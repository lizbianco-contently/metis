It is \nimportant that they be able to do this without the worry that their \nInternet access is being taxed.\n  Congress first voted to ban taxes on Internet access back in 1998, \nbut it was only a temporary ban.

Mr. President, yesterday the Senate joined together to \noverwhelmingly pass bipartisan legislation that will further isolate \nNorth Korea in response to its policy of aggression. It was necessary \nbecause our Nation faces a daunting array of threats and challenges \nfrom all across the globe. Our next Commander in Chief, regardless of \npolitical party, will face similar challenges upon taking office.\n  We see terrorist threats from the Islamic State in Iraq and the \nLevant, from Al Qaeda, and from both of their respective affiliates. \nFor example, the terrorist group that grew from Al Qaeda in Iraq, ISIL, \nis now not only capable of launching infantry assaults, suicide bomber \nattacks, and raids initiated by the detonation of IEDs, it is also \nworking hard to radicalize individuals over the Internet and is \ndetermined to keep attacking Westerners right here where they live.\n  We see threats to stability in Afghanistan from Taliban forces and \nthe Haqqani Network. For example, just this week we learned that \nadditional U.S. forces will be needed to reinforce the Afghan National \nSecurity Forces in Helmand Province. We have a determined partner in \nPresident Ghani, and General Campbell has testified that we need to \nmaintain a sufficient force posture to both train and advise them and \nalso conduct counterterrorism operations.\n  We see challenges from countries looking to aggressively expand their \ninfluence, such as China and Russia and Iran, while, of course, \ndiminishing our influence. For example, Russia is rebuilding its \nconventional and nuclear forces while launching cyber attacks, \nconducting espionage, and propping up paramilitary forces like we see \nin Ukraine. China is rebuilding and modernizing its conventional and \nnuclear forces, as it masters the tactics of low-intensity conflict \ndesigned to coerce our allies without provoking an overwhelming \nresponse from us.\n  The challenges we face today are very great. They are likely to be \neven greater tomorrow. All of this comes at a time when America must \nrebuild both its conventional and nuclear forces.\n  Clearly, the next Commander in Chief is going to take office \nconfronting a complex and varied array of threats. After 7 years of the \nObama administration delaying action in the War on Terror, the next \nadministration will need to return to the fight and to restore our role \nin the world. We want to work with our next President, regardless of \nparty, to do the things we know are needed to help protect our country, \nbut that incoming leader also needs our help now, and we should take \naction now in this year of transition.\n  The Secretary of Defense last week announced two aspects of this--\nfirst, a defense budget request that emphasizes the weapons systems \nneeded to balance\n\n[[Page S834]]\n\nagainst China's anti-access and area denial weapons and plans and a \nregional security initiative designed to resist Russian encroachment in \nEastern Europe.\n  General Dunford has talked about the acute threat represented by ISIL \nin Libya and the need to take action against this group. Other defense \nofficials have recently focused on the need to rebuild the nuclear \ntriad too.\n  It is clear what needs to be done. For instance, we know that our \nnuclear forces must be modernized to deter countries such as Russia, \nChina, Iran, and North Korea. We know that our conventional forces must \nbe modernized to both balance against and contain their regional \naspirations. We know that our Special Operations and Marine \nexpeditionary units must be maintained and equipped to conduct \ncounterterrorism and regional response. That means providing sufficient \nsealift and naval platforms and carrier air wings to keep amphibious-\nready groups and carrier battle groups on station rather than \nwithdrawing our presence at the very moment allies are questioning our \ncommitment to traditional alliances. It means that our regional \ncombatant commanders need sufficient force levels to protect our \ninterests.\n  We know the commander of Central Command must have the assets needed \nto assure our moderate Sunni allies, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, \nand Saudi Arabia, and help them resist Iran's efforts to intimidate \nneighbors.\n  In the Pacific, we know we must undertake a sustained buildup of \nnaval air and expeditionary capabilities and work closely with Japan, \nSouth Korea, and other regional partners if we want to lead within the \nregion and deter China's belligerent policies.\n  We know that the authorities our intelligence and counterterror \nforces need to defeat ISIL must also be renewed and restored.\n  We know that we must return to capturing, interrogating, and \ntargeting the enemy in a way that allows us to defeat terrorist \nnetworks.\n  It is clear that the Obama administration has failed to lead in \nsustaining the force and in meeting these strategic objectives. We have \nseen that the administration's efforts to employ Special Operations \nForces to train and equip units in Yemen, Syria, and Iraq have proven \ninsufficient to generate the combat power that is needed to defeat the \nenemy.\n  The economy of force strategy set forth in the President's West Point \nspeech has failed. National security policies that were for too long \nfocused on campaign promises made back in 2008, such as the effort to \nclose Guantanamo, to withdraw from Iraq and Afghanistan based on \narbitrary deadlines, and to end the War on Terror and take away the \nCIA's detention and interrogation capabilities and remake it into a \nCold War clandestine service, are finally giving way to geopolitical \nreality today.\n  The fact that current members of the Obama administration are now \nrecognizing the threat and the need to rebuild the force should inspire \nall of us to get started now--this year, not next year. I think we \nshould be doing all we can today to ready the force for the challenges \nahead and to lay the groundwork for the next President regardless of \nparty. Passing the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act \nyesterday was a positive step, but we must also ensure that the United \nStates does not withdraw from our alliance and forward presence.\n  With sustained bipartisan cooperation, we can pass a national defense \nauthorization act at levels that will allow us to modernize the force \nand execute current operations against ISIL and in Afghanistan while \nmeeting our commitments to keep the force ready. With sustained \nbipartisan cooperation, we can pass Defense appropriations at adequate \nlevels to train and equip and sustain the best military in the world. \nDoing what is required will necessitate a sustained effort, but we can \nbegin now, if colleagues are willing to work with us in this year of \ntransition. Let's work together to keep our country safe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/senate-section/article/S834-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Customs bill is another in a series of \nmissed opportunities and half-measures that have characterized this \nCongress. The legislation we are going to vote on today, the conference \nreport on Customs, misses the opportunity to take strong action against \ncurrency manipulation. The bill we sent out of here had strong currency \nmanipulation language in it; it is not there anymore.\n  It throws up unnecessary hurdles to agreements on climate change. It \nbasically says that any agreements the United States makes cannot take \nclimate into consideration--on any of those agreements.\n  No one that I know of opposes the legislation that is stuck inside \nthis Customs conference report dealing with taxation on the Internet. \nWe all support that. But the sad part about this is the manipulation to \nget it in this bill. It did not start in either House; it was just \nairdropped into the conference report. The reason it was done that way \nis everyone knew that if this matter was brought up--the Internet Tax \nFairness Act--as part of it, we always had marketplace fairness. That \nwas part of the deal. They went together. But the manipulation took \nplace.\n  This most important piece of legislation dealing with helping \nStates--States are struggling. It does not matter which States they \nare, they are struggling. What we have are the brick-and-mortar places \nthat can't compete with online merchandising. Someone who has a brick-\nand-mortar store--someone will walk in, see something they like, and \nthen they will walk out, go to the computer, and buy it online. They \npay no taxes. That is unfair to the brick-and-mortar stores and small \nbusinesses across America. It would help States remarkably if people \nwho buy on the Internet would have to pay the same taxes as someone who \nbuys in a brick-and-mortar store.\n  But in an effort to protect a number of Senators--one in particular--\nthis matter was stuck in this bill. We have just a few States that \ndon't have a sales tax. One of those Senators is up for reelection. She \nhas a very tough election, and anyone who understands politics a little \nbit understands that this was done as a result of trying to protect \nher.\n\n  But as Senator Durbin, the person who has pushed this marketplace \nfairness more than anyone else--except perhaps for Senator Enzi and \nLamar Alexander--knows, what has been done is unfair. But they have \nbeen told this matter will be brought up before the end of the year. So \nI don't know what solace that should give the Senator who is worried \nabout the marketplace fairness passing because it would seem to me that \nthe vote we had here earlier was 69 votes, and it will pass again. The \nSpeaker has told me that he is going to bring up marketplace fairness \non the House side. So we are going to vote on it before the end of the \nyear. It is going to be the law anyway.\n  It is too bad small businesses have to wait again for 6 months or 8 \nmonths to get this done.\n  The Customs bill does not do enough to enforce our trade agreements \nor protect American workers, and I will oppose it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/senate-section/article/S834-3", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S834-S835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BUDGET AND DEFENSE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish to make a few comments on the \nstatements of the Republican leader, my friend. It is obvious that he \nhas been reading the press and perhaps talking to some people on the \nHouse side. These people have created so many problems.\n  This right, right, rightwing in the House of Representatives is now \nsaying that what we did, having a 2-year budget, they want to change. \nThey want to take money away from the middle class and give it to \ndefense.\n  I supported the North Korea sanctions. It is a good piece of \nlegislation. I supported what we did in December. It was good \nlegislation. But we decided that the military, as strong as it is, \nshould remain strong but that we should give some equal footing to the \nmiddle class, and we did that.\n  Now my friend the Republican leader is obviously trying to pave the \nway to increase defense funding and go against the middle class.\n\n[[Page S835]]\n\n  I am pleased he said some nice things about the Secretary of Defense, \nbut it is very clear in his statement that he wants--obviously, he \ndidn't say so, but it is pretty clear to anyone listening to him--\nground troops. The Special Forces are not enough. He wants more, and \nthe American people don't want more ground troops.\n  He also said it is too bad--I am paraphrasing what he said--that we \nare going to take away the ability to have enhanced interrogation. That \nis waterboarding and all that other stuff that doesn't work.\n  John McCain was on the floor yesterday. Now if there is anyone in the \nworld who should have some understanding about torture, he should. He \nwas tortured not once but multiple times when he was a prisoner of war \nin Vietnam. He came yesterday--I have heard him before--and said: \nTorture doesn't work. We do better without torture.\n  But again, that is what the Republican leader is talking about.\n  I would remind those listening that President Obama has done a great \ndeal to keep America safe and secure. There is no better example of \nthat--there was a lot of talk previously about Osama bin Laden--than \nthat Osama bin Laden is dead. It was done on President Obama's watch, \nat his direction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/senate-section/article/S835-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S835-S836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FAIR DAY IN COURT FOR KIDS ACT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for the last 2 years our great country has \nfaced a humanitarian crisis arising from Central America. Thousands and \nthousands of migrants, mainly women and children, have fled to our \nborder and to other countries in the region to escape the growing \nviolence in the region.\n  Most of these women and children come from the so-called Northern \nTriangle countries--El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras--where crime \nand lawlessness have overrun the people. And that is an understatement.\n  El Salvador is the murder capital of the world. There isn't a close \nsecond. There are more murders per capita than in any nation on the \nplanet. El Salvador's murder rate is 26 times higher than the United \nStates.\n  Among El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, El Salvador beats them \nall for a murder rate, but the other two countries, Honduras and \nGuatemala, are third and seventh. In these countries, the rates for \nfemale homicide are unbelievably high. Again, El Salvador ranks No. 1 \nfor female homicides. As I have indicated, we have Honduras, which is \nthird, and Guatemala is seventh.\n  That is why you see these women and children fleeing--fleeing for \ntheir lives. It is not just murder that these desperate people are \ntrying to escape. People in these countries are imperiled by high rates \nof human trafficking, drug trafficking, sexual assaults, and widespread \ncorruption.\n  It is an understatement to say that these places aren't safe to live. \nThese refugees in our hemisphere are seeking protection. They are \nescaping to neighborhood countries, desperate to find someplace to go \nto hide, someplace to find sanctuary. Many make the trek through Mexico \nto our southern border, and it is a long ways. What they do to get to \nour border is really quite unbelievable.\n  What do they do when they get to our border? They don't sneak in; \nthey don't try to find a boat to go across the Rio Grande. These little \nkids throw up their arms and say in the best way they can: I am here; \ndo something to help me.\n  That is how desperate they feel--desperate to feel safe, to feel some \nprotection. They are refugees in every sense of the word.\n  In January the State Department announced that it would start a \nrefugee program in El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala after \n``concluding that the epidemic of violence by international criminal \ngangs in the three countries had reached crisis proportions and \nrequired a broader, regional response.''\n  I applaud Secretary Kerry and his team for making this humane and \nprincipled decision. It is a good first step, and it will help people \napply for refugee status at home so they don't have to make a trip \nthrough Mexico and other extremely dangerous places.\n  But for those who have already reached our border seeking asylum, we \nmust ensure that they are treated fairly, with respect. These refugees \nshould have help in making their asylum request. That means they should \nhave some legal representation.\n  Under current U.S. law, there is no right to appointed counsel in \nnoncriminal immigration removal proceedings, even if the person in \nquestion is a baby, a child. Think about that. These children who don't \nspeak English and are in a new country are unreasonably expected to \nrepresent themselves in a tribunal.\n  Approximately 70 percent of women and children and 50 percent of \nunaccompanied children who enter the United States don't have a lawyer \nwhen standing before a judge in deportation proceedings. It sounds hard \nto be true, but it is.\n  There is an organization called Kids in Need of Defense, or KIND. It \nis a wonderful organization. I admire it. It is incredible. This \nnonprofit organization is trying to help these children. Their \nexecutive director watched as a 5-year-old girl was brought before an \nimmigration judge.\n  The little girl was clutching a doll. She was so short she could \nbarely see over the table to the microphone. She sat there before a \nrobed immigration judge, with a trial attorney from the Department of \nHomeland Security on the other side of the chamber, in effect, saying: \nSend her back.\n  She was unable to answer any questions that the judge asked her \nexcept for the name of her doll: ``Baby Baby Doll.'' That was the name \nof her doll. But this is the worst part. This small child was expected \nto make a case of why she should be granted asylum under U.S. \nimmigration laws.\n  KIND matched her with an attorney from a major law firm who \nsuccessfully helped her win her case. KIND is doing a wonderful job, \nbut they are so shorthanded.\n  Immigration law is a complex area of law, and it should not be a \nplace where toddlers are placed in this situation. Children without \nattorneys are much more vulnerable than adults. So 9 out of 10 children \nwithout attorneys are ordered deported.\n  According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, a \nmajority of recently arrived unaccompanied children are eligible for \nlegal protection that would allow them to lawfully remain in the United \nStates, but they can't access these protections because they don't have \nanyone to tell them what the protections are. They can't access these \nprotections without an attorney to represent them in court or even to \nensure they receive proper notice of their hearings. Children with \nattorneys are five times more likely to be granted protection.\n  Picture this little girl. This little girl represents thousands of \nchildren who have been abused in many different ways. They have seen \ntheir parents murdered, humiliated, and hurt. Her name is Angela. This \nlittle kid is 9 years old--a sweet little thing, 9 years old. She \narrived at our southern border fleeing from the murder capital of the \nworld, El Salvador.\n  She is one of the fortunate kids. Kids in Need of Defense, the \nnonprofit group I mentioned, provided her with legal representation. \nShe was granted legal immigration status.\n  So look at this picture. I have looked at it many, many times. I took \nthis home with me last night.\n  Think of all the children, kids her age and younger--she is 9 years \nold--all who don't have representation. Think of a child like this \nstanding alone in a court of law with a language barrier on top of it. \nThis isn't how we should treat refugees. It is certainly not how we \nshould treat children fleeing violence.\n  Today I am introducing the Fair Day in Court for Kids Act. That is \nthe name of my legislation. My legislation would mandate that the \ngovernment appoint a counsel, a lawyer, to help these kids, \nunaccompanied children, and other vulnerable individuals such as those \nwho are victims of abuse, torture, and violence. My legislation would \nalso require the Department of Homeland Security to make legal \norientation programs available to all detention centers so people know \ntheir rights and responsibilities.\n  Deportation means death to some of these people, and I am not being \noverly dramatic. A study documents 83 people who had been deported from \nthis Northern Triangle who were subsequently murdered--83. Given the \nlife-\n\n[[Page S836]]\n\nand-death consequences of deportation in this region, we must ensure \nthat we are not putting asylum-seeking women and children in harm's \nway. We can do this by making sure that these desperate women and \nchildren have a lawyer.\n  The humanitarian crisis at our doorstep demands that we, as \nAmericans, affirm our fundamental values of protection and due process, \nespecially for children. The Fair Day in Court for Kids Act will uphold \nthese most basic American virtues and values which we hold dear.\n  Protecting children--children like Angela--isn't a partisan issue. \nThis is something I hope we can all agree on.\n  So I urge my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to support this \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/senate-section/article/S836-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until 10:30 \na.m. will be equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today the Senate is poised to take a major \nstep forward in advancing a robust agenda for international trade that \nbetter reflects the realities of the 21st century global economy. It \nprovides real benefits for our country.\n  Later today, the Senate will vote on and hopefully pass the \nconference report for H.R. 644, the Trade Facilitation and Trade \nEnforcement Act of 2015, legislation that we originally passed last \nMay.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Wyden follow my \nremarks in this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am coauthor of this legislation, and many of the \nprovisions in this conference report have been in the works for several \nyears. I also chaired the conference committee that was charged with \nreconciling the differences between the Senate-passed and House-passed \nversions of this bill.\n  In my view, the committee was a huge success. I believe our report \nrepresents a strong bipartisan, bicameral agreement to address a number \nof trade policy priorities.\n  I want to talk about some of the specifics of this legislation, which \nmost of us generally refer to as the ``Customs bill.'' Once this bill \nis signed into law--and I hope it will be in short order--it will enact \npolicies designed to achieve three main goals.\n  The first goal is to facilitate and streamline the flow of legitimate \ntrade into and out of the United States. The bill makes a number of \nchanges to reduce bureaucracy and improve consultation among executive \nagencies, Congress, and the private sector. These changes will \nfacilitate trade and improve our competitiveness by reducing \nunnecessary burdens and delays created by our overly bureaucratic \nsystem, which, in turn, will help create jobs and grow our economy.\n  The second major goal of the Customs bill is to improve enforcement \nof our trade laws. It does so in a number of ways. For example, the \nbill establishes a new, improved process at CBP for dealing with \nevasion of our anti-dumping and countervailing duties laws and provides \nclear direction and robust rules for identifying and addressing \ncurrency manipulation on the part of our trading partners. It also \nincludes dramatic improvements to better protect U.S. intellectual \nproperty rights. This has been a high priority for me, as most of my \ncolleagues know, and it is a high priority for my people in the State \nof Utah, whose economy is highly dependent on strong intellectual \nproperty rights. Combined, these enforcement provisions will provide \ngreater protection for American workers and consumers and help ensure \nthat foreign competitors will not have unfair advantages in the global \nmarketplace.\n  The third major goal of the Customs conference report is to \nstrengthen the trade promotion authority statute that we enacted last \nyear, reflecting various priorities and concerns from Members of both \nparties. For example, the bill clearly and strongly reaffirms that \ntrade agreements should not include--and TPA procedures should not be \nused dealing with respect to--immigration policy or greenhouse gas \nemissions. It also creates a new negotiating objective to remove \nbarriers facing American fishermen who export into foreign markets, and \nit provides important procedures related to the reporting of human \ntrafficking.\n  While this Customs bill was specifically designed to address these \nthree policy goals, it goes further to address other priorities as \nwell. For example, the bill will combat politically motivated boycotts, \ndivestments, and sanctions against Israel, bolstering our already \nstrong economic ties with one of our most important strategic allies. \nAnd it provides trade preferences for Nepal in order to provide \neconomic recovery in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake last \nyear.\n  Before I conclude, I do want to note that a number of my colleagues, \nas well as businesses and job creators around the country, were hoping \nthat the conference report on the Customs bill would include a \nreauthorization of the miscellaneous tariff bills, or MTBs. I want to \nmake clear that I support MTBs and want to get them passed. That is why \nthey were included in the original Senate-passed version of the Customs \nbill. There are, of course, some procedural concerns that complicate \nthe MTBs, particularly over in the House, which have made it difficult \nto reach a workable compromise. However, the conference report does \ninclude a strong sense-of-Congress statement reaffirming our shared \ncommitment to advancing MTB legislation in a process that provides \nrobust consultation and is consistent with both House and Senate rules.\n  I also want to reaffirm my personal commitment as chairman of the \nSenate Finance Committee to work with my colleagues to find a path \nforward on MTBs that will work for those on both sides of the Capitol. \nNeedless to say, I am very pleased with how this conference report \nturned out.\n  I have many people I want to thank, and I will thank them once the \nbill gets done. For now, I specifically want to thank the vice chair of \nthe conference committee, Chairman Kevin Brady, for his work on both \nthe committee itself and on the substance of the report.\n  I also want to thank the ranking member of the Finance Committee, \nSenator Wyden, for his efforts to ensure passage of this conference \nreport. It is a pleasure to work with Senator Wyden, and we have very \nmuch been able to work in a bipartisan way as we worked on this \ncommittee together.\n  Last spring, Republicans and Democrats on the Finance Committee came \ntogether to draft and report four major pieces of legislation, three of \nwhich have already been signed into law. That, of course, included our \nTPA bill, a bill to renew important trade preferences programs, and \nanother bill to reauthorize the Trade Adjustment Assistance program. \nThe fourth was our Customs bill, the one we will hopefully pass today.\n  These four bills represented the priorities of Members throughout the \nSenate and on both sides of the aisle. Collectively, they will shape \nthe policy landscape on trade--not just here in the United States but \naround the world as well--for years to come. Perhaps more importantly, \nthey also represent what is possible when Members of both parties work \ntogether to achieve common goals.\n  Of those four bills, the Customs bill is the only one that hasn't \nbeen enacted into law. I am cautiously optimistic that we will rectify \nthat later today. I am hoping that, just like the three other trade \nbills, the Customs bill will pass with broad, bipartisan support.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to vote later today to advance the \nCustoms bill\n\n[[Page S837]]\n\nto the President's desk and to put in place these much-needed reforms.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na list of supporters of the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement \nAct of 2015.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015\n\n\n                           List of Supporters\n\n       Airforwarders Association, Alliance to End Slavery and \n     Trafficking, Aluminum Extruders Council (AEC), American \n     Apparel & Footwear Association, American Association of \n     Exporters and Importers, American Cable Association, American \n     Chemistry Council, American Commitment, American Consumer \n     Institute, American Honey Producers Association, American \n     Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), American Petroleum \n     Institute, American Trucking Association, American Wire \n     Producers Association, Americans for Tax Reform, Association \n     of Global Automakers, BACM, California Fresh Garlic Producers \n     Association, Canadian/American Border Trade Alliance, Cargo \n     Airline Association, Christopher Ranch, Center for Freedom \n     and Prosperity, Center for Individual Freedom, Citizens \n     Against Government Waste, Coalition to Enforce Antidumping & \n     Countervailing Duty Orders, Coalition of Services Industries, \n     Committee to Support U.S. Trade Laws, Competitive Carriers \n     Association, Competitive Enterprise Institute.\n       COMPTEL, Computing Technology Industry Association, \n     Consumer Action, Copper & Brass Fabricators Council, Council \n     for Citizens Against Government Waste, Crawfish Processors \n     Alliance, CTIA--The Wireless Association, Digital Liberty, \n     Discovery Institute, Etsy, Express Delivery and Logistics \n     Association, Fashion Accessories Shippers Association, \n     Footwear Distributors & Retailers of America, Foreign Trade \n     Association, Freedom Works, The Garlic Company, Garment \n     Association Nepal, Gemini Shippers Association, Global \n     Automakers, Heartland Institute, Hispanic Heritage \n     Foundation, Hispanic Leadership Fund, Hispanic Technology & \n     Telecommunications Council, Independent Women's Forum, \n     Independent Women's Voice, Information Technology & \n     Innovation Foundation, Institute for Policy Innovation, \n     Institute of Makers of Explosives, International Trade Surety \n     Association, The Internet Association.\n       ITTA--The Voice of Mid-Size Communications Companies, \n     Jeffersonian Project, Latino Coalition, Leggett & Platt Inc., \n     LessGovernment.org, LULAC, Madery Bridge Associates, Media \n     Freedom, Monterey Mushrooms, Inc., Multicultural Media, \n     Telecom and Internet Council, Municipal Castings Association, \n     National Association of Black County Officials, National \n     Association of Chemical Distributors, National Association of \n     Foreign-Trade Zones, National Association of Manufacturers, \n     National Association of Neighborhoods, National Black Caucus \n     of State Legislators, National Black Chamber of Commerce, \n     National Cable & Telecommunications Association, National \n     Cattlemen's Beef Association, National Caucus of the Black \n     Aged, National Coalition for Black Civic Participation, \n     National Customs Brokers and Forwarders Association of \n     America, National Foreign Trade Council, National Hispanic \n     Council on Aging, National Industrial Transportation League, \n     National Organization of Black County Officials, National \n     Puerto Rican Coalition, National Retail Federation, National \n     Tank Truck Carriers, National Taxpayers Union.\n       NOBEL Women, Nucor Corporation, Outdoor Industry \n     Association, R Street Institute, Reusable Industrial \n     Packaging Association, Semiconductor Industry Association, \n     SER--Jobs for Progress, Sioux Honey Association, Small \n     Business and Entrepreneurship Council, Spice World, Inc./\n     Valley Garlic, Taxpayers Protection Alliance, TechFreedom, \n     Technology Councils of North America, Travel Goods \n     Association, United Spinal Association, U.S. Black Chamber, \n     U.S. Chamber of Commerce, U.S. Fashion Industry Association, \n     U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, U.S. Hispanic Leadership \n     Institute, U.S. Internet Service Provider Association, United \n     States Council for International Business, United States \n     Telecom Association, University of British Columbia Fisheries \n     Centre, UPS, Vessey & Company, Women Impacting Public Policy.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield the floor to the distinguished \nSenator from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Hatch for his good work \nand his very gracious comments.\n  I note our colleagues have been very patient, so I ask unanimous \nconsent that following my remarks, Senator Alexander be recognized for \n7 minutes and, immediately after Senator Alexander, Senator Stabenow be \nrecognized for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Colleagues, this bill is about coming down hard on the \ntrade cheats who are ripping off American jobs.\n  The truth is, past trade policies were often too old, too slow, or \ntoo weak for our country to fight back. This legislation says those \ndays are over. The legislation ushers in a new day and a fresh, modern \napproach--a tougher approach--to enforcing trade laws that start moving \nour Nation to a policy that I call getting trade done right. It is \nabout creating tough trade enforcement policies, seeing them through, \nand standing up to anybody who tries to get around them. No matter how \na Senator chooses to vote on a particular new trade agreement, I hope \nthat stronger trade enforcement and fighting back against the trade \ncheats would be a priority for every Senator.\n  The reality is, the amount of cheating that is going on is \nstaggering. It takes your breath away. We saw it a couple of years ago \nwhen we set up a sting operation and in effect invited the cheaters to \nhave at it. We were deluged with those who wanted to skirt the laws, \nuse shell games, sophisticated schemes, and fraudulent records to evade \nduties. You would smile at some of the inventiveness involved if we \ndidn't see how painful it was for the American companies getting ripped \noff this way.\n  One of the most common schemes--one of the biggest loopholes involves \nsomething called merchandise laundering. In effect, when a company gets \nbusted for violating the trade laws, the countervailing duty laws, in \neffect they go to another country and slap a label on it and are able \nto skirt the laws. Because his companies that make honey were victims \nof this, at one point Senator Schumer, my colleague on the Finance \nCommittee, said: What is going on is honey laundering, but it is not \nvery sweet for the people who are getting ripped off. That is what we \nseek to change.\n  I could thank a lot of colleagues of both political parties for their \ngood work here, but I just want to single out a few on our side. I know \nSenator Hatch is going to say more about colleagues on his side.\n  I particularly want to praise Senator Brown. Senator Brown led the \nfight repeatedly to close outlandish loopholes that allow products made \nwith slave and child labor to be imported into the United States. What \nthe old law basically says is that economics trumped human rights--that \nif there was an economic reason for using slave and child labor, you \ncould do it. We have closed that loophole. There was bipartisan support \nfor it, and I commend Senator Brown for this.\n  Senator Stabenow made a successful effort to have a more coordinated \napproach so that the left hand and the right hand would know what was \nbeing done in terms of trade enforcement. We now have a trade \nenforcement center that is going to do that.\n  Senator Cantwell worked to ensure that we have an important new trust \nfund--a trust fund for trade enforcement. It ought to be a priority to \nlock in all of the funds necessary to help protect our workers and \nbusinesses.\n  Senator Shaheen led the fight in order to ensure that smaller \nbusinesses had a bigger seat at the table in terms of the effort to \nreach new markets. I commend her for it.\n  Senator Bennet in particular did very good work with respect to trade \nenforcement in the environmental area. The package directs the trade \nnegotiators to act against illegal fishing and the trade of stolen \ntimber--something the Senator from Arkansas and I know a great deal \nabout. I am also very pleased because Senator Bennet and others worked \nhard to ensure that this legislation goes further than ever before to \nfight the currency manipulators and stop them from undercutting our \nworkers and our businesses.\n  At the end of the day, Democrats and Republicans came together. There \nwere spirited debates about trade agreements and whether to pass new \nones. What this is all about is just the opposite--just the opposite--\nof a new trade agreement. This is about making sure we get tough and \nenforce the laws on the books for what we already have. There shouldn't \nbe any dispute about that, and, certainly in the Finance Committee, \nDemocrats and Republicans were united.\n  Finally, I want to make one last point. I am glad the distinguished \nSenator from Tennessee is on the floor. I am very pleased that there \nhas been an agreement with the majority leader,\n\n[[Page S838]]\n\nthe Senator from Tennessee, and the senior Senator from Illinois so \nthat the ideas Senator Alexander wants are going to get heard on the \nfloor of the Senate. His interests are going to be heard and discussed \nfully. I want to assure him that there aren't going to be any kind of \nprocedural delays and objections when that is done. He is going to have \na chance to have his concerns heard and a vote on them, based on what I \nhave been told about the agreement with the majority leader.\n  In this bill, there is a chance for the Congress to finish the job of \nsomething I think is also important, and that is to say on a permanent \nbasis--a permanent basis--we are not going to have regressive taxes on \nInternet access and discrimination, particularly against working \nfamilies for whom, if there were regressive taxes on working families \nwho rely on Internet access to get information about education and \nemployment opportunities, we would harm those families at a time when \nthey are already walking on an economic tightrope, balancing their food \nbill against their fuel bills and rent bill against energy costs. We \nshouldn't have regressive taxes on Internet access. With this \nlegislation, we can ensure that will not happen. It has been a \nbipartisan effort for nearly 20 years, and with this we can say no to \nthose regressive taxes as a result of the work that was done. As I \nnoted, the concerns Senator Alexander wishes to raise are going to be \nheard in the future as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oregon for his \ncourtesy this morning. I appreciate the senator's remarks on allowing \nour different points of view to come to the floor and let's vote on it. \nHe is speaking, of course, about the Marketplace Fairness Act, which is \na 12-page bill which represents a two-word issue: States' rights.\n  The Majority Leader has said we'll have the ability to vote on that \nsometime before the end of the year. It is a bipartisan bill. It passed \nthe Senate 2 years ago with 69 votes. It recognizes that States have \nthe right to decide for themselves whether to collect their State sales \ntaxes from all of the people who owe the taxes or some of the people \nwho owe the taxes. It would allow States to do that if they simplify \ntax administration and exempt small online sellers from collection \nrequirements. It would create a pathway for States and localities \nacross the country to begin collecting an estimated $23 billion \nannually in uncollected taxes--taxes that are already owed. They can \nthen use that money to balance their budget, to reduce other taxes, to \npay for vital services.\n  I don't think Tennessee or any other State should have to play \n``Mother, may I?'' with the Federal Government when deciding whether to \ncollect, or not collect, a State tax that is already owed.\n  I can say to our friends on both sides of the aisle, the States are \nnot going to put up with this for very much longer. If Congress \ncontinues to be an obstacle to States making their own decisions about \ntheir tax structures, governors are going to be suing companies around \nthe country and say, if you are going to sell in our State, you are \ngoing to collect the tax that everybody owes. At that point, all those \nbusinesses are going to run to us and say: Please pass the Marketplace \nFairness Act.\n  I don't think we get any wiser about flying to Washington--one hour \nin my case--every week than the Governor and the legislature about what \nour tax structure ought to be. We don't like an income tax in \nTennessee, so we have a sales tax. We don't need any incentives from \nWashington to force us to pass an income tax in Tennessee.\n  Let me say a word about the vote today. I ask the chair, since I \nnoticed the Senator from Michigan is on the floor, to please let me \nknow when all but 30 seconds has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so notified.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. As far as the vote today goes, this distinguished body \nseems to have developed a case of amnesia. We seem to have forgotten \nwhat happened in 1994. 300 Republicans stood on the steps of the \nCapitol with the Contract with America and said: If we break our \ncontract, throw us out.\n  One goal of that contract was to stop Washington from imposing \nunfunded mandates on States. One of my most vivid memories is Senator \nBob Dole running around the country with a copy of the Constitution and \nreading the Tenth Amendment to Governors. The Tenth Amendment says: \n``The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, \nnor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States. . . . \n''\n  He said that. I was there. We were both running for President at the \ntime. The Tenth Amendment was the heart and soul of the Contract with \nAmerica. Senator Dole was good to his word. The first bill in the \nSenate after the Republican Revolution in 1994 was a bill prohibiting \nunfunded mandates. Republicans opposed unfunded mandates then. They \nshould oppose them today. According to the Republican conference rules, \n``The Senate Republican Conference believes that Congress should not \ncreate new federal unfunded mandates on state and local governments.''\n  However, today the vote we are about to cast breaks that promise. The \nCustoms bill has a provision that permanently extends the so-called \nInternet Tax Freedom Act. It prohibits State and local governments from \ntaxing access to the Internet. It tells seven States that are currently \ncollecting a tax that they can't continue to collect. These seven \nStates will lose $100 million in 2020 and several hundred million each \nyear after that.\n  This was not even considered by the House or the Senate when they \npassed the bill. It was airdropped in violation of rule XXVIII, so the \nvote we are casting today, a ``yes'' vote, violates the Contract with \nAmerica, violates the Senate Republican rules, and violates the \nSenate's rules.\n  I will agree there may be a Federal interest in not taxing Internet \naccess. I agreed with that in the 1990s. Maybe for the first three \nyears there should have been a moratorium when the Internet came along, \nbut where will it end? If you tell States they can't tax access to the \nInternet, you can also tell them they can't tax access to telephones or \nfood or gas because all of those are important to interstate commerce. \nIt is wrong for Washington to be telling States what their tax \nstructure ought to be. We are not any wiser than the Governor of \nTennessee. We're not any wiser than the State legislature in Tennessee. \nWe should leave those decisions to them.\n  That is my objection to the bill today. Instead of voting to oppose \nanother unfunded mandate that tells States what not to do, Congress \nshould consider passing the Marketplace Fairness Act later this year. \nWe should not fall into this bad habit that existed before the \nRepublican revolution of 1994, of assuming that just because we were \nelected to come to Washington, suddenly we are wiser than all the \nGovernors and all of the legislatures. They are not quite as wise, we \nare saying. We ought not to be telling them what to do about their tax \nstructure. We ought to leave that to them as the Senate Republican \nrules say, as the Contract with America said, and as the Tenth \nAmendment to the Constitution says. Let States do their job, and let us \ndo our job.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                     Flint, Michigan, Water Crisis\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first, I commend my friend and colleague \nfrom Tennessee and share his feelings about passing the Marketplace \nFairness Act. I hope we are going to see that happen as soon as \npossible.\n  I am joined on the floor by my dear friend and colleague from \nMichigan. We are united in speaking out about the urgent crisis in \nFlint.\n  If you will let me know when I have consumed 6 minutes, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so notified.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Over the last couple of weeks, we have been negotiating \nand negotiating with the chair of the Energy Committee, the ranking \nmember, and with other colleagues on the other side of the isle. I want \nto particularly thank our ranking member who has stood with us day \nafter day in the effort to make sure we can get some help for the \nchildren and the families of Flint. I thank our colleagues on this side \nof the aisle for standing with us as well.\n  We have been looking for an opportunity, a way to come together to \nhelp\n\n[[Page S839]]\n\na group of Americans. That is what we do in the Senate. When someone \nhas a crisis, we work together, State by State, to step up and be able \nto provide some assistance as Americans.\n  I have had the honor and pleasure to negotiate a number of bipartisan \nagreements while I have been here almost 16 years, working with \ncolleagues to pass a very complicated farm bill, working on many \ndifferent issues together across the aisle. I know that when you want \nto get things done, you can. It is just a matter of having the will to \ndo it. When you don't want to get things done, you come to the floor \nand attack the people you are supposed to be negotiating with and you \nnegotiate in the press. Unfortunately, that is what we have seen in \nrecent days. That is why we are so deeply concerned about the fact that \nthere is not the resolve to come together to be able to help the \nchildren of Flint, the families of Flint, and then move on with the \nEnergy bill that there is bipartisan interest in passing.\n  Every time we have thought we had an agreement, we changed things to \nreflect a proposal, a structure from the majority on the Energy \nCommittee, and every time we think we have something, the rug has been \npulled out from under us after hours and hours of work. Frankly, I feel \nlike Charlie Brown when Lucy is pulling the football away time after \ntime. That is exactly what has been happening.\n  We have had one exception though. I want to give a real thank-you and \nshout-out to Senator Inhofe because we spent all last weekend putting \ntogether a bipartisan, fully paid-for proposal that not only will help \nthe families and children of Flint but create the opportunity for \ncolleagues across the country to get help with water infrastructure \nprojects.\n  There are multiple areas. We have them in Michigan, other areas \noutside of Flint. They are not devastated like Flint is with their \nentire system corroded, the children poisoned, and the water system \nshut down, but there are multiple issues around water. We joined \ntogether with the distinguished chair of the EPW and have come together \nin good faith with a proposal we can't get a vote on, unfortunately. We \ncannot get the willingness to put before us where we could vote \ntogether on something that would address Flint but also help others.\n  I thank Senator Inhofe, and we are going to continue to work with him \nto get that proposal or some other comprehensive proposal in front of \nus.\n  It has also been extremely disappointing, though, to see Republican \nleadership come to the floor, colleagues who have had millions, in \nfact, billions of dollars funneled to their States for various \nemergencies over the years, come and tell us that what is happening on \nlead poisoning for these children, what is happening in Flint where you \ncan't drink the water today, yesterday, the day before, 18 months and \nlonger now, tomorrow, the next day, where you have to bathe these \nbabies in bottled water, brush your teeth in bottled water, try to \nfigure out how to take a shower in bottled water, that this is a local \nissue.\n  Right now we have a fully funded Federal Disaster Relief Fund that we \npassed last year in the omnibus--fully funded, billions of dollars. \nOver the years it has paid for a water main break in Boston, a chemical \nspill in West Virginia, a fertilizer plant explosion in West Texas.\n  Local issue? State issue? I am not sure why that was Federal, \nnecessarily. Right now there is somewhere between $6 billion and $7 \nbillion sitting in an account to respond to disasters, and we are only \nasking for a very small amount of those funds, to see and recognize and \nrespect and care about the children and families of Flint, MI, a small \nwithdrawal from that account to help children who have been poisoned by \nlead--9,000 children under the age of 6. Some parts of the city lead \nexposure is so high. It is higher than a toxic waste dump. How would we \nfeel if this were our children, our grandchildren? I know how I would \nfeel.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 6 minutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I am going to take 1 additional minute to emphasize the fact that \nyesterday our colleague from Texas said we are too optimistic trying to \nget help, while at the same time the President was signing a Federal \ndisaster declaration allowing additional Federal aid for 25 counties in \nTexas.\n  Since 2005, we have sent $9.75 billion to Texas, including $1 billion \nthat I got in the farm bill on livestock disaster assistance, which is \nnot a major issue in the State of Michigan, but it is for other \ncolleagues, and $1 billion has gone to someone who said: We, as a \ngroup, should not care about Flint, MI.\n  Let me just say, I think the folks in Flint deserve their money back. \nThey have been paying to help Americans across this country, and now \nthey don't have the dignity or respect to be able to have some small \nassistance to stop the poisoning and to create some dignity and respect \nfor these families and help for these children.\n  This child is an American too. We are not going to stop. We will \nnegotiate in good faith. We will continue to do that, but we are not \ngoing to stop until we recognize, support, and help the families of \nFlint.\n  Mr. President, I would like to yield the remainder of my time to my \nfriend from Michigan, Senator Peters.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Pesident, I wish to thank Senator Stabenow for her \nleadership on this issue and I share her frustration. We have been \ntogether, standing up, fighting to bring resources to Flint to deal \nwith this absolutely catastrophic situation in Flint, MI. We have \nreached out to our Republican colleagues. We have had some very \npositive conversations, but as we have those positive conversations, as \nthe Senator said in her comments, it seems as if it unravels right when \nwe are very close to making it a reality. As a new Member of this body, \nI am completely at a loss for understanding why that is. Why is it that \nMembers of the Senate can't step up for all Americans who are \nsuffering?\n  As you mentioned in the disaster fund, we have a disaster fund that \nis designed specifically for events like we have seen in Flint. You \nmentioned the West Texas explosion. We have had water main breaks in \nMassachusetts, a Caribbean oil corporation refinery explosion in Puerto \nRico, a bridge collapse in Minneapolis, a chemical spill in West \nVirginia. The list goes on and on. When we have had some sort of \ntragedy around this country, the U.S. Senate steps up and says: We are \ncompassionate. This is not a Democratic or Republican issue. This is \nabout the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time for debate has expired.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 more \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, we need to do that as well. We have pay-\nfors for the disaster fund. We identified and came forward with a pay-\nfor that would end a tax loophole--a tax benefit--for golf courses \nwhere wealthy individuals can give an easement to a golf course and \ndonate land. If we eliminate that--in fact, some Republicans have \nargued for the very elimination of this tax deduction--it will help to \npay for the infrastructure and it will help to pay for the children of \nFlint.\n  I know some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to \nprotect those wealthy donors and their golf courses, but I believe the \nchildren of Flint are more important. I believe the people of Flint are \nmore important. The fact that they have been poisoned by lead--\nsomething that creates irreparable damage to their brains--is something \nthat will impact their lives forever.\n  How can you look into the face of the children of Flint knowing they \nhave this brain damage as a result of this catastrophic situation and \nyet say no to a disaster fund to pay for it, say no to closing a tax \nbreak for wealthy folks who are giving land to golf courses? How can \nyou put golf course easements ahead of the children of Flint? We need \nto stand up as a body and understand that this is a crisis of \nunimaginable proportions, and we can do better. The United States can \ndo better. The Congress can do better.\n  The fact that we are not coming together to do this is why people \nhave such disdain for this body--the Senate and the House--because they \nthink\n\n[[Page S840]]\n\nthat in times of crisis, we pick and choose whom we help. Let's not \npick and choose whom we help. Let's help everybody. Let's help the \npeople of Flint. Let's help the children of Flint and show that we are \na compassionate country and that we do not pick and choose. Everybody \nshould get our support.\n  I hope we can come together and compromise. We need to take some of \nthese pay-fors and do what is necessary to address this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a question, \nI wish to ask the Senators from Michigan whether they were aware that \nthe Governor has made a request of the Michigan Legislature for at \nleast $195 million to help the families and the community of Flint?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time for debate has expired.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 more \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I just want to ask the Senators from \nMichigan whether they are aware of the request that the Governor has \nmade to address the crisis that they have identified in Flint and \nwhether they feel like that money, the $195 million, would be applied \nto the same problem they have identified.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, if I may respond to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. The Governor of Michigan sent a letter to the President \nasking for close to $800 million in disaster assistance to deal with \nall of the issues we are talking about. What we have been working to do \nis ask for Federal help for about 25 percent of that, with the balance \nof it being paid for by the State of Michigan.\n  The State of Michigan certainly has incredible culpability related to \nthis matter. We understand they are addressing this issue, and it is \nabout time that they did that. It does not take the place of our \nhelping the people of Flint and helping to solve this issue as much as \nany other issue we have talked about today.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I know all time has expired. I yield the \nfloor, and we will continue this discussion at some other time.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before \nthe Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the conference \n     report to accompany H.R. 644, an act to reauthorize trade \n     facilitation and trade enforcement functions and activities, \n     and for other purposes.\n         Mitch McConnell, David Perdue, Pat Roberts, Roy Blunt, \n           Chuck Grassley, Shelley Moore Capito, Richard Burr, \n           Mike Crapo, Thad Cochran, John Thune, John Hoeven, Tim \n           Scott, Lisa Murkowski, Rob Portman, Kelly Ayotte, Tom \n           Cotton, Orrin G.

Thank you, Madam President, for your recognition.\n\n\n             Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session \nto consider the following nomination: Calendar No. 365; that the Senate \nproceed to vote without intervening action or debate on the nomination \nand, if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be made and laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. On behalf of Senator Rubio, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. UDALL. Madam President, this is about the nomination of Roberta \nJacobson to be Ambassador to Mexico. This is one of the critical \npositions with one of our Nation's largest trading partners. It has now \nbeen vacant for over half a year.\n  Important work is left undone. We also have in this individual, \nRoberta Jacobson, a highly qualified career nominee. She is ready to \nserve. She has solid support on both sides of the aisle. There is no \ndoubt in this Senator's mind--and I think many Senators' minds--that we \nneed a strong Ambassador in Mexico City to represent our interests.\n  Mexico is working with us to stop those who cross our southern border \nillegally. Mexico is our third largest trading partner. One million \nAmerican citizens live in Mexico. It is our top tourist destination \nwith millions of U.S. visitors going to Mexico every year. There is a \nlot of work to be done on combatting illegal drug trade, including the \ntrafficking of illegal opioids, reforming the judiciary, and creating \neconomic opportunities on both sides of the border. That is something \nwe are working on together, and we are working together to address \nimmigration issues while cracking down on deadly border violence.\n  In New Mexico, we know the importance of this position and this \npartnership with Mexico. My State shares a border with Mexico; we also \nshare a cultural heritage and trade that grow with Mexico every year. \nExports from New Mexico to Mexico have soared from over $70 million 15 \nyears ago to $1.5 billion a year now. Over 36,000 jobs\n\n[[Page S841]]\n\nin my State depend on U.S.-Mexico trade. Arizona, California, and Texas \nalso share similar and deep relations with the Mexican people, and not \nconfirming this nominee harms those States as well.\n  Let me just say a word about Roberta Jacobson. She is a dedicated \npublic servant. The LA Times has called Roberta Jacobson ``among the \nmost qualified people ever to be tapped to represent the U.S. in \nMexico.'' Roberta has worked on the Merida Initiative to fight drug \ntrafficking and organized crime in Mexico. She has served ably as \nAssistant Secretary for the Western Hemisphere Affairs at the State \nDepartment.\n  Last year the President reestablished diplomatic relations with Cuba. \nAfter over 50 years of a failed policy with Cuba, Roberta helped \nnegotiate this historic shift, giving the United States an opportunity \nto engage with the Cuban people. Time and again she did her job and she \ndid it very well. She was approved by the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee with bipartisan support. This was weeks ago, and still we \nwait for this nomination to come to the floor and get a vote.\n  It is hard to explain to my constituents that we do not have an \nambassador to Mexico because a few Senators disagree with the \nPresident's policy on Cuba. They don't understand it. The folks back \nhome don't understand it, and neither do I. This is not just the \nPresident's team, this is our team. This is America's team working on \ntrade, on security, moving our economy, and moving all of us forward.\n  We need an ambassador in Mexico City. Roberta Jacobson is more \nqualified to serve than anybody that has been put up in many, many \nyears. I know we have an objective now, but I would urge my colleagues \nto sort this out and bring it to the floor, and I would ask the \nleadership to make this a priority.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I rise today in strong support of the \nconference report to accompany the Trade Facilitation and Trade Customs \nconference report on which we just had a cloture vote. I was very \npleased to see 73 U.S. Senators vote in favor of proceeding to and \ngetting a final vote on the conference report. It is important because \nthis legislation represents the most significant update to our trade \nenforcement policies in over a decade, and its passage today and \nenactment into law will demonstrate yet again that this Congress is \nworking in a bipartisan manner.\n  This bill is important for a lot of reasons. First and foremost, this \nlegislation is about trade enforcement. This bill gives the U.S. \nCustoms and Border Protection new tools to combat unfair trade \npractices, thus protecting American jobs and American workers. These \nenforcement provisions are important to a wide range of American \nmanufacturers, which is why the National Association of Manufacturers \nand the American Iron and Steel Institute strongly support this bill. \nIn fact, there are approximately 100 organizations and businesses that \nhave expressed public support for this bill. For any Senator who has \nmanufacturing in his or her State, supporting this conference report \nshould be a no-brainer.\n  These enforcement provisions are important to many other sectors of \nthe economy as well. Take honey producers, for example, who in my home \nState make South Dakota one of the top honey-producing States in the \nNation. Back in 2011, I was the ranking member of the Trade \nSubcommittee of the Finance Committee, and Senator Wyden was the \nchairman of that subcommittee. We held a hearing on the topic of how \nAmerica can better enforce our trade laws, and we heard testimony from \nRichard Adee, a well-known honey producer in my home State of South \nDakota about the problem of honey laundering. Simply put, honey \nlaundering is the practice of unscrupulous honey producers in China \nusing third-party countries to circumvent tariffs on dumped Chinese \nhoney. Over the past decade this has been a major problem, costing U.S. \nhoney producers hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue.\n  As one example of this practice, consider Malaysia, a nation with the \ncapacity to produce about 45,000 pounds of honey annually. Get this: \nMalaysia has exported as much as 37 million pounds of honey to the \nUnited States in a year--well beyond its production capacity. Clearly \nthis honey is not coming from Malaysia. It is Chinese honey being \ntransshipped through that nation.\n  The legislation we are considering today is finally going to give \ncustoms the tools it needs to help crack down on this practice. This \nwill not only benefit honey producers in my State, it will benefit \nfarmers all across the country whose crops depend upon bees for \npollination and will benefit American consumers who can buy American \nhoney with confidence.\n  While this bill is about enforcing our trade laws, it is also about \nmaking it easier for American businesses to engage in trade. This is \nespecially important to small businesses that may not always have the \nresources or the expertise to access foreign markets.\n  The conference report before us includes a provision that I authored \nwith Ranking Member Wyden that would update the so-called de minimis \nthreshold for imports from $200 per product to $800 per product. The \nbill also includes an amendment that Senator Bennet and I offered at \nthe Finance Committee, calling on our trading partners to follow our \nlead in this area. What this simply means is that if someone starts a \nsmall business selling goods on the Internet and he or she needs to \nimport a component part in order to make a product, we are going to \nsignificantly reduce the paperwork and cost involved in doing so. This \nis the reason that online marketplaces such as Etsy and eBay, as well \nas express shippers like UPS and FedEx, are so supportive of this \nlegislation. These companies understand what millions of American \nentrepreneurs understand: The Internet truly is the shipping lane of \nthe 21st century.\n  This bill will empower more Americans to engage in global commerce \nboth through the Internet and through more traditional means. This \nconference report will also help to ensure that access to the Internet, \nwhich is so important for global commerce, remains unencumbered.\n  This legislation includes a provision to make the existing ban on \nInternet access taxes permanent--something that Senator Wyden and I \nhave championed and a measure that has broad bipartisan support. The \nInternet Tax Freedom Act has been extended eight times since it was \nfirst enacted in 1998. As I mentioned earlier, the Internet is \nincreasingly a gateway to economic opportunity, often in the form of \naccessing new markets abroad.\n  As the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, one of my top \npriorities is expanding access to high-speed Internet from our inner \ncities to our most rural communities, and keeping access to the \nInternet unburdened by new taxes is an important step in that \ndirection.\n  This Internet tax freedom provision is strongly supported by a broad \nspectrum of technology, cable, and telecom companies. It is also \nsomething that will benefit America's manufacturers. As the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers wrote recently in an op-ed supporting this \nbill: ``The Internet has become a critical piece of infrastructure for \nmanufacturers in the United States, and permanently extending the ban \non state and local taxes on Internet access will continue to foster \ninvestment in broadband networks.''\n  I was especially pleased that we were able to include a provision in \nthe conference report granting States that already apply taxes on \nInternet access more than 4 years to adjust to the new law. I am \nconfident this will give Congress the time necessary to address other \nimportant issues relating to Internet taxation.\n  Enactment of the permanent ITFA provision in this bill will clear the \npath for consideration of legislation empowering States when it comes \nto collecting sales taxes that are owed. I intend to continue to \nsupport efforts to ensure that we have a level playing field when it \ncomes to the taxation of Internet commerce--something that is very \nimportant in my home State of South Dakota.\n  Last but certainly not least, I want to point out that this \nconference report includes provisions strongly in support of our ally, \nthe State of Israel. Unfortunately, we have seen a disturbing\n\n[[Page S842]]\n\ntrend in recent years where some nations are attempting to discriminate \nagainst Israeli-made goods for political reasons. This legislation \ncreates a new principal trade-negotiating objective under trade \npromotion authority designed to discourage these unfair practices \nagainst Israel. Once this conference report becomes law, if a foreign \nnation proposes a new trade agreement with the United States, that \nnation will need to demonstrate that it does not have politically \nmotivated discriminatory policies in place against our strongest ally \nin the Middle East.\n  I commend Senator Cardin and others who worked diligently to update \nour trade laws with respect to harmful actions against the State of \nIsrael. I am pleased that we are finally seeing these efforts come to \nfruition.\n  Enactment of this legislation into law will represent a win for \nAmerican manufacturers and farmers, a win for American producers, who \nhave been harmed by unfairly traded Chinese goods, a win for small \nbusiness owners looking to engage in global commerce, a win for \nconsumers who depend upon Internet access that is accessible and \naffordable, and a win for those of us who want to stand up and support \nthe State of Israel when that nation is being unfairly targeted. But \nall of that will be at risk if we do not pass this conference report. \nThe House of Representatives has been very clear that it will not take \nup this bill again. All the good things in this bill that I mentioned \nwill die. They will not become law if we do not pass the conference \nreport as it is. The House approved this conference report over a month \nand a half ago. It is past time that we do the same. Let's get this \ndone today and send this bill to the President for his signature. Let's \ncontinue to work together on other issues that still need to be \naddressed.\n  I thank Finance Committee Chairman Hatch and Ranking Member Wyden for \nall of their hard work in getting us to this point. I hope the Senate \nwill go on record--and I urge my colleagues to support this important \ntrade enforcement legislation--in what I hope will be a very big and \ndecisive vote.\n  This legislation is good for America. It demonstrates once again that \nthe Senate takes seriously its responsibility to get results and get \nthings done for the American people. It is good for our economy, it is \ngood for jobs, and it is good for the overall health and vitality of \nour country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise today to express my concerns with \nthe Customs conference report. While I support the Customs provisions \nin this conference report, as well as the Internet tax moratorium, I \ncannot support the way these issues were merged in conference.\n  I have said for years that the Internet Tax Freedom Act should be \npaired with e-fairness legislation because I think it is reasonable to \ntell the States that when we take away their ability to tax Internet \naccess, we are giving them the ability to collect the State and local \nsales and use taxes already owed on remote sales. It is beyond time for \nCongress to give States that right. Congress's failure to act has \ncreated a burden on our States and local governments, which are losing \nbillions in tax revenue that they need for local responsibilities.\n  As a former mayor and State legislator, I understand how important \nsales tax revenue is to State and local governments for maintaining \nschools, fixing roads, and supporting local law enforcement, fire \ndepartments, and emergency management crews.\n  Congress's inaction on e-fairness legislation implicitly blesses a \nsituation in which States may be forced to raise other taxes, such as \nincome or property taxes, to offset the growing loss of sales tax \nrevenue. In December, in-store sales were about the same as the year \nbefore, but Internet sales grew by about 40 percent.\n  To be clear, we are talking about a substantial loss in revenue. In \n2012, States missed out on an estimated $23 billion in uncollected but \nowed use taxes from all remote sales. About $61 million of that would \nhave gone to my home State of Wyoming. Those numbers increase every \nyear as online sales increase. States missed the opportunity to collect \nan estimated $26 billion in remote sales and use taxes in 2013. Wyoming \nlost an estimated $81.2 million, so $61 million to $81 million.\n  Congress's failure to act is also hurting our local stores, which \nhire local people who support local events and help out in the \ncommunity. The same stores that are required to collect State and local \nsales and use taxes while their online and catalog competitors are not.\n  As a former small business owner, I believe it is important to level \nthe playing field for all retailers--in-store, catalog, and online--so \nan outdated rule for sales tax collection does not adversely impact \nsmall businesses and Main Street retailers. I have given the example \nbefore of a friend in Sheridan who has a camera store. He has people \ncome in and look at some very expensive cameras and get all of the \ninstructions and find out about all of the accessories. Then they just \ntake a little picture of the bar code on that and order it online. The \ndifference in price? The sales tax. He provides the service, but loses \nthe sale, and it is because the sales tax is not collected online. That \nis not fair. I used to have a shoe store. The same thing is true. They \ncan get the fit they need, the adjustments they need, and know exactly \nthe shoe they want. Check the bar code online. What is the difference? \nThe sales tax. It really hurts if they order it in front of you. \nTelevisions, bicycles--there are all kinds of examples of this same \nsort of thing happening.\n  This issue also affects online stores. More and more States are \nsuccessfully implementing their own laws to ensure they can collect \nthese remote sales and use taxes. They are doing it piecemeal. This \nwill create a patchwork of complicated, uniquely tailored, and \nincongruent laws for all businesses to comply with.\n  For many years I have worked with all interested parties to find a \nmutually agreeable way to solve this problem. But instead of taking up \nlegislation that prevents taxation of Internet access and also helps \nState and local governments and businesses, we have a conference report \nbefore us that includes the Internet Tax Freedom Act, which was just \ndropped in without any separate vote or debate. The Senate has not \nconsidered it in the committee nor on the floor.\n  Instead of considering this inserted issue now, we should have \ncombined it with legislation that restores States' sovereign right to \nenforce State and local sales and use tax laws. What I am proposing is \nnot a tax on the Internet. I am opposed to that. Rather, e-fairness \nlegislation would give States the option to collect their sales and use \ntaxes already due on all purchases.\n  Unlike this airdropped Internet Tax Freedom Act provision, the Senate \nhas overwhelmingly voted in support of e-fairness with a bipartisan \ngroup of 69 Senators supporting the Marketplace Fairness Act in the \nlast Congress, and we were not even able to get a vote on our \namendment.\n  I thank my colleagues who have worked so hard on this issue, \nespecially Senators Durbin, Alexander, and Heitkamp. I thank the \nbusinesses, the trade groups, the State and local governments, and all \nof the other stakeholders who have helped us educate offices about this \nissue. I thank the leader for listening to our concerns about this \nconference report. But ultimately I oppose the conference report \nbecause, while Congress should pass the Customs bill and this provision \nthis year, Congress should also pass e-fairness legislation this year \nthat allows States to collect the sales and use taxes they are owed for \nremote sales already.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                    Amending 19 U.S.C., Section 1501\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, the bill we will be voting on shortly \ncontains a provision amending 19 U.S.C., section 1501, which relates to \nthe liquidation of entries into the U.S. The provision in the \nconference report amending section 1501 is intended to ensure in cases \nwhere liquidation occurs by operation of law, the 90-day timeframe for \nthe voluntary reliquidation of an entry by Customs and Border\n\n[[Page S843]]\n\nProtection begins on the date of the original liquidation.\n  I would ask my colleague, Senator Wyden, the ranking member of the \nFinance Committee, if that is his understanding of this provision as \nwell.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I agree with Senator Hatch. That is the \nintent of the provision amending 19 U.S.C., section 1501.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I am pleased to have been one of the \nconferees to H.R. 644, the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act \nof 2015.\n  There are many important provisions in this legislation, some of \nwhich I helped to draft.\n  There is one such provision that I particularly want to highlight. \nHoney producers in my State of South Dakota as well as producers of \nhoney, crawfish, garlic, and mushrooms around the country, have \nsuffered for 15 years because of unfair dumping from China. Senator \nWyden and I have worked together for 5 years to ensure that the trade \nlaws were enforced in these cases.\n  Unfortunately, the latest struggles have been more with U.S. Customs \nand Border Protection, CBP, than with Chinese dumpers.\n  Duties collected on dumped imports and all interest on those duties \nfrom 2000 and 2007 were to be paid to the injured domestic producers to \nallow them to reinvest and rebuild. For reasons that defy simple \nexplanation, CBP ignored the direction of the statute to pay all \ninterest to producers and instead deducted some types of interest from \npayments to producers.\n  In effect, this practice amounted to forcing South Dakota honey \nproducers to pay for the delays caused by Chinese dumpers, the U.S. \ninsurance companies that posted bond for the duties, and in some cases \nof CBP itself. This practice defies the plain language of the statute \nand cost domestic producers tens of millions of dollars over the years.\n  During the Finance Committee markup of this legislation, Senator \nGrassley, Senator Nelson, and I offered an amendment which is included \nin this conference report that corrects CBP's misreading of the law. \nThis is an important victory for honey, crawfish, garlic, and mushroom \nthat have suffered from Chinese dumping and CBP's unfounded practice.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I wish to support the trade \nenforcement conference report--legislation that will level the playing \nfield for American businesses and help them reach foreign markets.\n  This bill is aimed at supporting American businesses in an \nincreasingly global economy. It makes sure our economic competitors \nplay by the rules and helps our small businesses sell their products to \nnew markets overseas.\n  This bill passed the Senate 78-20 last March, with every single \nMember of the Democratic Caucus supporting it.\n  While I recognize that there were changes made in the conference \ncommittee, this legislation still contains critical mechanisms to \nensure fair trade for American businesses and workers.\n  I believe that the United States can out-compete and out-innovate any \neconomy in the world, but to do that, we need a level playing field, \nand that means making sure our competitors are playing by the rules.\n  This legislation contains some of the strongest trade enforcement \nprovisions that we have seen in decades. It gives Federal authorities \nthe tools they need to enforce U.S. trade laws at the border and hold \nour trading partners accountable. It includes the ENFORCE Act, a \ncritical measure to ensure that businesses and workers harmed by unfair \ntrade can have their claims investigated and resolved quickly. And it \nstrengthens the Treasury Department's ability to address currency \nmanipulation.\n  This bill also contains language I authored that makes sure that our \nsmall businesses are able to take advantage of new trade opportunities \nand reach new markets. Even though 95 percent of the world's customers \nlive overseas, less than 1 percent of small- and medium-sized \nbusinesses in the United States sell to global markets. By comparison, \nmore than 40 percent of large businesses sell their products overseas.\n  The conference report includes my small business trade amendment, \nwhich would help narrow that gap by reauthorizing the successful State \nTrade and Export Promotion grant program, better known as the STEP \nprogram. STEP was created as a pilot program to help States work with \nsmall businesses to reach in the international marketplace, and just a \nfew years in, it has been a great success. Already, the STEP Program \nhas helped small businesses reach 85 country markets, resulting in over \n$1.1 billion in export sales for a return on Federal taxpayer \ninvestment of 19:1. In reauthorizing this program, we are giving small \nbusinesses a real chance to expand their markets, grow their \nbusinesses, and create new jobs.\n  I want to thank Senate Finance Committee Chairman Hatch and Ranking \nMember Wyden for working with me to include my small business trade \namendment in the final bill.\n  The conference report before us today will keep American companies \ncompetitive. It will help small businesses sell overseas. And it will \nhelp drive innovation online.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill and oppose efforts to \nprevent it from moving forward today.\n  (At the request of Ms. Murkowski, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, as the final piece of the \nrobust trade package that we completed last year, the Customs report \nthat accompanies the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act \nallows authorities to aggressively enforce U.S. trade laws and provides \nenhanced authorities to protect obligations gained under international \ntrade agreements and rights under U.S. intellectual property laws.\n  In my home State of Alaska, trade currently supports more than 90,000 \njobs, which is more than one in five of all jobs in the State. Per \ncapita, Alaska is one of the top exporters in the country. We are the \ntop exporter of fish and seafood products in the Nation.\n  I worked hard to secure a provision in the Customs package that, for \nthe first time, establishes a principal negotiating objective on \nfisheries that reduces or eliminates tariffs and nontariff barriers, \neliminates subsidies that distort trade, and opens new markets for \nAmerican fish, seafood, and shellfish products around the globe.\n  With the global marketplace becoming more competitive and \nincreasingly challenging, it is vital that the United States focus its \nefforts on maximizing our ability to export our goods and services \nabroad in order to create more opportunity and good-paying jobs for all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. ENZI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Remembering Philip Rock\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this morning at Old St. Patrick's Church \nin downtown Chicago, there was a funeral service for an extraordinary \npublic servant, the late senate president Phil Rock.\n  On January 29, Illinois lost one of its most principled leaders and \none of its finest public servants. He was a good friend of mine and a \ngood friend of my wife's as well.\n  Before retiring from politics in 1993, Phil Rock represented \nChicago's Oak Park and parts of the West Side of the city of Chicago. \nHe spent 14 of those years as the longest serving Illinois Senate \npresident. During part of that time, I had the opportunity to be by his \nside and to work as his senate parliamentarian.\n  People used to say Phil Rock was born a Catholic, a Democrat, and a \nChicago Cubs fan, but not necessarily in that order. Phil was also a \ndedicated public servant.\n  Before Phil Rock became a public servant, he almost became a priest. \nHe was born and lived much of his life in the Midway Park section of \nthe Austin part of Chicago. He attended Quigley Preparatory Seminary \nand went on to the University of St. Mary of the Lake in Mundelein, IL. \nBut instead of becoming a priest, he became a lawyer.\n\n[[Page S844]]\n\n  After graduating from Loyola Law School--newly married to his wife \nSheila--he took a different path than his colleagues. He decided not to \njoin a big law firm. He chose to enter public service. He worked for \nIllinois State attorney general Bill Clark in 1965, and by 1967 Phil \nwas the chief of the Illinois Consumer Fraud Division. He chose to \nenter public service at a difficult time--the turbulent 1960s. The \ncountry was torn over the Vietnam war and many social issues. The 1968 \nDemocratic Convention was a painful reflection of our Nation's \ntroubles.\n  Instead of turning away from public service, at that time Phil Rock \ndecided to dive in and make a difference. In 1970 he was elected to the \nIllinois State Senate, where he ascended quickly in both the Democratic \nParty and the State senate as an institution. Within a year he was \nelected Democratic State committeeman for the Sixth District. A couple \nyears later he became assistant senate minority leader. In 1979 Phil \nRock was chosen by his colleagues to be the senate president. At the \ntime, Illinois was facing tough times. Illinois was hard hit by the \nnational recession and some of the highest urban unemployment rates in \nthe country. Once again, Phil did not waver. Through his leadership, \nPhil helped guide the State through a storm of a recession.\n  Phil was a loyal and passionate Democrat, but he understood that \ncompromise was always an important part of success. ``Bipartisanship'' \nwasn't a dirty word for Phil Rock; he worked with everybody. He just \nwanted to get things done for his constituents, as well as the people \nof the State. His word was his bond. When his allies made unreasonable \ndemands, Phil was firm and said no.\n  When the day's legislative work was done, though, you could still \nfind Phil presiding--usually over a barbecue pit near the State \ncapitol. Legislators from both political parties came by; they wouldn't \nmiss it. Phil would hand them a cold drink, and they would have a great \nevening together.\n  Hardly any of Phil's parties ended without Phil being requested to \nsing ``Danny Boy,'' which he did in a spirited fashion. On St. \nPatrick's Day, you could always count on Phil Rock and his fellow State \nsenator Bob Egan being close to a piano, singing great Irish tunes. The \nevents were always bipartisan, with Democrats and Republicans coming \ntogether. This is a lesson in friendship and cooperation which all of \nus should remember today.\n  Phil leaves a proud legacy. He had a wonderful sense of fairness and \na strong voice for the most vulnerable in communities across the State. \nPhil exemplified what Hubert Humphrey called ``the moral test of \ngovernment.'' He authored and passed more than 450 major pieces of \nlegislation in his career. He earned dozens of awards from \norganizations across the State of Illinois, from Cairo to Zion.\n  Among his legislative accomplishments, Phil started Illinois's I-\nSEARCH Program for missing children, which provides State funding to \nprovide information almost instantly to save those kids. He also \nchampioned laws for mandatory insurance for newborns and the State's \noriginal Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act. One of his proudest \nachievements was sponsoring legislation for the Nation's first school \nfor the deaf and blind in Glen Ellyn, which today has been named after \nhim, the Philip J. Rock Center and School.\n  Phil passed away last month at the age of 78. His legacy shines \nbrightly from Oak Park to Springfield and across our State. My wife \nLoretta and I want to offer our condolences to Phil's wife of more than \n50 years, Sheila; their four kids, Kathleen, Meghan, Colleen, and John; \nand, of course, the grandkids.\n  Phil Rock was a tireless advocate for the little guy, he was a giant \nin Illinois politics, and he will be missed.\n  Madam President, last year I joined a bipartisan majority in the \nSenate to pass a Customs reauthorization bill. It was strong, it was \nmeaningful, and it really set out to modernize our Nation's customs \nsystem and strengthen the enforcement of U.S. trade laws.\n  One of the greatest concerns Americans have about trade and trade \nagreements is that when they are cheated on by other countries, we \ndon't enforce them, and the losers are American businesses and \nemployees. So I like that Customs bill. I like that version and the \nstrong language on currency manipulation which has cost a lot of \nAmerican jobs and hurt U.S. businesses. It strengthened our commitment \nto combat human trafficking around the world. It would allow us to \nsafeguard our climate policies under future trade agreements.\n  The conference report that is back to us now and before the Senate at \nthis moment is a much different bill. Let me say there are provisions \nof it that are good and important. I strongly support the ENFORCE Act. \nThe provision would allow us to have a level playing field so that \ncompanies, such as Illinois companies, could ensure that other \ncountries play by the same rules when it comes to trade. These strong \nanti-dumping rules are vital to prevent foreign companies from dumping \ncheap steel products and other goods that undercut domestic prices and \nput our companies out of business and employees out of work.\n  I recently had representatives of the steel industry come by my \noffice, and they explained the dramatic increase in imports of steel \nproduct, particularly rebar from Turkey. They can't understand how \nTurkey can sell its rebar in the United States so cheaply, putting \nAmerican businesses at a disadvantage. Turkey takes scrap metal from \nthe United States and transports it across the ocean, transforms it \nthere into rebar and steel, and ships it back to the United States--and \nthey are still able to charge less.\n  The folks in the steel industry here say: We are ready for \ncompetition, but something else is going on here.\n  There is clearly a subsidy when it comes to Turkish steel. And the \nnet result is that companies like Granite City Steel in Granite City, \nIL, and companies across the United States are being threatened.\n  Some countries are dumping their products in the United States. They \nare selling them for less than the cost of production to run American \nbusinesses out of business and to put our steelworkers out of work.\n  The ENFORCE Act puts some teeth into this process, and it is one of \nthe sections in this bill I would wholeheartedly support if it were a \nseparate piece of legislation. But that is not how bills are presented \nto us in the Senate. We are given an array of issues and topics in \nevery bill, and we have to decide whether at the end of the day the \nbill is worth voting for even if there are provisions in it that we \nlike and some that we hate.\n  The inclusion of this important legislation is not enough to overcome \nmy concerns with the overall bill.\n  Unlike the Senate-passed bill, there was a provision airdropped into \nthis bill at the last minute in conference that really creates a \nproblem. It is called the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act. What it \nmeans is, with this legislation, we are by Federal law prohibiting \nState and local governments from imposing taxes on access to the \nInternet. Generically, I think that is a good thing to do, to encourage \nuse of the Internet and not to create hardships on families, students, \nand individuals who use the Internet, but let's go into this \nconversation with our eyes wide open.\n  If you use a telephone to make a call to someone, you are likely \ngoing to face a tax from your State or local unit of government on \ntelephone services. If, however, you do what my wife and I try to do \nevery weekend and Skype your grandkids, you are using your computer for \nthat conversation, and there is no tax on your use of that computer. \nSome people say, ``Good. I didn't want to pay the tax.'' But remember, \nlocal and State taxes go to sustain critical services in communities.\n  What we are doing with this bill is prohibiting States and localities \nfrom, in most cases, imposing taxes on Internet services. So we are \nclosing the door to State and local units of government raising revenue \nthat they might view as reasonable and fair to sustain police \nprotection, fire protection, and all the demands they face. That is the \nreality of this provision.\n  What we had hoped to do was, at the same time, say that State and \nlocal units of government could collect sales tax on Internet sales. \nLet me explain. More and more Americans are turning to the Internet to \nbuy things, our family included. You go to the usual vendors on the \nInternet, and in some cases, if they decide to, those Internet\n\n[[Page S845]]\n\nretailers collect the local sales tax. So when I give my home address \nin Springfield, IL, they check the ZIP Code, and they decide that when \nI make the purchase, they will collect the sales tax on the Internet \nsale of a book, for example, and they will remit that amount to the \ntreasury of the State of Illinois. But it is not required, and many \nInternet vendors do not collect the sales tax. So what happens? State \nand local units of government don't get the benefit of the sales tax \nfrom Internet purchases.\n  However, if I decided, instead of buying a book on the Internet, to \nbuy it at a local bookstore in Chicago or Springfield, I would pay a \nsales tax. Well, people are learning this. As they learn this, they are \nchanging their shopping habits.\n  A friend of mine, Chris Koos, is the mayor of Normal, IL. He is an \nextraordinary person beyond Normal, as far as I am concerned. He is \nalso a businessman as well as mayor. He has a business that sells \nbicycles and running shoes. He tells me people will literally come into \nhis store and say: I need size 11 New Balance shoes. What do you have?\n  They bring out the running shoes, and people try them on, stand in \nfront of the mirror, and say: Thanks a lot, Chris. I appreciate it.\n  They will then write down the number for the New Balance running \nshoes, go home, buy them on the Internet, and not pay a sales tax. \nWell, Chris is the loser. Here he is with a good, solid business in \nNormal, IL, that not only provides good service and good products but \ncollects--as required by law--the sales tax on transactions, the sales \ntax going to the State and to the community to sustain basic services. \nSo when people use his store as a showroom and then buy on the Internet \nand not pay the taxes, of course the State and the community lose.\n  What we had hoped to do was to put these two things together and say \nthat if we are going to prohibit State and local units of government \nfrom imposing taxes on access to the Internet, at the same time, we \nwill require Internet sellers and retailers, to collect sales taxes for \npurchases. That would be remitted back to the State and local \ngovernment so at least there was some balance. It isn't as if we are \nclosing the doors to State and local units of government for what they \nmight have otherwise collected.\n  Unfortunately, only half of what I just described is included in this \nbill. The prohibition against State and local governments collecting \ntaxes on Internet service is included, but sales conducted over the \nInternet is not included. That is unfortunate.\n  Initially, I opposed this bill and said that this was brought into it \nat the last minute, that it has nothing to do with customs whatsoever, \nand that it should never have been included. It is the kind of thing \nthat I think gives us a bad name sometimes when it comes to the way we \nwrite bills. I opposed it. I then ended up deciding to talk to \nRepublican Leader Senator McConnell. With his assurance that we will \nget a shot at calling the marketplace fairness or internet retail tax \nthis year--either if it is sent from the House or if it originates in \nthe Senate--I have dropped my opposition to the overall bill--although \nI will vote against it, I am not working against it--and the earlier \nrollcall indicated strong support.\n  With that in mind, I yield the floor and say that I will continue to \noppose the Customs bill for the reasons stated, but I am happy that \nSenator McConnell and I have been able to reach an agreement on the \npath forward toward marketplace fairness or efairness.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, as we move toward final passage of the \nconference committee report on H.R. 644, the Trade Facilitation and \nTrade Enforcement Act, I would like to take just a few minutes to \nreflect on how we got here and to thank the many individuals who made \nthis moment possible.\n  This conference report concludes what has been an historic 13 months \nfor trade legislation in the U.S. Senate. When I began my tenure as \nchairman of the Senate Finance Committee early last year, one of my \nforemost goals was to strengthen and modernize U.S. international trade \ninstitutions and policies. It was an audacious goal. After all, it is \nnot like we had not tried before. Years of stagnation had enabled \ncountless trade problems to accumulate, many of them crying for \nlegislative resolution. Everyone agreed that something needed to be \ndone, but again and again, our efforts were stopped. Well this Congress \nwas different.\n  Working together in a bipartisan way, we were able to advance \nlegislation to strengthen congressional oversight of trade negotiations \nthrough reauthorization of trade promotion authority, or TPA. I intend \nto vigorously employ TPA's new oversight tools in reviewing the Trans-\nPacific Partnership that the Obama administration concluded in October \nand signed last week. While the verdict is still out on TPP, the \nefforts of the individuals who made that possible should not go \nunrecognized. So I would like to acknowledge the hard work of \nindividuals such as Ambassador Mike Froman, former Deputy U.S. Trade \nRepresentative Wendy Cutler, and the Assistant U.S. Trade \nRepresentative for Southeast Asia and the Pacific, Barbara Weisel. \nTheir tireless commitment to advancing the interests of the United \nStates abroad deserves to be recognized and applauded.\n  I also would like to thank my staff, who worked behind the scenes to \nhelp negotiate and craft legislation that will serve our Nation for \nmany years to come. I believe that the Senate Finance Committee \nleadership team of Chris Campbell, Mark Prater, and Jay Khosla is among \nthe finest that I have had the pleasure to work with in my many years \nof Senate service. Our trade team, consisting of chief trade counsel \nEverett Eissenstat, Shane Warren, Douglas Petersen, Rebecca Eubank, \nAndrew Rollo, Kevin Rosenbaum, Paul Delaney, Greg Kalbaugh, and Kenneth \nSchmidt consistently demonstrated that teamwork, motivation, and drive \ncan produce great results; and this bill we are considering here is no \nexception. I also would like to thank our outstanding speech and \ncommunications team, consisting of Bryan Hickman, Julia Lawless, Aaron \nFobes, Amelia Breinig, and Joshua Blume; and of course, our fine tax \nteam, including Nick Wyatt, Eric Oman, Jim Lyons, and our chief \neconomist, Jeff Wrase.\n  Bipartisanship was critical to all of our work over the past year, \nespecially on trade. For their steadfast commitment and determination \nto our shared goal of producing strong, bipartisan legislation, I would \nlike to recognize Senator Wyden and his team: Josh Sheinkman, Mike \nEvans, Jayme White, Elissa Alben, Greta Peisch, Anderson Heiman, \nTiffany Smith, and Todd Metcalf.\n  I also would like to thank Senator McConnell and his staff: Sharon \nSoderstrom, Brendan Dunn, Terry Van Doren, and Hazen Marshall, who \nprovided us with support and leadership throughout this process. \nFinally, let me thank my House colleagues, Speaker Ryan, Chairman \nBrady, and their staffs Austin Smythe, Joyce Meyer, Angela Ellard, \nGeoff Antell, Steve Claeys, Nasim Fussell, and Casey Higgins. On the \nDemocratic staff, I would like to acknowledge the hard work and \ncontributions of Ranking Member Sandy Levin and his staff, Jason \nKearns, Beth Baltzan, Katherine Tai, and Keigan Mull.\n  Finally, this conference report would not have been possible without \nthe excellent work done by Tom Barthold from the Joint Committee on \nTaxation, the Senate Legislative Counsel's office, especially Margaret \nRoth-Warren and Thomas Heywood, and the Congressional Budget Office, \nespecially Teri Gullo, Ann Futrell, Susan Willie and Mark Grabowicz. \nThe support of the legislative affairs staff at U.S. Customs and Border \nProtection also was essential for getting this conference report right, \nand I especially want to acknowledge John Pickel, Ned Leigh, and \nKristin Isabelli.\n  I am proud of this conference report and pleased that we were able to \npass it with a strong, bipartisan vote. It took many hands to bring us \nto this moment, and I am truly thankful for all of their hard work. \nThis bill shows that, through persistence and hard work, we can \naccomplish great things.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S846]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, after the very weighty and serious \ndiscussion that just preceded me, I come maybe with a little bit more \nlighthearted message for the Presiding Officer and my colleague, the \nsenior Senator from Colorado, Mr. Bennet.\n  I think everybody knows here--the folks up in the gallery may know--\nthat Denver is home of the Super Bowl 50 winners, the Denver Broncos. \nThe Presiding Officer and I attended the Super Bowl on Sunday, and I am \nsure he agrees it was quite a treat.\n  God blessed us with beautiful weather, and the people of Santa Clara \nreally made us feel welcome and at home. They did an amazing job. The \nSuper Bowl organizers are to be commended for their attention to detail \nand the superb work they did to make us feel welcome. It was a \nfantastic experience for me. So I can only imagine, with the Presiding \nOfficer having the winning team, how much fun it was for him.\n  I think it is safe to say that there are thousands in Colorado on a \nRocky Mountain high this week, and I will bet there are even more who \nare really happy that the Broncos won the Super Bowl.\n  The Denver Broncos played a great game, and they defeated my Carolina \nPanthers. Both defenses played extraordinarily well, and the Broncos' \noffense did just enough to get the job done.\n  So to the Presiding Officer and Senator Bennet, I come to the Senate \nChamber today to fulfill my wager to humbly offer my congratulations to \nthe Super Bowl champion, the Denver Broncos, and to all their fans in \nyour great State and, I would argue, across the Nation.\n  But before I talk about the beloved Panthers, I want to thank you for \nnot accepting some of my maybe exuberant or overexuberant offers that I \nmade as a possible friendly wager. And for C-SPAN viewers at home, you \nmay want to avert your eyes.\n  I really don't think I would have looked very good in an orange beard \nwith Broncos earrings. With all due respect to the Presiding Officer, \nyou looked a lot like Papa Smurf with a blue beard. So a simple speech \nof congratulations is what I have to offer.\n  The truth is, I am deeply disappointed about the Panthers' loss. But \nit is also true that, unless the Broncos are playing my Panthers or my \nchildhood team, the Miami Dolphins, I am usually pulling for the \nBroncos. The Broncos' organization, starting with the Bowlen family and \nCoach Kubiak, are topnotch and well respected in the NFL. Former greats \nsuch as John Elway, Terrell Davis, Shannon Sharpe, Ed--how could he \nwear so few pads and still survive--McCaffrey, and so many other \nmembers have made this team so much fun to watch over the years.\n  But then there is this guy, Peyton Manning, or ``The Sheriff,'' as \nCoach Gruden nicknamed him back in 2009. I have been watching Peyton \nManning since he was recruited to the University of Tennessee many \nyears ago--a five-time NFL MVP and two-time Super Bowl winner on two \ndifferent franchises. Next month, on March 24, he is going to be 40 \nyears old, and he is playing at the top of his game. Peyton is an \namazing athlete, but what really makes Peyton extraordinary is his \ncharacter and his behavior on and off the field. He is a true \ngentleman, a great sport, and he is a scholar of the game.\n  I opted not to put up a graphic on the New England Patriots because \nanybody who knows me knows that I am not much of a fan of the New \nEngland Patriots, dating back to a December 1982 snowplow game.\n  But, in addition to all the other things Peyton Manning has done, he \nalso led the Broncos to a victory over the Patriots in the AFC \nChampionship, completely deflating Tom Brady's shot at another Super \nBowl ring. That alone makes Peyton Manning a great American, in my \nbook.\n  The Broncos and I do have something in common. We were both born in \n1960. We are both 56 years old. They built a franchise that most fans \nexpect to be in contention every year.\n  The Panthers, on the other hand, are young. They were born in 1995. \nThey are 20 years old. They have already gone to the playoffs seven \ntimes. They have won two NFC Championships and been in the big game \ntwice, and I believe that next year they have a good shot to be in \ncontention.\n\n[[Page S847]]\n\n  So before I close, I thank owner Jerry Richardson, Coach Ron Rivera, \nand the Carolina Panthers. Mr. Richardson is a pillar of our community, \nand Coach Rivera has developed a Super Bowl-caliber team: Cam Newton, \nthe league MVP; Luke Kuechly, our defensive standout; a total of 10 Pro \nBowlers this year; and a 17-to-2 season. It was fun to watch. The Super \nBowl was fun to watch.\n  You know, I did grow a playoff beard. After we ended the playoff \nseason, I proudly displayed it for weeks on the Senate floor, back in \nNorth Carolina, and at Levi Stadium on Super Bowl night.\n  But on Monday morning I got misty-eyed as I shaved it off in San \nFrancisco. So with all apologies to Tony Bennett, I penned a poem based \non one of his songs about that same city. I called it ``I left my hair \nin San Francisco.''\n\n     I left my hair in San Francisco\n     After the game, it haunted me\n     I'm cleanly shaven, quite sad and bare\n     While Broncos fans dance like Fred Astaire\n     The loveliness of Santa Clara seems somehow sad today\n     The glory of my Panthers' season is of another day\n     But I'm looking forward to next year's season\n     Because I expect a Super Bowl repeat for many good reasons\n\n  To Senator Bennet and to the Presiding Officer, congratulations on a \ngreat Super Bowl win for the Denver Broncos, and I look forward to many \nmore games that our two teams may play in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I have a longer set \nof remarks that I want to give next week celebrating the Broncos' \nvictory, and I know our colleague from Wyoming is here.\n  But since the Presiding Officer is shackled to the desk and can't \nmake remarks, I would say on his behalf how grateful the two of us are \nto the Senator from North Carolina for the graciousness of his remarks. \nI know how hard it must have been.\n  But to have the Senator not only make the remarks but provide \noriginal poetry at the end, is more than anybody could have expected. \nSo through the Chair I thank the Senator for that.\n  I also want to say how proud we are of the Broncos and the Broncos \norganization, the Bowlen family, and the entire team for what they were \nable to pull off. I was able to watch it in my living room with my wife \nand daughters.\n  I congratulate, in particular, Von Miller, who is the MVP, and our \ndefense, who played a game like no other defense I have ever seen.\n  Finally, I would simply say thank you to Peyton Manning for the \nexample he has set for my children and for children all over our \nState--that what matters is not how good you are or how skilled you are \nor how you act in the minute, but what matters is the patient decades \nof hard work a person is willing to put in to perfect their craft. That \nis what Peyton Manning has demonstrated. That is what he has shown. \nThat is the value he has lived. I think he has made a huge difference, \nas I say, to the next generation of Coloradans.\n  We learned last week, as well, that this game, just like any game, is \nnot about any one individual; it is about a team. We saw a team--the \nweaknesses and strengths--come together and win a game over a very, \nvery tough organization in the Carolina Panthers.\n  (Mr. BARRASSO assumed the Chair.)\n  With that, I see my colleague from Colorado is now on the floor.\n  I yield the floor by saying: Go Broncos.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for \nproviding relief and the Presiding Officer for allowing me to make \nremarks.\n  I thank my freshman colleague from the great State of North Carolina \nfor those kind words. I can only imagine if the Senator from Colorado, \nMr. Bennet, and I had to give the same remarks had the outcome been \ndifferent, that we could only be so gracious. So thank you very much \nfor the congratulations to the Denver Broncos and, obviously, the \nCarolina Panthers. It was an exciting game that they were able to be a \npart of, and there will be many more years of success to both \nfranchises, undoubtedly.\n  For those of you in Colorado who were able to watch the game, what an \nexciting time it was. We can remember the great teams led by John \nElway--whether they played the Packers or the Falcons for the two Super \nBowl victories--and now this exciting victory at Santa Clara as well. \nAlso, a million people showed up in downtown Denver, CO, just a few \nshort days ago to express their outpouring of support for the Denver \nBroncos. This has truly been an exciting time for the people of \nColorado.\n  I am very pleased that Senator Bennet and I didn't have to grow a \nbeard. Thank you, Senator Tillis, from the great State of North \nCarolina.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/senate-section/article/S847-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S847-S848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, on Tuesday, President Obama released his \nbudget for the next fiscal year. As usual, there was a lot of new \nspending the American people don't want and a lot of new taxes the \nAmerican people can't afford.\n  It is interesting. Politico had a headline about the budget in \nTuesday's paper. It says ``Obama launches liberal offensive in his \nfinal budget.'' A liberal offensive in his final budget. It called the \nbudget ``aggressively liberal.'' Well, one of the big, ``aggressively \nliberal'' things the President put in his budget is an enormous tax \nincrease on gasoline. This tax would add over $10 to the price of a \nbarrel of oil. That equates to about 24 cents to a gallon of gasoline \nat the pump. This increase in tax would raise about $319 billion over \n10 years.\n  President Obama knows his budget has zero chance of becoming law, not \njust because Republicans won't vote for it; Democrats won't vote for \nit. Last year his budget was defeated by a vote of 98 to 1. Only one \nMember of his own party voted for his budget last year, and now \nDemocrats in Congress are running away from this gas tax as fast as \nthey can.\n  The problem is, this tax is about more than just the budget; this is \na sign that the Obama administration is still committed to continuing \nits assault on energy production in this country--red, white, and blue \nenergy.\n  The American people understand there are enormous national security \nimplications to what the President is proposing in his budget. Right \nnow there is fierce competition in the global energy markets. The OPEC \ncartel has a strategy to win that competition in the oil market. It has \nbeen pumping out oil at a pace that is intended to drive U.S. shale oil \nproducers out of business. Then once the competition is gone, they will \nraise prices.\n  The best way for us to protect American interests is to make it \neasier and cheaper for energy producers to operate here in America. The \nworst thing we could do is to add to the cost of American oil by \nimposing this new tax of $10 per barrel, 24 cents per gallon, but that \nis exactly what President Obama wants to do. He wants to raise taxes, \nand he wants to make it harder to produce American energy. President \nObama's plan would actually help OPEC get what it wants. It would also \nput American energy producers at a competitive disadvantage with our \nadversaries in Iran and in Russia.\n  Just a few weeks ago, the Obama administration lifted economic \nsanctions on Iran's energy exports. This means that Iran can now export \noil again. So how much oil are they going to export? According to the \nU.S. Energy Information Administration, Iran right now has between 30 \nand 50 million barrels of oil sitting offshore in tankers today. Iran \nis planning to boost its oil exports to Europe and Asia by half a \nmillion barrels a day in the next few months. And it is not just oil; \nIran is also the world's second largest producer of natural gas in \nterms of its resources. Right now, they are building a new export plant \nfor liquefied natural gas that is about 40 percent complete, and they \nare ready to start shipping natural gas to Europe within 2 years.\n  Russia is also a huge exporter of natural gas. That is one of the \nreasons Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine. It was to get control of the \ngas pipelines there. Now it appears that Gazprom is\n\n[[Page S848]]\n\nprepared to start a natural gas price war with the United States. \nGazprom is, of course, the Russian gas company that is mostly owned by \nthe government and controlled by Vladimir Putin. A price war would help \nthem maintain their grip as being the biggest gas supplier in Europe, \nand it would discourage U.S. liquefied natural gas projects from ever \nbeing built.\n  What has the Obama administration done? The Obama administration has \na documented history of delaying permits to American businesses that \nwant to export our liquefied natural gas. Needless bureaucratic delays \njust deter energy production and producers from wanting to start these \nprojects in the United States because it is so hard to get them \napproved, and that just drives up the cost. The administration's \napproach plays right into Vladimir Putin's hands.\n  This is not the time to add cost to American energy production. That \nwill only help our adversaries more, and it will make our allies more \ndependent on energy--not from us but from places such as Russia and \nIran and, of course, from other OPEC countries. This is not the time to \nshut down the production of American energy.\n  There are a lot of far-left, extreme environmentalists out there who \nwant to make sure American energy resources are never used but stay in \nthe ground. There are also a lot of Washington Democrats who are eager \nto give these environmental extremists everything they want--\neverything.\n  Last week in New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton was caught on tape \npromising one of these extremist supporters that the end of fossil fuel \ndevelopment on public land, she said, is ``a done deal.'' The end of \nexploration of fossil fuels on public land is ``a done deal.'' Well, it \nmay be a done deal in her mind. It is also unrealistic, unwise, and \nunworkable. Take a look at it. Forty-one percent of America's coal \nproduction right now comes from public land; 22 percent of our crude \noil comes from public land; 16 percent of our natural gas comes from \npublic land; and Hillary Clinton, in her speech and her comments last \nThursday in New Hampshire, said, in terms of any of that production, it \nis ``a done deal.''\n  I remind my colleagues that energy is the master resource. America \nneeds energy for our economy to grow. We need those jobs. Where are we \nsupposed to get our energy if we don't get it from public lands? We \ncan't power America's manufacturing on wind alone.\n  Instead of building new barriers to American energy production, we \nshould be tearing down those barriers. The energy legislation we have \nbeen debating in this body actually includes ideas to help do that. One \nbipartisan idea in this legislation would help speed up the permitting \nprocess to export liquefied natural gas. It is bipartisan, with six \nDemocratic cosponsors.\n  After all the environmental studies have been done, after everything \nhas been approved, it then takes an average of another 7 months for \nthis administration to say yes or no on the permits. That is after \neverything has already been approved. Why would it take 7 additional \nmonths to get a decision by the administration? The Energy Department \nshould be able to say yes or no, and this legislation says they should \nbe able to do it within 45 days. This is going to force Washington to \ndo its job in an accountable and timely way. That will help make sure \nother countries have options for where to get their energy, other than \nthe concerns we have about a dominance of Russia, a dominance of Iran, \nand a change of the balance of power internationally.\n  It is time for America's energy policies to help American energy \nproducers compete and to help those jobs in our energy security at \nhome. That is how we are going to build our economy, how we are going \nto create American jobs, and how we are going to strengthen our \nnational security.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, late last year a cargo container ship \ncarrying 33 men and women left Florida from the Port of Jacksonville en \nroute to Puerto Rico. It typically sailed back and forth, carrying \ncargo to and from San Juan, Puerto Rico, but this time it sailed \ndirectly into the path of a hurricane.\n  Two days later the crew sent what would be its final communication, \nreporting that the ship's engines were disabled and the vessel was left \ndrifting and tilting, with no power, straight into the path of the \nstorm.\n  Subsequent to that, despite an exhaustive search and rescue attempt \nby the Coast Guard in the days that followed, the El Faro and her crew \nwere never heard from again. Only in one case, in desperately trying to \ndo a search and rescue mission, did they find one decomposed body in a \nbodysuit, but they could not find anybody else.\n  Since then, the National Transportation Safety Board--the agency \ncharged with investigating the incident--has been working tirelessly to \nunderstand what happened. Why would the ship leave port when they knew \nthere was a storm brewing and it was going to cross the path of where \nthe ship was supposed to go?\n  Working with the U.S. Navy and the Coast Guard, investigators \neventually found the ship's wreckage scattered at the bottom of the \nocean east of the Bahama Islands in waters 15,000 feet deep. But what \nthey didn't find that day was the ship's voyage data recorder, or what \nwe typically refer to as the ship's black box, not unlike the black box \nwe look for in the case of an aircraft incident that records all of the \ndata.\n  Since we have no survivors, this data recorder is a key piece to \ngetting the information to understand this puzzle of why that ship \nwould sail right into the hurricane. It records and it stores all of \nthe ship's communications. Finding it could shed light on what really \nhappened onboard in those final hours. Despite the search team's \nexhaustive efforts to locate the data recorder amongst the scattered \nwreckage, they couldn't find it, and eventually they had to call off \nthe search.\n  Earlier this year, this Senator wrote to the Chairman of the NTSB and \nurged him to go back and search again because finding the ship's data \nrecorder is important for us to understand how these 33 human beings \nwho have families back at home were lost. I am here to report that at \nthis very minute, the NTSB is announcing that they are going back to do \nthe search again. At this moment, the NTSB is saying it will resume the \nsearch for the ship's black box. This time it will do it with the help \nof even more sophisticated equipment to help investigators pinpoint the \napproximate location of the recorder and hopefully, if it is not among \nthe wreckage of the ship, point to its location and pick it up off the \nocean floor.\n  The NTSB's decision today--which I commend; and I thank the Chairman \nfor continuing to keep after this--to search again for the data \nrecorder is a critical step in our understanding of what went so \ntragically wrong that day. We owe it not only to the families of the \nlost mariners aboard the El Faro but to the future safety of all those \nwho travel on the high seas. It is up to us to not only understand what \nhappened but to do what we can to ensure that it doesn't happen in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n\n[[Page S849]]\n\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Leonard Terry Strand, of \nSouth Dakota, to be United States District Judge for the Northern \nDistrict of Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 15 minutes of debate, \nequally divided in the usual form.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, as was just reported, we will \nvote on the nomination of Len Strand from Iowa. I am very pleased to be \nhere to support him, just as I was here a few days ago to support Judge \nEbinger from Iowa, who was unanimously confirmed by the U.S. Senate on \nMonday, and I hope this person will likewise be unanimously approved.\n  I said this on the floor earlier this week, but for the benefit of my \ncolleagues who didn't get a chance to hear that wonderful speech I \ngave, in my opinion, the Iowa nominees, Judge Ebinger and now Judge \nStrand, are the two best judicial candidates this President has \nnominated. Earlier this week I discussed the extensive selection \nprocess these nominees underwent. I will not go into those details \nagain, but I will say that I am very pleased the process produced such \na nominee as Judge Strand.\n  Judge Strand has deep Iowa roots. He received his undergraduate \ndegree from the University of Iowa in 1987 and his law degree from the \nUniversity of Iowa College of Law in 1990. Upon graduation, he joined \none of the most prestigious law firms in Iowa as an associate, where he \nspecialized in employment law and commercial litigation.\n  During his time at the law firm, he received several awards, \nincluding ``Super Lawyer'' for Iowa and the Great Plains region for 6 \nyears straight. During his time at the firm, he was very involved in \nhis community. He has been a member of a wide range of organizations \nimportant to Iowa, all the way from the symphony orchestra, to the \nmedical center, to the YMCA.\n  In 2012 Judge Strand was appointed as a magistrate judge for the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Iowa. In this capacity, he \nhas handled hundreds of cases, which has prepared him well to be a \nFederal district judge, article III.\n  The ABA considers him--as you know the classifications--``unanimously \nwell qualified'' for this position.\n  As I did Monday for Judge Ebinger, I urge all my colleagues to \nsupport his nomination today, and we will be voting on it shortly.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we will vote on the nomination of \nLeonard Strand to fill a judicial emergency vacancy in the Federal \ndistrict court in the Northern District of Iowa. I will vote to support \nhis nomination.\n  The next district court nominee pending after we return from the \nPresident's Day recess will be Waverly Crenshaw, an exceptional \nAfrican-American nominee who is nominated to a judicial emergency \nvacancy in the Middle District of Tennessee. Mr. Crenshaw has the \nsupport of his Republican home State Senators, Senators Alexander and \nCorker, and he was voice voted out of the Judiciary Committee last \nJuly. There is no reason to continue to delay the confirmation of such \na qualified nominee who is urgently needed for Tennesseans to receive \nswift justice. I hope the Senators from Tennessee can convince their \nmajority leader to schedule a vote for Mr. Crenshaw as soon as we \nreturn from recess. I further hope that the majority leader will \ncontinue to regularly schedule judicial confirmation votes to ensure \nthat our Federal judiciary is fully functioning.\n  Since Republicans took over the majority last January, they have \nallowed votes on just 15 nominees. In stark contrast, at this point in \nthe last 2 years of the Bush Presidency in 2008, when Senate Democrats \nwere in the majority, we had confirmed 40 judicial nominees. Senate \nRepublicans' obstruction has resulted in judicial vacancies soaring \nacross the country--rising by more than 75 percent. Judicial vacancies \ndeemed to be ``emergencies'' by the Administrative Office of the U.S. \nCourts because caseloads in those courts are unmanageably high has \nnearly tripled in that time. Senate Democrats worked hard to reduce \nthese judicial emergency vacancies to 12, but under Republican \nleadership, they have now risen to 32. There is an urgent need for the \nSenate to confirm highly qualified nominees who will get to work in \nFederal courthouses across the country where justice for too many \nAmericans has been delayed. Judge Strand will fill just one of these \nemergency vacancies. There are dozens more to fill.\n  Judge Strand is an excellent judicial nominee who has served in our \nFederal judiciary since 2012 as a U.S. magistrate judge in the district \ncourt for the Northern District of Iowa. Prior to joining the bench, he \nspent over 20 years in private practice as a partner at the Cedar \nRapids, IA, law firm Simmons Perrine Moyer Bergman PLC. The ABA \nStanding Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated Judge \nStrand ``Well Qualified'' to serve on the Federal district court, its \nhighest possible rating. He has the strong support of his home State \nSenators, Chairman Grassley of the Judiciary Committee and Senator \nErnst.\n  After today, 17 judicial nominees will remain pending on the Senate \nfloor. These nominees are from Tennessee, Maryland, New Jersey, \nNebraska, New York, California, Rhode Island, and Pennsylvania. Many of \nthese nominees will fill emergency vacancies, and nearly half of these \nnominees have Republican home State Senator support. Furthermore, there \nare another 15 judicial nominees pending in the Judiciary Committee \nfrom California, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, \nMaryland, Massachusetts, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Utah, and Wisconsin.\n  It is our constitutional duty as Senators to provide advice and \nconsent on these judicial nominees. The Federal judiciary is dependent \non us to fulfill this obligation, and the American people expect that \nwe will do the jobs we have been elected to do in the U.S. Senate. This \nis why the demand from certain moneyed Washington interest groups that \nRepublican Senators oppose the confirmation of any judicial nominee \nthis year, regardless of a nominee's merit or qualifications, is so \ndestructive. Not only would this require Senators to cede their role \nand judgement to outside political action committees, but refusing to \nconfirm any judicial nominees for the rest of this year would also make \nthe high number of vacancies in our Federal judiciary even worse. This \nwould hurt the American people and weaken our justice system. We cannot \nallow this to happen.\n  In the first 5 weeks of this year, the Senate has voted on five \njudicial nominees. During this time, we have also debated and voted on \nlegislation and confirmed executive nominees. There is no reason why \nthe Republican majority cannot continue to hold confirmation votes on \njudicial nominees when we return. In 2008, when I was chairman of the \ncommittee with a Republican President, we worked to confirm judicial \nnominees as late as September of the Presidential election year. In \nfact, that year Senate Democrats confirmed 28 of President Bush's \njudicial nominees, 22 of these in the last 7 months of 2008. This \nincludes the confirmation of 10 of President Bush's district court \nnominees pending on the Senate floor in a single day by unanimous \nconsent on September 26, 2008.\n  I urge my fellow Senators to vote to confirm Judge Strand and look \nforward to continuing to work with my fellow Senators to ensure that we \ncontinue to vote on the remaining pending judicial nominees when we \nreturn from recess.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield back all time on this side, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the Strand nomination?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, soon Senator Whitehouse and I will be \noffering a unanimous consent request. It is in regard to the Juvenile \nJustice and Delinquency Prevention Reauthorization Act. It has an \namendment at the desk. I introduced this measure last April with \nSenator Whitehouse, and it has three main goals.\n  First, this measure would extend a federal law, known as the Juvenile \nJustice and Delinquency Prevention Act, for 5 more years. The \ncenterpiece of this 1974 law, which Congress last extended in 2002, is \nits core protections for youth.\n  There are four core protections. The first calls for States to avoid \ndetaining youth for low-level status offenses. The second requires that \njuveniles be kept out of adult facilities, except in rare instances. \nThe third ensures that juveniles will be kept separated from adult \ninmates whenever they are housed in adult facilities. The fourth calls \nfor reducing disproportionate minority contact in State juvenile \njustice systems. States adhering to these four requirements receive \nyearly formula grants to support their juvenile justice systems.\n  Second, this legislation would make important updates to existing law \nin order to ensure that juvenile justice programs will yield the best \npossible estimates. The authorization for these programs expired in \n2007, but they continue to receive appropriations. Nearly 14 years have \nelapsed since the last reauthorization, and the programs are long \noverdue for an update.\n  Third, this bill would promote greater accountability in government \nspending. The Judiciary Committee that I chair heard from multiple \nwhistleblowers that reforms are urgently needed to restore the \nintegrity of formula grant programs that are the centerpiece of our \ncurrent juvenile justice law. The Justice Department's Office of \nJuvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention administers this formula \ngrant program.\n  This grant program would be continued for 5 more years under this \nbill, but the Justice Department would have to do much more oversight \nif this bill is enacted. This bill also calls for evidence-based \nprograms to be accorded priority in funding. The goal is to ensure that \nscarce Federal resources for juvenile justice will be devoted mostly to \nthe programs that research shows have the greatest merits and will \nyield the best results for these young people.\n  For years and years, I have been reading inspector general reports \nthat disclose shortcomings within the Justice Department, under both \nRepublican Presidents and Democratic Presidents. Money is not being \nspent according to congressional intent, and it has not yielded the \nresults we should be getting. That's why we want evidence-based \nprograms to be accorded priority in funding.\n  A coalition of over 100 nonprofit organizations, led by the Campaign \nfor Youth Justice and the Coalition for Juvenile Justice, worked \nclosely with us on this bill's development. Others that have endorsed \nthis measure include Fight Crime: Invest in Kids, Boys Town, \nRights4Girls, the National Criminal Justice Association, the National \nCouncil of Juvenile and Family Court Judges, and the National District \nAttorneys Association. Senator Whitehouse and I are very grateful for \ntheir support.\n  I also take this opportunity to thank our 15 cosponsors, who include \nnot only numerous Judiciary Committee members but people off the \ncommittee, such as Senators Blunt, Rubio, Ernst, and other non-\ncommittee members. This bill is a truly bipartisan effort, and many \nSenators contributed provisions to strengthen this bill since we \nintroduced it last April.\n  There are a few provisions of the bill that I especially want to \nhighlight. First, as already mentioned, this bill calls for continued \ncongressional support of existing grant programs that serve at-risk \nyouth. It also incorporates new language, championed by the \norganization called Rights4Girls, which emphasizes Congress's support \nfor efforts to reduce delinquency among girls. Experts tell us that \nmany girls in the juvenile justice system today have experienced \nviolence, trauma, and poverty.\n  Second, at the urging of the National Council of Juvenile and Family \nCourt Judges, this bill gives States 3 years to phase out the detention \nof children who have committed so-called status offenses. Status \noffenses are those that are low-level offenses, such as running away \nfrom home, underage tobacco use, curfew violations, or truancy, which \nwouldn't be crimes if committed by an adult and which would never \nresult in an adult being jailed.\n  Most status offenders are boys, with one exception. Girls account for \nabout 60 percent of the runaway cases. Many of these girls and boys \ncome from broken homes, and many have experienced trauma or mental \nhealth issues in childhood. Research shows that detention tends to make \nmentally ill status offenders worse. Because some detention facilities \nare crowded, violent, or chaotic, they can be very dangerous places for \nthe low-risk offender. It is very expensive to lock up status offenders \nwho don't pose a public safety risk. Finally, experts say that the \nstatus offenders learn negative behavior from high-risk offenders in \ndetention, which greatly increases their risks of reoffending. \nResearchers call this peer deviancy training.\n  Third, the bill incorporates new provisions designed to rehabilitate \nand protect juveniles while they are in custody. It encourages \nscreenings of boys and girls who may be exploited by human traffickers, \nas well as those with trauma, mental health, or substance abuse issues. \nIt includes language, authored by Senators Cornyn and Schumer, which \nwould end the shackling of pregnant girls in detention. It calls for \ngreater data collection, including reports on the use of isolation on \njuveniles in State or local detention facilities, and it includes \nlanguage calling for States to ensure that juveniles will continue \ntheir education while in detention.\n  The measure we are seeking to pass today also includes a minor \namendment at the request of Senator Murkowski to ensure that the bill's \ndefinition of the phrase ``Indian tribes'' is the same as existing law. \nWe also have added several new provisions to meet the better needs of \ntribal youth, who are overrepresented in the juvenile justice system. \nThey include a requirement that the GAO report back to Congress on ways \nto improve prevention\n\n[[Page S851]]\n\nand treatment services, as well as provisions encouraging States to \nnotify Indian tribes when tribal youth come into contact with their \njuvenile justice systems.\n  I am pleased to have had the opportunity to work so closely in such a \nbipartisan manner with Senator Whitehouse, who I hope will speak \nshortly on these key reform provisions. I am pleased that we have \nrevisited the authorization statute for some vitally important juvenile \njustice programs--a statute which is long overdue for an update to \nreflect the latest scientific research on what works with at-risk \nadolescents.\n  At this point, would the Presiding Officer recognize Senator \nWhitehouse under the rules.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here to show support for my \nJudiciary Committee chairman's effort to move this measure by unanimous \nconsent. He has described the bill in considerable detail, so I will \nnot repeat his description of the bill.\n  From a point of view of process, I will say that this was a bill that \ncame through Judiciary without a single voice of dissent. A great deal \nof bipartisan work was done to make sure it addressed new problems that \nyoung people face in all these different areas that the chairman \ndescribed. It has a lot of enthusiasm and support in the Judiciary \nCommittee. Indeed, it had such broad enthusiasm and support in the \nJudiciary Committee that we decided that we would simply hotline the \nbill because there seemed to be no objection to it. ``Hotline'' means \nyou ask unanimous consent and warn people you are going to ask \nunanimous consent, and anybody who wants to object has a chance to come \nto the floor and do so.\n  It is my understanding that there is one Senator of the 100 of us who \nwishes to do so, and so here we are going through that exercise. But it \nhas completely cleared on our side and is ready for action.\n  I would say that it is quite broadly supported. This is the list of \nlaw enforcement support for it. As you can see even from a chair quite \nfar away, this is a fairly considerable document with a substantial \nlist of hundreds of folks from across the country who pledge their \nsupport to this bill in law enforcement.\n  I would add that from the State of Arkansas, the junior Senator from \nArkansas is the Senator who is going to raise the one objection, I \ngather. The Arkansas State Advisory Group, the association called \nArkansas Advocates for Children and Families, and the official State \nArkansas Division of Youth Services all support this bill.\n  On the list of law enforcement supporters that I showed you are the \nfollowing law enforcement leaders from Arkansas who support this bill. \nRobert Alcon is the chief of police of the Mayflower Police Department, \nand he supports this bill. Steve Benton is the chief of police of the \nWard Police Department; he supports this bill. Ray Coffman is the chief \nof police of the Judsonia Police Department; he supports this bill. \nRandy Harvey is the chief of police of the Lowell Police Department; he \nsupports this bill. Mark Kizer is the chief of police of the Bryant \nPolice Department; he supports this bill. Kirk Lane is the chief of \npolice of the Benton Police Department; he supports this bill. Randy \nReid is the chief of police of the Glenwood Police Department; he \nsupports this bill. Montie Sims is the chief of police of the \nDardanelle Police Department; he supports this bill. Obie Sims is the \nsheriff of the Lafayette County Sheriff's Office, and he supports this \nbill.\n  I would note that the senior Senator from Arkansas is not here to \nobject to it.\n  I would hope that since the Governor of Arkansas has appointed a \nYouth Justice Reform Board, whose purpose is to ``improve the overall \neffectiveness of the juvenile justice system'' through evidence-based \npractices, the 3-year period that this bill gives for the \nimplementation of this would give Arkansas plenty of time to \naccommodate itself. If there proves to be a problem, we can always come \nback to it later. In the meantime, this effort that is being undertaken \nunder the leadership of the Governor of Arkansas is being done in \nconjunction with the Arkansas Division of Youth Services, which \nsupports this bill.\n  I would add one other thing, which is that the purpose of this bill \nis to prevent children from being locked up for something that no adult \ncould be locked up for if they were to do it--truancy, not showing up \nfor school, things like that.\n  In the event, however, that a child comes under the supervision of a \ncourt and the court directs that child to do certain things, if the \nchild then fails to comply with the court order, judges have broad \nauthority to enforce compliance with their orders. It is known as the \ncontempt power. It is inherent in the judicial office. It can include \nfines; it can even include detention.\n  To be in violation of a court order is not, in my view or in the view \nof anybody else that I am aware of, a status offense. Therefore, in a \nparticularly acute or difficult situation in which a judge feels the \nneed to enforce compliance with his or her order, the contempt power \ninherent in the judiciary is not obviated or addressed in any way by \nthis bill.\n  So for all those reasons, I will conclude by recalling the story of \nthe conclusion of the Founders' work on the Constitution, when, at the \nend, Benjamin Franklin stood up and acknowledged that there had been \nvarious disagreements but that he would urge that each of the Members \nof that body doubt just for one moment their own infallibility and \nallow the measure to proceed.\n  In that spirit, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this is the opportunity we have been \nwaiting for. I hope it is not objected to. If it is, we will have to \ntake that into consideration and just hold the bill in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 325, which is S. 1169; further, \nthat the Grassley substitute amendment be agreed to; that the \ncommittee-reported substitute amendment, as amended, be agreed to; that \nthe bill, as amended, be read a third time; and that the Senate vote on \npassage of the bill, as amended, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, first, I \nwant to express my appreciation for the work Senator Grassley, Senator \nWhitehouse, and others have done in crafting the Juvenile Justice and \nDelinquency Prevention Act. I agree with my colleagues--the bill \nimproves the way we handle juvenile offenders. The bill properly \nfocuses on rehabilitation and services that seek to turn juveniles away \nfrom crime and provide help to at-risk youth. I support the vast \nmajority of the bill, and I hope it ultimately passes into law. \nHowever, I would like to take more time to discuss one specific \nprovision of the bill relating to juvenile status offenders and secure \nconfinement.\n  Secure confinement is not and in my opinion should not be the \npreferred option for instances of alcohol possession, truancy, or other \nstatus offenses. In fact, current law bars judges from imposing secure \nconfinement for initial status offenses. But I am concerned that the \nbill eliminates completely the ability for judges to order secure \nconfinement for a short time in instances where a status offender \nflagrantly violates the judge's prior order for him to, say, enter into \nrehabilitation, counseling, or take part in other treatment services. \nIn such narrow circumstances, it may be prudent to allow judges--often \nin consultation with the parents and attorneys involved--to have secure \nconfinement as a means to enforce their own orders and to ensure that \nthe juvenile receives the help he needs.\n  Currently, many States are developing an array of options for \ntreating status offenders beyond secure confinement. Yet a majority of \nStates do, in fact, still choose to retain the option for judges to \norder secure confinement in narrow circumstances.\n  Just last year, my State of Arkansas passed a new juvenile justice \nbill that sought to expand rehabilitation services for status offenders \nso the State could reduce the number who were subject to secure \nconfinement, but in my State legislature's judgment, it chose\n\n[[Page S852]]\n\nto retain secure confinement as a last-resort option. I don't believe \nCongress should second-guess this choice. I have heard from Arkansans \non this point, and I have raised it with the bill's sponsors.\n  A blanket Federal mandate that bans secure confinement in each and \nevery circumstance may not be the best way forward. I submit we should \ncontinue to entrust States with the decision to retain it as a last-\nresort option and to allow judges on a case-by-case basis to use their \ndiscretion about the best course to enforce their prior orders. \nTherefore, with hopes we can resolve the issue promptly and pass this \nlegislation, I regretfully object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, may I clarify one point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, there are grants that the Federal \nGovernment makes to States to support their juvenile justice programs, \nand there are conditions that come with those grants. But I want to \nmake sure that what is clear from the exchange is that this is a \ncondition for receiving these Federal grants, but there is no mandate \nof any kind. The State, if it wishes, is free not to receive the \nFederal grant money and not comply with those conditions. It may be a \ntechnical point, but I think it is one that is important to clarify.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I understand the point the Senator from \nRhode Island makes. I would say it poses a Hobson's choice for many \nStates.\n  I would also make note of his earlier comment about a court's \ninherent authority to enforce its previous order using its inherent \npower of contempt, which would include the ability to order secure \nconfinement for a short period of time. Perhaps we can work together to \ninclude a proviso in the bill that would recognize that inherent \nauthority, and this bill would not remove that inherent authority on \nthe condition of accepting the grant.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Again, for the Record, I am the Senator from Rhode \nIsland, not the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I respect the Senator from Arkansas. In \nthe short time he has been in the Senate, he has been an outstanding \nleader on very important issues. He is a good Senator. I have watched \nhim over the period of time he has been in the Senate, and I think this \nis the first time I felt he was wrong. But he has his rights.\n  Juvenile judges are the ones who originally requested that Congress \ninclude a valid court order, or ``VCO,'' exception in the Federal \njuvenile justice statute, and they now are asking us to repeal it. We \naccorded great weight to the opinion of the National Council of Family \nand Juvenile Court Judges because their members are the ones who invoke \nthis exception.\n  As further noted this week by Elizabeth Pyke of the National Criminal \nJustice Association: ``No one on the state government side is arguing \nto keep the VCO. . . . All agree that the VCO is the wrong tool to get \na child's attention. Holding them in detention for a status offense is \nno longer considered the best practice for scaring a kid into going \nstraight . . . So parsing the language to allow judges to continue to \nuse the VCO for punishment doesn't really make sense. And, again, no \none in the states has argued for that.''\n  Detaining status offenders is not good public policy. We don't \nsupport a further language change because locking up these adolescents \nwill make them worse, expose them to violent offenders who have \ncommitted serious crimes, and increase the likelihood they will become \nserious offenders themselves.\n  Remember that we are talking about juveniles who have committed \ninfractions that would not be crimes if committed by adults. Curfew \nviolations. Truancy. Underage tobacco use.\n  Status offenders often come from broken homes or homes with family \nconflicts. Many have had traumatic childhoods or suffer from mental \nhealth issues.\n  Strikingly, girls are 16 percent of the detained population but \ncomprise 40 percent of status offenders. In the case of girls, the root \ncause for commission of a status offense may be severe forms of child \nabuse, including child sex trafficking.\n  In truancy cases, placing a status offender in detention only ensures \nthat the juvenile will miss even more school without ever resolving the \nissue motivating the truancy. Even a brief time in detention may make \nit harder for the child to keep up with school work. Yet truancy is one \nof the status offenses that frequently results in a status offender's \ndetention in Arkansas. We need to resolve the issues that lead these \nchildren to skip school so that they can succeed.\n  Judges have more effective and less costly tools at their disposal to \nensure these juveniles' accountability. For example, they can suspend \ntheir driver's license; impose fines; send the juvenile to live with \nanother family; order the juvenile into counseling. Judges also may ask \nparents to undergo counseling or take parenting classes.\n  Finally, as already noted, locking up status offenders costs the \ntaxpayers a lot of money, even though these juveniles typically don't \npose a public safety risk. In Arkansas, housing a child in detention \ncosts hundreds of dollars per day. Community-based programs cost a lot \nless, but they ensure the judge receives periodic status updates and \nenable the judge to increase sanctions if the child remains unstable.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nsome of the letters we have received in support of the bill's passage.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 National Criminal\n\n\n                                          Justice Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 27, 2015.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Sheldon Whitehouse,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Grassley and Whitehouse: We are pleased to \n     support S. 1169, the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency \n     Prevention Reauthorization Act (JJDPA) of 2015. Members of \n     the National Criminal Justice Association (NCJA) include the \n     state, territorial and tribal chief executive officers of \n     criminal justice agencies charged with managing federal, \n     state, and tribal justice assistance resources. About half of \n     these administer the programs authorized by the JJDPA.\n       NCJA members applaud the goals of S. 1169 to preserve and \n     strengthen the prevention, youth development and \n     rehabilitation purposes of the JJDPA, and are committed to \n     achieving the reforms envisioned by the bill. In particular, \n     the bill focuses on employing evidence-based and promising \n     practices to promote alternatives to detention and provide \n     for the diversion from, and the safe and effective treatment \n     for, youth in confinement. It also would further the progress \n     we have made as a nation in keeping youth out of contact with \n     adult offenders, from the time of arrest through confinement.\n       The promise of the JJDPA is federal support for innovative \n     state approaches to reforming the juvenile justice system and \n     improving the treatment of juveniles under the state's care. \n     S. 1169 will add to states' responsibilities by substantially \n     expanding the activities under the core requirements, \n     increasing data collection, and potentially requiring states \n     to establish new facilities to house youthful offenders and \n     increase the number of facilities states are required to \n     monitor. Yet, since the last reauthorization in 2002, funding \n     for JJDPA programs has dropped by more than 60 percent. This \n     means that the resources available to states for juvenile \n     delinquency programming and compliance with the core \n     requirements are substantially dropping at a time when the \n     requirements on states are substantially increasing.\n       It is for this reason that NCJA members appreciate the \n     flexibility and spirit of partnership embedded in the bill \n     which will help all states reach a common standard of \n     protection and service for children in the juvenile justice \n     system even when resources are scarce.\n       NCJA members also believe the bill will help continue to \n     rebuild the partnership between OJJDP and the state agencies \n     responsible for carrying out the purposes of the Act. The \n     bill includes new training and technical assistance \n     opportunities for state agency administrators, offers a new \n     opportunity for state agencies to partner with OJJDP in \n     research and the sharing of best practices, and holds the \n     promise of improving transparency.\n       We are effusive in our praise and thanks for Evelyn Fortier \n     and Lara Quint. Throughout the bill development process, \n     Evelyn and Lara have been thoughtful, professional, \n     welcoming, patient, collaborative, and kind. They have \n     listened to our concerns and\n\n[[Page S853]]\n\n     worked hard to craft language that supports the role of the \n     state administering agencies while keeping pressure on the \n     states to strengthen our juvenile justice systems.\n       Thank you for your leadership, for your commitment to \n     improving the outcomes for youth, and for supporting state \n     efforts to prevent and reduce juvenile crime.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Jeanne Smith,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       Act 4 Juvenile Justice,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 25, 2016.\n     Hon. Chuck Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Sheldon Whitehouse,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Grassley and Senator Whitehouse: We, the \n     undersigned--representing more than 200 national, state, and \n     local organizations and hundreds of thousands of \n     constituents--thank you for your leadership in sponsoring S. \n     1169, the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention \n     Reauthorization Act of 2015. The bill strengthens and updates \n     the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (JJDPA), \n     which has provided States and localities with federal \n     standards and supports for improving juvenile justice and \n     delinquency prevention practices and contributed to \n     safeguards for youth, families and communities for more than \n     40 years, and we are grateful that you have made it a \n     priority this Congress.\n       Despite a continuing decline in youth crime and \n     delinquency, more than 60,000 young people are held in \n     detention centers awaiting trial or confined by the courts in \n     juvenile facilities in the U.S. For these confined youth, and \n     the many more kids at-risk of involvement in the justice \n     system, the JJDPA and programs it supports are critical. \n     Youth who are locked up are separated from their families, \n     and many witness violence. These youth struggle when they get \n     out, trying to complete high school, get jobs, housing, or go \n     to college. Aside from the human toll, the financial costs of \n     maintaining large secure facilities have also made it vital \n     to rethink juvenile justice in every community.\n       Premised on research-based understandings of juvenile \n     justice and delinquency prevention, S. 1169 reaffirms a \n     national commitment to the rehabilitative purpose of the \n     juvenile justice system; one that supports developmentally \n     appropriate practices that treat as many youth as possible in \n     their communities. It advances important improvements to the \n     JJDPA, its core requirements and its central purposes, \n     provides enhanced safeguards for youth in the system, \n     increases community safety, and ensures progress toward \n     racial fairness.\n       Since the last JJDPA reauthorization was approved in 2002, \n     there have been many developments in the field of juvenile \n     justice that significantly impact practitioners' work. S. \n     1169 recognizes and addresses many of these developments in \n     several key ways. Specifically, we are pleased that the bill:\n       1. Strengthens the Deinstitutionalization of Status \n     Offenders (DSO) core requirement by calling on states to \n     phase-out use of the Valid Court Order Exception that \n     currently causes non-offending youth/status offenders to be \n     locked up.\n       2. Extends the adult Jail Removal and Sight and Sound \n     Separation core requirements to apply to juveniles held \n     pretrial, whether charged in juvenile or adult court.\n       3. Gives States and localities clear direction on the \n     Disproportionate Minority Contact (DMC) protection to plan \n     and implement approaches to ensure fairness and reduce racial \n     and ethnic disparities, and to set measurable objectives for \n     reduction of disparities in the system.\n       4. Encourages States to eliminate dangerous practices in \n     confinement and to promote adoption of best practices and \n     standards.\n       5. Recognizes the impact of exposure to violence and trauma \n     on adolescent behavior and development.\n       6. Encourages investment in community-based alternatives to \n     detention; encourages family engagement in design and \n     delivery of treatment and services; improves screening, \n     diversion, assessment, and treatment for mental health and \n     substance abuse needs; allows for easier transfer of \n     education credits for system-involved youth; and calls for a \n     focus on the particular needs of girls either in the system \n     or at risk of entering the justice system.\n       7.

Reauthorizes the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant \n     (JABG) program which helps states and localities reduce \n     juvenile offending by providing judges and other juvenile \n     justice officials with a range of age/developmentally-\n     appropriate options to both hold youth accountable and get \n     them back on track so they are less likely to reoffend.\n       9.

Chuck Grassley,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Grassley: Rights4Girls is a human rights \n     organization focused on gender-based violence against young \n     women and girls here in the U.S. We write to thank you for \n     your leadership and commitment to our youth in sponsoring the \n     Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Reauthorization \n     Act (JJDPA) this Congress. We believe this bill strengthens \n     the existing law by providing critical updates needed to \n     protect youth, families, and communities.\n       We write to express our support for the JJDPA, which has \n     not been reauthorized in over a decade. Despite an overall \n     decline in youth crime and delinquency, more than 60,000 \n     children are held in detention centers across the United \n     States. We also know that girls are now the fastest growing \n     segment of the juvenile justice population, requiring a more \n     gender-responsive lens when looking at issues related to \n     delinquency and justice-involvement. The research shows that \n     the vast majority of girls in the justice system enter with \n     extensive histories of sexual and physical abuse. Nationally, \n     over 70% of girls in the justice system report histories of \n     sexual and physical violence, but in some states it can range \n     anywhere from 80-93%. For youth and especially young girls in \n     the system or at-risk of involvement in the system, the JJDPA \n     and the improvements in this year's language are vital.\n       For example, we know that each year more than 1,000 \n     American children are arrested for prostitution, despite not \n     being old enough to consent to sex and despite the existence \n     of federal laws that define them as victims of trafficking. \n     The JJDPA protects child trafficking victims by providing for \n     the screening of youth upon intake for child trafficking and \n     promoting services and alternatives to detention for such \n     victims. The JJDPA will also grant greater protection for \n     pregnant girls behind bars by restricting the use of \n     shackles. Because shackles can greatly increase the \n     likelihood of falls, the JJDPA limits the use of restraints \n     on pregnant girls in the system, which will better protect \n     the life and health of both these young women as well as \n     their unborn children. Another critical way in which the \n     JJDPA will benefit young girls is in phasing out the Valid \n     Court Order (VCO) exception. Since girls are \n     disproportionately charged with and detained for status \n     offenses, closing this loophole would particularly benefit \n     girls--many of whom are arrested and detained using the VCO \n     exception for offenses that are directly correlated with \n     suffering abuse and trauma.\n       We are grateful for your commitment to this issue and to \n     these youth. As a human rights organization dedicated to \n     protecting the rights of vulnerable young women and girls, we \n     urge the Senate to swiftly take up and pass this critical \n     piece of legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Rights4Girls,\n     Washington, DC.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  Fight Crime: Invest in Kids,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 17, 2015.\n       To All Members of Congress: We are members of Fight Crime: \n     Invest in Kids, a national organization of nearly 5,000 law \n     enforcement leaders nationwide, including chiefs of police, \n     sheriffs, prosecutors, and other law enforcement executives. \n     We write to express our strong support for S. 1169, the \n     bipartisan reauthorization of the Juvenile Justice and \n     Delinquency Prevention Act (JJDPA). This reauthorization \n     supports proven programs that can prevent youths from \n     engaging in criminal activity or rehabilitate youths starting \n     to offend. These programs provide a critical support for law \n     enforcement and an important investment in those young \n     people. We urge your support for this important \n     reauthorization.\n       Recidivism remains a serious problem, draining law \n     enforcement resources and damaging public safety. Past \n     studies have shown that if a youth 14 years old or younger \n     becomes a second-time offender, their likelihood of future \n     run-ins with law enforcement spikes to 77 percent; and \n     nationwide, almost half of youths who come before juvenile \n     court (40 percent) will come before the court at least one \n     more time. More needs to be done to ensure that if a youth \n     offends, their first contact with the justice system is also \n     their last.\n       The bipartisan Senate bill to reauthorize JJDPA would \n     provide federal support for evidence-based programs to combat \n     youth recidivism. Many states have expanded the use of these \n     intervention programs in recent years, and additional support \n     through the JJDPA reauthorization would help states continue \n     this work. Research has shown that effective community-based \n     intervention programs for youths and their families can \n     significantly reduce the likelihood that the youth will get \n     into trouble again. By reasserting family and personal \n     responsibility, and coaching parents and children in the \n     skills they will need to change the youths' behaviors, \n     juvenile offenders are much more likely to engage in more \n     pro-social behavior and avoid future run-ins with the law.\n       This reauthorization strengthens the evidence-based \n     standard, ensuring the federal investment will go to programs \n     that have demonstrated significant effectiveness. It also \n     encourages continued growth in the\n\n[[Page S854]]\n\n     anti-recidivism field by allowing a small portion of funds to \n     go to promising programs, thus encouraging innovation and \n     yielding the greatest results for the community.\n       A study of one intervention program that works with \n     troubled youth and their families, Functional Family Therapy \n     (FFT), found that youth whose families received FFT coaching \n     were half as likely to be rearrested as those whose families \n     did not. Another study found FFT reduced subsequent out-of-\n     home placements by three quarters. Further, because of the \n     reduced costs associated with crime and contact with the \n     justice system, FFT was found to save the public $27,000 per \n     youth treated. Another intervention that works with the \n     families of serious juvenile offenders, Multisystemic Therapy \n     (MST), found juvenile offenders who had not received MST were \n     62 percent more likely to be arrested for another offense, \n     and more than twice as likely to be arrested for a violent \n     offense.\n       One effective, research-based program, Multidimensional \n     Treatment Foster Care (MTFC) provides specially selected and \n     trained foster parents for seriously troubled youth who \n     cannot stay with their parents. While the youth are in foster \n     care learning crucial skills, their parents are receiving \n     coaching so they can continue the process of directing their \n     children's behavior in more positive ways once the youths \n     return home. In studies, MTFC has been shown to cut juvenile \n     recidivism in half and save the public an average of $9,000 \n     for every juvenile treated. Each of these programs can be \n     used successfully either in place of residential facilities, \n     or as after-care upon leaving a facility.\n       As these programs help to reduce youth recidivism, there \n     also needs to be a clear sense of the progress being made and \n     areas for continued improvement. We support the National \n     Recidivism Measure within this reauthorization that instructs \n     the Administrator to establish a uniform measure of data \n     collection that states can voluntarily adopt, or not, as \n     another tool to evaluate data on juvenile recidivism. The \n     option of measure some re-offending outcomes in the same way \n     could help states compare results and share best practices.\n       Law enforcement nationwide remain committed to doing what \n     is necessary to protect public safety, and we know that \n     families and communities have an important role to play. We \n     support the reauthorization of JJDPA, which will provide \n     support for family-centered and community-based \n     interventions, like FFT, MST, and MFTC. This is a strategic \n     investment in public safety. Changing the behavior of a \n     teenager is more likely than changing the behavior of an \n     adult career criminal. This not only benefits those youths, \n     but also law enforcement, the taxpayer, and the community.\n       We urge Congress to pass the reauthorization of JJDPA that \n     will prioritize evidence-based programs to get troubled kids \n     back on track and improve public safety.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, for the 10th anniversary of Hurricane \nKatrina, I went down to the Lower Ninth Ward. President Obama had a \nlittle convocation which I was privileged to be part of. I pointed out \nthat his budget that year attempted to take the money that the Federal \nGovernment had committed, voted on by a majority of this Chamber, to \nshare in the offshore revenue from Louisiana's coast, Texas's coast, \nand other Gulf Coast States, with those States.\n  I said: Mr. President, your budget is taking this money away.\n  If you look at the devastation wrought by Katrina, it was wrought \nbecause we lost our wetlands, which was a loss directly connected to \nthe Federal Government's decision to channel the Mississippi River for \nthe benefit of the rest of the country's economy, and also because the \nArmy Corps of Engineers failed to build--and this has been established \nin court--levees to the degree that would protect the city of New \nOrleans.\n  The President clearly agreed. He said so. He looked at his budget \nman, Shaun Donovan, and said: Why would this be? We need this State to \nhave that money.\n  I paraphrase, but it was essentially that. And he committed to taking \ncare of that issue so that our State would not be confronted with the \nkind of disaster Katrina was. He did not want this to happen again.\n  On Tuesday the President released his fiscal year 2017 budget. Once \nmore, despite his words, he proposed repealing existing revenue-sharing \nlaw, which would deny Louisiana and other Gulf Coast States billions. \nLouisiana will use this money on critical coastal restoration. By doing \nthis, the President betrays the commitment he made in the Lower Ninth \nWard. The President and some in this Chamber want to repeal a law that \nreceived bipartisan support, with over 70 Senators supporting the \noriginal legislation in 2006. By the way, it is also a law that anti-\npoverty and environmental organizations support.\n  I hold up a letter from Oxfam. Oxfam America states in this letter \nthat ``America's Gulf Coast is home to some of our nation's highest \nrates of poverty and greatest risks of natural hazards like sea level \nrise, hurricanes, flooding and coastal land loss.''\n  Passage of amendment No. 3192--which, by the way, is my amendment to \nthe Energy bill which brings more equity and revenue sharing--will \nprovide new resources to address the glaring inequities facing these \ncommunities.\n  In response to the President's fiscal year 2016 budget, the \nEnvironmental Defense Fund, the National Wildlife Federation, the \nNational Audubon Society, and the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation \nstated:\n\n       But we are disappointed by the budget's proposed diversion \n     of critically needed and currently dedicated funding for \n     coastal Louisiana and the Mississippi River Delta.\n       This proposed budget undercuts the Administration's \n     previous commitments to restore critical economic \n     infrastructure and ecosystems in the Mississippi River Delta, \n     where we are losing 16 square miles of critical wetlands \n     every year--a preventable coastal erosion crisis.\n\n  So if you are pro-environment and pro helping poverty-stricken \ncommunities, how can you not support revenue sharing for coastal \nStates?\n  Coastal restoration is critical to Louisiana's economy and safety but \nalso to America's economy. Every 38 minutes, Louisiana loses about a \nfootball field-sized chunk of land. I am presiding next. At the bottom \nof the hour, Louisiana will have lost another football field of land. \nThis revenue sharing helps reverse that.\n  By the way, in Louisiana, our Constitution dedicates 100 percent of \nrevenue from offshore energy production to restoring and rebuilding our \ncoastal wetlands.\n  A strong coast protects families and businesses against storm surge. \nIt prevents posters like this: ``Why New Orleans Still Isn't Safe,'' \nand posters like this, and many other posters.\n  With our coasts so degraded--it puts Louisiana's economy in jeopardy, \nbut it also puts America's energy and trade infrastructure in jeopardy. \nMost importantly, loss of coastal wetlands puts American lives in \njeopardy.\n  Not only do we need to protect this revenue sharing as promised, but \nI and others feel we must increase that revenue sharing amount if we \nare to truly protect our coast.\n  Royalties to States from energy produced offshore is a fraction of \nwhat States that produce energy onshore receive. In fiscal year 2014, \nthe Federal Government received $4.6 billion--with a ``b''--in \nroyalties from energy production in the Gulf of Mexico. The coastal \nStates that provide the energy infrastructure received $3.4 million--\nwith an ``m''--so 0.7 percent of the royalties. In comparison, States \nthat produce energy onshore--and I think the Presiding Officer's State \nis such--get 50 percent of those royalties. So 0.7; 50 percent--there \nis no equity there.\n  I have introduced a bipartisan amendment to the Senate's Energy bill \nthat I hope we can keep working on to provide greater equity and \nrevenue sharing for States that do host offshore energy production.\n  For decades, energy activities in the Gulf of Mexico have produced \nbillions of barrels of oil and trillions of cubic feet of natural gas. \nGulf of Mexico offshore oil production accounts for close to 20 percent \nof the U.S. crude oil production. Over 45 percent of total petroleum \nrefining capacity in the United States is located along the gulf coast,\n\n[[Page S855]]\n\nas well as 51 percent of total natural gas processing plant capacity. \nThe Gulf States provide the docks, roads, railroads, refineries, and \nother infrastructure that makes energy production possible to fuel \nAmerica's economy.\n  On top of this, our waterways support trade throughout the country. \nFarm crops produced in the Upper Midwest pass through the lower \nMississippi on their way to international markets. We need equitable \nrevenue sharing to continue hosting these industries, ensuring that \nAmerica continues to have a resilient domestic energy supply and access \nto the goods and services we need.\n  If the President is serious about protecting families, our \nenvironment, enhancing the resiliency of the gulf coast and improving \nthe Nation's economic infrastructure, he should have worked with \nCongress to ensure that this never happens again.\n  I yield to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank my colleague and friend from \nLouisiana.\n  I want to talk a little bit about the work of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee because we have had a pretty extraordinary week this week in \nthe committee under the leadership of the Senator from Iowa, Mr. \nGrassley. We have been focusing our efforts on our criminal justice \nsystem and how it has been transformed in recent years because instead \nof just being law-and-order courts, our criminal justice system is \ndealing with everything from heroin addiction to opioid addiction, \nmental health challenges, and the recognition that eventually many of \nthe people who are in our prisons will get out of prison, and we have \nbecome more focused on what we can do to help those who are willing to \naccept some help to be better prepared for a life on the outside and \nnot reengage in this turnstile that sometimes our criminal justice \nsystem has become, where they get in jail or in prison, they get out, \nand then they automatically end up back in prison. That is not good for \nsociety, for public safety. It is not good for the taxpayer who has to \npay for it, and it really is a squandering of human capital when some \npeople--indeed, a significant number of people--are willing to accept \nthat help to deal with their drug or alcohol issues, to learn a skill, \nand to turn their lives around.\n  We had a hearing yesterday that I want to make particular note of on \na piece of legislation I have introduced called the Mental Health and \nSafe Communities Act. The Presiding Officer is well familiar with this \nand is sponsoring some important comprehensive mental health \nlegislation himself, and we are working together to try to find common \nground on that, but my legislation is designed specifically to address \nhow do we equip law enforcement with the additional tools they need in \norder to address the mental illness crises they find in their daily \nwork and in our criminal justice system.\n  We made good progress, but the fact is I think most of us were \nshocked to realize our jails and prisons have become the de facto \ntreatment centers for people with mental illness, and actually in most \ninstances it is not diagnosed and not treated. People self-medicate \nwith drugs or alcohol, exacerbating their problems, and we couldn't \nhave had two better witnesses. One was the sheriff, Susan Pamerleau, \nfrom Bexar County, TX, San Antonio--my hometown--which has created a \nmodel program of how to divert people for treatment and to get them out \nof the criminal justice system and back on their feet but also to save \ntax dollars and make sure our jails and our criminal justice system is \nreserved for people who are bad actors and not just people who are \nsuffering from a mental health crisis.\n  Today we considered and passed a bill called the Comprehensive \nAddiction and Recovery Act, known as CARA. This is another example of \nbipartisan work being done in the Senate, which is back doing the \npeople's work with some notable accomplishments.\n  More importantly, it addresses a real crisis in the country because \nwe have all come to be aware of the fact that America is facing an \nepidemic of drug addiction, ranging from prescription drug painkillers \nto heroin, addiction that is ruining lives of Americans and taking the \nlives of far too many.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 47,000-\nplus Americans died from drug overdoses in 2014--47,055 Americans died \nfrom drug overdoses in 2014, more than any previous year on record and \nmore than double the mortality record from the year 2000. That \nstatistic cries out for further investigation and action. These 47,000-\nplus drug overdoses represent 150 percent more deaths than those caused \nby motor vehicles. I know we spend a lot of resources and a lot of time \ntrying to improve safety for people on our highways driving cars down \nthe road, but more than 150 percent more people died from drug \noverdoses than motor vehicles, and 61 percent of those deaths involved \nsome type of opioid, including heroin.\n  Fortunately, this legislation begins to establish a strategy to \naddress this problem head-on. The bill would expand prevention and \neducation efforts to help people learn the dangers of becoming addicted \nto prescription medication and the dangers of even experimenting with a \ndrug as powerful and addictive as heroin.\n  It would also reauthorize and expand Federal anti-heroin and anti-\nmethamphetamine task forces, which are on the frontlines in the battle \nagainst drug trafficking organizations, many of whom operate south of \nthe Texas-Mexico border and import their poison into the United States.\n  This legislation would also promote treatment and recovery options \nfor those struggling with deadly addictions and provide law enforcement \nand first responders the tools they need to help reverse overdoses as \nfast as possible by giving medication, which will actually restore \npeople to health rather than see them die because of their overdoses.\n  This legislation is another example of the fight that I think we all \nshare in common without regard to partisan affiliation. I want to \nparticularly point out the leadership of the Senator from New \nHampshire, Ms. Ayotte, and the Senator from Ohio, Mr. Portman, together \nwith Senator Whitehouse from Rhode Island, who have been leading the \neffort to make opioid addiction a national priority.\n  I hope there are other ways in the future we can consider \nstrengthening the hand of those fighting on the supply side of the drug \naddiction battle. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act \nprimarily deals with the demand side, people who have become addicted \nto prescription drugs and heroin, but as I indicated a few moments ago, \nwe have tons of heroin, methamphetamine, and other drugs being imported \ninto the United States by transnational criminal organizations, \notherwise known as cartels.\n  Earlier this week, the Director of National Intelligence, James \nClapper, testified before the Armed Services Committee. He touched on \nhow significant this problem is in Latin America and where many of the \ndrugs sold in the United States are grown or manufactured. Director \nClapper noted that the production of heroin in Mexico has been \nincreasing steadily in response to U.S. demand. Other illicit \nsubstances, such as cocaine, have been increasing in volume as well, \nbut while the production and importation through illicit networks into \nthe United States has been growing, our efforts to interdict or \nintercept these drugs and keep them from landing on our shores has not \nbeen keeping up.\n  In 2014 alone, drug cartels successfully smuggled more than 250,000 \npounds of heroin across our borders at a street value of about $25 \nbillion. We need to have a real conversation about the budget \nshortfalls that allow this to happen and how it is impeding our ability \nto choke off the flow of these illicit drugs coming into our country.\n  We have to do more to resource our military, particularly the \nSouthern Command, which has as its area of responsibility Mexico and to \nthe south, where many of these drugs transit. We need to provide those \non the frontlines with the tools they need in order to combat and \nprevail over these transnational criminal organizations.\n  Let me give you a quick snapshot. U.S. Southern Command, which I \nmentioned a moment ago, is our geographic\n\n[[Page S856]]\n\ncombatant command that has responsibility for this region, but it has \nbeen given zero ships needed to conduct countertrafficking missions in \nthe Caribbean. Why is that?\n  Unfortunately, the Navy fleet is too small, and the Navy doesn't have \nenough ships to commit to this region in light of the growing array of \nnational security threats around the globe. Even though the U.S. Coast \nGuard has stepped up and provided a variety of ships, their fleet also \nhas limitations. It is aging and small.\n  Other nations have noticed our hands-off approach in this region and \naround the world. Just like the Middle East, our adversaries, like \nRussia, are happy to fill the power vacuum left by an America that they \nsee in retreat. At least four times last year Russia had more naval \nships in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility than we did--four times. \nThat is our backyard. What were those Russian ships doing there? Most \nlikely they were conducting intelligence collection missions. This is \nsimply unacceptable and an invitation to even further confrontation and \nperhaps even conflict. We have obvious national interests in this part \nof the world, and they include putting a stop to the trafficking of \nillegal drugs that end up poisoning and often killing Americans.\n  If we can't even accurately patrol the Caribbean with our own \nvessels, we clearly have a problem. Let me be clear. We are not asking \nor talking about multibillion-dollar aircraft carriers or ballistic \nmissile submarines but rather smaller ships that can help launch and \nrecover helicopters to help interdict the growing shipment of drugs in \nthe region.\n  SOUTHCOM simply needs to be better resourced if it is going to make a \ndent in the rampant trafficking of drugs that ruin American lives once \nthey reach our border. General Kelly, the former head of the Southern \nCommand, has testified previously that too often his troops have to \nsimply sit and watch the drugs come into the United States across the \nCaribbean because they simply don't have the resources to interdict it \nand to stop it.\n  While the men and women of SOUTHCOM's Joint Interagency Task Force \nSouth are doing yeoman's work in this area, they can't fully succeed in \ntaking down the trafficking networks if we don't give them the \nresources to do so.\n  As we continue to work hard for the American people, I hope we will \ntake a serious look at the shortfall in our military budgets for \ncountertrafficking missions. We can't just look at the devastation \nwrought by heroin and prescription opioid abuse in the Northeast \nwithout looking at the supply of the very heroin that is killing \nAmericans and addicting them to a miserable existence, one that \nthreatens not only their life and their families but our communities. \nWe need to focus on the supply side and better equip the men and women \ntasked with the difficult job of protecting our country and our people \nfrom these transnational threats.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy).

Senator Collins and I \nfocused on two things: increasing security standards for those visa \nwaiver countries that we believe should use better biometrics and share \nthat information and data, and improving security at our airports \nbefore people reach the United States, so we can know that we have done \na thorough background check and evaluation.\n\n  Senator Collins and I want to stop potential terrorists before they \nboard a plane bound for the United States.\n  I thank Secretary Jeh Johnson for working with us in December on S. \n2430, and also for helping to get this included in the Customs bill.\n  What we want to do is expand the customs and border security efforts \nthat exist here in the United States and, if you will, expand our \nborder controls to overseas airports. After the Paris attacks reignited \na national discussion about what to do to improve U.S. security, we \nwanted to make sure that we do something specifically for those \nindividuals traveling from 38 visa waiver countries. These are \ncountries for whose citizens we do not require a full background check \non individuals prior to coming to the United States. I know the Senator \nfrom Maine understands commerce. From the perspective of my home State, \nI know that we appreciate the free flow of people and commerce. It is \nsomething we depend on for our economy, but our economy also depends on \nthe security of a travel system to catch bad actors before they reach \nthe shores of the United States.\n  Currently, manifests are checked by Homeland Security when passengers \nboard a plane bound for the United States. Airline personnel perform \nsome checks as well, but when no U.S. visa is required for travel to \nthe United States, there is less scrutiny on those travelers before \nthey reach U.S. shores, when they go through customs.\n  This is something we sought to address. With an ever-changing \nsecurity landscape around the world and the challenges that we face \nwith ISIS, it is very important to continue to upgrade our security \nregime.\n  Earlier this week, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper \nwarned that ISIS is likely to try to attack the United States this \nyear, so we must continue to do everything we can to make our country \nsafe. Two incidents highlight the need for expanding the border \nprotection outside the United States of America.\n  One EU citizen, Mehdi Nemouche, was radicalized through multiple \nstints in prison. After he was released, he was able to cover his \ntracks and fly from the EU to Syria. He was able to carry out an attack \non a Jewish museum when he came back to Brussels, even though he was on \nan EU watch list, because he was not placed under ongoing surveillance. \nNothing in his travel through airports helped him to be deterred.\n  German officials notified the French of his appearance in Frankfurt \nafter returning from several weeks in Southeast Asia, having since \ndeparted Syria. There was no record of his having traveled to Syria as \nan EU resident, so he was allowed to come back into Germany and travel \nthrough Europe's common border zone. It was from there he entered \nBelgium unchecked to carry out his attacks.\n  In addition, one of the masterminds behind the Paris attacks traveled \nback and forth between Belgium and Syria multiple times, even though he \nwas known to French intelligence. His mobile phone was traced to Greece \nbecause of a call he made to an extremist group in Belgium. We don't \nknow exactly how he crossed into Greece from Syria, but we do know that \nthere are holes in the system that terrorists can exploit.\n  Senator Collins and I first started working on the issue of biometric \nstandards and improving our security with visa waiver countries several \nyears ago after the Ressam case, in which an individual from Algeria \nwent to France and from France to Canada, making up a new identity \nevery step of the way. He then made it to the U.S. border in Washington \nState at Port Angeles and made up a new identity as a Canadian citizen. \nThank God a customs and border security agent was smart enough to \nrealize something was amiss, and when they checked the trunk of the \ncar, they found explosives that he had planned to use to blow up LAX.\n  Today's legislation makes sure our physical border checks are moved \nto overseas airports so that U.S. law enforcement officials will be \nthere on the ground to check for those people who are slipping through \nthe European regime and may try to board an airplane bound for the \nUnited States of America.\n  It is very important that we continue to strengthen our security \nregime, and I believe there is more that we can do. Our bill, S. 2430, \nwould have allowed\n\n[[Page S857]]\n\nCustoms and Border Protection to expand preclearance operations at \ntargeted airports where we are concerned that the U.S. has a full \npartnership. If you have traveled outside of the United States of \nAmerica and then return, you are very well aware of what happens to you \nat Customs--something like what is depicted in this photo where \nsomebody is asking you for your passport information and background. \nMany of these operations have continued to be improved, including at \nDulles airport. Through a pilot program, they now have the latest and \ngreatest biometric technology that allows for enhanced fingerprint \nidentification, facial recognition pictures, and a variety of things \nthat are making our air travel more secure. We would like to do the \nsame thing at U.S. preclearance operations abroad, and we will keep \nworking to do just that.\n  We would like to see customs and border operations, which is U.S. law \nenforcement on the ground, at partnership airports for places such as \nthe United Kingdom, Spain, Norway, Sweden, Belgium, and Turkey, even \nthough it is not a visa waiver country, because it is a transit point \nbetween Syria and Europe.\n  The language in the bill today shows that Congress supports efforts \nto strengthen the security of our border checks by stretching them \noverseas to these operations. Again, I appreciate Secretary Johnson's \ncommitted insight to constantly improving our border security. He and \nhis agency have been working hard to constantly upgrade our security. \nHe engaged in a conversation with Senator Collins and me last December \non this legislation, and he has continued to help us get this language \ninto the Customs bill that we just voted on.\n  I so appreciate Senator Collins' focus on this issue for many years \nas the head of the Homeland Security Committee. She has since turned \nthat responsibility over to Senator Johnson, and he has also been \nfocused on these issues. I just want to thank her for working with me \non this legislation over several years. In 2010, we tried to improve \nthe biometric standard for visa waiver countries and passed strong \nlegislation out of the Senate. Unfortunately, it was watered down to a \nlesser standard. Yet it did start the efforts on more aggressive \nbiometric travel infrastructure with our visa waiver partners.\n  In our bill, S. 2430, we try to set up new biometric pilot projects \nthat will work with our partners overseas and test out the best \nbiometrics we can use. That provision was not included today, but it's \nsomething we will keep working on.\n  We know ISIS has set up operations and is continuing to focus on \nthese visa waiver countries, as well, like the U.K. and Belgium, and we \nknow it is active in Turkey. Giving the best technologies and tools to \nour partner countries and working on counterintelligence is very \nimportant. Having trained U.S. law enforcement officials working with \nour partner airports is important for U.S. travelers, U.S. businesses, \ninternational commerce, and for travel and the airline industry in \ngeneral. The fact that customs agents can conduct interviews, capture \nbiometrics, and conduct behavioral analysis before travelers come to \nthe United States of America helps improve the security of our system.\n  Customs and Border Patrol has announced they want to increase the \nnumber of these preclearance-screened travelers by a considerable \npercent by 2024. This will help us protect the ever-growing traveling \npopulation--and know that we are doing a better job before people reach \nthe shores of the United States.\n  We know with a U.S. law enforcement presence overseas that we will \nincrease security. Customs and Border Patrol turned away nearly 10,000 \npeople seeking admission to the United States. That is 29 people per \nday. I am not saying all of these people were terrorists. Some had \nexpired documents or otherwise inadmissible information, but the key \nfact is that preclearance worked. It worked in helping to prevent \npeople that should not have been here from coming to the United States.\n  Existing U.S. Customs and preclearance operations have stopped some \nsuspected terrorists from reaching our country, and that is why we are \nso glad we passed this legislation and hope that it will be moved \nthroughout the process to the President's desk and quickly signed.\n  I also want to thank all of our colleagues and the managers of the \nlegislation for including this in the bill. I thank all those who work \nat our U.S. border and U.S. Customs and Border Protection--like the \nperson at the Washington State border who helped catch the Millennium \nBomber, Ahmed Ressam, before he could harm Americans.\n  I again thank the Senator from Maine for her constant work with me on \nthis issue and for her focus on U.S. security. She and I know this job \nis not done. She and I would go even further in this effort, but we are \nat least glad we are expanding our border controls to these overseas \nairports, making U.S. travel safer and protecting people by not letting \npeople come to the United States who pose a security threat.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, it is a great pleasure to join the \nSenator from Washington State, Ms. Cantwell, in discussing some very \nimportant provisions that were included in the Customs conference \nreport that the Senate acted on earlier this afternoon.\n  As Senators representing border States, we are particularly attuned \nto the security and economic consequences of our border security \npolicies. When it comes to travel, our country's goals should be to let \nour friends in and to keep our enemies out. As the Senator from \nWashington so eloquently described, the best way for us to do that is \nto push out our borders.\n  Today, approximately 15 percent of travelers boarding an airplane \ndestined for the United States do so only after fully clearing U.S. \nCustoms and immigration inspections at 15 Department of Homeland \nSecurity preclearance facilities located in foreign airports. That is a \nstart, but it doesn't go far enough. If we truly want to enhance our \nsecurity, we need to advance the use of preclearance facilities in \nother foreign airports, and that is exactly what the Senator from \nWashington and I would do and what the Senate voted to do today. As \nSenator Cantwell has described, it is something that we have long \nworked on together as a team for many years, and I am very pleased with \nthe progress we can point to today.\n  Now, let me just briefly explain how preclearance works. Under the \npreclearance program, we station U.S. law enforcement officials \noverseas at foreign airports. There they can screen passengers at the \npoint of departure to the United States rather than waiting for the \npassengers to arrive in the United States. Well, that makes all the \nsense in the world. It helps to prevent someone--a terrorist--from \nsmuggling a bomb onto a plane. It helps make the no-fly list more \neffective. It helps Federal law enforcement to do a scan of other \nterrorist databases to see if a passenger is listed.\n  In addition, the unique biometric information of each passenger is \nalso collected before the flight departs to our country rather than \nafter it has arrived. Again, it is this concept of pushing back our \nborders so that more screening is done overseas. We are doing this more \nwith cargo, also, that is shipped on those cargo ships coming into our \nports. It makes all the sense in the world. The security feature is \nparticularly important because biometric information is so much more \ndifficult to fake than biographic information such as the name or a \ndate of birth, which can easily, regrettably, be falsified. As a result \nof the preclearance operations, threats to aviation security and to our \ncountry and its people can be identified at the earliest opportunity.\n  Accelerating the expansion of preclearance operations incurs minimal \ncosts and great benefits. Instead, new preclearance operations overseas \nare often paid for by the foreign airport authorities in exchange for \nthe opportunity to offer passengers an improved travel experience \nreturning home.\n  Think of it, I say to my colleagues. When we come back from a long \noverseas flight and then we see that long line to go through Customs \nand immigration, wouldn't we rather do that on the front end of the \nflight when we are fresher and before that long flight\n\n[[Page S858]]\n\nhome? This is advantageous for our foreign visitors, as well as \nincreasing our security.\n  The conference report passed by the Senate today thus represents an \nimportant step forward in strengthening our security. It will help to \nstrengthen the security of travel to the United States. It does not \nrepresent our entire bill.\n  The Cantwell-Collins bill also has enhanced information sharing \nbetween the United States and Europe regarding the identities of \nsuspected terrorists. If our intelligence community can provide more \ninformation to European border authorities and they can use it in the \nscreening of the more than 1 million migrants that are arriving in \nEurope, we simultaneously improve the security of Europe and of the \nUnited States.\n  The continued threat posed to aviation from terrorist groups like Al \nQaeda, like ISIS, and so many others demands that we take immediate \nsteps to improve our security, keeping our borders and our aviation \nindustry safe but, most of all, keeping the American people safe. \nToday's vote on the Customs bill conference report is a significant \nstep in the right direction.\n  I want to acknowledge the work of the Committee on Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs, which is headed by our colleague Senator Ron \nJohnson, as well as the Department of Homeland Security, headed by \nSecretary Jeh Johnson. Both of them have also worked hard on the \npreclearance issue.\n  I hope that our colleagues will join Senator Cantwell and me as we \ncontinue the work we have been doing for the past 5 years on this \nissue. It is so important. As border State Senators, I think we are \nparticularly sensitive to the fact that we want tourists, we want \ntrade, we want people to come into this country, but we do not want lax \nborder security to allow those who would do us harm to be able to enter \nthis country.\n  Let me end where I began. Our goal is to keep our enemies out and \ninvite our friends in when it comes to travel. I want to commend \nSenator Cantwell for her longstanding leadership on this issue. It has \nbeen a pleasure to work with her.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/senate-section/article/S858-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S858-S859]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           WASTEFUL SPENDING\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, this week the President unveiled his budget \nfor fiscal year 2017, and it landed here in the Senate with a big thud.\n  This is not the first time that has happened. In fact, when the \nPresident's budget has been brought up for a vote by the 100 Members of \nthe Senate, it has never received more than 1 vote. Both Democrats and \nRepublicans have roundly rejected the President's proposals. Why? \nOverspending and overtaxation, driving us ever deeper into debt--nobody \nwants to put their name to that. Yet that is the situation we are in. \nWe are in that situation because of the irresponsible policies that \nhave been laid upon the American people and put into law by this \nPresident and by those who have supported him.\n  Despite numerous efforts over the past several years to address this \never-growing threat to our future, all of these efforts--some of them \nbipartisan, even--have been rejected by the President. They have failed \ndue to the President's unwillingness to work with the Congress and to \nput us on a path to fiscal solvency.\n  Now, I have been a part of that effort now for the last 5 years. All \nof us throw our hands up in frustration as we watch the debt clock \nclick away ever faster, as we watch the debt rising ever greater.\n  When the President took office, our national debt--the money we had \nto pay back--was $10.6 trillion. It is almost impossible to describe \nwhat $1 trillion is. Trust me; it is a lot of money. It was $10.6 \ntrillion. Today, it is over $19 trillion--nearly double--just in the \nterm of this President. And what have we done about it? Nothing. Some \nwill say a little bit. We have touched on it a little bit, but it \ncontinues to rise.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan organization that just \ndoes the numbers, has told us that in 10 years the debt will rise to \nwell over $27 trillion. The shocker is the amount of money that has to \nbe spent in paying interest on the debt. Nobody is giving us this money \nfor free. We have to pay interest on it because people want interest, \nand they want their principal back. The interest on that, plus the \nmandatory spending--that is, automatic spending over which we have no \ncontrol here unless we put reforms in place--will consume 99 percent of \nall the taxes and revenue that is coming in to pay for these programs. \nSo that means we won't be building any roads; we won't be repairing any \nroads. That means we won't be providing research capabilities to the \nNational Institutes of Health or the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention. That means we won't have money for viable programs in the \nfields of education, commerce, and transportation. Ninety-nine percent \nis all revenue consumed by just these two items: the mandatory \nspending--which we have lost control over and refuse to take reform \nactions to address--and the interest that has to be paid.\n  Well, this is unsustainable. It will all come down with a crash. That \nis why the President's budget this year will be soundly rejected and \nwill only receive one vote, if it gets that.\n  I am not giving up. I am looking at the major reforms that are \nnecessary, even if we start today, even in an election year. I \npersonally think the public is way ahead of us on this, and they will \nreward people who stand up and tell them the truth: Folks, we are going \nbroke, and here are the numbers. This isn't political; these are pure \nnumbers that come out of a neutral office. Nevertheless, we will see \nwhether or not those who are running for office will take up the cause.\n  So I thought: Well, OK, we can't do the big stuff. Can we at least \nlook at waste, fraud, and abuse? Can we not at least encourage my \ncolleagues to take things that have been presented to us--examples of \nwaste, fraud, and abuse by inspectors general, by the Congressional \nBudget Office, by the Government Accountability Office that looks into \nall the ways in which we spend money--can't we at least do that? So for \nthe last 33 weeks, starting in the last session and moving into this \nsession, I have been coming to the floor every week to highlight yet \nanother documented example of waste, fraud, and abuse. This is the 33rd \ntime.\n  Today, this one involves the sum of $25 billion that has not been \nproperly accounted for by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, \nwhich is part of the Department of Health and Human Services. I spoke \nwith the Secretary this morning about it. There are 25 recommendations \nas to how the Department can address this matter, and she is committed \nto that. I know she has the right intent, and we will see if it can be \naccomplished.\n  In this particular case private sector contractors partner with the \nCMS, or the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, to provide any \nnumber of products and services to beneficiaries--those on Medicaid and \nMedicare. Federal agencies that administer the contracts are required \nto track the contracts' progress and costs and then close out these \naccounts once the contracts are finalized. There comes the rub. The \nregulations give a grace period of up to 20 months in order to close \nout a contract--to get everything closed down and so forth on these \ncontracts. There is a handful of extensions where maybe it takes a \nlittle bit longer to do that. The timeframe or the grace period is \nintended to prevent improper payments and reduce the agency's financial \nrisk and then close it out.\n  The inspector general looked at all this and said: Great idea, good \nregulation--but it is not happening. In December the Health and Human \nServices inspector general issued a report of the investigation into \nthese terminated contracts. There are over 6,000 contracts that have \nbeen completed, but $25 billion in funding is overdue--meaning that the \naccounts haven't been closed, which makes CMS vulnerable to improper \npayments.\n  Sadly, 15 percent of the completed contracts remained overdue for \nmore\n\n[[Page S859]]\n\nthan 10 years, even though the regulation states they have to be closed \nout within 20 months. It shows the ineptness of this bureaucracy. It \nshows the incompetence of this bureaucracy, the inability of this \nbureaucracy to manage taxpayers' money in an effective way, to perform \nfunctions in an effective and efficient way. It is shocking. It is \nshocking to have the inspector general come along and find that there \nare thousands of contracts that have been completed for years--some \nover 10 years--and they are still open. The cost of that is $25 \nbillion. Even worse, the system that CMS has in place to monitor the \ncontracts hasn't been accessible to the bureau within HHS responsible \nfor closing the contracts. It is just a complicated mess.\n  Once again, we have situations totaling about $25 billion that could \neither be used for more necessary functions, returned to the taxpayer \nor not taken from the taxpayer in the first place. The bottom line is \nthat these have been identified and action needs to be taken.\n  This Senator continues to add to an ever-growing amount of waste, \nfraud, and abuse totaling, since we have started, a grand total \napproaching $156 billion.\n  Having exposed this, the first thing we ought to be doing before we \nbegin talking about raising taxes, before talking about a program \nstaying in place or not staying in place is going after the waste, \nfraud, and abuse and stopping this outrageous waste of money that is \noccurring.\n  The next time we are back in session, I will be back down here with \nmore. They just keep pouring in. We keep finding these documents, \nfinding this and that. It is unbelievable that we have put ourselves in \nthis situation and the ineffectiveness is out of control. It is no \nwonder the public no longer trusts us. If we can't get to this, how can \nwe ever get to the reforms necessary to stop us from becoming \ninsolvent?\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/senate-section/article/S859-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S859-S860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        EVERY CHILD SUCCEEDS ACT\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, last summer, by a vote of 81 to 17, the \nSenate passed a bill to fix No Child Left Behind. The House of \nRepresentatives had already passed their version. We had a conference \nreport. We sent it to the President, and it was in December that \nPresident Obama signed the Every Student Succeed Acts to fix No Child \nLeft Behind. The President not only signed it in a large ceremony \nattended by parents, teachers, students, Governors, and people from all \nwalks of life, the President said it was a ``Christmas miracle.'' I \nthink he said that for a couple of reasons. One, it was good news. \nMiracles are usually good news, and this was good news for 50 million \nchildren, 3.5 million teachers, and 100,000 public schools. They had \nwaited 8 years for the U.S. Congress to fix the problems with No Child \nLeft Behind. They knew it was difficult to do, and they looked forward \nto the result that we achieved because we achieved a consensus. There \nsurely was a consensus if this was a law that everybody wanted fixed, \nbut we also had a consensus about how to fix it.\n  People who don't usually agree in the education world said: We want \nto keep the tests. We want to keep the 17 federally required, State-\ndesigned tests between grades 3 and 12 so we can know how our children \nare doing, and we want to report that to the parents and the students, \nbut we want to move the responsibility for our children and our schools \nout of Washington and back to the classroom teachers, back to the local \nschool boards, back to the communities, and back to the Governors.\n  We heard that from the left, and we heard that from the right. We \nheard that from the Governors, and we heard that from the teachers \nunions. Because we all had that consensus, we were able to secure a \nvote of 81 to 17 here, and, as I often said last year, that is not that \neasy to do. Everyone is an expert on education. We have all had some \neducation. It is like being in the Louisiana State University football \nstadium or the University of Tennessee football stadium. The stands are \nfilled with 80,000 or 100,000 people who know exactly what the next \nplay to call is because they have all played a little football and they \nare usually ready to say what it is. So that is what we had to \nnavigate, but we did. As the President said, it was a Christmas miracle \nand a gift for the children, the teachers, and the parents who care \nabout our public schools.\n  The reason I am on the floor today is to put into the Congressional \nRecord a letter to the Acting Secretary of the U.S. Department of \nEducation, John B. King, Jr. The letter is from a number of those in \nthe coalition of educators and others who helped to pass the Every \nStudent Succeeds Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter I am referring to at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  This is a letter from people who don't always work together. In fact, \nin their letter to the Acting Secretary of Education they say: ``Mr. \nKing, although our organizations do not always agree, we are unified in \nour belief that ESSA is a historic opportunity to make a world-class \n21st century education system. We are dedicated to working together at \nthe national level to facilitate partnership among our members in \nStates and districts to guarantee the success of this new law.''\n  This letter comes from the National Governors Association, the School \nSuperintendents Association, the National Education Association, and \nthe American Federation of Teachers who all signed this letter. So did \nthe National Conference of State Legislators, the National Association \nof State Boards of Education, the National School Boards Association, \nthe National Association of Elementary School Principals, the National \nAssociation of Secondary School Principals, and the National Parent \nTeacher Association. I have racked my brain, and I can't think of any \nsignificant group in the State or local education world that hasn't \nsigned this letter, except the Council of Chief State School Officers. \nI have no idea why they have not yet signed it because they were \nenthusiastically in support of our bill as well, so I hope they are \nalso part of our coalition.\n  But here is the importance of this coalition. The coalition that sent \nthis letter is the same coalition that supported passage of the bill. \nThey know what I know and what Senator Murray of Washington State \nknows--who was the principal Democratic architect of the bill--that \nbill isn't worth the paper it is printed on unless it is implemented \nproperly.\n  This bill makes a dramatic shift in policy for elementary and \nsecondary education. The Wall Street Journal called it the largest \ndevolution of power from Washington to the States in a quarter of a \ncentury. They are right about that. Both the left and the right had \ngrown tired of a national school board in Washington, in effect, \ntelling teachers and school boards and Governors and legislators what \nto do about their children and what to do about their schools. Those \ndecisions are best made by those closest to the children. We don't get \nany wiser by flying from Nashville to Washington each week. In fact, \nthere are a lot of people back in Nashville who think we lose a little \nbit of our common sense when we come here. So this is important. This \nis what we usually don't see from Washington--taking large amounts of \npower and sending it back home where it belongs. That is what all of \nthese organizations say about the new law. Their letter says:\n\n       ESSA replaces a top-down accountability and testing regime \n     with an inclusive system based on collaborative State and \n     local innovation. For this vision to become a reality, we \n     must work together to closely honor congressional intent. \n     ESSA is clear: Education decision-making now rests with \n     states and districts, and the federal role is to support and \n     inform those decisions.\n\n  Let me read that again:\n\n       Education decision-making now rests with states and \n     districts, and the federal role is to support and inform \n     those decisions.\n\n  That is what the Governors say. That is what the National Education \nAssociation says. That is what the American Federation of Teachers \nsays. That\n\n[[Page S860]]\n\nis what the superintendents, the legislators, the State boards of \neducation, the school boards, the principals, and the PTA say. And that \nis what the Senate said, that we are moving power out of Washington and \nback to the classroom, back to the community, back to the State. Our \nnext year is going to be devoted to making sure that gets done. Our \ncommittee--of which the distinguished Senator from Louisiana is a \nmember--will be having six hearings this year with the Department of \nEducation and with many of the people whom I just mentioned to make \nsure the law is being implemented in the way Congress wrote it. The \nHouse of Representatives will do the same thing. Our objectives will be \nthe same that are in this letter--working together to ensure a timely, \nfair transition to the new law; coordinate with Governors, State \nrepresentatives, et cetera; promote State and local decision-making--in \nother words, make sure that what happens is what Congress said should \nhappen.\n  I thank the National Governors Association especially, which took the \nlead in organizing this coalition. I thank each member of the coalition \nfor organizing this coalition. I will be visiting with the Governors in \na week, and I will be suggesting to the Governors--after I thank them \nfor their support for the bill--that every single State organize a \ncoalition just like the coalition represented in this letter.\n  In Tennessee, I think it would be a good idea if the Governor and the \nsuperintendent work together with the NEA, the AFT, the legislators, \nthe State board of education, the school boards, the principals, and \nthe PTA to make sure that in Tennessee, the responsibility for the \nchildren, the schools, the standards, and the progress is in the hands \nof those in whom we decided it ought to be vested. And we, at our level \nin Congress, will keep the spotlight on what is happening here.\n  There was not a piece of legislation more important that passed in \nthe Congress last year. We got a lot of good things done in the last \nyear, but nothing was more important than this, nothing was more \ndifficult than this.\n  I have already mentioned Senator Murray, the Senator from Washington \nState, who was superb in working with both sides of the aisle to help \nget a result that had evaded the Senate for 8 years. I welcome the \nsupport of this coalition for the very same work we will be doing in \nthe Senate. I hope every State will follow the example of these \nnational organizations.\n  I look forward to a period of innovation and excellence that I am \nsure will be the result of this new era of accountability, \nresponsibility, and opportunity placed in the hands of those who should \nhave the responsibility for our children and our schools.\n  I thank the president, and I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                February 10, 2016.\n     John B. King, Jr.,\n     Acting Secretary, U.S. Department of Education, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Acting Secretary King: On behalf of states, school \n     districts, educators and parents, we write to express our \n     strong, shared commitment to making the Every Student \n     Succeeds Act (ESSA) a law that puts students first. We invite \n     you to work with us to ensure that communities determine the \n     best methods of educating our nation's children.\n       Although our organizations do not always agree, we are \n     unified in our belief that ESSA is a historic opportunity to \n     make a world-class 21 century education system. We are \n     dedicated to working together at the national level to \n     facilitate partnership among our members in states and \n     districts to guarantee the success of this new law.\n       ESSA replaces a top-down accountability and testing regime \n     with an inclusive system based on collaborative state and \n     local innovation. For this vision to become a reality, we \n     must work together to closely honor congressional intent. \n     ESSA is clear: Education decision making now rests with \n     states and districts, and the federal role is to support and \n     inform those decisions.\n       In the coming months, our coalition--the State and Local \n     ESSA Implementation Network--will: Work together to ensure a \n     timely, fair transition to ES SA; Coordinate ESSA \n     implementation by governors, state superintendents, school \n     boards, state legislators, local superintendents, educators \n     and parents; Promote state, local and school decision-making \n     during implementation; and Collaborate with a broader group \n     of education stakeholders to provide guidance to the federal \n     government on key implementation issues.\n       In ESSA, Congress recognizes states and schools as well-\n     suited to provide a high-quality education to every child, \n     regardless of their background. We have long prioritized \n     lifting up those students who need help the most and our \n     members stand ready to continue this work.\n       Our organizations look forward to a cooperative, \n     collaborative and productive relationship with you and your \n     staff throughout the implementation process.\n           Sincerely,\n         Scott D.

Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes to thank our \nstaff who did so much to address what I call the need for a fresh trade \npolicy, for trade done right through the course of this year. Our staff \nand Senator Hatch's staff have put an enormous amount of sweat equity \ninto this process. I would like to thank some of these terrific and \ndedicated individuals here this afternoon so that all of the Senate \nwill get a sense of what they did.\n  Over the course of the last year and a half, with the support of \nChairman Hatch, we were able to successfully conclude negotiations to \nintroduce four major trade bills: the trade promotion authority \nlegislation; the trade adjustment assistance legislation; the bill that \npassed overwhelmingly today, the Facilitation and Trade Enforcement \nAct; and the trade preference program renewal and enhancement program. \nThese staff leaders helped manage those bills in the Finance Committee, \non the Senate floor, completed conference committee negotiations, and \nalong the way, they did some awfully good work in terms of assembling a \nbipartisan coalition for this legislation.\n  In my view, the last year has arguably been the most productive in \nterms of trade policy in decades. In my view, these accomplishments are \ngoing to make an enormous difference for American workers, American \ninnovators, and our country's ability to compete in these tough global \nmarkets, and the stakes are just enormous. There are going to be 1 \nbillion middle-class people in the developing world in 2025. Frankly, \nthey are just crazy about America's goods and services. They like so \nmuch what we make, grow, and produce--whether it is airplanes, \ntransportation equipment or our wonderful wine and cheese, our fruit, \nbicycles. The list just goes on and on.\n  I am going to be home this weekend for townhall meetings in rural \nOregon. I often say that one out of five jobs in Oregon depends on \ninternational trade. Trade jobs often pay better than do nontrade jobs. \nIf anybody is interested in a modern economic theory, I say we ought to \ndo more to grow things here, to make things here, to add value to them \nhere, and then ship them somewhere. With those trade-related jobs \npaying better, that ought to be a strategy that would win bipartisan \nsupport.\n  This work doesn't happen by osmosis. It happens because we have a \nterrific team of people behind these efforts. I would like to recognize \nthe members of that team who have done so much to make this year \nsuccessful.\n  Greta Peisch is our counsel. She put together the Customs components \nof the trade enforcement package. Her patience and her ability to work \nwith staff, with industry, with all kinds of organizations--leaders \nrepresenting workers, consumers--Greta Peisch creatively worked to try \nto address all concerns as responsibly as possible and what an \nimpressive job Ms. Peisch has done.\n  Elissa Alben has done an extraordinary job in influencing the shape \nof\n\n[[Page S861]]\n\nthe final Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. She put in an awful lot \nof important and valuable exercises in negotiating TPA. Of course, \nthese are the rules under which we conduct trade policy, and in my view \nshe did superb work with the TPA amendments in the trade enforcement \npackage.\n  Andy Heiman is our resident innovation adviser. His contributions \nhave been crucial on Internet tax policy, on the Trade Adjustment \nAssistance Act, trade preference, creating a new program for Nepal--an \narea where Senator Feinstein has done an awful lot of good work--or \nimproving the African Growth and Opportunity Act. Of course, that \nlegislation involves several of our colleagues--Senator Isakson, \nSenator Coons, and others--who did very important work on those bills.\n  Jayme White is with me on the floor. He is our team leader. It would \nbe hard to overstate the excellent work Mr. White has done. Over the \nlast 2 years, his ideas, his patience, his leadership, and his ability \nto get a sense of where we needed to go for the future have been very \nvaluable. My view is we couldn't have had these exceptional \naccomplishments in this Congress on the trade issue without Mr. White.\n  Now, he is not here on the floor, but I want to say a word about Jeff \nMichels, our chief of staff. Jeff has been with me since I came to the \nSenate. I think it would be fair to say there is not a person in the \nNation's Capitol who better understands the intersection, particularly \non technology and innovation, between policy and politics. We would \nspend the entire afternoon if we were to talk about the good work Jeff \nMichels has done on these issues, but in particular, on the Internet \ntax freedom bill, Jeff Michels was there during those first days in \n1998. Our former colleague from the other body, Chris Cox, was the \nsponsor on the Republican side of the aisle. I was the sponsor of the \nlegislation in the Senate. I had pretty much just arrived in the \nSenate. We were struck by the idea that somebody might be trying to tax \nInternet access. If you tax Internet access, you are doing something \nthat is extraordinarily regressive. What it means--for example, in the \nState of Louisiana--if somebody were to try to do this in one of our \nStates that doesn't already have some kind of grandfathered \narrangement, taxing Internet access means that you have new regressive \ntaxes in America--taxes that are especially punitive to working \nfamilies, families who are trying to use the Internet to find out about \neducational opportunities or employment or maybe they are using it to \nlearn more about dealing with matters associated with raising children. \nWe wouldn't have the Internet tax freedom legislation, in my view, \nwithout Jeff Michels.\n  In addition to the problem with the prospect of taxing Internet \naccess, what we found back then is just out and out discrimination. For \nexample, people would buy a paper snail mail and they wouldn't face a \ntax. Then they would buy the online edition of the very same \npublication, and they would face a tax for the online edition. We said: \nThat seems pretty odd, even by Washington, DC standards. Let's ensure \nthat there is, in effect, technological neutrality. So what the \nInternet tax freedom bill is all about is ensuring that there are no \nregressive taxes to hit working families hard on Internet access and \nthat we don't reward discrimination against technology and innovation. \nThat work would not have been possible without Jeff Michels.\n  Importantly, Joshua Sheinkman, who is the Democratic staff director, \nand Mike Evans, our chief counsel, did masterful work in navigating all \nthe pitfalls and landmines of the Finance Committee, the Senate floor, \nand the other body in the Congress. Their leadership and their \nexperience has been essential to our success on trade and all other \npolicy matters before the committee.\n  Before I wrap up, I want to note that none of this happens just \ncoming from one side of the aisle. Chairman Hatch's trade team and \nsenior staff were absolutely essential to the success of the last year \nand today. Specifically, I commend Everett Eissenstat, Douglas \nPeterson, Shane Warren, Andrew Rollow, Jay Khosla, Chris Campbell, the \nstaff director of the Finance Committee, and Mark Prater, whom we have \nalways been very proud of because he is an Oregonian. All of his \nfriends still give me a hard time when we are working out in Southeast \nPortland at the gym. Mark Prater is a truly talented and thoughtful \npublic servant, and we appreciate his leadership.\n  I would also like to thank a couple of others who have been very \nhelpful in the leadership to work with us. Ayesha Khanna on the \nDemocratic leader's staff and Brendan Dunn have been very helpful in \nterms of working closely with our team.\n  Finally, there are a couple of alums. These issues have gone on so \nlong, I believe the Presiding Officer was probably practicing medicine \nwhen we started some of these battles. A number of alums have also \ncontributed significantly to the work that was completed today.\n  Hun Quach and Ayesha Khanna started working on Customs legislation \nwhat seems like eons ago under Chairman Baucus, and Alan Treat helped \nlay the groundwork for the ENFORCE Act. The ENFORCE Act is really \nlandmark legislation--landmark legislation that Alan Treat helped lay \nthe groundwork for.\n  What we found when we set up a sting operation that demonstrated this \nis that trade cheats all over the world were basically laundering \nmerchandise. They would get caught violating the trade laws in one \njurisdiction, and they would just move to another, slap a label on the \nbox, and off they would go. Alan Treat helped lay the groundwork to get \nthe ENFORCE Act, which I think is going to be a landmark in our ability \nto get tough with the trade cheats and those who rip off American jobs.\n  So good policy doesn't just get created out of the ether, and it \ndoesn't get advanced unless you have dedicated staff on both sides of \nthe aisle. It doesn't happen just because a Senator has an election \ncertificate. So I wanted to take just a few minutes this afternoon to \nmake sure that the Senate understood that there were very capable staff \non both sides of the aisle who gave up nights and weekends, family \ntime, and a lot of opportunities they could have had to catch a movie \nor a game or go for a jog. It has led us to be able to introduce four \nmajor trade bills. So I thank them. They don't get thanked enough. They \nprobably deserve a lot more praise than I have given them this \nafternoon, but at least what they have heard from me today is a start.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/senate-section/article/S861-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S861-S862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRADE FACILITATION AND TRADE ENFORCEMENT BILL\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I stand before the Senate to talk about \nlegislation that was marked up today in committee that deals with the \nopiate addiction crisis we have in this country.\n  Before I do that, and while my colleague is still on the floor, let \nme congratulate him and Senator Hatch, who is on the floor, for the \nlegislation that was passed today that will now go to the President \nwith regard to trade--and two provisions in particular: one that \nSenator Wyden just talked about, which has to do with ensuring that \nwhen you get an order against an unfairly traded import from a country \nbecause it is dumped or because it is subsidized, that you can't just \ntake that product and shift it to another location to evade the Customs \nduties. That is called the ENFORCE Act. It is going to make a huge \ndifference. I introduced it with him originally, and it is legislation \nthat will help Ohio steelworkers and steel companies in particular, but \nit helps everybody who goes through the long process--which is a little \nbetter, now thanks to the Level the Playing Field Act--to get an order \nagainst a product that is not being sold here fairly, to ensure that \nsome country doesn't just move it to another jurisdiction. I thank \nSenator Wyden for his hard work on that issue and ensuring that we can \nhave a more level playing field. If it is level, we can compete and \nwin, but when it is not level, it is impossible for our workers, our \nfarmers, our service providers to be able to get a fair shake. So I \nthank the Senator from Oregon for that.\n  The other is the BDS legislation, which didn't get as much play on \nthe\n\n[[Page S862]]\n\nfloor today because there were so many other things in this \nlegislation, but there are countries that have boycotts that divest \nfrom and put sanctions on Israel in an effort to delegitimize Israel. \nIn this legislation, it provides that if countries want to do business \nwith us and do trade with us, they cannot put in place these \ndiscriminatory policies as to Israel. I thank the chairman and ranking \nmember for that as well. This is very important legislation for us to \nbe able to ensure that we can continue to stand by our friends in \nIsrael so they are not treated unfairly, but rather, where trade is \ninvolved, we can use our leverage to ensure that they can be able to be \ntreated with the respect that other countries have around the world.\n  So those are two parts of the bill that I think are extremely \nimportant. I thank Senator Wyden and Senator Hatch, who was on the \nfloor a moment ago, for their hard work on that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/senate-section/article/S862-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S862-S863]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                COMPREHENSIVE ADDICTION AND RECOVERY ACT\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I now turn to the issue of opiate \naddiction.\n  I thank my colleagues again on the Judiciary Committee for reporting \non legislation today, on a bipartisan basis--in fact, there wasn't a \nsingle ``no'' vote. It was reported out on a voice vote. Everybody in \ncommittee agreed to it. That doesn't happen very often. The reason it \nhappened this way is that the legislation before the committee called \nCARA--the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act--is legislation that \nhas been thoughtfully crafted, with Republicans and Democrats alike, \nreally for the past 3 years.\n  We have had five conferences in Washington, DC, to put together the \nexperts from all over the country. Sheldon Whitehouse and I have lead \nthis effort but also with Senator Ayotte, Senator Klobuchar, and \nothers. What we have said is that we want to come up with legislation \nthat will make a difference in our States and around the country to \ndeal with what is sadly a growing crisis of people who are abusing \nprescription drugs, heroin, and this addiction problem is leading to \nnot just a lot more people becoming addicted but people actually \noverdosing and dying.\n  In Ohio we lost over 2,400 fellow Ohioans last year to overdose \ndeaths. It is now the No. 1 cause of death in America, accidental \ndeaths in America. Now more people are dying from overdoses than they \nare from car accidents. So this is an issue that affects every single \none of us. It has no ZIP Code. It is in our rural areas, it is in our \nsuburban areas, and it is in the inner city. It is something that \naffects so many families.\n  When I am back home talking about this, it is hard for me to find a \ngroup I am meeting with that doesn't bring this up. Most recently I was \nin Ohio this past week talking with women who had been trafficked. They \nalso were women who were given drugs and became addicted, and that \ndependency led to the kind of sex trafficking that they were involved \nwith and their sense of being coerced and being compelled because of \nthis drug addiction issue. They are now trying to work through that \nissue, God bless them. They are back with their families. They are back \ngetting their lives back on track, but as they told me, Rob, going \nthrough this issue of the addiction and the treatment and the recovery \nis hard work because the grip of addiction from opioids--meaning \nprescription drugs and heroin--is very difficult to address.\n  That is why our legislation is so important, because it provides to \nState governments, to local governments, to nonprofits the tools they \nneed to be able to have better treatment and better recovery programs, \nlonger term recovery, but it also focuses on prevention and education \nto try to keep people out of the funnel of addiction. It also helps our \nlaw enforcement personnel. It gives them the ability to save lives \nthrough Narcan and naloxone, which is the drug that is a miracle drug \nto be applied when someone has an overdose. It is saving lives right \nand left in my State of Ohio and around the country.\n  Finally, our legislation helps to get the prescription drugs off of \nthe bathroom shelves, to ensure that these prescription drugs which \nhave been overprescribed over the years--there are too many \nprescription drugs out there--aren't going to be taken by somebody, \noften young people who get them, it gets them involved in this \naddiction issue, and then often they turn to heroin as a less expensive \nand more accessible alternative. Our legislation does that, and it also \nprovides for a monitoring program for the prescription drug \nprescribing, so we know who is getting prescribed what, including \nacross State lines, which is why it is very important to have Federal \nlegislation in this regard. Until we get at this issue of prescription \ndrugs, it is very hard to stop what is a growing crisis in our \ncommunities.\n  Can we turn the tide? Yes. I am absolutely convinced we can because I \nhave seen the treatment programs that work. I have seen the prevention \nand education programs that work. I started my own anti-drug coalition \nin my hometown of Cincinnati, OH, about 22 years ago. Using proven \ntechniques, we can make a difference and we have made a difference \nthere. Unfortunately, most communities don't have that kind of a \ncoalition, that kind of effort.\n  Our legislation will help to provide that. In treatment, most \nAmericans who are suffering from addiction do not have access to \ntreatment. This will provide more needed resources, not just money but \nalso being sure that the money is going to evidence-based treatment and \nrecovery that works, that has been proven to work, so we are not just \nthrowing money at a problem, but we are setting up a framework for \nsuccess.\n  The legislation is supported by many groups because it has been \ncarefully crafted. It has been bipartisan or I would say nonpartisan. \nOver 120 groups have come in from around the country to support this \nlegislation. Today I am happy to report that we have a new endorsement, \nand this one comes from the National Fraternal Order of Police. The FOP \nendorsed our legislation today, which is a tremendous boost to us.\n  Law enforcement around the country has been supportive. The doctors \nhave been supportive. The nurses, first responders, those in recovery \nthemselves, and of course experts from around the country who are \ninvolved in providing treatment and providing the prevention that is \nscience-based, evidence-based know that if they have more support from \nthe Federal Government, they can do more. They can leverage that at the \nlocal level to make a difference in our communities.\n  I am glad to hear that this legislation got reported out with such \nbroad bipartisan support today and that everyone said this is good \nlegislation and we need to move it forward because the next step is to \nget it to the floor of the Senate and to get it passed on the Senate \nfloor and then get it over to the House where there is a companion \nbill. In other words, there are Democrats and Republicans working \ntogether in the House as well on this issue, understanding the urgency \nof addressing this crisis. They are ready go. If we send them the \nlegislation, I believe that legislation can end up on the President's \ndesk in short order, and we can begin to turn things around and change \nwhat is unfortunately a growing problem. It is a spreading problem. We \ncan begin to reverse it, and through prevention and education keep \npeople, particularly young people, from making bad choices and going \ndown this route.\n  I have gone across the State holding roundtables on this over the \nyear, but in the last month alone, I have met in Columbus, OH, Marion, \nOH, and in Cleveland, OH, with people who are directly affected. In \nCleveland I toured the Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital. This is \none of the great children's hospitals in America. There they have lots \nof specialists, particularly an issue that sadly is one that is \naffecting more and more of our hospitals; that is, drug-dependent \nbabies. These are babies who are drug-addicted when they are born \nbecause their mothers used.\n  These are consequences of this addiction problem we talked about. \nThey take these babies through withdrawal. These are babies, many of \nwhom are born prematurely and can almost fit in the palm of your hand. \nThese babies, God bless them, are getting the help they need to be able \nto withdraw from that addiction.\n  We don't know what the longer term health consequences might be, but \nwe\n\n[[Page S863]]\n\ndo know that many of these babies are now starting their life in a much \nhealthier situation because of this special expertise that is being \nprovided, but these hospitals are telling me this is an increasing \nproblem. Every hospital in America needs to have this expertise now to \ndeal with a situation that is hard to imagine, a baby who is born drug-\naddicted.\n  I also toured a community alternative sentencing center in Claremont, \nOH, to see where a court is taking people who have been arrested for \npossession and instead of throwing them in jail is setting up an \nalternative program where they can get some of the treatment they need \nand get some of the life skills they need to get their life back on \ntrack. It is an intensive program that is working.\n  These are programs that are also supported by our legislation. Our \nlegislation also deals with people who are in prison who have addiction \nproblems, to be able to get them treatment, so when they get out of \nprison they don't fall back into a life of crime to support their \naddiction problem.\n  Most recently I was in Columbus, OH. I met with four women who were \nrecovering addicts who had this addiction foisted upon them as part of \nhuman trafficking, sex trafficking. Their traffickers got them addicted \nto make them dependent. In one case, the woman told me she wasn't paid \nanything. She was just paid in terms of the drugs. Her trafficker kept \nher dependent because of that. These women were in a program where they \nhad been given the opportunity to get into treatment, given the \nopportunity to be able to get their lives back together, but sadly a \nlot of people do not have that opportunity, not having access to \ntreatment. Our legislation will be very important to do that.\n  The bill targets the very issues we know have to be addressed--\nkeeping people away from these substances in the first place. Then, \nonce they are addicted, if they become addicted, get them the treatment \nthey need to begin to turn their lives around. For that longer term \nrecovery, which we think is absolutely essential from the experience \nand the good science that is out there for successful programs, it is \nimportant that we have, in some cases, medication treatment as well \nthat supports that.\n  It also says that we have to help our law enforcement more. I think \nthat is one reason the Fraternal Order of Police, the national \nsheriffs' organizations, and others have supported this legislation \nwith such wonderful statements, as I just talked about earlier, as we \ngot today from the FOP.\n  This is an issue that will continue to be a serious problem in all of \nour communities unless we take these kinds of actions at the Federal \nlevel, the State level, and the local level. We have to work as a team \nwith nonprofits, with people who are in the trenches dealing with this. \nIf we do not, we will continue to see families torn apart. We will \ncontinue to see communities that are devastated, including by the \ncrimes and other consequences of this, and we will continue to see \nAmericans who are not able to fulfill their God-given abilities and \ndestinies because of this drug addiction problem.\n  Today I am told that others who support this legislation would like \nto spend more money in addition to the $80 million that this program \nprovides every year going forward. This is a well-crafted, well-\nthought-out framework of how to spend that money more effectively to be \nable to address the problem. I am for spending more money. If there are \npeople who would like to spend more money on this issue of opiate \naddiction, I am for that. I think it is enough of a crisis that we \nshould be fending more funds on it.\n  I will say something else. Let's get this bill moving. Let's get this \nbill to the floor. Let's get this bill passed. Let's get the House to \npass the companion legislation. Let's get it to the President's desk. \nThis is an urgent problem. We cannot wait. If people are going to offer \nother ideas, including more funding and funding that is an emergency, \nrather than in a way that is paid for, that may make it more difficult \nto move this bill forward because some people in this Chamber will not \nsupport that.\n  We now have a consensus on this bill. Let's not play politics with \nthis bill and stop this bill. Let's move this bill forward. Right now \nwe have on the floor of the Senate an energy bill. It includes energy \nefficiency provisions I have worked on for years. Yet it is being \nstopped by other issues, important issues. Around here we too often \nrefuse to move forward on legislation where there is a consensus, where \nwe know it is the right thing to do, because other issues come up, and \nsometimes it is other issues that are very important issues but ones \nthat end up stopping the legislation and not allowing us to make \nprogress for the people we represent.\n  I do support more funding. I support funding in this legislation. \nOver and above that, I support additional funding. The President's \nbudget has a request for additional funding. I talked about that today \nin a hearing we had. I told the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nI would support some of these programs that have additional funding. \nLet's be sure it is well-spent, as it is in this legislation. Let's be \nsure we are not throwing money at a problem. Let's make sure we are \nmaking a difference in the lives of the people we represent, and let's \nbe sure it doesn't derail this effort to get this legislation passed.\n  We are on a track now. It is bipartisan. It is bicameral. It has the \nPresident's general support. He hasn't specifically said he will \nendorse this bill, but his representatives--including the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services--today were very supportive of the direction \nwe are moving.\n  It was reported out of a committee today in a total bipartisan way. \nIt was unanimous. Again, that doesn't happen often around here. Let's \naddress this issue now. Let's not sit back and play politics. Let's \ntake the politics out of this, as has been the case for the last few \nyears.\n  Sheldon Whitehouse has been my partner in this. Sheldon Whitehouse \nand I don't agree on a lot of issues. He is more liberal. I am more \nconservative on some issues. We agree on this issue because we know the \nway it affects the communities we represent, the families we represent, \nand the people we represent. Let's move forward or this legislation. \nLet's get it to the floor. Let's get a vote. Let's start turning the \ntide. Let's start changing the dynamic on the ground where instead of \nus having this creeping problem of addiction and all of its horrible \nconsequences that we begin to allow people to get their lives back \ntogether, to give them the opportunity to get their families back \ntogether, to be able to achieve the dreams they have for themselves and \ntheir families.\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished Senator from \nOhio on his remarks here today. He is one of the pillars of this \nSenate. He is one of the finest men I have served with in the whole \ntime I have been in the U.S. Senate. He is on top of everything. His \nexperiences outside of the Senate have been magnificent. Everybody, I \nthink, has a very high opinion of him. Those who might express \notherwise, deep down do. They know what a fine man he is. He is \nabsolutely right on this issue. We need to do many things about it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/senate-section/article/S863-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S863-S865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, having said that, during the 2008 \nPresidential campaign, one of the candidates criticized the outgoing \nPresident for adding $4 trillion to the national debt. He called that \nincrease not only irresponsible but even ``unpatriotic.'' Barack Obama \nwas that candidate. He won the election and took office with the \nGovernment Accountability Office warning the long-term fiscal outlook \nis ``unsustainable.''\n  The national debt on inauguration day 2009 was $10.6 trillion, and it \nstands at $19 trillion today. The national debt for American households \nhas risen from $93,000 to nearly $160,000 since President Obama took \noffice.\n  If a $4 trillion increase is irresponsible and unpatriotic, what \nwords describe an increase that is more than twice as large? The \nnational debt crisis has been around for a long time, but we have never \nbeen in a more serious, perilous situation than we are today. One way \nto grasp the magnitude of the national debt is to compare it to the \nsize of the economy, or the gross domestic\n\n[[Page S864]]\n\nproduct. In other words, we can compare what we owe to our ability to \npay.\n  When President Obama took office, the national debt was 82 percent of \nGDP. It is now 105 percent of GDP today, by far the largest increase in \nAmerican history during a President's first 7 years. Economists tell us \nthat the national debt above 90 percent of GDP for a sustained period \nof time will lead to substantially slower economic growth and higher \ninterest rates.\n  The United States is now in the longest period in history with a \nnational debt above that toxic 90-percent level. Not surprisingly, \nsince the recession ended in June 2009, the national debt has grown \nmore than twice as fast, and GDP has grown less than half as fast as \nduring the same period after previous recessions. Some economists \nprefer to evaluate the national debt as a percentage of tax revenue; \nthat is, comparing what we owe to what we earn. The national debt has \nrisen from approximately 350 percent of Federal revenue when President \nObama took office to 600 percent of Federal revenue today. But even \nthat does not tell the whole story.\n  During the last several years of skyrocketing national debt, the \ninterest rate on that debt has been nearly zero. If interest rates had \nbeen at the historical average, annual interest costs would be more \nthan twice what they are today and on their way to consuming more than \nhalf of all Federal revenue. And now interest rates are starting to \ncreep up. The Concord Coalition and the Committee for a Responsible \nFederal Budget both anticipate that over the next decade interest \npayments on the national debt alone will approach $1 trillion per year. \nThat is interest against the national debt. By any of these measures, \nthe national debt crisis is not only serious, it is worse than ever and \nmuch worse than when this President took office.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has a new budget, an economic outlook \nthat projects the national debt rising by nearly $10 trillion over the \nnext decade. Looking beyond the next decade, CBO says that under \ncurrent law, the national debt will explode to more than 150 percent of \nGDP, the highest level in American history. CBO also says that interest \non the national debt is one of the engines driving the debt even \nhigher. A national debt of this magnitude undercuts the economic growth \nnecessary to minimize borrowing to fund the government. Rising interest \ncosts for such a monstrous debt add to the debt on which more interest \nmust then be paid.\n  In this new report, CBO again outlined some of the serious negative \nconsequences of this national debt for the budget and the Nation. In \naddition to substantially higher interest payments, these include lower \nproductivity and wages, less flexibility by lawmakers to respond to \nfiscal challenges, and an increased likelihood of a fiscal crisis. In \naddition to those problems, former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman \nMichael Mullen and experts from the Heritage Foundation to the \nBrookings Institution warned that the national debt crisis is a serious \nthreat to national security. It is no wonder that more than two-thirds \nof Americans say that their concern over the national debt is growing, \nand more than three-quarters of Americans say that the national debt \nshould be among Congress's top three priorities.\n  The national debt was once a top priority. In fact, America's \nFounders were so determined to avoid debt that their commitment to \nfiscal balance was often called our unwritten fiscal constitution. \nPresident George Washington, for example, told Congress that the \nregular redemption of the public debt was the most urgent fiscal \npriority. That commitment is long gone. The Federal budget has been \nbalanced in only a dozen of the last 80 years, and as I said earlier, \nwe are in the longest period of American history with a debt above 90 \npercent of the GDP.\n  As its willpower failed, Congress has also tried to address the debt \ncrisis by legislation. The first bill requiring a balanced budget was \nintroduced in 1934, when the national debt was 40 percent of GDP, \ncompared to today. Fifty years later, Congress enacted the Balanced \nBudget and Emergency Deficit Control Act. Since then, we have enacted \nmultiple budget control acts and budget enforcement acts as the \nnational debt climbed from 42 percent of GDP in 1985 to more than 100 \npercent of GDP today.\n  Good intentions will not balance the Nation's checkbook. Statutes \nthat Congress can change or ignore will not keep our fiscal house in \norder. Neither willpower nor legislation will tackle this national debt \ncrisis. Pretending otherwise is the fiscal equivalent of fiddling while \nRome burns. In no other way, except by an amendment to the \nConstitution, can Congress be compelled to balance its budget in \npeacetime. Let me say that again. In no other way, except by an \namendment to the Constitution, can Congress be compelled to balance its \nbudget in peacetime. While I claim that as my firm conviction, I cannot \nclaim authorship of those words. The Appropriations Committee expressed \nthat principle in 1947 about a balanced budget amendment introduced by \nSenator Millard Tydings, a Democrat from Maryland. Everything that has \nhappened since then has proved the truth of those words.\n  Year after year, decade after decade, we slide deeper in debt until \ntoday our economy is being suffocated. One definition of insanity is \ndoing the same thing but expecting different results. If we keep doing \nwhat we have done, we will get more of what we have been getting. This \nwould be a very different country, a freer and more productive country, \nif Congress had already proposed the only solution that exists--a \nconstitutional amendment that requires fiscal responsibility. The first \nbalanced budget amendment was introduced in the House in 1936.\n  I introduced my first balanced budget amendment in June of 1979 \nduring my first term in the U.S. Senate. Adjusted for inflation, the \nnational debt then was $2.6 trillion, or 32 percent of GDP. That share \nof GDP doubled by 1997, when the Senate came within one vote--one \nsolitary vote--of passing a balanced budget amendment that I \nintroduced. It rose to 95 percent when the Senate last voted on a \nbalanced budget amendment in 2011 and is 105 percent of GDP today.\n  Since this crisis is already so grave and getting worse, and since \nthe only way to tackle it is through the Constitution, we should \npropose a balanced budget amendment and let the American people decide \nto take this step. Congress, after all, cannot amend the Constitution. \nA requirement that Congress keep its fiscal house in order does not \nbecome part of the Constitution until it is approved by three-quarters \nof the States, or 38 States.\n  Article V of the Constitution also allows the States to apply for a \nconvention to propose constitutional amendments. Concerned citizens \nhave been working since the mid-1970s to reach the two-thirds threshold \nfor calling such a convention to propose a balanced budget amendment. \nSince Congress has never called an article V convention, many questions \nremain unresolved, and theories remain untested regarding that method \nof proposing an amendment. I can assure my colleagues, however, that \nCongress's continued failure to propose a balanced budget amendment \nguarantees that our fellow citizens will continue working to force that \ncourse upon us.\n  I looked at dozens of polls conducted by major polling firms and \nnational news organizations since I was first elected to the Senate. \nThree-quarters of Americans supported a balanced budget amendment in \n1976, and three-quarters support it now. They believe even more \nstrongly today what the Appropriations Committee said in 1947--that in \nno other way, except by a constitutional amendment, can Congress be \ncompelled to balance its budget in peacetime. It will do no good to \npretend that the national debt is not a fiscal Tsunami. It is. It will \ndo no good to pretend that this ocean of debt is not already taking a \nserious toll on our country. It is. It will do no good to repeat the \nmantra that Congress can tackle the national debt crisis by itself. No \none believes that anymore--not anyone. That emperor has no clothes. \nPerhaps some of my colleagues believe that all the polls over the last \n40 years are wrong, that the American people are content watching the \nnational debt swallow the economy.\n  Perhaps our fellow citizens are actually OK with slower economic \ngrowth, a rising threat to national security, the greater likelihood of \na fiscal crisis, and an unsustainable path to fiscal disaster. If that \nis what the American\n\n[[Page S865]]\n\npeople actually believe, then they will decline to ratify a balanced \nbudget amendment. So why not give it a chance?\n  Perhaps some of my colleagues believe that the Congressional Budget \nOffice is wrong in its disturbing projections and dire warnings or that \nthe Government Accountability Office is mistaken and the fiscal path we \nare on is sustainable after all or that the Concord Coalition and the \nCommittee for a Responsible Federal Budget are wrong about how national \ndebt interest payments will continue to grow and add to the debt or \nthat economists are wrong to warn about the impact of a sustained \nnational debt of this magnitude. If my colleagues are convinced that \neveryone else is wrong and that our fiscal future is just fine and \nhunky-dory after all, then I still urge them to let the American \ndecide. The Constitution belongs to the American people--not to the \npeople here, although we are part of the American people.\n  President Obama once said that a $4 trillion increase in the national \ndebt is irresponsible and unpatriotic. This week he submitted a budget \nfor fiscal year 2017 that reflects the same recycled misguided policies \nthat have both added to the debt and have failed in Congress. On all of \nthe budgets he submitted, there was only one vote for his budget. There \nwas a bipartisan rejection in each case.\n  President Obama wants to expand a broken Medicaid system rather than \nreform it. He wants to impose higher taxes to prop up more government \nspending. He continues to turn a blind eye to the Nation's \nunsustainable entitlement programs that are propelling the national \ndebt to unprecedented levels.\n  We all know the facts and the dangers about the national debt crisis. \nWe all know that the American people are, if anything, more alarmed \nabout this crisis than we are--certainly with the exception of myself. \nThe only reason that Members of Congress have refused to give our \nfellow citizens a choice about adding a balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution is that they know what that choice will be. I say with \nrespect, but as strongly as I can, that this is not a legitimate basis \nfor refusing to propose a balanced budget amendment. In our system of \ngovernment, as Founder James Wilson once put it, the people are the \nmasters of government. Only they have authority to set the rules for \ngovernment. This choice must be theirs, not ours.\n  Here is the heart of the matter. First, the national debt crisis \nposes a significant and growing threat to the economic and national \nsecurity of this country. In fact, we have never been in such an \nextended, perilous period than we are right now. Second, Congress has \ntried and failed to address this crisis by either willpower or \nlegislation and will do so only if the Constitution requires it. Third, \nthe decision of whether to use the Constitution to require fiscal \nresponsibility belongs to the American people, not to Congress. A \nbalanced budget amendment would allow the American people to make that \nchoice.\n  What are we afraid of? Are we afraid that we can't keep going on \nspending like this or that the American people might pass a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution? Yes, I think we are afraid of \nthat, but we shouldn't be. We should be glad to have it in the \nConstitution itself. We could either take the responsibility we were \nelected for and propose a balanced budget amendment or the American \npeople may do it for us.\n  The key to me is to pass a balanced budget constitutional amendment. \nI filed it, and it has a great number. It was filed right after we got \ninto the Congress. It is an amendment that literally every one of us \nshould support.\n\n  Let's get real about this national debt. Let's get real about helping \nour American people survive. Let's get real about having the greatest \nNation on Earth continue to fight for liberty and freedom and \nindependence and religious rights all over the world and all over this \ncountry. Let's get real about the future of our young people. Let's get \nreal about being in the U.S. Senate and having an opportunity to form a \nreal, solid approach to this, which would make all the difference in \nthe world.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Of course, my focus has been on the \nSwedish and Norwegian Ambassadors from our country to those two \ncountries. We have now gone for 867 days without a confirmed ambassador \nto Norway and 476 days since the President nominated an ambassador for \nSweden.\n  I think we have made it very clear that nearly every Member in this \nChamber does not have an issue with having a vote or even an issue with \nthe qualifications of these nominees who went through the Foreign \nRelations Committee without objection. Senator Cotton himself said: I \nbelieve both nominees are qualified. We have significant interest in \nScandinavia. My hope is that both nominees receive a vote in the Senate \nsooner rather than later.\n  As we know, Senator Cruz has had various issues not related to the \nnominees or our two strong allies, Norway and Sweden.

Every other major Nation has \nan ambassador.\n  I wish to thank Senator McConnell and Senator Reid and Senator Corker \nand Senator Cardin for their work on this issue.

Mr. President, as I mentioned, I rise today to discuss \nU.S. policy toward Iran--an issue that is critical to our national \nsecurity and the security of our allies. When we talk about our policy \ntoward Iran, we must do so with our eyes wide open. The Iranian regime \nis one of the world's leading State sponsors of terrorism. It threatens \nIsrael, it destabilizes the region, and it abuses human rights. That is \nwhy I have cosponsored the Iran Policy Oversight Act, a bill that \nallows Congress to move quickly to impose economic sanctions against \nIran's terrorist activity. It expands military aid to Israel, and it \nensures that agencies charged with monitoring Iran have the resources \nthey need.\n  Preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon is one of the most \nimportant objectives of our national security policy. I have strongly \nadvocated for and supported the economic sanctions that have brought \nIran to the negotiating table over the last few years. Those sanctions \nresulted in a nuclear nonproliferation agreement between Iran and the \nUnited States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, and China.\n  The Iran nuclear agreement, as we have talked about many times on \nthis floor--including my own words--is an imperfect but necessary tool \nto prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. In order for the \nagreement to work, of course, we must remember that simply trusting \nIran to do the right thing is not an option. We must be vigilant in our \nmonitoring and in our verification.\n  In my view, our national security strategy must focus on three \nthings. This is overall: Protecting our citizens, eliminating threats \nto our national security, and never losing sight of our core American \nvalues. It is through this lens that we must approach Iran.\n  First of all, we must do all we can to keep our own citizens safe. We \ncan't be naive. We cannot trust in the Iranian regime--and the Iranian \nregime continues to prove that is the case. Iran repeatedly violated \nthe United Nations Security Council Resolution 1929 by testing \nballistic missiles, most recently on October 10 and November 21 of \n2015. The very next month, in December of 2015, Iran conducted a live \nfire exercise using unguided rockets\n\n[[Page S866]]\n\nnear a U.S. aircraft carrier in international waters. Make no mistake, \nthis was an intentional provocation.\n  Just last month Iran announced it flew a surveillance drone over a \nU.S. aircraft carrier. Afterwards, an Iranian Navy commander went on \nState TV and said the drone strike was a ``sign of bravery'' that \n``allowed our men to go so close to the warship and shoot such \nbeautiful and accurate footage of the combat units of the foreign \nforces.''\n  Iran flying military drones over our aircraft carriers means that we \nmust respond.\n  We also have to keep in mind that Iran isn't just provoking our \nmilitary. Iran also targets innocent civilians by funding terrorism \naround the world. Iran is the world's leading State sponsor of \nterrorism. Iran funds Hezbollah, a terrorist group that wreaks havoc in \nthe Middle East. Recently Hezbollah was accused of recruiting five \nPalestinian men to attack Israelis using explosives. Luckily, the \nIsraeli defense forces were able to stop the attack before anyone was \nhurt.\n  Iran also continues to defend Bashir al-Assad and attack U.S.-backed \nrebel forces in Syria. The United Nations estimates that Iran spends $6 \nbillion a year to fund Assad's government. What is Assad doing with \nthat money? He buys barrel bombs to level entire Syrian towns. He pays \nfor blockades to prevent food, medicine, and other critical supplies \nfrom reaching his own people. He is starving entire villages in \nnorthern Syria where children are starving and thousands of people have \nbeen forced to survive on grass because Assad and troops from Hezbollah \nwill not let food and medicine get to them.\n  Iran is funding a government that is responsible for a civil war that \nhas killed 250,000 people and displaced 11 million more. Again, we need \nto be at the top of our game when it comes to sanctions. The worst \nwould be for a country that behaves in this manner and that disrespects \ninternational human rights to have access to a nuclear weapon, which is \nwhy many of us in this Chamber did support the agreement. While \nimperfect, we did support the Iranian nuclear agreement.\n\n  Our national security strategy also must focus on eliminating \nthreats. We must demonstrate that the United States has the capability \nto stand up to Iran when it funds terror and seeks to destabilize the \nworld.\n  Given Iran's history, we can anticipate that it will test the \nboundaries of international agreements, and we have to be ready to \nrespond when it does so. That is why we must hold Iran accountable \nevery step of the way. Imposing harsh sanctions against those \nresponsible for Iran's ballistic missile program is a good start.\n  Iran's ballistic missile program is a threat to regional and global \nsecurity. Any person or business involved in helping Iran obtain \nillicit weapons should be banned from doing business with the United \nStates, have their assets and financial operations immediately frozen, \nand have their travel restricted. Minimizing the threat Iran poses also \nmeans working to ensure that the money flowing into Iran now that \nnuclear sanctions are lifted is not used to further destabilize the \nregion and spread terrorism. We must monitor the flow of terrorist \nfinancing and use every tool available to punish bad actors who seek to \ndo harm.\n  It is also known that Iran has a terrible human rights record. In \nfact, Iranian Americans and Iranians around the world will be the first \npeople to tell you that 35 years of religious dictatorship has been a \nhuman rights nightmare for the people of Iran.\n  Recently, thousands of Iranians took to the streets of Paris to join \na mass demonstration protesting President Ruhani's visit to Paris. \nThose protestors are demonstrating against things like Iran's policy to \npermit girls as young as 9 to boys as young as 15 to be sentenced to \ndeath. They protested Iran's continuing suppression of journalists and \nfreedom of speech.\n  Beyond imprisoning journalists--and we do applaud the recent release \nof the Washington Post journalist. I was so honored to be at the \nopening recently at the Washington Post facility where he appeared and \nspoke. We learned how he was taken from his home in Iran at gunpoint, \nblindfolded, handcuffed, and thrown into solitary confinement for 18 \nmonths until recently his release was negotiated. Beyond imprisoning \njournalists, Iran arbitrarily jails human rights activists, and it \noppresses religious minorities including Christians, Jews, and Sunni \nMuslims.\n  America has a long history of being an arbiter of peace and security \naround the world. In order to continue this legacy, we must hold Iran \naccountable for its human rights violations.\n  I sponsored the Iran Policy Oversight Act because it is a bill that \ndoes three important things to hold Iran accountable. First, it allows \nCongress to more quickly impose economic sanctions against Iran's \nterrorist activities. This is really important because the best way to \nstop terrorism is to cut off the financing for it. We should be doing \neverything in our power to better track terrorist financing so that we \ncan stop the flow of money that funds suicide bombers and illicit \nweapons.\n  The United States and the international community have maintained \nsanctions against Iran for decades. I have voted to increase sanctions \non Iran's oil imports and strengthen sanctions against human rights \nviolators in Iran. Sanctions are a powerful tool, and Congress should \nexercise its authority to implement them as fast as possible against \npeople who fund international terrorism.\n  Second, the bill also expands military aid to Israel. The United \nStates plays a critical role in supporting Israel's defense. The United \nStates and Israel have enjoyed a friendship based on values rooted in \ndemocracy, freedom, and mutual strategic goals. Protecting Israel--our \nmost reliable ally in the Middle East, the beacon of democracy--against \na hostile Iran is essential.\n  Third, the bill ensures that agencies charged with monitoring Iran \nhave the resources they need. We cannot take Iran's word for it that \nthey are obeying the rules. We need strong independent verification and \nmonitoring. The United States and our European partners must fulfill \nour obligation to fund the international agencies responsible for that \nmonitoring.\n  In order to protect our citizens, Congress must exercise its \nconstitutional authority to enact legislation that expands oversight of \nthe Iran nuclear agreement. We must also continue to work with the P5+1 \nto ensure that the agreement is strictly enforced. Iran must understand \nthat we will not hesitate to snap back sanctions if it fails to comply \nwith the rules. Sanctions were effective at getting Iran to the table, \nand they will continue to be a tool that allows the United States and \nour allies to minimize the threat posed by Iran.\n  Those of us who supported the Iran nuclear agreement have a special \nresponsibility to ensure that it works. In fact, this whole Senate has \na responsibility, regardless of whether Members supported it or not. It \nis in the best interest of our country. We cannot shirk from our duties \nand we must be vigilant. We owe it to the American people, to Israel, \nand to our allies. Our mission here is clear: We must protect our own \ncitizens by exercising our authority to enact strong legislation to \nensure that Iran does not cheat on its international commitments. \nBecause we know from experience that Iran will test the international \ncommunity, we must be ready to respond when it does.\n  Iran must know that if it violates the rules, the response will be \ncertain, swift, and severe. We must also minimize the threat Iran poses \nto our citizens and the world by doing everything in our power to stop \nIran from funding the world's terrorists.\n  Last year the world was shaken by a series of successful terrorist \nattacks on innocent civilians. The attacks in Paris, Lebanon, Mali, and \nSan Bernardino, right here in the United States, remind us that the \nvictims of these massacres will never be limited to one nationality or \none ethnicity or one religion.\n  It is critical that we take additional steps to stop countries like \nIran from funding terrorism and destabilizing the world. Stopping \nIran's support of terrorism protects us here at home, but it also helps \nmillions of refugees fleeing Syria, the children that are starving in \ncities like Madaya, and the families fleeing mortar fire in Yemen. Our \nvalues of justice, democracy, and freedom for all demand nothing less.\n  Iran's recent behavior suggests that the United States needs to have \nthe ability to snap back as soon as possible. We have to have the \nability to\n\n[[Page S867]]\n\nimpose sanctions. That is why I am supporting this bill. I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the Veterans \nChoice Program and the challenges some of Indiana's veterans are \nexperiencing with its implementation.\n  Our veterans have served our country and have sacrificed for our \ncountry every day. Some come home bearing physical or mental wounds. \nSome bear both. Serving also means being away from their families, who \nalso sacrifice for us. Veterans have missed their sons' or daughters' \nfirst words, first steps, birthdays, little league games, holidays, and \nmany other life milestones that we all treasure.\n  When our veterans first come home, they are met with the many \nchallenges of settling back into everyday life, which can include \nstress from finances to reconnecting with their wife or husband and \nsons and daughters. Some, as mentioned, must deal with the physical and \nmental wounds of war.\n  All of our vets should be able to have peace of mind that they will \nbe able to have a good-paying job and access to quality health care. \nOur veterans should not be burdened with wondering if or when they will \nbe able to schedule a medical appointment.\n  While we can never fully repay our veterans or their families for \ntheir service and sacrifice, our country has a sacred responsibility to \nhonor our veterans and to take care of them. Serving our veterans and \nmaking sure they receive the best care possible, whether for physical \nailments or for mental health challenges, is something I take very \nseriously. We are committed to ensuring each and every one of them has \naccess to quality care and the full range of benefits they have earned \nby their service.\n  Following gross mismanagement and misconduct at several VA medical \ncenters nationally, in 2014 Congress passed the bipartisan Veterans \nAccess, Choice, and Accountability Act that was signed into law. The \nlaw established the Veterans Choice Program to help address the \ninadequate access to care that our vets were facing. The program is \ndesigned to enable veterans who can't see a VA doctor within 30 days or \nwho live more than 40 miles from a VA facility to access a local non-VA \nprovider using a Veterans Choice Card.\n  Unfortunately, there are repeated examples of the Veterans Choice \nProgram coming up short. It is our responsibility as legislators to \nreview, follow up, and ask questions about this program we helped to \nput in place to make sure it is working correctly and efficiently.\n  I stand here today to state that some Indiana veterans are \nexperiencing problems with the Veterans Choice Program, and we must \nwork to address these issues and to solve them.\n  There are two third-party vendors contracted to help the VA implement \nthe Veterans Choice Program around the country and in Indiana--Health \nNet Federal Services, which covers most of our State, and TriWest, \nwhich extends into parts of southern Indiana. Instead of making \nVeterans Choice Program appointments directly with local hospitals, \nveterans must use Health Net Federal Services or TriWest. In recent \nweeks, our office has heard from Indiana veterans who are experiencing \nlong wait times of up to 90 minutes on the phone and disconnected calls \nwhen they contact Health Net Federal Services.\n  I share the stories of some of these veterans and the struggles they \nhave dealt with. Vietnam vet Daniel Vice from Marion, IN, had eye \nsurgery through the Veterans Choice Program and had been told by Health \nNet that his postoperation appointments would also be covered. When he \nwas at the eye doctor for his follow-up appointment, he learned that \nHealth Net Federal Services had not sent over his paperwork. This meant \nthat instead of being covered by the Veterans Choice Program, Dan would \nhave to pay out of his own pocket. Dan contacted our office while at \nthe doctor seeking help. Our case manager called Health Net only to be \nput on hold for 21 minutes before speaking to a supervisor. The company \ncould not provide immediate answers but called back our staff a few \nhours later and said that Dan's paperwork had not been approved. We \ncontinue to work with Dan to get answers to solve this problem.\n  Veteran Robert Trowbridge, from South Bend, had surgery on his ankle \nalmost 6 months ago and has yet to be scheduled for his post-op \nphysical therapy. He called Health Net many times and was put on hold \nfor 30 to 40 minutes each time he called. When he was able to reach a \nrep, he was told repeatedly that his paperwork was sent to be approved, \nonly to find out 4 months later that there was a problem. He was later \ninformed that his Social Security number was not attached to his file. \nFrustrated, Robert contacted our office for assistance.\n  Our staff experienced firsthand the frustrations and inadequate \ncustomer service that some of our vets like Robert face. One of our \ncase managers called Health Net and it took 23 minutes into the \nconversation with a representative before the customer service rep even \nasked for the veteran's name. After calls with a representative, then a \nsupervisor, and then a manager from Health Net Federal Services, we \nwere finally able to work with the manager to resolve the issue for \nRobert.\n  What our veterans are going through to schedule appointments and \naccess their benefits through the Veterans Choice Program is completely \nunacceptable. Our office continues to work to assist vets who \nexperience difficulties.\n  I have called on Health Net Federal Services to get answers. We need \nto get to the bottom of this problem, and we need to ensure that all \nHoosier veterans and all American veterans and their families receive \nthe timely and quality care they deserve.\n  I will work nonstop to end this problem, and our office will continue \nto work nonstop to make sure we get to the bottom of the problems that \nour Hoosier veterans are having with the Veterans Choice Program. They \ngave too much to this country to be treated this way. We will solve \nthese problems for Hoosier veterans and for every American veteran.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/senate-section/article/S867-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S867-S869]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to join the American people \nin celebrating Black History Month, but it should be noted that the \nimmeasurable role African Americans have had in making the Nation the \nstrong Nation that it is today could not be fully recognized in 1 short \nmonth. Black history is American history.\n  This February we highlight the titans of African-American history: \nMarylanders such as Harriet Ross Tubman, Frederick Douglass, and \nThurgood Marshall; icons, including Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and \nDr. Dorothy Height; and contemporary heroes, such as John Lewis and Mae \nJemison.\n  We all celebrate the countless men and women whose names will never \ngrace the history books or newspapers, those who fought each day for \nfreedom and equality, those who pushed the limits of innovation, and \nthose who endured and overcame hardships over the centuries.\n  As we celebrate, the struggle to ensure all Americans under the law \nare treated equally under the law rages on. I believe that as much as \nBlack History Month is about reflecting on a rich past, it is also a \ntime for all Americans to contemplate how to create a better future.\n  It is not enough simply to recognize the great contributions that \nAfrican Americans have made, to honor those who have come before us; we \nmust use Black History Month as a springboard to bring about positive \nchange in America. I have a number of legislative priorities that \nrelate directly to Black History Month and to building a better future.\n\n[[Page S868]]\n\n  I take pride in being from Baltimore for many years reasons. I know \nall my colleagues are familiar with the National Association for the \nAdvancement of Colored People, the NAACP for short. The NAACP \ncelebrates its 107th anniversary on the 12th of month. The NAACP is \nheadquartered in Baltimore City. The model of the NAACP is ``One Nation \nWorking Together, For Justice and Equality Everywhere.'' The motto is \nfitting because for the last 107 years, this is exactly what the NAACP \nand its more than half a million members have done. I have introduced \nlegislation to honor the legacy of the civil rights champion, executive \ndirector of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Solicitor \nGeneral, Supreme Court Justice, and Baltimorean Thurgood Marshall. The \nlegislation would direct the National Park Service to determine the \nsuitability of including his alma mater, Public School 103 in West \nBaltimore, as a national historic site.\n  The stories of Justice Thurgood Marshall reading the Constitution in \nthe basement of P.S. 103 during detention typifies the American dream. \nPreserving P.S. 103 would not only be a fitting tribute to a great \nMarylander but also an enduring symbol of the importance of education \nin shaping civic-minded and great Americans. I understand that the \nlegislation may be included in the Energy Policy Modernization Act that \nthe Senate may consider again in the near future, and I hope the Senate \nwill approve of this amendment.\n  I just mentioned education, and during Black History Month, I think \nthere are few topics more important to promoting equality than ensuring \nthat all Americans have access to a high-quality, affordable education. \nIn December of this past year, Congress enacted the Every Student \nSucceeds Act in a strong bipartisan manner. I hope the Members of this \nbody can build on this momentum by confronting the pressing issues of \ncollege affordability and student debt.\n  I am a strong supporter of President Obama's America's College \nPromise proposal to provide 2 years of community college education \ntuition-free for responsible students. This proposal will allow \nstudents to earn the first 2 years of a 4-year degree or the critical \nskills necessary to enter the workforce without having to take on \ndecades of debt before they even embark on their career.\n  While student debt is a critical problem for nearly 42 million \nAmericans, paying for higher education can be especially difficult for \nAfrican-American families. According to the Urban Institute, since the \nmid-2000s, African-American families on average have carried more \nstudent loan debt than White families. This is driven in large part by \nthe growing share of African-American families who take on student \ndebt. In 2013, 42 percent of African Americans ages 25 to 55 had \nstudent loan debt, compared with 28 percent of Whites. Because African-\nAmerican families on average have less wealth and fewer private \nresources, they may be more likely to turn to loans to finance their \neducation.\n  Education is the great equalizer in our society. As a nation, we \ncannot afford to price Americans of any race out of education and the \nopportunities a quality education provides.\n  The main higher education equalizer, the Federal Pell grant, provides \nits lowest share of college education costs since its enactment in \n1965. As a result, more than 61 percent of the students who receive a \nFederal Pell grant award have to take out loans, compared to only 29 \npercent of their more affluent peers. With more than 60 percent of \nAfrican-American undergraduate students utilizing the Federal Pell \ngrant to pay for their education, this has placed an undue burden on \nAfrican-American communities for decades. During Black History Month \nand beyond, I will continue to help support legislation to help ease \nthe burden of paying for higher education.\n  In the last year, Baltimore and many cities across the United States \nhave been inundated with news crews covering the deaths of unarmed \nBlack men and women at the hands of police officers. Long before the \nunrest that gripped Baltimore last spring, I had introduced a number of \nbills seeking to empower communities and rebuild trust between the \ncitizens and police departments. Events in Baltimore, Charleston, \nCleveland, Chicago, and many other places showed the urgent need for \ncongressional action. That is why I introduced the BALTIMORE Act, which \nwould help communities nationwide by building and lifting trust in \norder to multiply opportunities and racial equality.\n  The BALTIMORE Act is a package of legislation made up of bills that I \nhave previously introduced, along with several new additions. Many \nprovisions in the BALTIMORE Act enjoy bipartisan support. Title I of \nthe BALTIMORE Act includes law enforcement perform provisions to help \nbetter train and equip law enforcement officers so they can better \nserve communities across the country.\n  The first provision contained within the BALTIMORE Act is the End \nRacial Profiling Act. The End Racial Profiling Act would end racial and \ndiscriminatory profiling by State and local law enforcement and require \nmandatory data collection and reporting. Think about this for a moment: \nIn 2016 there is no national standard against law enforcement officers \nstopping someone merely because of his or her race. I am pleased that \nMaryland attorney general Brian Frosh recently issued guidelines \nprohibiting the use of discriminatory profiling by State and local law \nenforcement in Maryland. And the Attorney General of the United States \nhas acted, but we need a national standard with the force of law that \nwould prohibit the use of discriminatory profiling by any Federal, \nState, or local law enforcement officer.\n  The second provision deals with State and local accountability. It \nwould require local law enforcement officials receiving Byrne JAG and \nCOPS Hiring Program funds to submit officer training information to the \nDepartment of Justice. That information would include how officers are \ntrained in the use of force, racial and ethnic bias, deescalating \nconflicts, and constructive engagement with the public.\n  The Police CAMERA Act would establish a pilot program to assist local \nlaw enforcement in purchasing or leasing body-worn cameras.\n  I am pleased that several provisions that are consistent with the \nBALTIMORE Act were included in the fiscal year 2016 appropriations \nmeasure enacted by Congress in December. The appropriations legislation \ndirects the Department of Justice to swiftly devise and submit plans to \nimprove training levels in use of force, identifying racial and ethnic \nbias, and conflict resolution for State and local law enforcement \nofficers. It urges DOJ to partner with national law enforcement \norganizations to promote consistent standards for high-quality training \nand assessment and directs the agency to better collect State and local \nlaw enforcement data on the use of force.\n  I also want to mention that I introduced the Law Enforcement Trust \nand Integrity Act, which would help local law enforcement agencies \nstrengthen their department and combat officer misconduct.\n  The BALTIMORE Act deals with voting rights reform and civil rights \nrestoration. The Democracy Restoration Act would make citizens who have \nreturned from incarceration eligible to vote. At the State level, I was \nproud to see that the Maryland State Senate recently overturned our \nGovernor's veto of a State statute expanding the right to vote for \npeople who have served their time. I want to reduce recidivism and give \npeople a stake in their communities. If you want to do that, they need \nto have a voice and a vote. The Democracy Restoration Act would also \nrestore one's eligibility to serve on a Federal jury.\n  Congress should also enact legislation to restore the Voting Rights \nAct and reverse the damage done by the Supreme Court decisions that \nundermine the fundamental right to vote as Americans, to cast their \nvotes for the Presidential primary elections of 2016.\n  The BALTIMORE Act also deals with sentencing reform. Over the years, \nsentencing in this country has been marred by racial disparities. The \ndiscrepancy between jail time for crack and powder cocaine users is \nonly one such example. The RESET Act would reclassify specific low-\nlevel nonviolent drug possession felonies as misdemeanors and eliminate \nthe aforementioned distinctions between crack and powder cocaine. I am \npleased to be\n\n[[Page S869]]\n\nable to say that the sentencing reform is a bipartisan issue, and I \nlook forward to working with any member who is willing to ensure that \nall Americans are treated equitably under the law. I hope the Senate \nwill take up legislation to address some of these disparities in the \nvery near future. Finally, the BALTIMORE Act addresses reentry and \nemployment law reforms. I think this section is especially important \nbecause once someone has served his or her sentence, that person should \nbe able to start anew and should get a fair shot to reenter the \nworkforce.\n  I would be remiss if I did not mention Second Chance, Inc., a \nBaltimore nonprofit that trains returning citizens in deconstruction, \narchitectural salvage, and much more. I have had a chance to meet with \nthe staff of Second Chance, and I can tell you that their reentry and \njob program should be a national model. I invite my colleagues to learn \nmore about the good work that is being done only a short drive north of \nhere.\n\n  I am pleased the administration has ``banned the box'' when it comes \nto the hiring of Federal contractors, so that ex-offenders get the \nsecond chance to rejoin our communities as productive and working \nmembers of society.\n  I am pleased the State of Maryland as well as Baltimore City, \nMontgomery County, and Prince George's County have all ``banned the \nbox'' in various forms, and I urge the private sector to follow suit. \nHelping ex-offenders find gainful employment is a win-win by reducing \nsocial services costs, increasing tax revenues, and making our \ncommunities safer.\n  Eliminating disparities in our justice system is critically \nimportant. It is just as important to eliminate disparities in the \nquality of health care available between groups of Americans. In \nBaltimore, living in certain African-American neighborhoods instead of \na White neighborhood, separated by only a few miles, can shorten life \nexpectancy by as much as 30 years--a full generation. That is \nunacceptable. As a Senator with a longstanding record of working to \npromote health equity, including my legislation establishing Offices of \nMinority Health throughout the Department of Health and Human Services \nand elevating the National Institutes of Health's National Center on \nMinority Health and Health Disparities to an Institute, I will say we \nhave made progress in shrinking disparities, but I am far from \nsatisfied.\n  I am very encouraged to see that NIH received a $2 billion increase \nin the fiscal year 2016 omnibus spending bill. That is very important. \nThat is the largest increase NIH has received since 2003. The National \nInstitute on Minority Health and Health Disparities received $278 \nmillion. This is an increase of $8.7 million over its fiscal year 2016 \nenacted level. Make no mistake, that money will help save lives.\n  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, we have recently made health care \ncoverage more accessible and affordable than it has been in decades. By \nreducing the number of uninsured Americans across the country, the ACA \nis working to address health inequalities. For instance, between 2013 \nand 2014, the percentage of uninsured African Americans fell by 6.8 \npercent. Also, because of the ACA, there is increased funding available \nfor community health clinics, and 300,000 Marylanders, including more \nthan 140,000 African Americans, are served by these clinics. Under the \nACA preventive services, which are critical to the early detection and \ntreatment of many diseases that disproportionately affect minorities, \nare now free for 76 million Americans, including 1.5 million \nMarylanders.\n  Some of what Congress can do to shrink disparities is not limited to \nhealth care policymaking. Recent events in Flint, MI, have brought to \nlight the need to focus on environmental justice issues. Flint is a \ncase study in what happens when environmental stewardship and water \ninfrastructure needs are ignored. It is also an example of how \npollution can hurt minority populations in a severe way. Flint's \npopulation is about 100,000 people. Roughly 56 percent are African \nAmerican. The residents of Flint will have to live with the \ncomplications of lead poisoning for the rest of their lives.\n  What disturbs me the most--both as a grandfather and a member of the \nSenate Environment and Public Works Committee--is the very real \npossibility that children may have suffered irreversible damage to \ntheir developing brains from exposure to lead in drinking water. \nExposure even to low levels of lead can profoundly affect children's \nbehavior, growth rates, and their intelligence over time. I might point \nout that Freddie Gray, the person who was killed in Baltimore, had high \nlevels of lead in his blood. Elevated levels in the bloodstream may \ncause learning disabilities and other developmental issues.\n  I wish to quote from an article in the New York Times, January 29 of \nthis year:\n\n       Emails released by the office of [Michigan] Governor Rick \n     Snyder last week referred to a resident who said she was told \n     by a state nurse in January 2015, regarding her son's \n     elevated blood level, ``It is just a few IQ points. . . . It \n     is not the end of the world.''\n\n  It is a crisis when we deny a child his or her full potential by \nexposing them to lead. This crisis could have been avoided. It is going \nto affect an entire generation of children in Flint to varying degrees.\n  Sadly, Flint is not alone among the cities in which pollution is \nharming African Americans at disproportionately alarming rates. \nNationally, African Americans are 20 percent more likely to have asthma \nversus non-Hispanic Whites. According to a study in the Annual Review \nof Public Health, many African-American children live in more heavily \npolluted areas. Living in urban centers increases one's exposure to \ntraffic and industrial pollution, which promotes a greater sensitivity \nto allergens.\n  As I said at the beginning of my remarks, Black History Month is \nabout reflecting on a rich path but also a time for all Americans to \ncontemplate how to create a better future. The Senate is capable of \ngreat things. Landmark bills like the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the Voting \nRights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Act of 1968 all passed through \nthis Chamber. I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and in \nboth Houses of Congress to transfer the good will and kind words of \nBlack History Month into meaningful legislation to help African \nAmericans and all Americans.\n  I presented only a small portion of my legislative priorities today. \nI know other Senators may have different ways of approaching some of \nthese same challenges. In honor of the countless men and women who have \ncontributed to making this country great, let us work together to get \nsomething done for the American people.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a World War \nII veteran and an American hero--PO3 John B. Baldwin. Petty Officer \nBaldwin was a member of the United States Navy Reserve and sailed on \nthe USS St. Louis. Tragically, on February 14, 1944, he died as a \nresult of enemy fire during the Battle of the Green Islands.\n  Petty Officer Baldwin's sister--Ms. Irene Baldwin Cox of Beaver, UT--\nrecently informed me that her brother had earned prestigious military \nmedals, which neither he nor his family ever received. As a result of \nJohn's dedicated service during the battle that besieged the USS St. \nLouis, he earned the Purple Heart, the World War II Victory Medal, the \nAmerican Campaign Medal, the Asiatic Pacific Campaign Medal with two \nBronze Star appurtenances, and a Combat Action Ribbon. Thankfully, the \nmilitary has since verified John's medals and will soon present them to \nthe Baldwin family.\n  As we approach the anniversary of this historic battle, we should \nremember the challenges Petty Officer Baldwin and his fellow soldiers \nfaced on that fateful day. At dawn, American fighters sighted six Aichi \nD3A dive bombers, which approached the St. Louis and dropped six bombs, \nkilling 23 sailors and wounding 20 more. Petty Officer Baldwin was \namong the fallen.\n  The Baldwin family has always been proud of John's service. We owe \nthis family a debt of gratitude that can never be repaid. It is only \nfitting that we present John's siblings with the medals he earned for \nhis heroism. I am grateful for the assistance of the USS St. Louis CL-\n49 Association and the National Personnel Records Center for helping me \nsecure these medals for the Baldwin family.\n  I hold our Nation's veterans in the highest regard. Because of men \nand women like Petty Officer Baldwin, our Nation enjoys the full \nblessings of liberty. I am pleased that these medals have finally found \ntheir rightful home. May they ever serve as a testament to John's valor \nand his love of freedom.\n  This Valentine's Day, I intend to spend a moment reflecting on the \nbravery of our sailors who served aboard the USS St. Louis. Today I \nhonor them for their courage, their selflessness, and their sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/senate-section/article/S870-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO JUDGE EUGENE SILER, JR.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to recognize a celebrated \nKentuckian who has received a great honor. Federal appeals court judge \nEugene Siler, Jr., a fixture in his community, who has served on the \nbench for over 40 years, has received the ``Tri-County 2016 Leader of \nthe Year'' award from the Leadership Tri-County organization in \nKentucky.\n  Leadership Tri-County focuses on civic, business, and community \nleadership in Laurel, Knox, and Whitley Counties in southeastern \nKentucky. A nonprofit organization founded in 1987, it identifies \npotential, emerging, and current leaders from the three counties and \nnurtures their continued development.\n  Judge Siler is a native of Williamsburg and earned his bachelor of \narts at Vanderbilt University. He has a law degree from the University \nof Virginia and has two graduate law degrees from the University of \nVirginia and Georgetown University.\n  Judge Siler served as an Active-Duty officer in the U.S. Navy from \n1958 to 1960 and later retired as a commander in the U.S. Naval \nReserve.\n  Judge Siler practiced law privately alongside his father in \nWilliamsburg and was then elected Whitley County attorney, an office he \nheld from 1965 to 1970. In 1970, he was appointed U.S. attorney for the \nEastern District of Kentucky by President Richard Nixon.\n  In 1975, he was appointed as a judge for the U.S. District Court for \nthe Eastern and Western Districts of Kentucky by President Gerald Ford. \nIn 1991, he was appointed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the sixth \ncircuit by President George H.W. Bush.\n  Today Judge Siler is a senior judge on that court. He was awarded the \n``1992 Outstanding Judge of the Year Award'' by the Kentucky Bar \nAssociation, and that same year, he was sent to Lithuania by the U.S. \nState Department to advise and assist the judiciary in that country as \nthey transitioned from a communist to a democratic system. He also \ntraveled to Albania at the behest of the U.S. Justice Department to \nadvise that country's judges on ethics and discipline.\n  Judge Siler is married to the former Chris Minnich.

Mr. President, last Friday, America celebrated the 23rd \nanniversary of the Family and Medical Leave Act--landmark legislation \nthat transformed American workplaces for the better.\n  I am deeply proud to have voted for this bill in 1993 when I served \nin the House of Representatives. This bipartisan legislation was a \nmajor victory\n\n[[Page S871]]\n\nfor many working families, providing workers the ability to take up to \n12 weeks of unpaid leave for family needs.\n  This meant working parents could take care of their newborns without \nfear of losing their jobs and sources of income. Workers could care for \nan ailing family member or care for their own serious health conditions \nwithout having to worry about whether they would be able to come back \nto their careers.\n  Before the Family and Medical Leave Act, being a working parent meant \nhaving to choose between your job and taking care of yourself and your \nfamily. Today, thanks to this legislation, this attitude has changed \nfor many families.\n  Since 1993, American workers have used the leave provided by the \nFamily and Medical Leave Act more than 200 million times. This \nlegislation has helped balance workplace demands with family needs for \nmillions of hard-working men and women across the country. And there is \nno doubt that these are achievements we should all be proud of.\n  But we need to do more.\n  As families change, so should the laws designed to help them--our \nworkforce, our economy, and our family responsibilities have changed \ndramatically over the past two decades. Women now make up half the \nworkforce, and many families depend on two incomes. Family caregiving \nneeds are on the rise, and both men and women provide critical care.\n  But according to a recent Department of Labor survey, only 60 percent \nof employees have access to FMLA leave--and 8 out of 10 eligible \nworkers cannot afford to take leave when they need it.\n  For too many Americans, unpaid leave is not an option--it is \nunaffordable. Just 13 percent of the workforce has paid family leave \nthrough their employers, and less than 40 percent have personal medical \nleave through an employer-provided disability program.\n  It is clear that we need to do more to ensure families can earn the \nsupport they need. I am proud that both Senator Murray and Senator \nGillibrand have stepped up and introduced legislation this Congress to \naddress these shortcomings. I hope we will continue to see support for \nthese bills and get more of my colleagues from across the aisle to talk \nabout these concerns.\n  The reality is ensuring paid family and sick leave would help keep \nnew parents and family caregivers in the workforce and boost their \nearnings and savings overtime. Studies have already shown that mothers \nwho are able to take paid maternity leave are more likely to return to \ntheir jobs and stay in the workforce. That just means more money for \nfamilies to spend and put back into our economy.\n  Expanding paid family and sick leave makes moral sense, and it makes \neconomic sense. It is about time we get it done.\n  As we mark the anniversary of this groundbreaking legislation, I hope \nwe take the time to recommit ourselves to the values that inspired this \nlaw. Let's continue to lead on this issue and expand paid family and \nhealth leave to cover more families.\n  I will continue to fight and protect the benefits provided by the \nFederal and Medical Leave Act and help ensure fairer workplaces and \nhealthier, more secure families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/senate-section/article/S871-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING HILL FARMSTEAD BREWERY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as a Vermonter, it is with great pride that \nI call to the Senate's attention the success of one of Vermont's fine \nbusinesses, Hill Farmstead Brewery, which was recently named the best \nbrewer in the world by RateBeer for the second year in a row and for \nthe third time in 4 years. The brewery's success is a testament to the \nhard work and dedication of founder and brewer Shaun Hill, whose \nphilosophy revolves around brewing beer as an art rather than solely as \na business. His drive to brew the best beer in the world has brought \naccolades and interviews in national publications from Vanity Fair to \nthe New York Times; yet he remains staunchly opposed to following the \npath of most conventional breweries. Rather than focusing on boundless \nproduction, his business model gives value to what is created with \nintegrity, grit, and perseverance.\n  Shaun's approach sets the Hill Farmstead Brewery apart from other, \nmore commercial enterprises. Its location in Greensboro, VT, is \nsituated in the Hill family's former dairy barn, surrounded by dirt \nroads and rolling hills. Despite its remote geography, beer lovers come \nfrom far and wide to experience the world-renowned beers, to take in \nthe beautiful setting, and to buy some beer to take home. Because a \nvisit to Hill Farmstead is a unique and intimate experience, it is no \nsurprise that is on the bucket list of beer lovers around the world.\n  As members of his team fill orders, it is not uncommon to see Shaun \nbuzzing around the brewery, moving grain or stopping to talk with \nvisitors. Even if they do not know it at the time, these visitors are \ntaking with them something extremely special. Bottled with the beer is \na taste of something greater: Vermont values, and a celebration of \nlife, initiative, and hard work.\n  Experiencing dramatic growth in the last decade, the craft beers made \nat Vermont's 40 breweries have a reputation as being some of the best \nin the world. It is not uncommon for people to drive from New York \nCity, Boston, or even Washington, DC, to spend a few hours or a weekend \nvisiting Vermont breweries. So it is wonderful to watch an entrepreneur \nlike Shaun, with such a passion for his work, grow his idea into a \nvalued and sought after product from all over the country. While many \nVermonters still feel the effects of a recovering economy, there are a \nlot of good things happening in our State thanks to people like him.\n  When Shaun opened his brewery 5 and a half years ago, he said his \ngoal was to brew the best beer in the world. Well, he achieved that \ngoal and in an impressive short amount of time. Its consistent and \nexemplary performance over the years, combined with success in creating \nseveral phenomenal beers across various styles, have this brewery to \nshine above more than 22,500 other breweries worldwide. The distinct \nand nuanced beers pay homage to the art of brewing and to the ambition \nof their creator. They are a testament to the quality products produced \nin Vermont, by Vermonters.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/senate-section/article/S871-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S871-S872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             NATIONAL COUNCIL OF HIGHER EDUCATION RESOURCES\n\n Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the \nRecord a copy of my remarks last week to the National Council of Higher \nEducation Resources.\n  The material follows:\n\n             National Council of Higher Education Resources\n\n       I was smiling a little bit when you said that I probably \n     knew more than anybody in Congress about student loans. That \n     is probably true, but that may not be saying very much. This \n     is a complex subject. And although I have been in and around \n     it for a long time, I still spend most of my time listening \n     and learning from you and others who deal with how we help \n     students take advantage of the tremendous opportunities they \n     have in this country.\n       I'm sure some of you were up late last night watching \n     politics. I went to bed early, but 20 years ago I was right \n     in the middle of it. When you have the privilege of running \n     for president, you find out that you spend most of your time \n     hoping nobody says to you what they said to the late Mo \n     Udall--the congressman from Arizona--when he was walking into \n     a barbershop in New Hampshire and he stuck out his hand and \n     said ``I'm Mo Udall running for president,'' and the barber \n     says, ``yeah I know, we were just laughing about that \n     yesterday.''\n       I watched with interest the results this morning--my \n     sideline view is that Marco Rubio is somebody to watch in the \n     next week. Twenty years ago, about two weeks before the New \n     Hampshire primary, I was at 10 percent in New Hampshire \n     polls, and I came in third in Iowa as Marco did last night. \n     26% Dole 23% Buchanan and I got 18. That 18 was such a \n     surprise I ended up on the cover of Time magazine and was in \n     first in New Hampshire within the week. So things can change \n     rapidly, and what happens in the 8 days between the Iowa \n     caucuses and the New Hampshire primary should be very \n     interesting--I have no idea what will happen.\n       I do think that 20 years ago it was said to be 3 out of \n     Iowa, and 2 out of New Hampshire. And the financial limits on \n     fundraising were such that it made that come true because you \n     could only raise money from people up to $1000 a person. You \n     can imagine trying to raise millions of dollars at $1000 per \n     person. You can't start a business that way, you can't start \n     a college that way and you\n\n[[Page S872]]\n\n     can't have a presidential campaign that way. So it was 3 out \n     of Iowa and 2 out of New Hampshire.\n       I think this time they are going to carry 4 out of New \n     Hampshire. And one reason is because the rules have changed \n     about fundraising. So hopefully more Americans will have a \n     chance to participate in the system and will get a chance to \n     run through the southern primaries and on into the \n     convention. So it ought to be an interesting year.\n       I'd like to talk just a minute about higher education and \n     some of the things that I hope we could do. Then I'll be glad \n     to take up to 3 questions you'd like to ask me. I'll be glad \n     and try to respond to them if there's something you want to \n     say to me. First--thank you for the work you do to help \n     students have a chance to participate in what still is the \n     best system of colleges and universities in the world. We \n     have millions of families every year who still fill out their \n     student aid application forms. It's a large number.\n       Here is what our committee, which is the Senate's education \n     committee, will be doing. As Ron said, for the last year our \n     major priority was elementary and secondary education. We \n     tackled fixing No Child Left Behind which was 7 years \n     overdue, and filled with partisan problems. It's like higher \n     education but even more so. In fact--with elementary and \n     secondary education it's like going to a University of \n     Tennessee football game--you've got 100,000 people in the \n     stands and every single one of them played football and is an \n     expert and knows what plays to call and usually wants to call \n     it. Well it's the same thing with elementary and secondary \n     education--you have 50 million students, and 3.5 million \n     teachers and parents. And everybody has got an idea--whether \n     it's transgender bathrooms--they all want to put it in the \n     bill. But all these things could sink the bill in a minute. \n     And I will compliment Senator Patty Murray of Washington \n     because she and I worked together and we got a result and the \n     president to sign the bill. Fundamentally, it was a major \n     change because it basically says ``sure we want to know how \n     the students are doing so the federal government will require \n     you to take 17 tests between the 3rd grade and senior year.''\n       Then you report that to see how the students are doing. And \n     you disaggregate it so you can see if the African American \n     kids or the white kids or the Latino kids are being left \n     behind. But after that, the decisions about what to do about \n     the results of the tests--if you're a 4th grade teacher in \n     Franklin--that's your business. That's the state of \n     Tennessee's business. So if you want the common core academic \n     standard you can have it. If you don't want it then you don't \n     have to have it. That's not anything the United States \n     Secretary of Education is going to tell you. It's not going \n     to tell you what the test should be, how to evaluate the \n     test, what the accountability system should be and how to \n     evaluate the teachers.\n       People assume that because I have been a big fan of \n     evaluating teachers as Governor that I'll come up here and \n     try to make everybody do it. It's just the reverse with me. I \n     think people are fed up with Washington telling them so much \n     about what to do--whether it's elementary and secondary \n     education or in higher education. My goal with higher \n     education is to try to deregulate it. Try to take the federal \n     rules and regulations which just piled up through 8 different \n     reauthorizations of the Higher Education Act, and simplify \n     them and make them more fair. Several years ago I got an \n     appropriations bill; a study for how to do that with \n     research, and the head of the University of Texas at Austin, \n     chancellor, former chancellor now, had them update me a \n     report. I asked the chancellor of Maryland and the chancellor \n     at Vanderbilt to lead a group of higher education folks to \n     recommend how we could make higher education more simple and \n     effective: 59 recommendations. A few of them the Secretary \n     himself can do. As many as we can, maybe 3 dozen of the rest \n     of those, we hope to put in a piece of legislation that Sen. \n     Mikulski and Bennet from the Democratic side, and Sen. Burr \n     and from the Republican side will introduce. They all will \n     help to save the time and money from this jungle of redtape \n     the study would have.\n       Another simplification we would like to do is with the \n     FAFSA. You know better than almost anybody that it's not \n     necessary to have 108 questions. In fact we had testimony \n     before our committee from people that come from many \n     different directions that said basically you only need 2 \n     questions. One was ``the size of your family?'' and one was \n     ``your amount of income.'' Well, maybe we don't need only 2 \n     questions, but we need a lot fewer questions. I mean you have \n     20 million families filling that out every year. That's an \n     enormous savings of time and money. And if we simplify and \n     demystify the forms to some degree more students will take \n     advantage of the student aid enrollment. The president of \n     Southwest Community College in Memphis told me he thinks he \n     loses 1,500 students every year just from the complexity of \n     the FAFSA. And so we are experimenting in a whole variety of \n     ways. Parents and grandparents asking, ``why do I have to \n     give this info to the government again, they've already got \n     it on my FAFSA?'' Well, good question. Maybe all you need to \n     do is give permission to the IRS to send it over and you fill \n     out only a few questions. So, simplifying for FAFSA is \n     another thing we have a bipartisan agreement on.\n       We'd like reduce the number of student loans. I'd like to \n     see a single undergraduate loan. I think students would be \n     less likely to over borrow and less likely to make mistakes. \n     And we could use the savings from that to provide another \n     thing that I think would be helpful and that's the year-round \n     Pell Grant. We have ridiculously complex student aid and \n     student aid repayment terms. I saw the other day, Bernie \n     Sanders had some person up there holding up a sign that said \n     she had $90K in student loans and she was paying half of her \n     income to pay it off every year. Well, as an undergraduate \n     loan she doesn't have to do that.\n       If she knew what the existing income-based repayment \n     programs are, she wouldn't have to pay half of her income \n     toward loans, she would only have to pay 10 or 15 % of her \n     income towards it. If she had been working for public service \n     she might have it forgiven. After 20 to 25 years it would be \n     forgiven. So there's a lot of misinformation about student \n     loans and about repayment and our goal is to cut it down to \n     two. To have a 10 year repayment plan and have an income \n     based repayment plan. So you would have two choices.\n       Fundamentally, if students knew what their options were and \n     that they were that simple to understand, we'd probably have \n     a lot more students take advantage of those repayment plans \n     and on the front end a lot more students going to college. \n     There are other steps we'd like to take.\n       The ones I have just described have a lot of bipartisan \n     agreement. We'd like to allow students to use their income \n     from two years ago, called the prior-prior year, to use to \n     fill out their financial aid forms. The administration agrees \n     with us on that. Other areas where we may be able to have a \n     bipartisan agreement on in the Senate are campus safety and \n     sexual assault, accreditation reform, giving institutions \n     more authority to counsel students on how much to borrow as a \n     way to reduce over borrowing. Having institutions have some \n     skin in the game (or risk sharing) as a way to reduce over \n     borrowing. So those are some of the areas where we should be \n     able to have bipartisan support.\n       Now what can we actually get done this year?--My goal is as \n     I've said to the group earlier, the tax payers will pay our \n     salaries this year, and I think we ought to just continue to \n     work. Our number one priority is oversight on the elementary \n     and secondary education bill we passed last year. The bill's \n     not worth the paper it's printed on unless it's implement \n     properly and I don't want the Department of Education \n     granting back to itself all the decision making authority we \n     pushed out of Washington and to the states and classroom \n     teachers. So we're going to be watching that very closely and \n     having a number of hearings.\n       Number two--we have a very important biomedical innovation \n     research bill. There's never been a more important time for \n     scientific research The House has passed, the president's \n     interested in precision medicine and cancer research. We have \n     a genius, Francis Collins, heading the National Institutes of \n     Health. We want to do our part. So that's going to take some \n     time.\n       The third of three top priorities is reauthorization of \n     Higher Education Act.\n       Maybe we can do it all this year. This year is challenging \n     because it's not only an election year, it's a presidential \n     election year. So we have some really interesting proposals \n     on higher education from some of the candidates. You've heard \n     those. And those could box things up in the Senate as we try \n     to deal with them.\n       But we're going to go ahead and take some of these \n     proposals that I've just described, and bring them through \n     our committee, pass them in the House of Representatives, and \n     look for opportunities to bring them to the Senate floor.\n       I'm really proud of what we did in elementary and secondary \n     education. Because I think it's really good policy. It's \n     carefully written, it was vetted by everybody who is involved \n     in the education system, and I think it will govern \n     elementary and secondary education for the next 15-20 years \n     because it will be difficult to change.\n       I'd like to do the same thing for higher education. Over \n     the last eight reauthorizations, the stack of regulations has \n     gone like that. I'd like to start the stack of regulations \n     going downward like that. I'd like your advice as we begin to \n     do it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/senate-section/article/S872-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S872-S873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           RECOGNIZING RUTGERS UNIVERSITY-NEWARK DEBATE TEAM\n\n Mr. BOOKER.

By a 2-to-1 \ndecision, the RU-N team defeated UC Berkeley to be crowned champion. \nGoing into the 2015-2016 season, this means the Rutgers University-\nNewark team will be ranked the No. 1 team in the Nation.\n  I am proud to acknowledge this landmark achievement in the Rutgers \nUniversity-Newark Debate Team's history and its efforts to support \ndebate at all age levels.\n  Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/senate-section/article/S873-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO BEVERLY ANDERSON\n\n Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Beverly \nAnderson of Conrad, MT, for her incredible generosity and service to \nthe people of her community. Beverly has a huge heart for helping those \nin need and has truly cared for those around her.\n  Beverly previously worked as an emergency dispatcher before taking on \nthe many volunteer roles that she now serves in. She is head of her \ncommunity's Salvation Army, serves at the food bank every Friday, and \nvolunteers for the local abused spouses advocate groups, DFS and CASA.\n  She has a heart for children as well. Every week, she plans crafts \nand other afterschool activities for area students. Beverly prioritizes \nspending time helping underprivileged children and, every year, \ncoordinates local efforts to gather school supplies for those in need.\n  As a woman of faith, Beverly regularly takes individuals in recovery \nfrom drug abuse with her to church and out to lunch. She visits and \nprays for those who are sick and dying in her community and takes a \nspecial effort to cook food and provide encouragement for the bereaved \nfamilies.\n  During the holiday season, Beverly is known to secretly shop for \nchildren of families in need and gathers people across town to \nparticipate in a ``knock and drop'' with presents. She also delivers \nturkey dinners to families at both Thanksgiving and Christmas. A proud \nparent of two soldiers, Beverly gladly promotes every veteran activity \nthat takes place in her community and helps the VFW send gift boxes to \nsoldiers every Christmas.\n  I am humbled by Beverly's heart for service and her selfless \ncommitment to putting the needs of others before herself. She is truly \na standout in her community and has made Montana a much better place. \nIt is with deep gratitude that I honor her today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/senate-section/article/S873-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING JESSE DANNELS\n\n Mr. DAINES.

Jesse's motivation and happy spirit impacted \neveryone he met. His love for sports was evident in his swimming, \nfootball, track, and wrestling. He excelled at everything he did. His \nteammates were not only friends, but brothers. Jesse's willingness to \nalways help others was inspiring.

Dean Gianchetta has been a \npart of the University of Montana staff for 41 years and has served as \ndean of the School of Business for the past 30 years.\n  Dean Gianchetta has been an inspiration not only for his staff, but \nalso for his students. Dean Gianchetta is an enthusiastic teacher who \nhas instilled an excitement for learning and a commitment to service in \nhis staff and students. He created positive environment for his staff \nand students, making experiences at the University of Montana enjoyable \nfor all.\n  Dean Gianchetta made sure the school of business could support \nstudents for generations to come through its scholarship program. He \nworked tirelessly to promote the University of Montana School of \nBusiness Administration name to gain the financial support needed to \neducate Montana's next generation of leaders. His dedication not only \nresulted in donations for the school's scholarship program, but also \nfunding for new school buildings, including the Gallagher Business \nBuilding, which opened in 1996, and the Gilkey Center for Executive \nEducation, which opened earlier this year.\n  One of Dean Gianchetta's most admired accomplishments is the founding \nof the American Indian Business Leaders. It began at the University of \nMontana and, today, has grown to be a national organization that \nincludes 76 high schools, colleges, and universities. Dean Gianchetta \nhas also helped the University of Montana develop new college majors in \nmarketing and management, a minor in business program, and six \ncertificates in several different areas.\n  Dean Larry Gianchetta does not boast about the accomplishments he has \nmade while at the University of Montana School of Business, but they \ncan be clearly seen not only on the University of Montana campus, but \nalso throughout the country. I may be a Bobcat, but I recognize the \ntremendous impact this Grizzly has made on our State and our Nation. He \nwill be greatly missed at the University of Montana, but I am confident \nthat the legacy he's left will be carried on for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/senate-section/article/S873-4", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S873-S874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO MIRANDA CROSS AND KATE KROLICKI\n\n Mr. HELLER.

This is an incredible accolade, \nrecognizing the very best students across the Nation, and I extend my \nmost sincere congratulations to these two Nevadans.\n  USSYP was created in 1962 to bring excellent students to our Nation's \nCapital to gain knowledge and insight on the three branches of \ngovernment. Every year, this program brings 104 outstanding students to \nWashington, DC, for a weeklong program highlighting the Federal \nGovernment. Students also receive a $5,000 undergraduate college \nscholarship to encourage them to continue on in their scholastic \npursuits. Students selected for the program generally fall in the top 1 \npercent academically within their State. Both Miss Krolicki and Miss \nCross have excelled in their academic ambitions and are certainly \ndeserving of the opportunity to attend this weeklong program.\n  Miss Cross is a student at Reno High School and serves on the Washoe \nCounty School District's student advisory board. She is a proud member \nof the Future Business Leaders of America, taking three State \nchampionship titles and serving as a national finalist. She\n\n[[Page S874]]\n\nis also the founder of Girls in STEM. Miss Cross is a role model to her \npeers, and I am thankful to have such an ambitious Nevadan representing \nour State at this prestigious event.\n  Miss Krolicki attends George Whitell High School and serves her peers \nin a number of student activities. She is president of her senior \nclass, a member of the student issues committee, president of the \nNational Honor Society and Key Club, and captain of the varsity soccer \nteam. I am grateful that Miss Krolicki served the State of Nevada as an \nintern in my office last summer. She is truly an inspiration to her \npeers and future generations of Nevadans.\n  Both students are shining examples of what hard work and \ndetermination can accomplish. They should be proud of their selection \nin this competitive process.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Tina \nQuigley for all of her hard work and dedication to the State of Nevada. \nMs. Quigley has gone above and beyond in her role with the Regional \nTransportation Commission of Southern Nevada, RTC, bringing efficient \ntransportation methods to the region and driving economic development.\n  Ms. Quigley was raised in Petaluma, CA, and initially planned to have \na career in aviation. After graduating with a bachelor's degree in \naviation business and planning from Embry Riddle Aeronautical \nUniversity, she moved to Las Vegas and began working for former Clark \nCounty director of aviation Bob Broadbent at McCarran International \nAirport. Ms. Quigley began her career with RTC in 2005, accepting the \nposition of deputy general manager. In 2012, she was selected to lead \nthe commission as general manager.\n  Since accepting the position, Ms. Quigley has led numerous projects \nat RTC that have greatly benefitted the State. These projects have led \nto vast improvements to the area's transit system, bringing greater \naccessibility to the local community and the many tourists traveling \nthroughout the region. Under her leadership, RTC launched a transit \npass program for university students and staff, eight new rapid transit \nand express bus routes, and a residential route. The commission has \nalso added hundreds of new bus shelters, three transit terminals with \ncommuter parking lots, and a platinum LEED-certified transit hub in Las \nVegas. As a result of her successful initiatives, RTC was named one of \nthe most efficient transit providers in the Nation.\n  She has also served as a voice to the Nevada legislature, advocating \non behalf of southern Nevada's transportation and infrastructure needs. \nRecently, Ms. Quigley spearheaded work within the State to move forward \non the future Interstate 11, I-11. I am proud to have led the way in \nWashington, DC, on legislation including the extension of I-11, which \nwas signed into law. Developing critical infrastructure in our State is \nthe first step toward long-term job growth and sustainability, and I am \nthankful to have Nevadans like Ms. Quigley working as an ally in the \nfight to complete this initiative.\n  Over the last decade, Ms. Quigley has demonstrated an unwavering \ncommitment to bringing southern Nevada the transportation and \ninfrastructure tools it needs. The Silver State is fortunate to have \nMs. Quigley working to build a greater and more accessible Nevada. I \nask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in thanking Ms. Quigley \nfor her many contributions to our State. I wish her well as she \ncontinues her efforts to address southern Nevada's transportation \nneeds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/senate-section/article/S874-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/senate-section/article/S874-3", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/senate-section/article/S874-4", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:11 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3293.

A bill to increase public safety by punishing and deterring \nfirearms trafficking; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see my distinguished colleague from Maine \non the floor. Both of us would like to speak about how for years law \nenforcement in Vermont and elsewhere have sought more effective tools \nto go after straw purchasers and gun traffickers. Straw purchasers are \npeople who do not have a criminal record but who purchase firearms for \nother people, and all too often they enable violent criminals, drug \ntraffickers, and terrorists to obtain guns and to circumvent the \nbackground check requirements of Federal law.\n  This Senator finds it frustrating. I am a gun owner. I go through \nbackground checks, but when I think of drug traffickers getting guns \nthrough a straw purchaser, that is wrong. In fact, they ship guns with \nimpunity across State lines, not only from Vermont to other parts of \nNew England but also along the Southwest border, allowing them to \nconduct illegal gun transactions in our cities and towns. Law \nenforcement officers who have tried to stop this have been hamstrung \nbecause under current law there is no Federal statute specifically \nprohibiting either the practice of straw purchasing or firearms \ntrafficking. So today I am reintroducing legislation with the \ndistinguished Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, to plug those gaps in \nthe law. The Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms Act of 2016 would \nmake it a Federal crime to act as a straw purchaser of firearms or to \nillegally traffic firearms. It would also establish tough penalties for \nanyone who transfers a firearm when they have reasonable cause to \nbelieve it would be used in a drug transaction, crime or an act of \nterrorism. It will fix a loophole in the existing law and make it clear \nthat it is a crime to smuggle firearms out of the United States just as \nit is a crime to smuggle firearms into the United States. This \nlegislation answers the call from law enforcement to strengthen our \ninvestigative and prosecutorial tools to keep guns out of the hands of \ncriminals and terrorists.\n  We have to do more to protect our communities. The heartbreaking \nreports of mass shootings have become all too common and no corner of \nour country is immune from the tragedies that accompany everyday gun \nviolence--not even Vermont. Criminals in search of firearms exploit \ngaping loopholes in our gun laws, and they utilize straw purchasers and \ntrafficking networks or unregulated gun markets. In addition, the rise \nin addiction to heroin and opioids in the Northeast has exposed a new \nso-called iron pipeline of firearms trafficking. We are seeing firearms \nserve as a currency. You can use a firearm to buy illegal drugs like \nheroin. Addicts are being directed to straw purchase firearms for \ndealers because dealers who have criminal backgrounds could not pass a \nbackground check. In Vermont, for example, Federal investigators are \nreporting increasing instances of straw purchasers buying guns for drug \ndealers or finding guns that were purchased in Vermont being trafficked \nto criminals in other States, such as New York, Massachusetts, and \nConnecticut, where the guns are traded for heroin or used in violent \ncrimes.\n  This morning the Judiciary Committee approved bipartisan legislation \nthat takes a comprehensive approach to dealing with heroin and opioid \naddiction. I fought to include provisions to help law enforcement and \nto provide assistance to rural communities like we have in Vermont. \nPassing a gun trafficking bill is another way we can keep our \ncommunities safe.\n  Remember, straw purchasing and gun trafficking is not just tied to \ndrug trafficking. Even terrorists, like the suspected San Bernardino \nshooters, have utilized straw purchasers to acquire their guns. In the \nSan Bernardino case, the prosecutors did not have the option of \ncharging the friend of the terrorists with a straw purchasing offense. \nInstead, the only charge that was available against him for unlawfully \npurchasing the two rifles used in the mass shooting was a paperwork \nviolation of making a false statement. This Senator has heard from many \nprosecutors, Republicans and Democrats alike, that these paperwork \ncharges are wholly inadequate to deter or stop such dangerous conduct.\n  It is time to take action. Only Congress can fill the gap. Congress \nmust not become so numb to tragedy after tragedy that we fail to \nfulfill our responsibility to legislate. It is true that\n\n[[Page S878]]\n\nno one piece of legislation can prevent all criminals from acquiring \nfirearms, and it certainly will not solve the epidemic of gun violence, \nbut that is not an excuse for inaction.\n  I would hope all of us would agree that criminals and terrorists \nshould not have guns and that we should investigate and prosecute the \nstraw purchasers and gun traffickers who help criminals and terrorists \nget guns. Law enforcement officials have complained for years that they \nlack the statutory tools to effectively investigate and deter straw \npurchasers and gun traffickers. That is why this bill has such strong \nsupport from law enforcement groups such as the National Fraternal \nOrder of Police, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the \nMajor Cities Chiefs Association, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers \nAssociation, the National Tactical Officers Association, the National \nDistrict Attorneys Association, and the Association of Prosecuting \nAttorneys. This bill builds on the progress we made last Congress when \nI worked with Senator Durbin to introduce similar legislation. I want \nto acknowledge the tireless efforts of Senator Durbin and others on \nthis issue, and I am glad he is an original cosponsor of this important \nlegislation.\n  As are many others, I am proud to be a responsible gun owner. I enjoy \ntarget shooting in the backyard of my farmhouse--with a nice safe \nbackdrop I might add. I am deeply committed to the fundamental and \nindividual rights afforded in the Second Amendment. I know Senator \nCollins shares my commitment to protecting those constitutional rights, \nbut we also share a desire to go after violent criminals, drug \ntraffickers, and terrorists. We do not want to hand guns to violent \ncriminals, drug traffickers, and terrorists, and if they do get guns we \nwant to make sure law enforcement officials arrest the people who gave \nthem the guns to keep guns out of their hands. This legislation does \njust that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to my good friend, the senior \nSenator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my colleague \nfrom New England, Senator Leahy, in introducing our bill, the Stop \nIllegal Trafficking in Firearms Act. Our bill would strengthen Federal \nlaw to make it easier for prosecutors to effectively go after gun \ntraffickers while protecting fully the rights of the vast majority of \ngun owners who are law-abiding.\n  The practice of straw purchasing is intended to achieve one result, \nand that is to put a gun in the hands of criminals. Today traffickers \ntarget individuals who can lawfully purchase firearms and then use \nthose weapons to commit crimes. They exploit weaknesses in Federal law \nthat make prosecuting straw purchasers difficult and punishment for \nsuch a crime generally minimal.\n  The guns we are targeting in our bill are frequently sold and resold \nand trafficked across State lines, resulting in the proliferation of \nillegal firearms in our communities. This practice has fueled the \nviolence across our southern border associated with the Mexican drug \ncartels; it has spurred gun violence in our cities; and it has \ncontributed to the heroin crisis that is so devastating to our families \nand is undermining public safety in our communities.\n  Current Federal law makes preventing and prosecuting these offenses \nvery difficult for law enforcement. Right now, a straw purchaser can \nonly be prosecuted for lying on a Federal form. Essentially, that is \ntreated as if it were a paperwork violation. Our bill would create new, \nspecific criminal offenses for straw purchasing and trafficking in \nfirearms. Instead of a slap on the wrist, these crimes would be \npunishable for up to 15 years in prison for those who knowingly \npurchase a firearm for a prohibited person or had reason to believe \nthey would use the firearm in a prohibited way. For those straw \npurchasers who know or have reasonable cause to believe that the \nfirearm would be used to commit a crime of violence, that crime will be \npunishable for up to 25 years in prison.\n  It is not surprising that so many law enforcement groups have \nendorsed our commonsense proposal. It would provide them with an \neffective tool to fight the violence that too often goes hand in hand \nwith drug trafficking. Straw purchasing and the trafficking of firearms \nputs guns directly into the hands of drug dealers and violent criminals \nwho smuggle heroin into my State and so many other States. The heroin \nflooding our communities is reaching crisis proportions. In 2014, there \nwere a record 208 overdose deaths in the State of Maine, including 57 \ncaused by heroin, and the problem is only getting worse.\n  The problem of straw purchasing and drug and gun trafficking is \ndirectly linked to the heroin crisis. Law enforcement officers tell me \nthey have seen a major influx of drug dealers coming from out of State, \nstraight up I-95's ``iron pipeline'' and other interstate highways with \ndirect ties to gangs in major cities and ready to sell or trade \nprescription opiates and heroin for guns.\n  Oftentimes drug dealers and gang members follow a similar pattern. \nThey seek out and target addicts and they trade or sell them heroin for \nguns. These gang members with criminal records cross into Maine and \napproach these drug addicts to be their straw buyers because these \naddicts usually have clean records, so they can legally purchase the \nfirearms these criminals are seeking. The addict exchanges the gun for \nheroin to support his or her drug dependency, and that cycle is \nrepeated time and again. Those guns might be used in out-of-State \ncrimes or resold at a profit.\n  Recently, I received a truly shocking briefing from Federal law \nenforcement officials about the cases in Maine that fit this pattern. \nLet me tell you about one. Gang members trafficked in crack cocaine and \nheroin between New Haven, CT, and Bangor, ME, where I live. They were \nlater charged with acts of violence, including assault, armed \nrobberies, attempted murder, and murder. Law enforcement's \ninvestigation revealed that they had gotten the firearms by trading \nnarcotics for them in Bangor, ME. They then distributed these guns to \nother gang members.\n  The terrorist attack in San Bernardino, CA, is another tragic example \nof how straw purchasing can lead to horrific crimes. In this case it is \nbelieved that the individual straw-purchased two assault rifles that \nwere later used in the terrorist attack that killed 14 people. He has \nbeen charged with making a false statement in relation to the purchase \nof those firearms. Our bill, the Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms \nAct could have allowed law enforcement officials to charge this \nindividual with straw purchasing and the trafficking of firearms rather \nthan just a paperwork violation.\n  Our bill also strengthens existing laws that prohibit gun smuggling. \nRight now it is illegal for someone to smuggle a firearm into the \nUnited States with the intent to engage in drug trafficking or violent \ncrime.\n  To combat the drug cartels operating across our southern border, we \nmust also prohibit firearms from being trafficked out of the United \nStates for these illegal purchases and purposes. In doing so, our bill \nwould provide an important tool to combatting the trafficking \norganizations that are exporting firearms and ammunition from the \nUnited States and into Mexico, where they are used by drug cartels that \nare fueling the heroin crisis here at home.\n  According to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, \nout of the nearly 105,000 firearms recovered in Mexico in the last 5 \nyears, more than 73,000 were sourced to the United States. Similarly, a \nlarge percentage of guns used in crimes in our largest cities were \ntrafficked across State lines.\n  Let me emphasize that our bill protects the Second Amendment rights \nof law-abiding citizens. It protects legitimate, private gun sales and \nis drafted to avoid sweeping in innocent transactions and placing \nunnecessary burdens on lawful, private sales. It expressly exempts \ncertain transactions that are allowed under current law, such as gifts, \nraffles or auctions. There is absolutely nothing in our bill that \nwould, for example, prohibit a father from giving a hunting rifle to \nhis daughter as a gift. Furthermore, our bill expressly prohibits the \nact from being used to establish a Federal firearms registry, which I \nstrongly oppose.\n  This Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms Act takes guns out of the \nhands of criminals without infringing upon the constitutional rights of \nlaw-abiding citizens.\n  We have had many discussions in this Chamber, in our caucuses, and in \nour\n\n[[Page S879]]\n\ncommittees about the heroin crisis that is gripping far too many \nfamilies and communities in States across the Nation, including the \nState of Maine.\n  We need to take a comprehensive approach that includes strengthening \nlaw enforcement, providing treatment, and increasing education and \nprevention efforts. This bill is one piece of the law enforcement \npuzzle as we seek to combat this terrible epidemic that is ruining so \nmany lives.\n  I urge our colleagues to join Senator Leahy and me in supporting our \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KAINE (for himself and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 2548. A bill to establish the 400 Years of African-American \nHistory Commission, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the 400 Years of \nAfrican American History Commission Act.\n  During my tenure as Governor of Virginia I presided over the 400th \nanniversary of the founding of Jamestown, VA, by the English colonists \nin 1604. Last year I attended the 450th anniversary of the founding of \nSt. Augustine, FL, which celebrated Hispanic heritage. Both \ncommemorations included activities sponsored by federal commissions, \nwhich were voted on and passed by Congress. In three years, in 2019, we \nwill mark another key anniversary in American history. August 2019 will \nmark 400 years after the first documented arrival of Africans who came \nto English America by way of Point Comfort, Virginia. Although in 1619 \nslavery was not yet an institution the ``20 and odd'' Africans, as it \nwas recorded, were the first recorded group of Africans to be sold as \ninvoluntary laborers or indentured servants in the colonies.\n  Having commemorated the English and Spanish heritage of our founding \nthere is no reason it should be any different for the arrival and \ncontinuous presence of Africans and African Americans in the English \nsettlements in 1619. There is no dispute that the beginning of African \nand African American presence in what is now the United States was both \ntragic and regrettable. Slavery as an institution broke up families, \nresulted in the deaths of thousands, and caused irreparable damage to \nour American psyche. Though we should never forget that period of stain \non our history, slavery is not the only part of African American \nhistory. We must remember the whole story. African Americans have \ncontributed to the economic, academic, social, cultural and moral well-\nbeing of this nation.\n  So today with my cosponsor Senator Mark Warner, I introduce the 400 \nYears of African American History Commission Act, which would establish \na commission that would plan programs and activities across the county \nto recognize the arrival and influence of African Americans since 1619. \nIt is my hope the establishment of a ``400th'' commission would create \nan opportunity to bring continued national education about the \nsignificance the arrival of African Americans has made to the U.S., and \nthe contributions that have been made since 1619. Additionally, the \ncommission would create space to discuss race relations in America and \nfocus on dismantling the institutional systems that have adversely \nhindered African American progress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Mr. Tillis, Mr. Murphy, Mr. Menendez, \n        Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Brown, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. \n        Coons, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Markey, Mr. Merkley, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \n        Casey, and Ms. Warren):\n  S. 2551. A bill to help prevent acts of genocide and mass atrocities, \nwhich threaten national and international security, by enhancing United \nStates civilian capacities to prevent and mitigate such crises; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, on April 10, 2014, I introduced the Syrian \nWar Crimes Accountability Act in this Chamber. Three days earlier, the \nworld had marked the 20th anniversary of the genocide in Rwanda, one of \nthe most horrific events in modern history that unfolded as the world \nstood back and watched. At that time I noted that, ``[u]nfortunately, \nwe have not learned the lessons of the past. We must do better to not \nonly see that sort of atrocities never again occur under our watch . . \n.'' That statement was not only a reflection of my beliefs, but a \npromise to keep the issue of atrocity prevention in front of the Senate \nand the American people.\n  So today, under the heavy cloud of atrocities occurring in Syria, \nSouth Sudan, and elsewhere, I come to address this body again. I am \nhere today not to look backward about actions not taken. I am here \ntoday to stress that our job, our responsibility, is to make sure the \nUnited States has the tools--diplomatic, political, economic, and \nlegal--to take effective action before atrocities occur. Essential to \nthis is authorizing the Atrocities Prevention Board, and ensuring that \nthe United States Government has structures in place and the mechanisms \nat hand to better prevent and respond to potential atrocities.\n  President Obama, when he established the Atrocities Prevention Board \nin 2012, said that, ``preventing genocide [is] an `achievable goal' but \none that require[s] a degree of governmental organization that matches \nthe kind of methodical organization that accompanies mass killings''.\n  I am introducing the Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act of 2016 \nto ensure that we do just that. I am joined in this effort by Senators \nTillis, Murphy, Menendez, Shaheen, Brown, Gillibrand, Blumenthal, \nCoons, Mikulski, Markey, Merkley, and Boxer. This bill authorizes the \nBoard, which is a transparent, accountable, high-level, interagency \nboard that includes representatives at the assistant secretary level or \nhigher from departments and agencies across the U.S. Government.\n  The Board will meet monthly to oversee the development and \nimplementation of atrocity prevention and response policy, and \nadditionally address over the horizon potential atrocities through the \nuse of a wide variety of tools, so that we can take effective action to \nprevent atrocities from occurring.\n  This bill gives our Foreign Service Officers the training they need \nto recognize patterns of escalation and early warning signs of \npotential atrocities and conflict. With this training, we will, over \ntime, build atrocity prevention into the core skillset of our people on \nthe ground. They will be equipped to see the warning signs, analyze the \nevents, and engage early.\n  This bill also codifies the Complex Crises Fund, which has been a \ncrucial tool to our ability to quickly respond to emerging crises \noverseas, including potential mass atrocities and conflict. We used the \nComplex Crises Fund in Tunisia during their Arab Spring and in Sri \nLanka after its civil war. We've used it to respond quickly in Kenya \nand Cote d'Ivoire, where it has helped save lives.\n  Importantly, this bill builds greater transparency and accountability \ninto the structure of the Atrocities Prevention Board. Civil society \nwill have a say, and Congress will have a greater oversight role to \nmake sure we are getting this right.\n  Mr. President, this is a good bill. It does good things, and places \nthe United States on solid moral ground. But the moral argument alone \nis not enough. We must also remember that America's security, and that \nof our allies, is affected when civilians are slaughtered. Our security \nis impacted when desperate refugees stream across borders. Our security \nis affected when perpetrators of extraordinary violence wreak havoc on \nregional stability, destroying communities, families, and livelihoods. \nWe have seen groups like ISIS systematically targeting communities on \nthe basis of their ethnicity or religious beliefs and practices, \nincluding Yezidi, Christian, and Turkmen populations, but over sixty \nyears after the Holocaust, we still lack a comprehensive framework to \nprevent and respond to mass atrocities and genocide.\n  So, let this bill act as our framework, and also our call to action, \nso that when we use the phrase `never again', we know that we are \ntaking meaningful preventative action.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Whitehouse, and \n        Ms. Klobuchar):\n  S. 2552. A bill to amend section 875(c) of title 18, United States \nCode, to include an intent requirement; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n[[Page S880]]\n\n  \n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Interstate \nThreats Clarification Act, which is a necessary bill to clarify the \n``level of intent'' required to convict someone for making threats to \ninjure or kidnap another person.\n  I would like to thank Senators Durbin, Whitehouse, and Klobuchar for \ncosponsoring the bill.\n  In June 2015, the Supreme Court issued a decision in Elonis v. United \nStates, a case involving a man who was convicted for posting on \nFacebook ``crude, degrading, and violent'' threats against his co-\nworkers, ex-wife, law enforcement personnel, and a kindergarten class.\n  The man started posting the violent and threatening posts after his \nwife of nearly 7 years left him and took with her their two young \nchildren.\n  The threats made over Facebook caused his ex-wife to feel ``extremely \nafraid'' for her life, leading her to obtain a restraining order \nagainst him.\n  But that did not stop the man, who then posted on Facebook to \ncommunicate to his ex-wife that she ``[f]old up your [restraining \norder] and put it in your pocket / Is it thick enough to stop a \nbullet?''\n  That same month, he continued to make violent posts, including one \nthat indicated that ``[e]nough elementary schools in a ten mile radius \nto initiate the most heinous school shooting ever imagined / And hell \nhath no fury like a crazy man in a Kindergarten class.''\n  After viewing the posts, an FBI agent and another investigator \nvisited the man at his home, where he was ``polite but uncooperative.'' \nAfter they left, he posted the following:\n\n       Little Agent lady stood so close\n       Took all the strength I had not to turn the b**** ghost\n       Pull my knife, flick my wrist, and slit her throat\n       Leave her bleedin' from her jugular in the arms of her \n     partner.\n\n  The post went on to threaten what would happen if he was visited \nagain by the agent, including the possible use of explosives.\n  Due to these threats and others, the man was convicted for making \nthreats to inflict bodily harm under Section 875(c) of Title 18.\n  This law prohibits the transmission of a communication that contains \na threat to injure or kidnap another person.\n  The man appealed, saying the lower court did not apply the correct \nlevel of intent for a conviction.\n  When the case reached the Supreme Court, the Court overturned the \nconviction.\n  The Court found that the law requires the government to prove some \ntype of ``wrongful'' intent by the man--``negligence'' was not enough \nfor a criminal conviction under this law.\n  The Court's opinion, however, left significant ambiguity regarding \nwhat the government must prove for a conviction under the statute.\n  The Supreme Court simply did not specify the exact ``level of \nintent'' required for a conviction.\n  Justice Alito highlighted the problem of the ambiguity in his partial \ndissent, stating, ``[a]ttorneys and judges are left to guess'' as to \nthe level of intent required.\n  This ambiguity has left judges and prosecutors in the dark about what \nthe law requires, and has raised concerns among domestic violence \nvictims because prosecutors and judges may now be hesitant to fully \nenforce the law.\n  This is why Congressional action is necessary.\n  The Interstate Threats Clarification Act solves this ambiguity.\n  It clarifies that, under Section 875(c) of Title 18, the Government \nhas three options to obtain a conviction. It can prove that a defendant \neither intended, had knowledge, or recklessly disregarded the risk, \nthat the communication would be reasonably interpreted as a threat.\n  This is exactly what Justice Alito said would be sufficient in his \nopinion.\n  As Justice Alito stated when analyzing the statute in the context of \nthe case, ``[s]omeone who acts recklessly with respect to conveying a \nthreat necessarily grasps that he is not engaged in innocent conduct.''\n  I agree.\n  Someone who posts violent and crude threats to harm or kidnap judges, \ndomestic violence victims, vulnerable members of society, military \npersonnel, and law enforcement personnel, must be held accountable for \ntheir reckless conduct.\n  This bill clarifies for judges and attorneys alike the proof required \nto convict those who make such threats to injure or kidnap such \npersons.\n  I also appreciate the work done by a coalition of domestic violence \norganizations that have worked with me on the bill, including the \nNational Network to End Domestic Violence, the Domestic Violence Legal \nEmpowerment and Appeals Project, the National Center for Victims of \nCrime, the American Association of University Women, Futures Without \nViolence, Jewish Women International, Legal Momentum, National Alliance \nto End Sexual Violence, National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, \nthe National Domestic Violence Hotline, and the National Resource \nCenter on Domestic Violence.\n  I also appreciate the strong support for the bill from law \nenforcement, including the National District Attorneys Association, the \nFraternal Order of Police, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers \nAssociation, and the Major Cities Chiefs Association.\n  This bill is necessary to clarify Federal law about criminal threats \nand ensure that those who send them are prosecuted. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/senate-section/article/S880-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3306.

Res. 298\n\n       Whereas, on March 2, 1867, Congress enacted a naval \n     appropriations Act that authorized the Secretary of the Navy \n     to ``receive and accept a deed of gift, when offered by the \n     State of Connecticut, of a tract of land with not less than \n     one mile of shore front on the Thames River near New London, \n     Connecticut, to be held by the United States for naval \n     purposes'';\n       Whereas the people of Connecticut and the towns and cities \n     in the southeastern region of Connecticut subsequently gifted \n     land to establish a military installation to fulfil the \n     Nation's need for a naval facility on the Atlantic coast;\n       Whereas, on April 11, 1868, the Navy accepted the deed of \n     gift of land from Connecticut to establish a naval yard and \n     storage depot along the eastern shore of the Thames River in \n     Groton, Connecticut;\n       Whereas, between 1868 and 1912, the New London Navy Yard \n     supported a diverse range of missions, including berthing \n     inactive Civil War era ironclad warships and serving as a \n     coaling station for refueling naval ships traveling in New \n     England waters;\n       Whereas Congress rejected the Navy's proposal to close New \n     London Navy Yard in 1912, following an impassioned effort by \n     Congressman Edwin W. Higgins, who stated that this ``action \n     proposed is not only unjust but unreasonable and unsound as a \n     military proposition'';\n       Whereas the outbreak of World War I and the enemy use of \n     submarines to sink allied military and civilian ships in the \n     Atlantic sparked a new focus on developing submarine \n     capabilities in the United States;\n       Whereas October 18, 1915, marked the arrival at the New \n     London Navy Yard of the submarines G-1, G-2, and G-4 under \n     the care of the tender USS OZARK, soon followed by the \n     arrival of submarines E-1, D-1, and D-3 under the care of the \n     tender USS TONOPAH, and on November 1, 1915, the arrival of \n     the first ship built as a submarine tender, the USS FULTON \n     (AS-1);\n       Whereas, on June 21, 1916, Commander Yeates Stirling \n     assumed the command of the newly designated Naval Submarine \n     Base New London, the New London Submarine Flotilla, and the \n     Submarine School;\n       Whereas in the 100 years since the arrival of the first \n     submarines to the base, Naval Submarine Base New London has \n     grown to occupy more than 680 acres along the east side of \n     the Thames River, with more than 160 major facilities, 15 \n     nuclear submarines, and more than 70 tenant commands and \n     activities, including the Submarine Learning Center, Naval \n     Submarine School, the Naval Submarine Medical Research \n     Laboratory, the Naval Undersea Medical Institute, and the \n     newly established Undersea Warfighting Development Center;\n       Whereas in addition to being the site of the first \n     submarine base in the United States, Connecticut was home to \n     the foremost submarine manufacturers of the time, the Lake \n     Torpedo Boat Company in Bridgeport and the Electric Boat \n     Company in Groton, which later became General Dynamics \n     Electric Boat;\n\n[[Page S883]]\n\n       Whereas General Dynamics Electric Boat, its talented \n     workforce, and its Connecticut-based and nationwide network \n     of suppliers have delivered more than 200 submarines from its \n     current location in Groton, Connecticut, including the first \n     nuclear-powered submarine, the USS NAUTILUS (SSN 571), and \n     nearly half of the nuclear submarines ever built by the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the Submarine Force Library and Museum, located \n     adjacent to Naval Submarine Base New London in Groton, \n     Connecticut, is the only submarine museum operated by the \n     United States Navy and today serves as the primary repository \n     for artifacts, documents, and photographs relating to the \n     bold and courageous history of the Submarine Force and \n     highlights as its core exhibit the Historic Ship NAUTILUS \n     (SSN 571) following her retirement from service;\n       Whereas reflecting the close ties between Connecticut and \n     the Navy that began with the gift of land that established \n     the base, the State of Connecticut has set aside $40,000,000 \n     in funding for critical infrastructure investments to support \n     the mission of the base, including construction of a new dive \n     locker building, expansion of the Submarine Learning Center, \n     and modernization of energy infrastructure;\n       Whereas, on September 29, 2015, Connecticut Governor Dannel \n     Malloy designated October 2015 through October 2016 as \n     Connecticut's Submarine Century, a year-long observance that \n     celebrates 100 years of submarine activity in Connecticut, \n     including the Town of Groton's distinction as the Submarine \n     Capital of the World, to coincide with the centennial \n     anniversary of the establishment of Naval Submarine Base New \n     London and the Naval Submarine School;\n       Whereas Naval Submarine Base New London still proudly \n     proclaims its motto of ``The First and Finest''; and\n       Whereas Congressman Higgins' statement before Congress in \n     1912 that ``Connecticut stands ready, as she always has, to \n     bear her part of the burdens of the national defense'' \n     remains true today: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends the longstanding dedication and contribution \n     to the Navy and submarine force by the people of Connecticut, \n     both through the initial deed of gift that established what \n     would become Naval Submarine Base New London and through \n     their ongoing commitment to support the mission of the base \n     and the Navy personnel assigned to it;\n       (2) honors the submariners who have trained and served at \n     Naval Submarine Base New London throughout its history in \n     support of the Nation's security and undersea superiority;\n       (3) recognizes the contribution of the industry and \n     workforce of Connecticut in designing, building, and \n     sustaining the Navy's submarine fleet; and\n       (4) encourages the recognition of Connecticut's Submarine \n     Century by Congress, the Navy, and the American people by \n     honoring the contribution of the people of Connecticut to the \n     defense of the United States and the important role of the \n     submarine force in safeguarding the security of the United \n     States for more than a century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/senate-section/article/S883-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 2016\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I am here to speak in opposition to the \nnomination of Dr. Robert Califf to be the head of the Food and Drug \nAdministration.\n  I understand that Leader McConnell has asked that cloture be filed on \nDr. Califf's nomination. I understand that. I appreciate it. But we \nneed to have a debate in this country on opioids. While I am \ndisappointed that the majority leader is taking this step, I am \ncommitted to continuing to work on this issue, and using Dr. Robert \nCaliff's nomination is the means by which we can have a debate here on \nthe floor of the Senate on these issues.\n  (Mr. McCONNELL assumed the Chair.)\n  I am here to speak about a public health epidemic that every year \nkills more people in the United States than gun violence or motor \nvehicle accidents. What does this epidemic look like? Well, it looks \nlike this: Last year 30,000 Americans died of an opioid overdose. More \nthan 1,300 of those were from my home State of Massachusetts. In the \ncity of Brockton, MA, last month, in January, in the span of 48 hours, \n40 people overdosed on opioids. I will say that again. In Brockton, in \n48 hours, 40 people overdosed on opioids.\n  Between 2000 and 2013, the rate of death from heroin overdoses nearly \nquadrupled. The United States is less than 5 percent of the world's \npopulation, but we consume 80 percent of the world's opioid pain \nkillers. Drug overdoses are increasing the death rates of young adults \nin the United States to levels not experienced since the AIDS epidemic \nmore than 20 years ago. These skyrocketing death rates make these young \nadults the first generation since the time of the Vietnam war to \nexperience higher death rates in early adulthood than the generation \nthat preceded it.\n  Let's compare what we did as a nation when we confronted other deadly \nepidemics. A bipartisan majority in Congress funded more than $5 \nbillion to respond to Ebola. We dispatched the medical community and \npublic health experts. We built entire facilities to ensure we stopped \nthe spread of the deadly virus. Today, the Obama administration is \nasking Congress for $1.8 billion in emergency funding to fight the Zika \nvirus. Imagine if we applied the same commitment, the same urgency, the \nsame level of resources to the prescription drug and heroin epidemic.\n  Yet, despite this raging epidemic, one would think the Food and Drug \nAdministration--the agency responsible for the safety of all \nprescription drugs in the United States--would welcome every bit of \nexpert advice it can get from doctors and other public health \nprofessionals. In fact, the FDA's own rules call for it to establish an \nindependent advisory committee of experts to assist the agency when it \nconsiders a question that is controversial or of great public interest, \nsuch as whether to allow a new addictive prescription painkiller to be \nmarketed in the United States. Instead, the FDA has put a sign in its \nwindow: No Help Wanted. That is what this nomination of Dr. Robert \nCaliff is all about.\n  The FDA began turning its back on advisory committees in 2013 when an \nadvisory panel to review the powerful opioid painkiller Zohydro voted \n11 to 2 against recommending its approval. But the agency approved the \ndrug anyway, overruling the concerns voiced by experienced physicians \non the panel. Those experts criticized the agency for ignoring the \ngrowing epidemic fueled by OxyContin--the heavily abused prescription \npainkiller the FDA first approved back in 1995. They warned about the \ngrowing dangers of addiction, of abuse and dependence associated with \nthis entire class of opioid painkillers. Justifiably, the FDA was \nlambasted for its decision to approve Zohydro by public health experts, \ndoctors, Governors, and Members of Congress. But despite those warnings \nof the real-world dangers of abuse and dependence on these new, \nsupercharged opioid painkillers, the FDA willfully blinded itself to \nthe warning signs.\n  In 2014, in the wake of the Zohydro decision, the FDA twice skipped \nthe advisory committee process altogether when it approved the new \nprescription opioids Targiniq and Hysingla.\n  Then, in August of 2015, the FDA did it again, this time by bypassing \nan advisory committee on the question of a new use for OxyContin for \nchildren aged 11 to 16. This time the FDA even ignored its own rules \nthat specifically call for advisory committee advice when a question of \n``pediatric dosing'' is involved.\n  At this point, it became clear that the FDA was intentionally \nchoosing to forgo an advisory committee in order to avoid another \noverwhelming vote recommending against approval of a prescription \nopioid. And why did they do it? Well, because the FDA would then have \nhad to ignore yet another group of experts in order to continue\n\n[[Page S884]]\n\nits relentless march to put more drugs on the market.\n  With the OxyContin-for-kids decision, the FDA's reckless attitude \ntoward expert advice on drug safety went too far. Children whose brains \nare not yet fully developed are especially vulnerable to drug \ndependency and abuse. Yet the agency focused its so-called safety \nanalysis only on concerns about proper dosing, saying that it needed to \ntell doctors the proper doses for children who needed the drug. That is \njust plain wrong. We use experts to determine if child car seats are \nsafe, if toothpaste is safe, and if vaccines are safe. We should also \nuse experts to determine if those opioid painkillers are safe for the \nchildren in the United States of America.\n  We need to immediately reform the Food and Drug Administration's \nopioid approval process if we want to stop this epidemic of \nprescription drug and heroin addiction in the United States.\n  When I placed a hold on the nomination of Dr. Califf to head the FDA, \nI called on the FDA to commit to convening an advisory panel of outside \nexperts for every single opioid approval question it reviewed. Here is \nhow the FDA responded: It responded by committing to convene outside \nexperts but only for opioids that are not abuse-deterrent. Let's be \nclear. I want everyone in this Chamber to understand this: ``Abuse-\ndeterrent opioid'' is an oxymoron, like ``jumbo shrimp'' or \n``congressional expert.'' There is no such thing. When we hear the term \n``abuse-deterrent,'' think of pills that are tamper-resistant. They are \nsupposed to be difficult to crush or chew or cut open or tamper with. \nBut nothing about abuse-deterrent opioid prevents addiction. There is \nno such thing as abuse deterrence if you are suffering from addiction \nand have access to the Internet, where you can find out just how easy \nthese painkillers are to manipulate and abuse. Whether an opioid is \nabuse-deterrent or not hasn't prevented tens of thousands of people who \nhave had their wisdom teeth extracted or experienced lower back pain \nfrom getting addicted to these painkillers.\n  By refusing to convene advisory committees to reform all of its \nopioid approval decisions, the FDA continues to ignore outside experts \nwho could help stem the tide of tragic deaths and overdoses plaguing \nthis country.\n  This all started back with the FDA's 1995 approval of the original \nOxyContin--the moment in history that is widely recognized as the \nstarting point for the prescription opioid and heroin overdose epidemic \nin the United States. It started with the FDA. The FDA approved the \noriginal version of OxyContin--an extended-release opioid--believing \nthat it ``would result in less abuse potential, since the drug would be \nabsorbed slowly and there would not be an immediate `rush' or high that \nwould promote abuse.'' Since then, the claims that opioid is abuse-\ndeterrent have time and again proven oxymoronic.\n  FDA's own guidelines recognize the inherent contradiction in the term \n``abuse-deterrent,'' explaining:\n\n       It should be noted that [abuse-deterrent] technologies have \n     not yet been proven successful at deterring the most common \n     form of abuse--swallowing a number of intact capsules or \n     tablets to achieve a feeling of euphoria. Moreover, the fact \n     that a product has abuse-deterrent properties does not mean \n     there is no risk of abuse.\n\n  That is from the FDA's own guidelines.\n  In many cases, the FDA approved so-called abuse-deterrent opioids \ndespite warnings from the medical community about the potential for \nabuse. And when it wasn't turning a blind eye to the warnings of \nexperts, the FDA simply didn't engage them at all in approval of \nopioids with abuse-deterrent properties. With numerous approvals of so-\ncalled abuse-deterrent opioids since 2010, the agency convened advisory \ncommittees for less than half of them.\n  This issue of abuse deterrence is not a hypothetical concern. The new \npolicy announced by the FDA would not have guaranteed an advisory panel \nfor the OxyContin that is on the market today and being sold in tens of \nmillions of doses or for the other recently approved opioids that have \nraised serious concerns from public health and medical experts from \naround our country. The FDA is attempting to set up a system where \nnothing really changes.\n  We will not solve the prescription drug crisis with an FDA that \noperates with business as usual and continues to turn its back to \nexternal experts. The FDA needs to welcome outside expert advice and \nmust convene expert advisory panels for all opioid approval decisions, \nperiod. Until the FDA makes that commitment, I am going to continue to \nraise my voice in opposition to the nomination of Dr. Califf.\n  This is an issue that is central in our country. The terrorist phone \ncall that families in America are afraid of getting is not one from \noverseas; it is that a member of their family has fallen victim to this \nprescription drug opioid crisis. It is in every city, every town in our \ncountry. We have seen a quadrupling of the number of heroin deaths in \nour country in the last 13 years, and 80 percent of them started with \nOxyContin, with Percocet, with one of these prescription drugs.\n  We need the FDA to do the right thing, and until they do, we need to \ndebate out here on the floor what the responsibilities will be of this \nnew FDA Commissioner, because they have been unwilling to change their \npolicy. Until they do, these people and communities all across our \ncountry are going to be helpless. They are going to be helpless because \nfamilies think that if a bottle is given to them by an expert, they can \ntrust it. And when their children die--when their children die--they \nask themselves the question: Could I have done more? It starts with the \nFDA. It starts with MEA, mandatory education for physicians. It starts \nthere. If we don't do this, then those families are still going to be \nhaving the same result year after year after year.\n  I thank the majority leader for sitting and hearing my objections. \nThe majority leader and I have had many conversations about this \nsubject, and I know of his deep concern on this issue. I think this is \nsomething that can be corrected. I hope it can be corrected. It must be \ncorrected.\n  I thank the majority leader for staying to hear my presentation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/11/senate-section/article/S884-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
