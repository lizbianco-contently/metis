Mr. President, thanks to the bill managers' efforts \nthat I just referred to, along with the years-long work undertaken by \nMembers on both sides--Senator Hoeven in particular--we expect this \nbipartisan bill to finally pass the Senate.\n  We expect the filibuster of good American jobs to soon come to an \nend. That is good news for the Senate. It is even better news for the \npeople we represent. It would show their Congress is capable of defying \nthe powerful special interests that oppose Keystone so we can get \nthings done for the middle class.\n  Constructing this infrastructure project would pump literally \nbillions of dollars into our economy. It would support thousands of \njobs, and it would do it all with minimal environmental impact. That is \naccording to what we have heard from the President's own State \nDepartment. So it makes sense to get this bipartisan legislation to the \nPresident for his signature. We hope he will sign the Keystone jobs \nbill into law. The President should expect more good ideas to head his \nway.\n  That is the goal of this new Congress. We want to get Washington \nfunctioning again, and we want to pass commonsense ideas. The Keystone \ndebate is showing how we can do both.\n  One other issue. I am certainly glad to see President Obama dropped \nhis plan to make it harder for the middle class to save for college \nwith 529s. I fought to ensure these plans were tax-free at the Federal \nlevel. Thanks to this incentive to save, literally millions of \nAmericans use 529s to help prepare for college expenses. These are good \nplans that promote responsible savings. I am not sure why President \nObama would have sought to undermine them in the first place, but it \ncertainly is good to see the President coming around to Republicans' \npro-middle-class view on this matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/28/senate-section/article/S549-8", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 30 days from today, on February 27, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, the\n\n[[Page S550]]\n\nlead agency in protecting America from terrorism, will run out of \nmoney. The only way to prevent this important government agency from \nshutting down is for Congress to pass legislation to fund the \nDepartment and to do it quickly.\n  This morning, we moved to the second reading, what is known as a \nclean appropriations bill, which will provide resources for this \ncritical Department. I hope the Senate can take that up quickly and \npass it quickly as well.\n  We should not even be debating the funding for the Homeland Security \nDepartment. Every other government agency has been funded through the \nend of the fiscal year, the end of September, but not the Department of \nHomeland Security. The House Republicans insisted on separating this \ncritical agency from the rest of the Federal Government and treating it \ndifferently, giving it temporary funding--what is known as a continuing \nresolution--and making it extremely difficult for the Department of \nHomeland Security to do its job to keep America safe.\n  Why did the Republicans insist that this one agency be treated \ndifferently, funded in a way that it can't do its job effectively? They \nare using the deadline, the end of February, on this Department's \nfunding in an attempt to force the Senate to accept extreme anti-\nimmigrant amendments that have been attached to the homeland security \nbill in the House. The House Republicans' message to the Senate is very \nstraightforward: Accept our controversial immigration amendments or we \nwill shut down the Homeland Security Department. That is the height of \nirresponsibility. Now is not the time to play politics with homeland \nsecurity.\n  Just this weekend the world witnessed another horrible terrorist act, \nthe beheading of a Japanese hostage by the terrorist group ISIS. In \nlight of the terrorist threat we currently face, it would be the height \nof irresponsibility to shut down the Department of Homeland Security as \nthreatened by the House Republicans. That is one of the key government \nagencies charged with protecting Americans.\n  Today I am calling on the Senate majority leader for a clean \nappropriations bill that we moved forward on the calendar this morning. \nLet's pass this bill. Let's make sure we do it in a timely way. Let's \nfund this Department.\n  Some Republican leaders are arguing, well, it is not such a big deal, \ngiving temporary funding to the Department of Homeland Security, \nplaying roulette with the prospects of whether it will be funded for \nthe rest of this fiscal year.\n  Last week the Republican chairman of the Senate homeland security \ncommittee here in the Senate reportedly said, and I quote, that he \n``isn't that concerned about the potential shutdown of the Homeland \nSecurity Department.''\n  Jeh Johnson, the Secretary of Homeland Security, has a much different \nview. He says our homeland security is already at risk because the \nDepartment is operating under a short-term funding bill known as a \ncontinuing resolution. Listen to what Secretary Johnson said: ``As long \nas this Department continues to operate on a [continuing resolution], \nwe are prevented from funding key homeland security initiatives \n[including] new grants to state and local law enforcement [and] \nadditional border security resources.''\n  How many times have we heard from the other side of the aisle the \nhighest priority in America is our border security? Many of us agreed \nand voted for a comprehensive immigration reform that folded more \nresources than ever into protecting the border. Now the same people, \nthe same elected officials, who have been arguing for a strong border \nare underfunding the Department with that responsibility. The Secretary \nreminds us their approach to this is going to jeopardize investments in \nborder security.\n  What are these amendments the House Republicans feel so strongly \nabout that they are willing to risk the funding of this critical \nagency? The bill the House passed would defund President Obama's \nimmigration policies, including the Deferred Action for Childhood \nArrivals Program known as DACA.\n  A quick history about how we reached the point we are at today. It \nwas 14 years ago when I introduced the DREAM Act. The DREAM Act was \ndesigned to take care of children brought to America by their parents, \nchildren who were undocumented, and to give those children a chance, if \nthey led a good life and finished school, if they were prepared to go \nto college or join our military, to have a path to legal status. Over \nthe years this has been debated widely. Even many Republican leaders \nhave stepped up and said, well, it is fundamentally just. Why would you \nhold the children responsible for a decision made by their parents to \ncome to this country? Why would you jeopardize the future of a child \nbecause the parents came here, overstayed their visa, or failed to file \nthe necessary papers for their child? Even former Arkansas Governor \nHuckabee, interviewed this Sunday on television, made that very point. \nYou don't arrest a parent for speeding in the front seat and then \narrest the baby sitting in the back seat for speeding. He made that \npoint in light of his decisions as the Governor of Arkansas.\n  Over time this concept of the DREAM Act has been moving toward \nacceptance by both political parties but moving very slowly. For 14 \nyears we have been debating this one simple idea, that children should \nnot be held responsible for the wrongdoing of their parents, that young \npeople brought to this country and undocumented should be given a \nchance. And, of course, 2\\1/2\\ years ago, President Obama did \nsomething. He did it at the request of many Senators, including myself. \nWe wrote to him and said, Mr. President, while the Senate and Congress \ndebate the future of the DREAM Act, there are literally thousands of \nthese young people who have no future in America. They don't know which \nway to turn. They can't get drivers licenses. They can't go to school \nwith any government assistance. They don't have any basic idea what \ntheir future is going to be.\n  The President said, here is what I will do. I will create this \nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, the DACA Program. If \nthese young people will come forward, if they will submit a filing fee \nto cover the cost of the program, if they will submit themselves to \nbackground checks, then we will give them temporary status in America--\ntemporary status in America. We are not making them citizens or \ndeclaring them legal forever. We are saying they can go to school and \nwork without the fear of deportation.\n  We estimate there are 2 million young people in our Nation of 350 \nmillion-plus who would qualify for this DACA treatment. Six hundred \nthousand have in fact registered in the 2\\1/2\\ years since the \nPresident's decision. DACA put on hold deportation so these young \npeople who grow up in this country would have a chance. These are the \nDREAMers. They are the ones we have referred to over and over on the \nfloor and tell their stories.\n  Think about it. America is already invested in these young people. We \npaid for their education. We sent them to the classrooms in the \nschools. They stood there every morning by their desk, hand over their \nheart, pledging allegiance to the same flag we pledged allegiance to \nthis morning. They sang the only national anthem they have ever known. \nThey are just asking for a chance.\n  Over the years I have come to the floor to tell their stories because \nleaving the explanation at this point really doesn't touch on the \nreality of who these DREAMers are. I am going to tell another story \nthis morning, and I want the record to show this young man I am about \nto speak about, Juan Rios. He is a person whom the House Republicans \nwant to deport. They have said by their vote--by the amendment they put \non this appropriations bill--they want Juan Rios to leave the United \nStates of America. That is their goal, deport the DREAMers, all of \nthose who have signed up for DACA and those who might sign up. That is \njust part of what they are trying to achieve. But that to me is the \nstarting point that ought to be our starting point for debate.\n  Juan Rios was brought to the United States when he was 10 years old. \nIn high school Juan decided what his calling was. It was military \nservice. He became a leader in the Air Force Junior ROTC in his high \nschool, group commander, and armed drill team captain, and he rose to \nthe rank of cadet lieutenant colonel.\n  This photo is of Juan in uniform in high school. His dream was to \nattend\n\n[[Page S551]]\n\nthe Air Force Academy. Of course, it is a dream that couldn't happen. \nHe is undocumented. Instead, he enrolled in Arizona State University.\n  In 2010 Juan Rios graduated from Arizona State University. What \ncourse did he study? It was a degree in aeronautical engineering. He is \nsome student.\n  This is a picture of him at his graduation. But after he graduated \nwith his degree in engineering, he didn't know which way to turn. He \ncouldn't enlist in the military like he wanted to. He couldn't work as \nan engineer because he was undocumented. His talents were wasted. He \nsent me a letter at that time and said:\n\n       The United States of America is the country I want to live \n     my life in, where I want to flourish as a productive citizen, \n     where I want to grow old among my lifelong friends and where \n     I want to one day fall in love and raise a family.\n\n  So what happened to Juan after DACA, when the Executive order gave \nhim the opportunity to have temporary protection and not be deported? \nIn February 2013, after signing up for DACA, he interviewed for his \nfirst engineering job. Today Juan is working as a mechanical engineer \nin the semiconductor industry.\n  At the age of 27 he learned how to drive and bought his first car. \nAfter living in Arizona for 17 years, he was finally able to visit the \nGrand Canyon for the first time.\n  Juan sent a letter to me last week and said:\n\n       I am fortunate to have found the opportunity to prove \n     myself as a professional and to work in a place where I feel \n     my contributions are valued and recognized. The past two \n     years have changed my life in every way imaginable. I think \n     DACA is a responsibility, a privilege, and an opportunity for \n     everyone who receives it to demonstrate that we as a \n     community of Dreamers have so much to contribute to society.\n\n  Juan Rios is trying to prove to everyone that he is worth this \ninvestment, that he is worth this trust. He has done it. He will \ncontinue to do it.\n  So why in the world do the House Republicans want to deport Juan \nRios? Why do they want to give up on this young man, with his idealism, \nhis determination, and his record of accomplishment? Why do they want \nhim to leave the United States of America?\n  Well, it is because he was brought here as a 5-year-old--\nundocumented. For that decision by his parents, the House Republicans \nwould say: We have no use for Juan Rios. We don't want him to stay.\n  There are so many other stories similar to this one. It is clear that \nDACA works for America. I have been to Chicago so many times and met \nwith these DREAMers. I know these young men and women. I believe in \nthem, and I believe they are going to make a difference in this \ncountry.\n  I also want to remind my friends on the Republican side of the aisle \nthat America is a nation of immigrants. Our diversity is our strength. \nWe come to this great country from so many different places, and we \nbring so many different cultures, languages, religions, ethnic \nbackgrounds, and cuisines. We bring it all here, and we make it part of \nAmerica's future.\n  I know a little bit about this story because my mother was an \nimmigrant herself. She was brought here at the age of 2. Today I stand \non the floor of the Senate representing the great State of Illinois. \nThat is my story. That is my family story. That is America's story.\n  There is something else I would say to the critics of immigrants. \nImmigrants bring something special to America. Each one of these \nimmigrant families took the greatest risk of their lives to come to \nAmerica. Some of them literally risked their lives to do it. Others \ncame to this country where they didn't speak the language, knew very \nfew people, and didn't have any idea what their future would be. But \nthey had heard about this America place, and they believed this was a \nbetter opportunity for them and for their kids. I am sure that is what \nbrought my family to this country--my mother to this country--and I am \nsure that is what has brought a lot of people.\n  That is part of our DNA. Those immigrants, their courage, and their \ndetermination to be part of America and its future really bring to this \ncountry an energy that just can't be matched in many other places in \nthe world.\n  House Republicans would kill that dream, and they have showed us that \nby this horrible amendment they have attached to the Department of \nHomeland Security appropriations.\n  They think America is stronger if we tell Juan Rios to leave. I \ndon't. It is shameless to play politics with the life of this young man \nand hundreds of thousands of others. It is just shameless to put \nhomeland security funding at risk, to punish Juan Rios for having been \nbrought to this country as a child.\n  The House Republicans feel so strongly about deporting DREAMers they \nare willing to hold up the homeland security funding bill. The House \nRepublicans are telling the Senate and the President: Deport the \nDREAMers or we are going to shut down the agency responsible for \nprotecting America from terrorism.\n  I hope the Senate majority leader will reject this blackmail, and I \nhope that in the spirit of the Senate, where we came together on a \nbipartisan basis to pass immigration reform almost 2 years ago, we will \nreject this hate-filled message from the House Republicans.\n  For our part, Senate Democrats will insist that the Department of \nHomeland Security be funded and that the President have the authority--\nwhich every President has had--to establish his own immigration \npolicies.\n  I see there is another colleague on the floor. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/28/senate-section/article/S551-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last November the American people sent \nan unmistakable message to Washington, DC. Voters across the country \nsaid they were tired of the gridlock and they were tired of the lack of \naction by the Democratic-led Senate.\n  Well, we are now working again for the American people because voters \nsaid it was time for a new majority--the Republican majority--to get \nthe Senate working again and to get America on a better course. \nRepublicans heard the message. We heard it loud and clear, and we have \nbeen doing exactly what the American people have sent us here to do.\n  Under Republican leadership the Senate is working again for the \nAmerican people, and the best example of that is the bill we are \nconsidering now in the Senate on the Keystone XL Pipeline project. The \nObama administration has blocked and delayed this job-creating project \nfor 6 years. Now Republicans are moving forward. We are moving it \nforward as well. We have had an open debate on the bill, and we have \nallowed amendments to the bill.\n  Imagine that. We are actually debating legislation on the floor of \nthe Senate, and Senators are actually offering amendments to that bill.\n  We are all familiar with the milestone the Senate reached last week. \nLast year, under the Democratic leadership, there were a total of 15 \nup-or-down votes on amendments--15 for the entire year under Harry \nReid. That is all the Democratic leader allowed.\n  But by the end of the day last Thursday, we completed our 25th \namendment vote. Just 22 days into the year, the Senate had already been \nmore productive on amendments than it was on 365 days under Democratic \nleadership.\n  We didn't stop there. Today the Senate will vote on up to 18 more \namendments to the Keystone jobs bill and then another 12 after that.\n  Several Democratic Senators complained the other day about what they \nsaid was a lack of amendment votes on this bill. Well, where were they \nlast year when the Democratic leader allowed only 15 votes to get an \nup-or-down vote on an amendment for an entire year?\n\n[[Page S552]]\n\n  Senator Schatz and Senator Markey, two Democrats, had never had a \nvote on one of their amendments in the Senate before Republicans gave \nthem a vote last week. Senator Coons will get his first vote on an \namendment today.\n  All of these amendments aren't the only way again the Senate is \nworking for the American people. Another is going to happen on \nThursday. The Energy and Natural Resources Committee is going to hold a \nhearing on a bill that I introduced earlier this month.\n  We have four Republican sponsors on that bill and four Democratic \nsponsors: Senators Heinrich, Bennet, Heitkamp, and Kaine. It is the LNG \nPermitting Certainty and Transparency Act. Now Senator Toomey, a \nRepublican, was added as cosponsor, and Senator Udall, a Democrat, was \nadded as cosponsor. So there are five Republican and five Democratic \ncosponsors.\n  This is an idea that the House considered last year, and it passed \nwith bipartisan support. Forty-six Democrats voted in favor of \nincreasing America's exports of liquefied natural gas. The House is \nexpected to vote again and pass a bill like this one this week. This is \nan idea that has bipartisan support in the Senate as well. So it should \nbe a no-brainer. Plans to send American energy overseas are wrapped up \nin Washington redtape, and Americans who are eager for the jobs on \nthese projects continue to wait.\n  This bipartisan bill will do a lot to fix that problem. It would set \nclear deadlines for Washington to make timely decisions on these import \npermits--export permits, important permits to export liquefied natural \ngas.\n  Once there has been an agreement and an appropriate environmental \nreview, the Secretary of Energy will have only 45 days to act on a \npermit application. Increasing American natural gas exports would do \nthree important things.\n  No. 1, it would create jobs. That is, of course, most important. \nThese are American jobs, jobs for Americans. The private sector wants \nto create these jobs--not government jobs but private sector jobs.\n  No. 2, it would help to reduce our Nation's trade deficit. The trade \ndeficit currently stands at $39 billion.\n  No. 3, these exports would support our American allies. Last year \nRussia invaded Ukraine and seized control of Crimea. Why? Largely \nbecause of the natural gas facilities there.\n  There was a group of Senators who were actually in Ukraine. I was one \nof them the day the Russian helicopters landed just north of the gas \nplants there. This was about the gas. Well, we could help reduce the \nthreat Russia poses to Europe by offering more options for our allies \nto buy American natural gas.\n  There is no good reason for the endless delays on these export \npermits. Our bill would speed up the process. These export projects are \njob creators with bipartisan support. They have been stuck in \nWashington's bureaucrat gridlock.\n  The Senate is going to be acting to get these projects moving. That \nis why the American people sent us to the Senate. It is how the Senate \nis supposed to work. Committees consider the ideas on both sides, the \nbills get debated in committee and on the floor, and every Senator has \na chance to talk about it and then to offer amendments that might \nimprove legislation. That is how it has always worked before. It is a \nslow process. It was meant to produce consensus.\n  The majority leader, Harry Reid, changed all of that. The Democratic \nmajority leader did everything he could to block amendments and to \nbypass and to skip committees. Did he do it to make better laws? No, \nnot at all. Did he do it to speed up action so the Senate could be more \nproductive? Of course not.\n  It was a transparent campaign tactic to keep vulnerable Democratic \nSenators from having to take tough votes. Even Democrats couldn't get \nvotes on their amendments. Well, that gimmick by Harry Reid--the \ncampaign tricks--failed, and the American people were not fooled.\n  That is one of the reasons voters across the country chose \nRepublicans to lead both Houses of Congress. The American people said \nthey deserve better, and the American people are absolutely right. The \nAmerican people want Democrats to start working with Republicans to get \nthings done.\n  That is what Senator Heinrich and I--and others who are cosponsoring \nthis measure today--are doing with our bill. The American people want \nan honest debate on important issues such as the Keystone jobs bill, as \nwell. The American people want their representatives in the Senate to \nbe able to offer amendments to bills such as this one.\n  That is how the Senate should work. That is how the Senate is working \nunder Republican leadership, and that is how it is going to continue to \nwork.\n  So I am pleased to see the votes are going to be held on these \namendments. I am pleased to stand and cast my vote on behalf of the \npeople of Wyoming. I look forward to more votes, more debate, and more \nconsideration of ideas from both sides of the aisle.\n  It is interesting that President Obama has threatened to veto eight \nseparate pieces of legislation so far this year. It is interesting to \nthe point that it has a headline in today's USA Today, page 2A: ``Obama \nveto threats are at record high.'' Veto threats are at a record high.\n  The President has said he will veto another two bills that haven't \neven been introduced yet. If they haven't even been introduced, how \ndoes he know what they are going to say? How does he know what they are \ngoing to say once they go through the process of being amended, passed \nin the House, passed in the Senate, and get to his desk?\n  The President should reconsider each and every one of these veto \nthreats.\n  The Senate is moving forward. The White House is putting up \nroadblocks. That is not what the American people were asking for in \nNovember. The American people want us to work together to get things \ndone, to make their lives better. It is about them. It is not about the \npeople who sit in this body, it is about the American people--their \nquality of life, people living paycheck to paycheck, day to day, what \ntheir lives are about.\n\n  The Republican Congress and this Senate continue to listen to the \nAmerican people. The President of the United States continues to ignore \nthem.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MORAN.

Mr. President, we have had a lot of talk--certainly in the \nlast year or so and certainly as this new session of Congress begins--\non the importance of tax reform. Our country is at a point in time \nwhere we certainly are no longer competitive globally. The economy now \nis one that works against us because of our Tax Code. I think there is \ngeneral consensus in the Senate that reforming the Tax Code is of \nsignificant importance, something that must be done.\n  I am often asked not only when I am back in Kansas but here in \nWashington, DC: Do you expect there to be broad-based tax reform? And \nwe keep guessing about the likelihood of that happening.\n  I think it is typical of elected officials, politicians, to always \ntalk about the need for comprehensive tax reform. We talk about \nlowering rates, making the tax system more fair, less bureaucratic, \nless paperwork. I certainly join in those sentiments and believe that \nthe current circumstance we have in regard to our Tax Code is such that \nit limits the freedom of Americans--American business men and women, \nindividuals, and their families. We make way too many decisions based \nupon the consequences of those decisions and how they are affected by \nthe Tax Code.\n  So I am all on board on tax reform, but I wish to talk about what I \nbelieve is the best solution toward tax reform. And it is not tinkering \nwith the current system; it is an overhaul of the current Tax Code.\n  I have joined my colleague from Georgia, Senator Perdue, in once \nagain introducing the fair tax plan. I started a long time ago in \nCongress, knowing that we needed to make significant changes in our Tax \nCode, with\n\n[[Page S553]]\n\nthe belief that most Americans ought to be able to file a tax return \nwithout the need of professional help, that we ought to be able to make \ndecisions that are in the best interests of ourselves, our families, \nand our businesses without always going to the Tax Code to see what the \nconsequences of those decisions were. I looked at a variety of \nproposals that were being considered at the time and continue to be \nconsidered today and ultimately reached the conclusion that the Fair \nTax is the best option for significant reform. I wish to speak for just \na minute about why I think that is the case.\n  As I said, Senator Perdue and I introduced S. 25, the Fair Tax Act of \n2015. I have been a cosponsor of that legislation. It was originally \nintroduced in the Senate by the former Senator from Georgia, Mr. Saxby \nChambliss, and I am pleased to now succeed him in his efforts to see \nthat not only is this topic discussed in Congress but ultimately that \nthe Fair Tax Act becomes law. It is a significant step in the direction \nof individual freedom.\n  I would highlight for my colleagues--and I have said this on the \nSenate floor before--I think the greatest responsibility we have as \nAmerican citizens is to pass on to the next generation of Americans the \nfreedoms and liberties guaranteed by our Constitution and the \nopportunity for every American to live the American dream. The Fair \nTax, in my view, brings both of those goals front and center. Greater \nfreedom and protection of individual liberties is certainly a component \nof the Fair Tax, and the opportunity for every American to pursue the \nAmerican dream is a result that comes from the Fair Tax. It is that \nFair Tax direction and individual freedom that caught my attention. It \nis the concept our Founding Fathers knew so well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. MORAN. I ask unanimous consent for additional time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, the Fair Tax repeals all Federal, \ncorporate, and individual taxes, payroll taxes, capital gains taxes, \nand estate and gift taxes and replaces them with a revenue-neutral \npersonal consumption tax. The Fair Tax allows Americans to keep the \nentirety of their income, putting individuals in charge of their own \nfinances, not the government--or, more specifically, not the Internal \nRevenue Service.\n  All Americans should be able to trust the IRS, which exercises great \nauthority over the lives of Americans in this country, but we know from \npast experiences that expectation is no longer founded. So getting rid \nof the Internal Revenue Service is a significant benefit that comes \nfrom the passage of the Fair Tax.\n  I recognize that consumption taxes can be regressive, meaning they \nare harmful to those at lower income levels. So the Fair Tax takes that \ninto account by providing a pre-rebate for those who fall below certain \npoverty income levels so that the basics--the things we by necessity \nneed to by in our individual daily lives--are not covered by a tax, \ntherefore creating greater progressivity to what otherwise would be a \nmore regressive tax and something that I think is still important in \nthis country to make certain we don't overtax those at the lowest \nincome levels in the United States.\n  Certainly, our current Tax Code has significant complexities with all \nthe paperwork. By some estimates, U.S. companies are currently holding \nover $20 trillion overseas. With the passage of the Fair Tax, foreign \ninvestments would no longer continue to sit on the sidelines when they \ncould be brought back to America to drive economic growth and create \njobs. For international businesses looking to relocate to the United \nStates, the Fair Tax would be a welcomed sign. But the Fair Tax also \nbenefits the consumer. It also benefits the everyday citizen, as I \nsaid, because of the pre-rebate.\n  With my time being short, I look forward to having a dialogue on the \nSenate floor and in the committees over the next few months, and I ask \nmy colleagues to seriously take a look at S. 25 and to join the Senator \nfrom Georgia, Mr. Perdue, and me and others in promotion of a program \nthat reduces the complexity of the Tax Code in our lives, rids us of \nthe Internal Revenue Service, protects the progressivity of the tax \ncircumstance we find today, and most importantly, allows us to continue \nto pursue the American dream and promotes our individual freedoms and \nliberties.\n  The Fair Tax is worthy of people's consideration. It ought to be more \nthan just a talking point. It deserves a debate, a discussion, a vote, \nand consideration by the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time, and I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/28/senate-section/article/S553-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S553-S555]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be here today to \nspeak to my colleagues about funding for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity and to be followed by one of my most valued colleagues, \nSenator Menendez, whose leadership on this issue has been \nextraordinarily important. I am also pleased to work with him on a \nletter he sent yesterday to the President concerning Iran sanctions, \nwhere his statesmanship-like path to a reasonable solution on this very \ncomplex and crucial issue will be enormously important to the future.\n  The Department of Homeland Security is one of the most significant \ndepartments in the U.S. Government. It has a mandate that is as complex \nand crucial as any in keeping American citizens and communities and \ncapabilities safe and secure in a dangerous, complex, and threatening \nworld.\n  In my family, when I was growing up, we had a saying: Don't cut off \nyour nose to spite your face. Unfortunately, that path is exactly what \nsome of my colleagues are choosing to follow in threatening to stop \nfunding for the Department of Homeland Security.\n  We are reminded of the importance of this Department not only as \nterrorism raises its ugly head repeatedly abroad but also as perhaps \nmore benign threats exist at home--the most recent of them, the \nsnowstorm that hit the Northeast within the past couple of days. The \nDepartment of Homeland Security is not only engaged in a fight against \nterrorism, not only engaged in keeping America safe from threats abroad \nbut is engaged in a wide variety of other tasks that have to do with \nthe Nation's security. That is the key word in its title--``security.''\n\n  Americans fear more deeply than ever before that their security is \nthreatened--economic security by stagnating incomes, foreign security \nas the world becomes more volatile and unpredictable and more \nthreatening, and domestic security as threats abroad metastasize within \nour own borders.\n  Many people equate the concept of security at home or homeland \nsecurity with protection against extreme violence from abroad, violent \nextremism spawning from abroad and in fact stopping those threats. \nFinding the wrongdoers and stopping them is one of the major tasks the \nDepartment of Homeland Security has, but it has a myriad of additional \nresponsibilities that include aiding the victims of natural disasters \nand extreme weather, citizenship and immigration, routinely handling \nmatters that involve legitimate applications for visas for entry into \nthe United States, and it fights the scourge of human trafficking. I am \nprivileged to have a Caucus on Human Trafficking with my colleague \nSenator Rob Portman. So I know it forms a diverse collection of \nresponsibilities that are crucial to security.\n  In fact, the Department of Homeland Security's responsibilities are \ncomprehensive--so much so that it is simply unacceptable to play \npolitics with its crucial mission. It is irresponsible to hold its \nfunding hostage in a dangerous game of fiscal chicken and threaten \ndaily activities that are vital to America's present and future \nsecurity.\n\n[[Page S554]]\n\n  That is why we are here, because some of my friends across the aisle \nbelieve stopping the President from exercising discretion on certain \nimmigration issues affecting specific individuals in this country is \nworth hamstringing and undercutting the entire Department of Homeland \nSecurity and forcing an enormous amount of its vital work to grind to a \nhalt. That is the game of chicken we have. The President is expected to \nrelent if the Department of Homeland Security is stopped from \nfunctioning, but it is a game that has no place in this Chamber or in \nthis government.\n  We can agree or disagree with the President, and I disagree with the \nDepartment of Homeland Security on certain of its policies; for \nexample, on detaining children which it has done routinely on a \ngrandiose scale. I have included an amendment in the measure for \nimmigration reform that passed the Senate. It would stop it from \ndetaining children--a practice I consider shameful and unacceptable--\nand I have a long list of other changes I would like to see made in DHS \npolicies. But the way to effectuate those changes in my view is not to \nwithhold funding to stop DHS in its tracks of providing security for \nthe American people, it is to amend the laws to persuade our colleagues \nto undertake the legislative process and to appeal ultimately to the \ncourt of public opinion which can render a verdict far more powerful \nthan the tactics involved here. Chipping away at the President's \nauthority by not only undercutting him but stopping one of his \ndepartments is reprehensible. So I urge my colleagues to cease this \ntactic.\n  The President needs discretion. In fact, I know as a prosecutor, as a \nformer attorney general, and as a one-time U.S. attorney for \nConnecticut that discretion is essential. There is no way any authority \ncan prosecute every crime. So prosecutors need to select cases based on \nseverity of offense and most important the danger to the public because \nultimately protecting the public is what security requires. That is \ntrue as well for the Department of Homeland Security.\n  The President has exercised his discretion in a way I find laudable. \nThe exigencies of the present immigration system require the exercise \nof discretion. The President has done it in a way that is responsible \nand upholds his duties as Commander in Chief. But even if I disagree \nwith the President on that exercise of discretion with respect to \nimmigration, I would never use this tactic of withholding funding for \nan entire department, affecting all of its activities and implicating \nand undercutting security in so dangerous a way.\n  My hope is we will debate immigration policy, that we will approve an \nimmigration reform bill, that it will be on a bipartisan basis just as \nit was during the last session, that there will be a lot of good-faith \ndisagreement on the floor of this Chamber about those policies and \nabout the President's actions but that we will keep the lights on at \nthe Department of Homeland Security, that we will shine the light on \nthreats to our security that need to be exposed and pursued, that we \nwill further the security of this Nation and protect the public by \nmaking sure the DHS funding as a clean bill is approved right away and \nthat we move forward to make sure DHS continues its vital service to \nthe American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, as we approach the near end--I think--of \nthe votes and legislation on the Keystone Pipeline--I know we are \nhaving a series of votes later today--I know what is likely to be next \nup is the question of Department of Homeland Security funding. I hope \nwe can come collectively together to fund the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, the Department that keeps us safe in an unsafe world, the \nDepartment we created after September 11 to bring together disparate \ngovernment agencies, all charged with keeping our cities, our ports, \nour airports, our railways, highways, bridges, and neighborhoods safe \nfrom the threat of global terrorism. I particularly understand that as \na Member of this body who represents, according to the FBI, the most \ndangerous 2 miles in America, the chemical coastway, airports, seaports \nalong the Hudson waterfront. This is the Department that funds \nemergency management in our communities. It protects the President. It \nis engaged in all domestic counterterrorism efforts.\n  But what are we doing instead? We are being asked, as one of the new \nRepublican majority's first acts of this Congress, to shut down the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. Why? Because some of our friends on \nthe other side are willing to take a gamble and put politics ahead of \nnational security, a thinly veiled political stunt in response to the \nlawful actions of the President of the United States to do something to \nfix our broken immigration system. Their message is pretty simple: \nrepeal the President's lawful Executive actions on immigration or shut \ndown the Department of Homeland Security. Make no mistake, that is the \ntextbook definition of pure politics: not caring what its impact might \nbe, not caring whom it might hurt, not caring about the families whom \nit will tear apart, and the fact that it will put our Nation's security \nat risk.\n  I have been in this Chamber and in the other Chamber for over 20 \nyears, and I don't think I have ever seen such a cavalier political \nrecklessness played with our national security. Why? To prevent the \nPresident from taking lawful action to help DREAMers and immigrant \nfamilies to come out of the shadows after they pass a criminal \nbackground check, register with the government, and get right with the \nlaw in exchange for being allowed to temporarily stay in the country \nand obtain a work permit.\n  The bottom line is clear: Republicans are doing all of this just to \nprevent a clean Department of Homeland Security funding bill from being \nsent to the President, a critical funding bill that the President has \nrightfully promised to veto should it include their anti-immigration \namendments, a veto which Congress will not override. It is a fool's \npolitical errand that is neither good policy nor particularly humane.\n  Our friends on the other side have accepted these anti-immigrant \npoison pill amendments, knowing full well they will sink the Department \nof Homeland Security funding bill because they have allowed extremists, \nsuch as Steve King, to dictate the party's strategy on immigration.\n  Let's not continuously go down this dark path of partisanship instead \nof funding national security programs to keep our families and our \ncommunities safe. In my view it is shamefully and woefully \nirresponsible for Republicans to hold up funding for operations that \nprotect every American against terrorism in the wake of what happened \nin France and against cyber attacks at a time when North Korea just \ncarried out a dramatic attack against a major American corporation.\n  This is not a time to hold up funding to help the Department of \nHomeland Security investigate cyber crime that could cripple America's \nelectronic infrastructure or when the world is a tinderbox of jihadists \nand would-be homegrown terrorists willing to die for a perceived \nversion of Islam.\n  If Republican colleagues want to seriously consider this ill-\nconceived approach, they will be forcing a shutdown of the Department \nof Homeland Security--a shutdown of our national security \ninfrastructure to pursue their agenda of mass deportations that will \ntear families apart, an agenda that embraces a system that doesn't \ndistinguish between deporting a working mother with U.S. citizen \nchildren and a convicted felon.\n  Instead, I urge my friends on the other side to join us and pass a \nbalanced and comprehensive bill. Let's talk. Let's sit down again and \nfind common ground, as we did in the last Congress where this Senate \ncame together on a bipartisan basis with over 67 votes to send a bill \nto the House of Representatives that dealt with our broken immigration \nsystem, provided for our national security, promoted our national \neconomy, and at the same time made sure our legacy and history as a \nnation of immigrants was preserved. The answer is not holding up \nnational security funding at a critical time, not turning our backs on \nthe\n\n[[Page S555]]\n\nhard-working men and women at the Department of Homeland Security in \nlaw enforcement who are protecting our borders, our airports, and our \ncoastlines. It is not about trying to score political points by \nconflating national security and immigration reform, which will only \nmake it harder to address security issues at home and almost impossible \nto move forward on comprehensive immigration reform.\n  Let's look at what my Republican colleagues are so opposed to. They \nare opposed to new DHS directives that include a rigorous application \nprocess that will ironically help eliminate national security threats. \nThey seem to be opposed to the fact that applicants will have to come \nforward and register with the government. They will have to pass \ncriminal background checks before they can receive a temporary reprieve \nfrom deportation and a work permit. No violent criminals, gang members, \nor terrorists will be able to take advantage of the program. They seem \nto be opposed to allowing immigrants who are not a public safety or \nnational security threat to come forward and request deferred action, \nmeaning there will be fewer people living in the shadows, beyond the \nreach of law enforcement.\n  These directives identify moms and dads who have a U.S. citizen or a \nlegal permanent resident son or daughter and take them out of the \ndeportation queue. They also take DREAMers out of the deportation \nqueue.\n  The House amendment to the Department of Homeland Security funding \nbill would effectively end the new Deferred Action for Parental \nAccountability Program and the expanded DACA Program for DREAMers. They \nwould also defund every other aspect of the President's November 20 \nExecutive action that would promote border security, public safety, \nmilitary service, legal immigration, citizenship, immigration \nintegration, entrepreneurship, civil immigration enforcement \npriorities, including the prioritization of individuals with convicted \nfelonies and gang activity and terrorist ties for deportation.\n  I will repeat that. It includes a prioritization. I would think the \nSenate would want to support a prioritization of individuals who are \nhere illegally and are convicted felons and part of gang activities or \nwho have terrorist ties for deportation and any future similar \nExecutive actions.\n  The only directive our Republican colleagues found acceptable, which \nis interesting--in my mind, you say: Well, none of it can happen by \nExecutive action. But it seems that the only thing that did happen by \nExecutive action that our colleagues found acceptable pertains to pay \nincreases for Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, which I \nbelieve they certainly deserve.\n  These amendments would break apart more families and destroy \ncommunities by ensuring that we continue to deport the parents of U.S. \ncitizen and lawful permanent resident children. One of the most mean-\nspirited amendments would prohibit the use of Federal funds or \nresources to consider or adjudicate any new, renewed, or previously \ndenied application for deferred action for childhood arrivals.\n  Let's call this amendment what it is: It is an amendment to deport \nDREAMers and targets all of those young people who came forward and \nsigned up in good faith. I will give an example of whom these \namendments attack.\n  I wish to remind my colleagues of who the DREAMers are. DREAMers are \nyoung people who came to this country through no choice of their own. \nThe only flag they have ever pledged allegiance to is that of the \nUnited States of America. The only national anthem they know is the \n``Star-Spangled Banner.'' Their country is this country.\n  I was fortunate to speak with people like the Morales-Cano family 2 \nweeks ago in New Jersey. They are a family of six, including 13-year-\nold, U.S.-born Rebecca Morales. Their lives have drastically improved \nthanks to the program Republicans are hoping to dismantle. If the \nRepublicans are successful, Rebecca would be left alone in the United \nStates without her parents or sisters--an American citizen left alone, \nperhaps in foster care, because Republicans don't care about \nprioritizing the deportation of convicted criminals over her mom, dad, \nand sisters.\n  The story of the Morales-Cano family is a clear example of thousands \nof deep-rooted families who have waited too long in the shadows for \nimmigration reform.\n  Three years ago, after attending a deferred action for childhood \narrivals workshop that my office organized in New Jersey, all three of \nRebecca's older sisters--Ingrid, Evelyn, and Lesly--were given an \nopportunity to begin a new chapter of their lives after qualifying for \nthe President's 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, \njoining thousands of others who had been granted relief.\n  Today, look at what this family is doing Ingrid cares for New \nJerseyans' health at her job at the Ocean Medical Center. Evelyn moved \nto Illinois to attend the West Coast Bible College and Seminary. Lesly \nwas able to enroll in Brookdale Community College to pursue her dream \nof becoming a nurse. Ingrid, Evelyn, and Lesly represent the hundreds \nof thousands of young individuals who, because of the deferred action \nfor childhood arrivals, can actively contribute to our economy without \nfear of losing everything they have worked to gain.\n  Romeo Morales and Mrs. Magda Cano de Morales did not qualify for \ndeportation deferrals under DACA and have continued to live with the \nconstant fear of having their family abruptly separated. But thanks to \nthe deferred action for parents program, recently announced by \nPresident Obama, both parents will likely qualify to come out of the \nshadows, register with the government, pass a background check, and \njoin their daughters in their pursuit of the American dream--unless, of \ncourse, the Republicans get their way.\n  We cannot let that happen, and I will do everything to ensure that we \nwill not let that happen. These are the real faces of our broken \nimmigration system. There are many families like the Morales-Cano \nfamily who have been and remain an economic resource we cannot afford \nto waste. They are hard-working families who simply want to be full \nparticipants in American life, full contributors to the American \nfamily, and they want to remain united as a family. We should want them \nto remain united.\n  I have listened to so many speeches here about family values. Well, \nthe core of a family value is a family being able to stay together, \nintegrated and helping each other and driving each other to success and \nsupporting each other. Ripping families apart is not a family value.\n  We must see through the smoke and mirrors and do what is right for \nAmerica. Let's stop playing political games. Let's defeat these poison-\npill amendments and pass a clean Department of Homeland Security \nfunding bill. Let's not play politics with national security. Let's \nremember the people behind the policies. Let's remember the Morales-\nCano family and the fate of Rebecca if we allow these amendments to \npass.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am ready to go this morning. I have \ncomfortable shoes on. I am ready for a good, long day and to process a \nbunch of amendments. I see the Senate doing its work. I know we have \nimportant business before the Senate. I know the Judiciary Committee is \nholding the hearing to listen to the comments from Loretta Lynch, who \nhas been nominated to be Attorney General.\n  Obviously these are very important issues the committee is discussing \ntoday. Interspersed with all of that, we are going to be having a \nrelatively long series of votes this afternoon, which makes it a little \nbit choppy and a little bit chaotic, but we have business to do in the \nSenate.\n  I am pleased we are at this point where I think we can honestly say \nwe are looking at the final stretch in this discussion on the \nbipartisan, 60-sponsored bill to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline after \nmore than 2,320 days of delay.\n  At this point we are past that last call for amendments on the bill. \nWe have spent a lot of time over the past couple of days negotiating \nwhich of the roughly 200 first-degree amendments that have been filed \nwould come up for votes. We have a pretty good list. Again, we have 18 \nof them that will be before us beginning this afternoon. There will be \nmore we will be dealing with at a later point.\n  But I do think this is significant. I was reading the newspaper this \nmorning, and there is no shortage of critics out there, folks who would \nsay the Senate is broken and can't possibly be fixed.\n  There was an article from an opinion writer which stated: Within the \nmidst of the Keystone debate, McConnell has had to retreat ``on his \npromise to allow freewheeling amendments.''\n  The article then goes on to state that yesterday not much of anything \nhappened on the Senate floor where the pipeline debate had stalled.\n  In fairness, maybe the debate, in terms of processing amendments on \nthe floor, had stalled out yesterday, but that did not mean there were \nnot significant and serious negotiations going on between the majority \nand the minority about how we would proceed. Sometimes when someone \ntunes in and the Senate is in a quorum call, they think nothing is \nhappening. They think the business of the Senate is not being \nconducted. I need to assure not only colleagues but those who watch \nthis process on C-SPAN that in fact there is still good business being \ndone.\n  I think that is what has resulted in our opportunity this afternoon \nto take up some 18 different amendments. There are amendments that are \nall across the board; 10 of the 18 pending amendments are from \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle. I think we are certainly \nbeing very generous in terms of what is out there. We are trying to \nensure that Members who want a vote can have them.\n  Again, keep in mind, with a couple hundred amendments that come \nforward, we are going to have a lot of duplication. We are going to \nhave issues people may want to make a statement about but might not \nnecessarily want to ask for a vote on. But those that we have in front \nof us today--everything from issues relating to solar energy to LNG \nexports, to further discussion about climate change, wilderness, wind \ntax credits, the Land and Water Conservation Fund--are truly all over \nthe map.\n  When it is suggested that somehow or other Senator McConnell as the \nmajority leader is moving back from his commitment to allow for an open \namendment process, so-called freewheeling amendments, I don't think a \nwhole picture of what is happening on the Senate floor is being \npainted. In fact it is a very open and considerable process.\n  I made mention last week that we broke the records. We blew the top \noff in terms of the number of amendments we were actually able to \nprocess on the Senate floor. We moved through 24 amendments on this \nbill since the time we started it. Twenty-four amendments is pretty \nconsiderable, considering that in all of 2014 there were just 15 \namendments that were considered the entire year. In fact, on Thursday \nalone we processed 15. If we do 18, as is on the roster today, that is \npretty significant. I feel good about the point we are at. It is not \njust because we are churning through amendments, it is because of what \nthe ranking member and I have been able to do as the floor managers on \nthis bill, kind of working back and forth. Yes, sometimes it is \ntedious. Yes, sometimes it is frustrating. Yes, sometimes Members wish \nthey had more time to talk or there were more hours in our day to \nprocess all of this,\n\n[[Page S557]]\n\nbut at some point in time I think we have to recognize when we spend 3 \nweeks on a bill, that is pretty considerable. When we are able to move \n50 amendments--close to 50 amendments is where we may be at the end of \nthis legislation and processing--that is of note.\n  What I appreciate is we are here this morning getting ready to kick \noff a long afternoon of votes and go back and forth with Members and \ndisruption of their schedules and committee meetings and the \ninconvenience that causes. But again this is part of what happens \naround here. It is not a very tightly scheduled environment because we \njust have so much that is going on. But being able to move forward on \nthis important legislation is good and necessary.\n  I think we are setting the stage for the balance of this Congress--\nunder the leadership of the Senator from Kentucky, the majority leader, \na commitment to have wholesome debate--to have the opportunity for a \nprocess that is not only good for Republicans, it is good for \nDemocrats. It is good for the Senate and for the United States.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 166\n\n  I want to quickly mention an amendment I will have up later this \nafternoon. This is amendment No. 166. I spoke very briefly to it \nyesterday when I called it up. But it would require wilderness study \nareas to be released if Congress has not officially designated them as \nwilderness within one calendar year. Right now what happens is that \nwhen a wilderness study area is designated, it can sit out there on the \nbooks almost indefinitely. There have been areas that have been sitting \nout there without congressional action for a couple of decades.\n  I don't think this was the point of the process. But I would suggest \nthe amendment I have advanced is a critical one to our Western States, \ncertainly to my State of Alaska.\n  Again, the news on Sunday of the President moving toward a wilderness \ndesignation of all of ANWR--with the exception of a very small slice \nbut all of ANWR--all 19 million acres in addition to the 1002 area, the \n1.57 million acres that have been specifically designated by Congress \nfor further review and study.\n  Right now there are 528 wilderness study areas throughout Alaska and \nthe other 11 Western States. Again, these designations have been made \nby over time by one administration or another. The next step forward in \nthis process is that Congress needs to act, but Congress hasn't acted. \nWe have had some of these that have been pending since the 1980s.\n  Again, as I suggested yesterday, if we have had something pending for \n20, 30 years, I think that is plenty of time to say that Congress has \nhad to review those areas. Even though we have not turned these into \nwilderness--in other words, even though Congress has not acted to \ndesignate these areas as wilderness, what happens to them?\n  They are treated and managed as if they are wilderness. Effectively, \nwe have de facto wilderness. The law requires that only Congress \ndetermines whether an area is designated as wilderness. But what has \nhappened is just kind of a lag, a lull, if you will, so they don't even \nneed the congressional designation if in fact it is already being \nmanaged as wilderness.\n  We look at the intent behind this. It is clear it was never intended \nto be this way. We were never supposed to have millions of acres of de \nfacto Agency-decided wilderness around the Western United States. We \nroutinely pass public lands legislation into law. I would like to know \nwe could do it a little more often. As recently as last month, it \nactually has included new wilderness. So we are not saying that in \nother areas these wilderness study areas don't get officially \ndesignated. There is that process, and we demonstrated that just during \nthe lameduck here. But in the instances where Congress has decided not \nto act on wilderness study areas, agencies need to start looking at \nwhat that broader array of options is for managing the land, whatever \nthat multiple use designation might be. They need to be looking at this \ncritically with the local people in the area and with the other \nstakeholders who are involved in the planning process, but clearly they \nare not doing that on their own.\n\n  So what my amendment would do is essentially provide a 1-year \ntimeframe for wilderness designations to be made. I think, again, that \nis more than enough time for Congress to consider debate and approve \nlegislation for any area with wide support for a wilderness \ndesignation, so we will see that amendment this afternoon.\n  I know the Senator from Washington was on her way, coming from a \ncommittee meeting this morning, and had intended to speak. I see \nSenator Udall is also on the floor.\n  I yield to the Senator from New Mexico if he wishes to speak at this \ntime before Senator Cantwell comes to the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PETERS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 55\n\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss my amendment that \nwas made pending by my friend and the ranking member of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, the Senator from Washington, Ms. Cantwell.\n  The amendment I have offered, amendment No. 55, is a simple, \ncommonsense amendment. It requires the Environmental Protection Agency \nto complete a study on the potential environmental and health impact of \nbyproducts from tar sands oil that would be transported across our \ncountry by the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  One of these byproducts of tar sands oil is a black, powdery \nsubstance known as petroleum coke or petcoke. It is a residual from \nthis tar sands oil and large amounts of it are produced in the refining \nprocess.\n  In fact, it is estimated basically for every barrel of oil we get \nfrom tar sands, one-third of the material is this dark substance called \npetcoke. If we are transporting an awful lot of oil through the \nKeystone Pipeline, it naturally follows that we are going to get \nmassive amounts of this petcoke.\n  I have had an experience with this petcoke in my previous House \ndistrict in the city of Detroit, where we had petcoke from the refining \nprocess of this tar sands oil being piled up along the Detroit River. \nWe had a pile there that was at some times several stories high, a city \nblock long. It was stored along the river in an uncontained fashion. It \nwas blowing into people's homes, it was blowing into businesses, and it \nwas also draining into the Great Lakes watershed.\n  It caused all sorts of problems. I had complaints from constituents \nwho talked about this substance going into their homes. I had \nbusinesses talking about--for example, restaurants in the area--their \nwait staff getting respiratory problems as a result of breathing this \nin.\n  In fact, we had a video to explain how problematic it can be. I had a \nvideo taken by a Canadian resident across the Detroit River that showed \nthe petcoke piles. With some wind blowing, a massive black dust cloud \nwas blowing off of these petcoke piles. In the distance you could see \nthe Ambassador Bridge, which is the bridge that connects Canada to the \nUnited States. The dust was so thick and so black it obscured the \nbridge as it was blowing into the neighborhoods, into the river, and \nthen into Canada.\n  It is a completely unacceptable situation, which is why I believe it \nis important as we move forward with this legislation that we have a \ncouple of studies.\n  One, we need to understand what are those environmental and health \nrisks associated with petcoke. It is clear this is particulate matter, \nand if it is not contained, it gets into people's lungs and creates a \ndust layer throughout communities.\n  It is very important as well in the study not only to study the \nenvironmental and health impacts, but what are the best practices to \nhandle this material.\n  With the massive amount of tar sands oil that will come through the \nKeystone, we will also get massive amounts of petcoke, a substance that \nhas been problematic not only in Detroit, but it has been problematic \nin the city of Chicago and other places across the country.\n\n[[Page S558]]\n\n  So I believe it is very important that we get these kinds of \ninformation as this project moves forward, and it is certainly my hope \nthat we can assure that what happened in Detroit, what is happening in \nChicago and other places across this country doesn't happen, that we \nunderstand what this substance is, and we understand what those best \npractices are to handle and to transport this material safely.\n  I urge my colleagues to support amendment No. 55.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 166\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am glad the junior Senator from \nAlaska is in the Chair because I am going to be discussing things that \nare of great concern to Alaskans and really to those who care about the \nrule of law here and how it applies throughout all 50 States fairly and \nevenly. As I mentioned just a bit ago, I have offered an amendment that \nwould deal with how wilderness study areas are treated. My proposal is \none that would put a time limitation on these study areas.\n  I mentioned the amendment was precipitated by the President's \nannouncement this weekend about additional areas of wilderness to be \ndesignated in Alaska. I have cited two. The 1980 lands bill, ANILCA--I \nthink it is good for us to have a little bit of a refresher on what \nANILCA actually did. In one fell swoop ANILCA designated nearly 60 \nmillion acres of wilderness in the State of Alaska. That is pretty \nsubstantial. It was more than any other President had ever designated \nat any other time prior to that.\n  What we have seen since then, with the designation of wilderness, is \nthere has been this fight going back and forth. There have been areas \nthat have been requested for wilderness study areas. But this \nadministration has really taken it a major step forward. On Sunday the \nPresident recommended that an additional 12.3 million acres within the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge be designated as wilderness--so an \nadditional 12.3 million acres on top of the 60 million acres that we \nalready have as wilderness in Alaska after ANILCA.\n  This action by the President means that these 12.3 million acres will \nimmediately be managed as wilderness. As I have mentioned, right now \nthere is no deadline or expiration for this designation. Even if \nCongress fails to act--and I am going to make darn certain we do not \nact on this wilderness proposal the President has advanced--these acres \nare being managed as wilderness.\n  Let me just show colleagues what it means for us right now. The small \nmap of Alaska is up there in the corner. It is kind of unfair because \nit needs to be a much bigger map to get the context. Effectively, what \nthe President is proposing is that in addition to the 7.16 million \nacres of wilderness that currently exist in the ANWR area--and the ANWR \narea is a big refuge, a big designation. A little over 7 million acres \nhave already been designated as wilderness. That was done back in 1980. \nBut what he is proposing now is effectively taking the whole balance of \nthe refuge area and making wilderness out of that as well--so 12.3 \nmillion acres.\n  Now, keep in mind this also includes the 1002 area up on the northern \npart of ANWR. That is the area right, which was specifically designated \nby Congress for further study of its oil and gas potential. Back in \n1980, when the wilderness designation was made for the one area--7 \nmillion acres of it--it was determined that refuge status would be \nafforded the balance of the area, and then the 1002 would be reserved--\nreserved deliberately for study of its oil and gas potential.\n  That 1980 act was pretty clear in terms of the bargain that had taken \nplace. I am going to read for the record the provision in the law that \nwe refer to as the ``no more'' clause. It states:\n\n       This Act provides sufficient protection for the national \n     interest in the scenic, natural, cultural and environmental \n     values on the public lands in Alaska, and at the same time \n     provides adequate opportunity for satisfaction of the \n     economic and social needs of the State of Alaska and its \n     people; accordingly, the designation and disposition of the \n     public lands in Alaska pursuant to this Act are found to \n     represent a proper balance between the reservation of \n     national conservation system units and those public lands \n     necessary and appropriate for more intensive use and \n     disposition, and thus Congress believes that the need for \n     future legislation designating new conservation system units, \n     new national conservation areas, or new national recreation \n     areas, has been obviated thereby.\n\n  The act goes on to state that ``no further studies of Federal lands \nin the State of Alaska for the single purpose of considering the \nestablishment of a conservation system unit, national recreation area, \nnational conservation area, or for related or similar purposes shall be \nconducted unless authorized by the Congress.''\n  So the President is basically choosing to ignore the law as set out \nin ANILCA--the agreement that Alaska has contributed mightily with its \nshare of wilderness.\n  I remind my colleagues that more than one-half of the wilderness in \nthe entire United States of America is in the State of Alaska. Thus we \nwrote the law back in 1980 that says no more out of Alaska. They found \nthat balance. Well, this President is tipping that balance.\n  The coastal plain holds an estimated 10.4 billion barrels of oil. I \nmentioned yesterday that if we can tap into these resources, we could \nsee 1 million barrels a day coming down our Trans-Alaska Pipeline for \nnearly 30 years.\n  Think about what that would mean, Mr. President--1 million barrels a \nday filling up that Trans-Alaska Pipeline that is now less than half \nfull, an additional 1 million barrels a day coming into this country. \nRight now, Americans are enjoying the lower prices of oil. But the \nPresident said: Don't get used to these low prices because they may go \nup. Well, they do not have to go up if we can provide more. If we can \nincrease production in this country, we can theoretically decrease that \ncost. But we have to be allowed to access that.\n  Think about the source of good-paying jobs, energy security, billions \nof dollars in new Federal revenues. The energy security part of it is \nkeenly important, but let us also think about the positive national \nsecurity implications of energy produced in the United States. When we \nare producing more energy in this country and relying less on others, \nwe are less vulnerable. We have greater ability to deal with hostile \nnations. Sanctions work better when we don't need to rely on that same \noil that some of these nations would like to free up for other \ncountries.\n\n  From a national security perspective, this is huge. This is where the \nintersection with the Keystone Pipeline is so interesting: that at the \nsame time this administration has issued this wilderness study it is \nalso fighting so hard to keep us from building the Keystone XL \nPipeline, which would allow us to get crude from our friend and \nneighbor to the north and utilize it to our benefit. The President is \nsaying: No, I don't want to do that.\n  I guess he would much rather receive it from Venezuela or wherever. \nHe says he wants Brazil to be our big trading partner when it comes to \noil.\n  Hello. Canada--they share a border. They are our friend. They are our \nclosest friend, our strongest trading partner. Are we going to shut \ndown such an opportunity as that?\n  And: Oh, by the way, that same week let's just go ahead and take off \nthe table permanently one of the greatest reservoirs of crude we have \nhere in the United States next. Let's just take that off the table, \ntoo.\n  What does that say? What does that say to other countries? That we \ndon't care about our own energy security? I care about our energy \nsecurity, and I care about our national security.\n  Again, it stuns me to think that what the President is proposing here \nis a measure that would take off limits permanently our ability as a \nnation to access the 1002 area to safely develop this enormous \npotential.\n  Keep in mind, we are not talking about accessing the full 1.5 million \nacres in the 1002. The legislation that has been before this Senate, \nback in 1995 and 2005, asked to open up 2,000 acres--2,000 acres--out \nof 19.5 million acres in the whole refuge.\n  The Presiding Officer knows Alaskans can do this safely. We have set \nand met the highest environmental standards in the world. We do it \nevery\n\n[[Page S559]]\n\nday. Our pipeline, our amazing 800-mile pipeline, has a decades-long \nrecord of responsible production. It has carried nearly 17 billion \nbarrels of oil safely across our State, over 2 mountain ranges, \nmultiple rivers, in areas where we are known to have a few earthquakes. \nIt is an engineering marvel. It has served our State and our country \nwell.\n  But instead of recognizing this unparalleled opportunity that we \nhave, we are now facing a mounting lockdown of our resource potential. \nAnd the Presiding Officer knows the worst part is, it is not just ANWR \nwe are talking about. Our offshore oil reserves are now also going to \nbe restricted.\n  Just yesterday the President announced he was indefinitely \nwithdrawing 9.8 million acres in the Beaufort and the Chukchi Seas from \nleasing. So now ANWR is going to be locked up, as well as the Beaufort \nand Chukchi seas. I don't have a map of these areas that have been \ntaken off limits, but I can tell you that it is an area of roughly 9.8 \nmillion acres. There is some real question that I have in my mind. \nAfter reading the Interior's press release, I don't have any real \ncomfort that the two sales that are being proposed--one in the Beaufort \nand one in the Chukchi--will actually stay on schedule.\n  The Secretary of the Interior is quoted saying that: Interior will \ncontinue to consider oil and gas exploration in the Arctic. It is not a \nvery firm commitment, as far as I can see.\n  But when we look at it altogether--between the ANWR wilderness \ndesignation and the Arctic offshore withdrawal--Alaska has lost more \nthan 22 million acres of land and water where energy could be produced \nfor the good of this country, and it has happened in less than 1 week. \nIt has happened over a span of 3 days--22 million acres.\n  So what is 22 million acres? It is an area about 563 times larger \nthan where we are here in the District of Columbia. It is about 28 \nRhode Islands. I know Rhode Island is a small State by comparison, but \n28 of them adds up. It is about 4.5 times the size of the State of \nMassachusetts. Again, this is just to give you an idea of what was \ntaken off limits, indefinitely, by this administration since Sunday.\n  My reaction to all this has been pretty strong. I think it is pretty \nobvious to anybody who would take a moment to think about it, but I am \namazed our President can look at Alaska and think, this is what we need \nmost right now.\n  We are facing a pretty significant budget shortfall. I know our \nGovernor has spoken to the President and the Secretary of Interior \nabout Alaska's situation. Then this is what he gets as a ``we will work \nwith you''? I don't think so. This is not an indication of a Federal \nGovernment that wants to work with the State to develop its resources.\n  The Governor asked the Secretary of the Interior for an address, \nbecause he said he needed to send an invoice for the lack of any \neconomy Alaska would be able to generate with these actions.\n  The one thing--the one thing more than anything else that could help \nour State--is to be able to access our Federal lands and our waters so \nthat we can fill up the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, so that we can not only \nhelp Alaska but we can help the rest of the country. But that seems to \nbe the one thing this President is intent on denying, whether it is in \nANWR, whether it is in our offshore, or whether it is in our National \nPetroleum Reserve, where this President basically unilaterally took off \nabout half of that in terms of availability of access.\n  I noted that when the President made his announcement on Sunday, the \nvideo that went out showed beautiful pictures of the refuge area. \nAgain, this is a big area. This whole refuge is about the size of the \nState of South Carolina. It is big and there are some amazing spaces--I \nam the first one to admit it, amazing spaces--just as there are all \nover Alaska.\n  But I watched that video as he was flying in his airplane to go to \nIndia, and I thought to myself: The President hasn't been to Alaska, \neven though he says he only has three States left to see and Alaska is \nnot included. So I actually asked my staff to find out. By my count, \nthe President has been to Alaska three times during his administration. \nAnd he told me, before he was President, he had never been to Alaska. \nSo three times during his administration. All three times were \nbasically to get fuel. And granted, to give him credit, on one of those \ntimes he did meet with the troops at Elmendorf, but he never went off \nthe base. The other two times were in the middle of the night for as \nlong as it took to get fuel.\n  In my mind, that is not visiting Alaska. That is not trying to \nunderstand who we are. We have some pretty beautiful, wide-open skies. \nBut when you are flying at 35,000, 45,000 feet looking down, that is \nnot how you get a view of Alaska.\n  So outside of this short meet-and-greet, outside of a bargaining chip \nto gain support from national constituencies, he is basically viewing \nAlaska as a refueling stop--which is no shortage of irony here in the \nfact that he is happy to refuel Air Force One in Alaska, but he doesn't \nseem to want fuel produced in Alaska.\n  I can get pretty frustrated and upset about this. Part of it is \nbecause so much of this comes without consultation with us, without \nlistening to the vast majority of Alaskans--as if, once again, we are \nnothing but a territory and the promises that were made to us at \nstatehood mean nothing.\n  I was born in the territory. It was not that long ago that Alaskans \nknew what it meant to be kind of kicked around by folks on the outside. \nWe didn't have a voice. We thought statehood was going to change that. \nWe thought that statehood compact--the promises made that Alaska would \nbe able to deliver to its citizens based on the amazing resource wealth \nthat we had--we thought that was going to count for something. \nApparently, not enough.\n  I was a little bit surprised to read that the White House counselor, \nMr. Podesta, thinks I have overreacted to these announcements and to \nothers that I have been told may be coming--more to come--and he \nsuggested my reaction is not warranted.\n  I would ask any one of the other 99 Senators here: Think about how \nyou would respond if the citizens of your State woke up to a message \nthat we are going to take 12 million acres away from you and your \npotential to develop in your State; and then on Tuesday, we are going \nto take away 9.8 million acres. But don't worry, we are the Federal \nGovernment, we are here to help. Alaskans want to help themselves. We \nwant to be able to exercise that independence, that free spirit that so \nmany of us in Alaska identify with. We want to help our neighbors, help \nour families. But this kind of help we don't need. Don't lock us up. \nDon't shut us out.\n  It was suggested in Mr. Podesta's comments, and I saw it in other \npress reports, that somehow or other the Interior Department felt \ncompelled to move forward with the timing of these announcements \nbecause we were ratcheting up on ANWR. They suggested I had introduced \na bill. I haven't introduced a bill. I do intend to introduce a bill. \nBut to somehow suggest this was precipitated because the delegation is \nmaking a charge on ANWR is, at this time, unwarranted.\n  It did kind of make me wonder, maybe the White House isn't aware of \nhow Alaskans feel about this. So in the few minutes I want to take this \nmorning I want to read a few of the quotes from our State leaders who \nhave come out against this decision since they were announced, \nparticularly as they relate to ANWR.\n  We have a new, Independent Governor. As I mentioned, he has already \nhad the opportunity to meet with the President and talk about Alaska's \nissues. Again, he has also met with the Secretary of Interior to talk \nsimilarly. Governor Walker says he is ``angry, very angry, that this is \nhappening.''\n  Our State senate president, Kevin Meyer, said the following:\n\n       The impact of this decision, if allowed to stand, will harm \n     the future of our Great State and will deal a devastating \n     blow to our economy.\n\n  I spoke with our house speaker, a gentleman by the name of Mike \nChenault from the Kenai Peninsula, an area where we have oil and gas \npotential in the Cook Inlet. They know about oil and gas. The speaker \nsaid:\n\n       The president just doesn't get it, or he does get it and \n     doesn't care about the will and voice of Alaskans. That's \n     beyond offensive.\n\n\n[[Page S560]]\n\n\n  In response to the President's ANWR announcement, Speaker Chenault \nalso had some pretty choice words. He said:\n\n       Alaska's not a territory anymore and it's high time our \n     federal overlords stopped trying to treat us like one.\n\n  The Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, whose shareholders, people who \nactually live on the North Slope, issued a press release stating that:\n\n       We are staunchly opposed to this relentless and coordinated \n     effort to designate the Coastal Plain of ANWR as Wilderness. \n     This administration has deliberately ignored the input \n     provided by the most affected people within ANWR.\n\n  Colleagues, remember that when this President is suggesting that this \narea needs to be named or designated as wilderness, the 1002 area, \npeople live there. People live their lives there--children go to school \nand people work there. They fly in and out. They have a little grocery \nstore. They try to make an honest living there. They subsist, \nabsolutely; but people live there. To quote from the Arctic Slope \nRegional Corporation, the corporation's shareholders who live there \nsay, ``this administration has deliberately ignored the input provided \nby the most affected people within ANWR.''\n\n  I think the reason they have ignored it is because they forget people \nactually live there. How can people live in a wilderness?\n  Democratic State Representative Ben Nageak of Barrow, who is an \nInupiat and born in Kaktovik, who lives in the affected area, wrote \nthis:\n\n       President Barack Obama and his lieutenants at the Interior \n     Department will permanently harm our people and all Alaskans \n     with his colonial attitude and decision making . . . It's \n     terrifying to see the extent by which our pleas for time and \n     a fair hearing of our views fall on deaf ears 5,000 miles \n     away.\n\n  That is a State representative born and raised in this area, an \nInupiat, who is saying 5,000 miles from here you are making decisions \nwithout listening to us, without listening to our people.\n  Our North Slope Borough Mayor Charlotte Brower didn't mince any \nwords, either. She said that ``these types of paternalistic, executive \nfiats seem to be more appropriate for Andrew Jackson's administration \nthan Barack Obama's.''\n  Pretty tough words. I am starting to think my words were pretty mild \nbased on what I read from the mayor of the North Slope Borough and the \nDemocratic State representative from Barrow.\n  Mayor Brower has invited President Obama and Secretary Jewell to \nvisit the North Slope, and she asked them to meet with the people who \nactually live there before proposing these types of sweeping land \ndesignations. If the President and the Secretary actually accept that \ninvitation, Mayor Brower concluded:\n\n       They might learn that the Inupiat people who have lived on \n     and cared for these lands for millennia have no interest in \n     living like relics in a giant open air museum. Rather, they \n     hope to have the same rights and privileges enjoyed by people \n     across the rest of the country.\n\n  That seems like a pretty fair request to me.\n  Even the New York Times interviewed a few Alaskans who didn't hide \ntheir feelings. One woman who said she had voted for the President \ntwice said, ``He has just alienated an entire state.'' She described \nherself as being ``on the fence'' about ANWR before the proposal, but \nshe added, ``without talking to any of us, just doing it by fiat--\nthat's not how you lead.''\n  I think she summed it up pretty well. What the President has done, \nthe way he has done it--it is unfair, uncalled for, and it is \nunwarranted. So for it to be suggested by the counselor from the White \nHouse that my response is somehow overreacting or unwarranted, I think \nthey should start listening to all of the people of Alaska. The \npresiding officer and myself were sent here to represent them and I \nthink we are expressing pretty clearly where Alaskans are coming from \non this.\n  This is wrong. It should not be tolerated. And we will not just sit \nback while this administration locks up our State and the potential of \nour people.\n  We have a lot more we will be discussing about this. Again, I \nmentioned on Monday that there was a trifecta with what we see coming \nout of this administration. I have been told by the Secretary that we \nwould see his ANWR designation and that we would then see the 5-year \nlease sale that would take areas that had been in deferred status and \ncompletely withdraw them for an indefinite period of time, and that \nthere would be a third announcement coming relating to the National \nPetroleum Reserve--the area where folks who said don't go to ANWR, go \nto NPRA, go to the National Petroleum Reserve. So the first company \nthat tried to do so is trying to make it happen. What this \nadministration is doing with the mitigation costs they are laying in \nfront of them, the company will determine whether it is going to be \neconomic. But my fear is that will be the third kick to Alaska.\n  So it has been a bad week, a bad week for Alaska. But you know what, \nwe are not people who are deterred by bad news, by bad weather. We have \na way to roll with it.\n  I was looking at the front page of the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner \nyesterday. They had a little recap of what is going on with the \nweather. It is about 52 below zero in Fort Yukon and 51 below in Fort \nGreely where we base our ground-based missile defense system. We are \npretty proud of what we do. We can still provide for the defense and \nprotection of this country and do it in some pretty cold weather.\n  In Fairbanks, where I went to high school, I think the weather this \nmorning was 47 degrees below zero, but the kids still go to school in \nthis kind of weather. We are doing what we do up north. It is not easy, \nbut it is an amazing place and the people there are pretty resilient. \nWe have been kicked this week, but that doesn't mean we are down. It \nmeans we are just getting started.\n  With that, I will have more to say about the process in front of us \nthis afternoon, where we are with Keystone; but again, I am pleased \nthat we have a good series of votes to keep us busy this afternoon, and \nI appreciate the indulgence of colleagues as we go through a process \nthat can be very disruptive as they are trying to meet with \nconstituents and pursue committee business. But I think we recognize \nthat we want to be on a path toward completion of this bill, and I \nthank them for their cooperation.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n           Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, last week my colleague Senator Lankford \nand I introduced the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency \nAct--a bill to enhance transparency about the true costs of burdensome \nFederal regulations affecting our States and localities.\n  Twenty years ago the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, otherwise known as \nUMRA, was signed into law to reduce the burden of Federal mandates on \nState and local governments, as well as the private sector. The statute \nwas intended to fix a simple problem while promoting informed decisions \nby this Congress. But since UMRA's enactment in 1995, many remain \nconcerned that the law has fallen short. In Nebraska and all across \nAmerica, our constituents continue to face a growing mountain of \nredtape that stifles economic growth and holds back progress on a \nnumber of fronts.\n  In 2011 alone the Government Accountability Office identified 14 \ndifferent loopholes that would allow government agencies to avoid \nconducting the UMRA analysis. In other words, redtape has survived and \nprospered. By their very nature, Federal mandates are both complex and \nvague, which is why I have introduced a new bill to fix these \nshortcomings and increase accountability. My bill, known as the \nUnfunded Mandates and Information Transparency Act, would address \nUMRA's loopholes by mandating stricter agency requirements, enhance \nstakeholder input, and strengthen enforcement mechanisms.\n  Furthermore, this bill has the power to get the job done. It would \nallow judges to place a stay on a regulation or invalidate a rule if a \nFederal agency fails to complete the required UMRA\n\n[[Page S561]]\n\nanalysis. It would also close a glaring loophole used by agencies to \nskirt UMRA requirements.\n  Last but not least, my bill would expand the scope of reporting \nrequirements to include regulations imposed by independent regulatory \nagencies, such as the EPA. I know many Nebraskans are deeply concerned \nabout the effects of new EPA requirements, such as the proposed water \nrule--a rule I have forcefully fought since it was first proposed. \nNebraskans already go to great lengths to protect and preserve water \nresources within our State, but now the EPA is going overboard with \nthis new proposal--one that represents a massive Federal power grab and \nclear disconnect with Main Street America.\n  I share the belief of many Nebraskans that the Federal Government \nshould be held responsible for the rules it puts into place. By clearly \nnotifying taxpayers of the costs of each mandate, which the bill I \nintroduced would require, we can better hold the Federal Government \naccountable for the economic impact of its costly regulations.\n  I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in \nsupporting this simple, commonsense legislation to help bring greater \naccountability and transparency to Washington.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I return to the floor today to discuss the \nlegislation under consideration. As I did yesterday, I wish to begin by \nagain thanking both the Senator from Alaska on our side of the aisle \nand the Senator from Washington on the other side of the aisle, who are \nthe bill managers--the legislation managers in this case--of the \nKeystone XL Pipeline approval legislation that I put forward along with \nSenator Manchin. I wish to begin by thanking both of the managers for \ntheir diligence and for their bipartisanship and for working together \nto advance this legislation, but I also want to make sure all of the \nMembers of this body get a chance to bring their amendments forward, \ndebate those amendments, and have a vote.\n  This afternoon we have scheduled 18 votes, and that is great. Some of \nthose amendments I support; some I oppose. But we are going to do what \nthis body is supposed to do and what the American people elected us to \ndo, and that is to have this discussion and then vote.\n  We are working to advance energy policy for this country that can not \nonly truly help create more energy, jobs, and economic growth but also \nreally address the national security implications of making our country \nenergy secure. By that, I mean producing more energy than we consume \nand working with Canada, our friend and ally, to do that so that we \ndon't have to depend on OPEC to do that and on parts of the world where \nthere is great instability and where our interests are not aligned with \nthe interests of some of those countries.\n  Also, it enables us to actually weaken some of our opponents that are \npetro-dependent, countries such as Iran, which is now trying to build a \nnuclear weapon, as well as, right now, Russia, which is invading its \nneighbor Ukraine, one of our allies, where we are trying to stop the \nadventurism of President Putin.\n  By truly becoming energy secure, by providing more supply of energy, \nwe not only benefit every American at the pump--Americans are saving \nbillions of dollars when they pull up to the pump. That is not only \ngood for American consumers, it is good for our small businesses.\n  Energy is a foundational industry that strengthens every other \nindustry out there. It makes us more competitive in the global economy \nacross the board. As I say, it weakens some of our opponents. So that \nis really the debate in which we are engaged.\n  Yesterday I started to respond to some of the critics who oppose this \nlegislation on the basis of saying this is a project for Canada and not \nfor the United States, and that is not true at all. This pipeline would \nnot only move crude from Canada to our refineries, it would also move \ncrude from production in the United States, including in my State of \nNorth Dakota, which now produces 1.2 million barrels of oil a day--\nsecond only to Texas--as well as Montana. So it also moves domestic \ncrude to our refineries as well.\n  Furthermore, it really is about making our Nation energy secure, \nworking with Canada to become energy secure so we don't have to depend \non OPEC. That is very much a national interest issue for this country, \nfor this Nation, and for all Americans. I spoke about that a little bit \nyesterday.\n  The second issue I would like to address is some of the environmental \nissues. I started to do that yesterday, but I deferred at that time \nbecause anytime we can get people to come to the floor to offer their \namendments and make them pending, that is what we want to do. At that \npoint we started getting people to come offer their amendments, and the \nbill managers, through their hard work, were able to get agreement, and \nwe now have 18 amendments pending on a precloture basis. So we have \nmade real progress in getting everyone involved and hopefully building \nmore bipartisan consensus and getting on the energy debate the American \npeople want and getting to a result where we can actually produce \nlegislation that will help our Nation.\n  So I started to get into the second point I wanted to discuss, which \nis some of the environmental aspects of the oil sands development and \nhow technology is being deployed, with hundreds of millions of private \ndollars invested in new technologies that are not only producing more \nenergy but doing it with a smaller environmental footprint. That helps \nto reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of oil that is produced in the \noil sands.\n  There are two projects I wish to speak about to give examples of how, \nif we continue to work to empower this kind of investment in new \ntechnologies, we get not only more energy more cost-effectively and \nmore dependably but we also get it with environmental stewardship.\n  The first project I will speak about is a project that has been \nundertaken in the oil sands in Alberta, Canada. Going back to this \nearlier chart, we can see that it is up in the Hardisty area, and this \nsecond chart is a picture of the project. It is one that is undertaken \nby the Shell Oil Company. It is called their Quest project. I will read \na little bit about the project.\n\n       Shell Canada will this year complete the world's first oil \n     sands carbon capture and storage project.\n\n  This is CCS--carbon capture and storage--something we have been \nworking to develop in this country and apply to fossil fuels, not only \nthings such as oil and gas but also coal. This is the new carbon \ncapture technology. They will complete the world's first project. \nContinuing:\n\n       The project, called Quest, will begin permanently storing \n     CO2 by the end of the year and will permanently \n     store more than 1 million tons per year.\n\n  Let me read that again.\n\n       The project, called Quest, will begin permanently storing \n     CO2 by the end of the year and will permanently \n     store more than 1 million tons per year. Quest reduces the \n     emissions from Shell's upgrader by 35 percent--that's the \n     equivalent of taking 175,000 cars off the road each year. \n     Shell will transport the CO2 50 miles north via \n     pipeline and permanently store it more than a mile below \n     ground under impermeable rock formations.\n\n  My point is that here is an example of where a private company is \nworking with the Province of Alberta on this project to invest hundreds \nof millions of dollars in carbon capture and storage technology that \nwill not only apply to the oil sands, but--think about it--this is also \ntechnology that is not only being developed but deployed on a \ncommercial scale in production that we can now take advantage of and \nuse in this country to produce more energy from multiple sources--\nagain, smaller footprint, lower greenhouse gas.\n  Isn't that the solution to better environmental stewardship where we \nget more energy that we produce here with our closest friends and \nallies, with better stewardship through investment by private companies \nin these new technologies and, in this case, working with Alberta? \nAlberta is also investing in this technology, but this is the \ninnovation of our country, of our companies. This is the kind of \ningenuity and\n\n[[Page S562]]\n\ninnovation that helps us build the kind of future we want. In this \ncase, it is a secure energy future by deploying these new technologies.\n  The other point I will make as we look at this chart is that under \nthe old system of oil sand production--remember, it is excavation, so \nthey would be digging up this area and then extracting the oil from the \noil sands. But under this new system of development, which is called in \nsitu, they are actually drilling wells, and then they put steam down \nthe hole to bring the oil up, and then they capture the CO2 \nand store it underground, so smaller environmental footprint and lower \ngreenhouse gas emissions.\n  Since 1990 the greenhouse gas emissions on a per-barrel basis for oil \nsands production has gone down by 28 percent. So they have reduced it \nby almost a third. These new technologies will reduce it further going \nforward.\n  This is about finding good solutions to create jobs and economic \nactivity and energy security and take us into the future. That is why I \nwanted to discuss that project for just a minute.\n  A second project I will reference is Exxon's Kearl project, spelled \nK-E-A-R-L. Just by way of preface, Exxon currently produces over \n100,000 barrels of oil a day in the Canadian oil sands. They are going \nto increase that amount this year to 345,000 barrels a day. Their \nobjective is to get to half a million barrels a day of oil produced in \nthe Canadian oil sands. They are investing $10 billion in this project. \nThat is their investment in this project and these new, better drilling \ntechniques.\n  Let me tell my colleagues a little bit about their project. Exxon is \ndoing it differently than Shell and Quest. They are employing different \ntechnologies but investing $10 billion to reduce the environmental \nfootprint, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but produce a lot of \nenergy for Canada and for our country.\n  Exxon's Kearl project will use cogeneration for steam, which a low-\nenergy extraction process to recover oil, and heat integration between \nthe extraction and treatment facilities to minimize energy consumption. \nAs a result, oil produced from Kearl will have about the same life-\ncycle greenhouse gas emissions as many other crude oils refined in the \nUnited States as a result of technologies which significantly enhance \nenvironmental performance--again, smaller environmental footprint, \nlower greenhouse gas emissions.\n  This is how we work to address the challenges we face, whether it is \nproducing energy or anything else. We deploy these new technologies \nthat enable us to do it better.\n  Other environmental innovations for Kearl include onsite water \nstorage to eliminate river withdrawals in low-flow periods and \nprogressive land reclamation, which will return the land to the boreal \nforest.\n  I wish to emphasize that for a minute. What we see around this site, \nwhich is actually the Shell site--this is the boreal forest. I have \nbeen to Hardisty, and I have seen the oil sands production. I was also \ntaken out to areas where they had reclaimed land that had been formerly \nused to produce oil sands. Now we can't tell the difference between the \nland that has been reclaimed and the land that hadn't ever been used in \nterms of oil production. I was there and I looked at both and I \ncouldn't tell the difference. Of course, that is subjective. You want \nto return it to the state it was in before it was tapped. With this \nnewer production, there is a much smaller area that we would ultimately \nhave to return to its original state.\n  I wanted to touch on those two projects for a few minutes as well as \npoint out that the Alberta Government actually requires that all land \nused in the development of oil sands has to be returned to the same or \nequivalent condition when it is no longer in use.\n  The final point I wish to touch on for just a minute or two is \nanother issue that has been brought up, which is pipeline safety. There \nhave been some references to recent pipeline spills--one in Poplar, MT, \nactually not too far from where I live in western North Dakota. But the \nspill is from what is called the Poplar Pipeline, which I believe is \nowned by the Bridger Company. It is a pipeline that goes underneath the \nYellowstone River. It was built in the 1950s, so we are talking about a \npipeline that is over 50 years old. Isn't that just the point, that \nwhether it is roads or bridges or buildings or pipelines or \ntransmission lines or anything else, we have to make the investment in \nnew facilities rather than just continuing to rely on old facilities?\n  That is what I want to emphasize about the Keystone XL Pipeline \nproject. This is an investment of $8 billion, not a penny of government \ninvestment but $8 billion in private investment in new steel and new \ntechnologies.\n  Also, the Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous \nMaterial Safety Administration--PHMSA--the division of the Department \nof Transportation that oversees pipeline safety, has required 57 \nspecial conditions for this pipeline to make sure it is as safe as \npossible. I am going to touch on some of those to give a sense of what \nthey are.\n  The whole point is that here we are trying to create a business \nclimate, a business environment where companies can put billions of \ndollars into these new technologies and this new infrastructure so that \nwe can have energy as safely as possible, with the best stewardship \npossible, so we aren't relying on pipelines or other infrastructure \nthat is more than 50 years old.\n  We are trying to get that upgrade. We are not doing it at taxpayer \nexpense. We are getting tax revenues. We will get hundreds of millions \nof tax revenues that will come back in from private sector projects \nwhere we are trying to empower that investment. At the same time, the \nPHMSA, the Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous \nMaterials Safety Administration, has all these requirements that they \nare making part of the approval process--57 different special safety \nconditions for the Keystone XL Pipeline. They are conditions such as \npuncture resistance. For example, TransCanada is required by PHMSA in \nthe environmental impact statement to ensure that the steel used in the \npipeline can withstand impact from a 65-ton excavator with 3\\1/2\\-inch \nteeth.\n  There is corrosion resistance coating, making sure it has a coating \non it that is resistant to corrosion. There is cathodic protection. \nCathodic protection is applied to a pipe so where it connects to \nother--it could be structures such as a bridge. It could be any place \nwhere the pipes are connected to make sure those other connections \ndon't rust through into the pipe.\n  For maintenance, TransCanada must submit certification that \ndemonstrates compliance with all 57 conditions before they commence \noperation of the pipe.\n  Airplanes will patrol the right of away at least 26 times a year. \nThey will send cleaning and inspection tools through the pipeline once \na year to collect and analyze basic sediment and water.\n  Compare all of this to a pipeline that was built 50 years ago and \nlaid on the floor of a river--versus a pipeline now, where if they have \nto cross a river, they use directional drilling. So they go down 25 \nfeet below the river and put the pipe 25 feet down in the rock below \nthe river, versus older pipelines that were just laid in there. Again, \nthis is the new technology--the new safeguards.\n  In horizontal drilling and directional drilling the pipe will be \nburied approximately 25 feet below riverbeds. So if there any riverbeds \nthat cross, that is 25 feet below using directional drilling.\n  There are automatic shutoff valves. So they will have automatic \nshutoff valves and they will be placed every 20 miles along the \npipeline route. Extra miles will also be placed where there are \nprotected water crossing and other areas of higher consequence. They \ncan be closed remotely on either side of the line, isolating a damaged \narea within minutes of detection.\n  Again, it is about making sure if there is an issue of any kind, that \nyou can minimize and mitigate any kind of spill.\n  With 100 percent weld inspections, there is a requirement that 100 \npercent of welds are inspected rather than just some of the welds under \na test basis.\n  With satellite monitoring and leak detection, Keystone XL will have \nmore than 13,500 sensors feeding constant and detailed information \nabout flow rates to the control center 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. \nThat is so that if any kind of a leak is detected, it is immediately \nshut down so you minimize the amount of product that would leak.\n\n[[Page S563]]\n\n  Those are the kinds of safety features--and there are 57 of them--\nrequired by the administration's Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety \nAdministration. When we talk about pipeline safety and somebody comes \nin and says there is this pipe that broke so we should never have \nanother pipe, we need to talk about that and address that in a sensible \nway.\n  We have over 2 million miles of pipe in this country. The point is we \ndo need to build new pipelines and upgrade them and take other steps to \nmake sure the system is safe. But you don't do that by blocking \ninvestment in the new technologies and the new pipeline that will help \nus move product more safely, more cost-effectively, and more \ndependably.\n  Those are the three issues I wanted to address. Again, I covered some \nof them yesterday, but I wanted to make sure that any time we had \nsomebody coming down to offer amendments, we deferred to those \nindividuals. I am pleased now we have 18 amendments pending on a whole \ngamut of issues related to this project, to this energy discussion, and \nto our efforts to advance a better energy future for our country.\n  Again, I look forward to the debate this afternoon, to voting on \nthese amendments, and to continuing to advance this legislation on \nbehalf of the American people.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Department of Homeland Security Funding\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes to talk \nabout the latest attempt by the Republicans in the House of \nRepresentatives--and a few Republicans in the Senate as well--to hold \nhostage the basic operation of our government, once again, over \npolitics.\n  While I have several issues with the Department of Homeland Security \nfunding bill that the House has sent to us, I will first discuss this \nstrategy we are seeing from Republicans, as the former chair of the \nBudget Committee and as someone who has worked across the aisle to \nbreak through gridlock in Congress.\n  Two years ago our country was moving constantly from one manufactured \ncrisis to the next. We had debt limit scares that were rattling our \nbusinesses and the markets, we were headed toward an absurd and \nunnecessary government shutdown, and people across the country were \nlosing faith that their elected officials could get anything done when \nit came to the budget and to our economy.\n  But by working together, Congressman Paul Ryan and I were able to \nreach a budget deal that prevented another government shutdown and \nshowed the American people that Congress could work together to get \nthings done.\n  Because of that deal we were able to then pass bipartisan spending \nbills for the past 2 fiscal years, including 11 of the 12 \nappropriations bills from last year. Although we have a lot of work to \ndo, it is clear that stability in the Federal budget makes a difference \nfor our economy. We have to work together to build on that growth, to \ncontinue that certainty, and to make sure our economy is working for \nall families, not only the wealthiest few.\n  Across the country, businesses have added more than 11 million new \njobs--over 58 straight months of job growth. The unemployment rate is \nnow under 6 percent and trending downward, and we have reduced the \nFederal budget deficit by over two-thirds since 2009.\n  So when I look at the Homeland Security funding bill that the House \nof Representatives has now sent to us, I see a few things. I see a \nbill--the way it is drafted and was sent to us will tear apart families \nwho are working hard to make it in America. I see a bill that will put \nour security at risk, and I see a bill that seriously threatens all of \nthe work we have done recently, Republicans and Democrats, to keep our \ngovernment functioning because the bill the House has sent over is \nsimply unacceptable.\n  It will not pass the Senate. Republicans know that. Let's be clear \nabout what this bill is, it is a calculated, political gamble from our \nRepublican colleagues.\n  This looming showdown over funding the Department of Homeland \nSecurity is no accident. In fact, it is actually a risk they have been \nplanning since last year all because of political pressure from the \nextreme anti-immigration right wing of their party.\n  If Republicans are willing to risk funding for the Department of \nHomeland Security for political reasons, I believe the American people \ndeserve to know exactly what that does mean because funding the \nDepartment of Homeland Security doesn't only keep the lights on the DHS \nheadquarters, that funding protects our country from terrorist attacks \nat a time when the world is as dangerous and volatile as ever.\n  It protects our country and American businesses from cyber attacks, a \nthreat that is all too real as we have now seen in recent months. It \nsupports basic security measures at our airports, at our seaports, and \nalong the border. It even supports our Federal emergency management \nresources that are on call for every community in America.\n  In my home State of Washington, this funding supports the Coast \nGuard, which protects shippers and sailors throughout Puget Sound, and \nCustoms and Border Protection, which helps facilitate billions in \ninternational trade moving through my State, the most trade-dependent \nState in the country.\n  Not funding these programs is a risk we cannot afford to take. It is \nreckless and irresponsible and, more than anything else, simply \ncounterproductive for Republicans to put all of this on the line just \nto score some political points with the tea party and the far right. \nUnfortunately that appears exactly to be what they are doing.\n  Once again Speaker Boehner and the House Republicans have decided \nthey are willing to break up millions of families and deport millions \nof DREAMers who are victims themselves of a broken system.\n  They have decided they are willing to stop the President's policy of \nfocusing our law enforcement on national security threats, gang \nmembers, and violent criminals. Once again they have decided they are \nwilling to make bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform that much \nmore difficult to achieve.\n  This is much more than only an annual funding bill. This legislation \nis a message which has been sent to us loud and clear from House \nRepublicans and Speaker Boehner that they are willing to continue \npushing us from crisis to crisis. They are willing to play politics \nwith our national security, and they are willing to turn their backs on \nmillions and millions of children and families.\n  For years now we have seen that strategy doesn't work--it doesn't \nwork. It holds us back.\n  But I have to say I was encouraged when Majority Leader McConnell \nsaid that at the end of the day the Senate will fund the Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  It is clear the House bill will not pass the Senate, so I truly \nbelieve it is time for the majority leader to show, as he has promised, \nthat he will let the Senate and Congress work efficiently.\n  It is time for the majority leader to bring a clean DHS \nappropriations bill to the floor. Let's get it done, passed, and move \non to the work that is so important to us.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to urge my Republican colleagues \nto pass a clean bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security for \nthe remainder of the fiscal year.\n  We are now only 1 month away from a shutdown of the principal Federal \nagency charged with keeping Americans safe from terrorism and prepared \nfor natural disasters.\n\n[[Page S564]]\n\n  The President has said he will veto any funding bill that repeals or \nrolls back his Executive order on immigration, so anything but a clean \nbill to fund DHS means one thing and one thing alone. Republicans are \nunilaterally shutting down the agency.\n  No matter what your grievance is, we shouldn't be playing politics \nwith national security. It is alarming that even as we can now count \nthe days, 30, until a Republican security shutdown, so many on the hard \nright are ready to just dismiss the consequences.\n  Compared to their obsession with President Obama's immigration action \nand their desire to appease the tea party with radical and practical \nideas that would not fix our system, to Republicans shutting down DHS \nis ``not the end of the world.''\n  So I will use my time to spell out what a DHS shutdown would mean for \nour country in the hopes that our Republican colleagues will be jolted \nback to reality and to common sense. Since this isn't the first time \nRepublicans have put us through a shutdown, we actually have a very \ngood idea as to what a DHS shutdown would look like.\n  Here are just some of the functions that would cease if Republicans \nfailed to put a clean bill on the floor: The bulk of DHS management and \nheadquarter administrative support activities would cease, including \nmuch of the homeland security infrastructure that was built during the \n9/11 terrorist attacks to improve command, control, and coordination of \ndisparate frontline activities. Securing the Cities, a critical post-9/\n11 funding program that helps pay for nuclear detection capabilities in \nNew York City, Los Angeles, and Washington, DC, could not be awarded in \nfiscal year 2015. The DHS Nuclear Detection Office, which since 9/11 \ncoordinates on a daily or weekly basis with local law enforcement, will \nstop operating.\n  FEMA's disaster preparedness unit would cease coordinating regular \ntraining activities for law enforcement for weapons of mass destruction \nevents. FEMA employees in Washington and across the country who provide \ncritical preparedness resources to local first responders would be sent \nhome. Twenty-five percent of FEMA's headquarters and regional staff \nwould be furloughed.\n  FEMA personnel working on grants programs, such as funds for \nintelligence analysts or firefighter needs, would be furloughed, and \neven those personnel deemed essential would be denied paychecks until a \nfunding bill is passed. This means we are not paying the Coast Guard, \nwe are not paying the TSA, we are not paying the Border Patrol, the \nSecret Service or FEMA aid workers.\n  So make no mistake, a DHS shutdown would hamstring our ability to \ncombat threats to the homeland and to keep our citizens safe. The irony \nof course is that one of the programs that shutdown would close \ncompletely is E-Verify, which stops unscrupulous employers from hiring \nundocumented workers and cutting everyone's wages.\n  So in order to make a point on immigration, our Republican colleagues \nare actually going to stop the program which prevents employers from \nhiring undocumented workers. Essentially to make a point about needing \nmore immigration enforcement, Republicans are willing to shut down \nimmigration enforcement.\n  In short, I am perplexed as to why Republicans are playing this game \nof chicken with DHS funding because the only possible outcome that \ncould come from withholding of a clean DHS bill is the shutdown of \nseveral critical post-\n9/11 programs within the DHS and the furlough of thousands of workers \nparamount to our Nation's security and disaster preparedness.\n  At a time when we need all hands on deck to keep America safe, \nRepublican efforts to politicize our security would tie DHS's hands \nbehind their back. So I urge my Republican colleagues in the House and \nSenate to drop this fool's errand and put a clean DHS funding bill on \nthe floor as soon as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am here this afternoon to discuss the \ntwo concerns I have about the bill currently before the Senate--the \nregulation that would grant immediate approval of the Presidential \npermit necessary to construct and operate the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  First and foremost, I believe a thorough regulatory review process is \ncritical for any major infrastructure project, particularly one that \nwill cross our country's border. Regulatory review enables the \nidentification of economic impacts from a major project and, more \nimportantly, environmental impacts that infrastructure projects such as \nthe Keystone Pipeline may bring.\n  We shouldn't trade transparency for expediency when it comes to the \nconstruction of an international project that has such scope. I can't \nsupport a bill that sacrifices these important protections. That is why \nI voted in the past against legislation to allow the Keystone XL \nPipeline to circumvent the normal review process, and that is why I \nintend to again vote against this bill.\n\n  I also have a number of concerns about the impact of the Keystone \nPipeline on our environment. In the past 2 weeks, we have had a \nspirited debate on this floor, and a number of my colleagues have come \nto the floor to talk about the pipeline oilspills we have seen in this \ncountry.\n  Just a few days ago, an oil pipeline burst, leaking 50,000 gallons of \ncrude oil into the Yellowstone River in Montana. Yet this spill pales \nin comparison to the 2010 Kalamazoo River oil spill where over 1 \nmillion gallons of oil sands poured into Talmadge Creek in Michigan. \nThe cleanup has already cost more than $1 billion and taken over 4 \nyears to complete. In fact, to date there has been no authoritative \nstudy on how the spills of oil sands crude may differ from those of \nconventional crude oil. This means we have no idea about the spill's \nlong-term effects on the health of wildlife in that river.\n  The other issue that has been raced onto the floor is the fact that \nright now, because of the way we define crude oil, TransCanada--\nsupporting and planning to build the Keystone Pipeline--is not required \nto pay into the federal oil spill liability trust fund, which would \nensure taxpayers against any spills. So we have this out-of-state, out-\nof-country foreign company that is coming in to build this pipeline, \nand yet they are not required to pay, as any American company would be, \ninto the oil spill liability trust fund. That, to me, doesn't make \nsense. Circumventing the regulatory process for Keystone prevents us \nfrom understanding the health hazards that we would face should another \nspill occur.\n  I am also concerned that construction of the Keystone Pipeline will \nincrease carbon emissions and undermine some of the most critical \nclimate policies that we have in place. The pipeline poses threats to \nour environment that have already been identified. Tar sands greenhouse \ngas emissions are 81 percent greater than those of conventional oil. \nThat is because the production of oil sands crude is more energy \nintensive, or more greenhouse gas intensive, than conventional crude \nproduction. Additional processes are required to extract the oil, \nremove the sand, and dilute the oil so that it can flow in a pipeline.\n  In addition, if the pipeline is approved, much of the boreal wetlands \nin Alberta, Canada, which act as a carbon sink, would be destroyed, \nreleasing 11 million to 47 million metric tons of CO2 into \nthe atmosphere.\n  One of the reasons I am concerned about circumventing the regulatory \nprocess is because I believe this could set a precedent for a rushed \napproval of infrastructure projects currently under consideration in \nNew Hampshire.\n  In New Hampshire, we have two projects that really merit careful \nconsideration and thorough review that could be affected by a precedent \nthat says we should ignore the regulatory process. In New Hampshire, \nthe Northern Pass transmission proposal, which proposes to deliver \nhydropower from Quebec into the New England energy markets and goes \nthrough northern New Hampshire, would bring power to southern New \nEngland, but New Hampshire wouldn't benefit. And any suggestion that we \nwould circumvent the\n\n[[Page S565]]\n\nprocess is a real concern to people in New Hampshire who would be \naffected by that project.\n  The other project is the potential reversal of the Portland-Montreal \npipeline, which, if the determination were made to do this, would send \noil sands through many New Hampshire communities, and that oil would \nthen be shipped to foreign countries.\n  So if we set the precedent of trading transparency for expediency \nwith Keystone, without requiring the completion of a comprehensive \napproval process, local communities in New Hampshire may not have a \nmeaningful voice in the process that deals with Northern Pass or \nreversing the Portland-Montreal pipeline. I think that is unacceptable.\n  These three projects--Keystone, Northern Pass, and Portland-\nMontreal--have one important thing in common: They should undergo the \ncomprehensive environmental and safety approval process required by \nexisting law, and that should be done independent of politics.\n  Circumventing the Presidential permitting process for cross-border \npipelines and electric transmission facilities avoids the due process \nthat is needed to determine whether these projects are in the best \ninterests of the country.\n  In New Hampshire, Northern Pass and the Portland-Montreal pipeline \nhave raised serious concerns for people who live in areas impacted by \nthese projects. That is why I worked with the entire New Hampshire \ncongressional delegation in a bipartisan way to ensure that both \nprojects undergo a transparent, thorough, and comprehensive review \nprocess. That allows the input of local communities who will be \naffected by these projects.\n  Like people in New Hampshire and across the country, I share concerns \nabout our Nation's energy future. Throughout my career I have fought \nfor smart policies that will reduce energy costs in New Hampshire and \nacross the country, that will help create jobs, and will protect our \nair and water from pollution.\n  But I don't believe mandating a project that bypasses the approval \nprocess is a smart policy. We need to be smart and thoughtful about our \nenergy future. I think it would set a dangerous precedent for other \nprojects that could have serious consequences in New Hampshire and in \nother States around the country.\n  I appreciate the debate we have had here on the Senate floor about \nthe Keystone Pipeline, but I will be opposing this bill.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Ukraine and Syria\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I want to speak to the Senate about \nUkraine and also about Syria. These are two parts of the world that are \nof particular critical importance to the United States foreign policy \ntoday because of what they portend for the future. The fact that our \nrelationship is so rocky with the President of Russia, President Putin, \nwho right up to just a few days after the Olympics suddenly shows his \ntrue colors when he invades Crimea, a part of Ukraine, despite all of \nthe agreements when the Soviet Union broke up in the late eighties, \nearly nineties, the agreements that in exchange for moving all of the \nnuclear weapons out of Ukraine back into Russia, that Russia would \nforever recognize and respect the sovereignty of Ukraine--well, that \nwent out the window right after the Olympics, and Mr. Putin showed his \ntrue colors.\n  He could couch it in all kinds of terms, that there is a Russian \nnaval base that was there, but the fact is the whole world knows what \nhe did, and no one could do anything about it. Then he started to move \non the eastern part of Ukraine, and that, of course, is going on as we \nspeak. The so-called rebels aren't really rebels. They are a front for \nthe Russian military propped up with actual troops of the Russian \nmilitary, sometimes disguised as being free and independent players \nsimply because they don't have on their Russian uniforms; but in fact \nthey have taken them off and put on uniforms that are not Russian \nuniforms to say that they are part of the rebel force. It is a ruse and \neverybody knows it is a ruse.\n  I went last August to Ukraine, spoke with almost all of the top-level \nmembers of the government and asked what it was they needed. To my \nsurprise, at the time they did not say they needed lethal equipment. \nThey needed up-to-date, up-to-the-minute intelligence, and they needed \ntraining.\n  I have urged the U.S. Government to provide that, and we are \nproviding a number of things. This Senator thinks it is clearly in the \ninterest of the United States that we provide more assistance to the \nGovernment of Ukraine so their military can have the equipment, \nincluding lethal assistance, to hold off Putin's aggression in Eastern \nUkraine.\n  This is a particularly critical time. I was there last summer, but \nwhat has happened in the meantime is over the course of the past year \noil has gone from $100 to $46 a barrel. I remember asking someone when \nI was there and in the Baltic States what did oil need to get to and \nbelow in order for Mr. Putin to start really feeling the pinch, and \nthey said anything under $85 a barrel. It is now around $46 a barrel. \nAlthough Russia has significant reserves as of a few months ago, about \n$450 billion of cash in reserves, that is lower now. Those reserves \nwill hold them for a while because of the price they are getting for \ntheir oil. They don't have high production costs in Russia, but because \nthe price is so much lower--half of what they were getting--their \nrevenue is significantly down and therefore all of the money that was \nbeing supplied by the Russian Government for so many things, a plethora \nof different social programs--guess who is feeling the pinch. The \npeople of Russia. So the aggressiveness of Mr. Putin internationally is \nan attempt to try to take his people's eye off of their own financial \ndepravity and, in fact, get it on the international scene where the \nPresident of Russia is quite adept at pounding his chest and banging \nhis fist.\n  The Ukrainians are once again fighting right now as we speak for \ntheir territory. The Ukrainian Government took back the Donetsk airport \nin Eastern Ukraine. Then the rebels came back. And I say ``rebels'' \nwith a wry smile. I mean this is the Russian Army. They came back and \nthey took it again. Last week those Russian-backed rebels broke a shaky \nceasefire agreement and they renewed the fighting with the Ukrainian \nGovernment military. This Senator feels that we have got to do more to \nhelp these people who are trying to protect their independence. If you \nrecall, last year we passed the Ukraine Freedom Support Act which \nprovides further sanctions and lethal aid such as antitank and anti-\narmor weapons, counterartillery radars, secure communications \nequipment, and tactical surveillance drones. All of that was needed.\n  The fighting that is following appears to be a steady buildup of \nRussian support for the rebels. General Hodges, the U.S. Army commander \nin Europe, said last week that since December Russia had doubled its \nsupport for the rebels. General Breedlove, the NATO Supreme Commander, \nsaid that Russian electronic warfare and defense systems have been \ndetected in the conflict areas. So let's not fool ourselves, the \nRussian Army is in there and we have to do more to help them.\n  On Syria, this Senator feels where we are having success right now in \nIraq against ISIS with the multiple strikes from the air, with training \nup the Iraqi Army as the boots on the ground, including some American \nboots on the ground that are advisers and trainers--at the end of the \nday we are going to have to do this in Syria if we are going to be \nsuccessful. It is a lot more complicated in Syria because of the Assad \ngovernment. The Free Syrian Army we are now starting to train--it is \nalmost an impossible task. We train them, they go in, they try to \nattack ISIS. ISIS attacks them, but so does the Assad regime. That is \nnot a recipe for success.\n  We are working with the vetted opposition fighters to go after ISIS \nin Syria. We have to supply support. We have to supply lethal support \nin addition to the training and equipment in\n\n[[Page S566]]\n\norder for them to be successful. And for them to be successful, it is \nabsolutely in the interest of the United States. Congress has approved \nthe training and equipping of vetted elements of the Syrian opposition, \nand the Department of Defense recently announced it will deploy 400 \npersonnel in that effort. We are going to have to do a lot more.\n  The American people are tired of war, and yet we have a new kind of \nenemy, and we are going to have to take it right to them where they \nare.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Hatch pertaining to the introduction of S. 295 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about some of the \namendments we will be voting on later this afternoon--three of them in \nparticular. The amendments I am referring to are the Merkley amendment \nNo. 125, the Carper amendment No. 120, and the Heitkamp amendment No. \n133. All three of these amendments address sensitive tax issues that \nfall squarely into the jurisdiction of the Senate Finance Committee, \nand all of them address issues that are likely to be litigated as the \nFinance Committee continues its efforts toward comprehensive tax \nreform.\n  The Finance Committee is going to be very active in this Congress. We \nhad our first bipartisan markup this morning. We already had two \nhearings, with more scheduled for next week, and perhaps more \nimportantly--at least in the context of these three votes we will be \nhaving today--we have taken concrete steps in a process we believe will \nend in the introduction of bipartisan tax reform legislation. We have \nappointed five tax reform working groups to address the various areas \nof reform. Our hope is that over the next few months these working \ngroups will study the issues and provide ideas we can use as we develop \na comprehensive tax reform proposal.\n  Ranking Member Wyden is on board with this effort. We are working \ntogether every step of the way. If we start singling out individual tax \nissues here on the floor--even issues Members may feel passionately \nabout--we are going to undermine this bipartisan process. Virtually \neveryone in both parties agrees that we need to fix our broken, \ninefficient Tax Code. Sure, there are disagreements on what the \nsubstance of tax reform should look like, but there is a growing \nconsensus on the need for reform, which is encouraging. If we are going \nto be successful in tax reform, we need to make sure these issues are \naddressed in the tax-writing committees.\n  I think it is safe to say that all of the issues my colleagues are \ntrying to address with their amendments are going to be litigated one \nway or another in the Finance Committee's efforts this year. That being \nthe case, raising these issues as floor amendments on an unrelated bill \nis, in my view, very counterproductive.\n  Finally, I would like to note that these amendments would all be \nsubject to a constitutional point of order as they all deal with \nrevenue and would need to be passed first by the House of \nRepresentatives. I am not going to raise that point of order at this \ntime; I just want to make note of it for the record.\n  Given all of these concerns, I hope my colleagues--Senators Merkley, \nCarper, and Heitkamp--will withdraw these amendments so these issues \ncan be addressed in the proper forum. If they do not withdraw their \namendments, I plan to vote against all three of them and urge all of my \ncolleagues--particularly those who have an interest in a successful tax \nreform effort--to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cruz). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. I congratulate the Presiding Officer, and I also \ncongratulate Chairman Hatch for the unanimous vote he got in today's \nmarkup in the Finance Committee. It was a great bipartisan start to our \nwork, as he said. I hope we will continue to have these discussions in \nthat manner.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 92, as Modified\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I wish to speak today about the Burr-\nBennet amendment No. 92, which we are slated to vote on later today. I \nwill be brief because it is pretty straightforward.\n  The amendment simply reauthorizes the Land and Water Conservation \nFund and ensures that a dedicated portion of LWCF funds go to provide \nnew access for our Nation's sports men and women.\n  As many in this body know, the Land and Water Conservation Fund is \none of the country's best and most important conservation programs. It \nis authorized to provide $900 million annually for efforts to preserve \nand increase access to our public lands and waterways. These resources \nhistorically have been used for projects that range from building city \nparks, to purchasing small parcels of isolated land from willing \nsellers, all the way to preserving the Nation's historic battlefields.\n  This past summer in Colorado, we completed a huge LWCF project that \nretired several old mining claims on the San Juan National Forest near \nthe town of Ophir.\n  Over the Fourth of July weekend, the town invited me and my family to \njoin them in a celebration of the accomplishment, and we took them up \non that offer without a moment's hesitation.\n  Ophir sits at 9,600 feet above sea level. It is the kind of place \nthat has a sign on its main road--clearly painted by the kids who live \nin the town--indicating that their population totals 163 people, \nincluding, according to the sign, 55 kids, 30 dogs, and 15 cats. When \nwe pulled in on the morning of the celebration, it seemed to me that \nthe entire town was there. Over the course of that day--which included \na hike, a picnic, and a formal program--it was amazing to hear from the \ncommunity about the importance of this LWCF project and how many years \nso many people in the town devoted themselves to getting it done.\n  Many of our mountain communities get huge portions of their revenue \nand business through recreation and tourism, and it is for some of \nthese reasons that the town felt LWCF literally helped cement its \neconomic future.\n  I was an LWCF supporter before that visit, but that day really drove \nhome the value of the program to me. That is only one of countless \nstories from Colorado. I know it can be replicated thousands of times \nacross the country in all 50 States. Those stories and accomplishments \nalone make this amendment worth supporting.\n  Let's also remember that when we are talking about LWCF, we are not \ntalking about taxpayer dollars. When Congress crafted the measure back \nin 1965, they had a very innovative solution for how to pay for their \nconcept. Instead of using taxpayer dollars from the Treasury, they \ndecided to dedicate a portion of the revenue the government collects \nfrom offshore oil drilling to fund LWCF. This argument was very simple \nand elegant.\n  As we deplete our natural resources--offshore reserves of oil and gas \nin this case--we ought to support the conservation of another natural \nresource: our lands and waterways. As I mentioned, Congress passed a \nlaw in 1965, and now it is time to reauthorize it. I thank Senator \nBurr, who has shown great leadership in crafting the amendment to do \njust that.\n  This amendment is thoroughly bipartisan and enjoys cosponsors such as \nSenator Ayotte, Senator Alexander, and Senator Tillis, just to name a \nfew. In fact, I am told there are 246 amendments that have been filed \non this bill, and not one amendment has the number of cosponsors that \nthis amendment does. This amendment has more cosponsors than any of the \nremaining 245 amendments.\n  Before I close and urge my colleagues to vote yes, I want to \nparaphrase something I said on the floor last week about another \namendment. Conservation policies such as LWCF are important to the \nAmerican people. Protecting our land and water is mom-and-apple-pie \nstuff in Colorado, and I know our State is not the only one. Conserved \nlands and wide-open spaces are a huge economic driver across our \ncountry, and it is part of who we are in the West.\n  We are not only talking about backcountry parcels, such as the one I \nvisited in Ophir, we are talking about building new parks in inner \ncities and providing new access to hunters and anglers. The LWCF does \nall of these things and more.\n\n[[Page S567]]\n\n  I say to my colleagues, if you are for city kids getting a new \nplayground or making sure we protect gold medal trout streams or any \nnumber of benefits in between, then you need to be for amendment No. 92 \nfrom Senator Burr. I urge all of my colleagues to support the measure \nwhen it comes time for a vote later this evening. I think we would make \na very meaningful statement about where the Senate is headed if we \ncould supply the votes necessary to actually adopt this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 75\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that in about a \nminute we are going to be voting on the first of a series of \namendments. The first amendment is the amendment I have offered which I \ntalked about before. I want to remind my colleagues what this amendment \ndoes.\n  First, it would require a notification to Governors and to county \nofficials of risks to their drinking water supplies that may be caused \nby the Keystone Pipeline.\n  Second, the local officials would have the right to bring that \ninformation back to the Federal Government so that action could be \ntaken in order to protect their drinking water supplies.\n  Third, it provides a right of action for property owners for damages \ncaused to their wells and drinking water as a direct result of the \nKeystone Pipeline construction.\n  This is a pretty straightforward amendment. It provides States rights \nin knowing what is happening with regard to their drinking water, and \nit provides property owners rights for the damages that could be caused \nas a result of Keystone.\n  I would urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would urge colleagues to oppose the \nCardin amendment.\n  In review, it appears that it is designed to halt the construction of \nthis pipeline before it even begins. The amendment tells the President \nto provide this analysis of the potential risks to public health and \nenvironment from a leak or rupture and to provide that to every \nmunicipality and every county along the route, as well as to the \nGovernors. Then the Governor can petition the President to effectively \nlocate the pipeline somewhere else, at which point, again, construction \ncould never commence.\n  The Governors of Montana, South Dakota, and Nebraska have already \napproved the pipeline route through their States. So this amendment is \nan effort, I think, to build that opposition over contamination fears \nand in turn, pressure those Governors to reverse their positions and \nhalt the pipeline's construction.\n  I think it is important for colleagues to understand the risks to the \nwater supplies along the pipeline path were examined by the State \nDepartment's final SEIS. They were found to be not significant. Again, \nI will vote no on this amendment and strongly encourage my colleagues \nto join me with this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question occurs \non agreeing to amendment No. 75.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I announce that the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Reid) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there is now 2 \nminutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 70, \noffered by the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Peters.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, as Michiganders, Senator Stabenow and I \nknow firsthand how important the Great Lakes are. The lakes are a vital \nnatural resource and an economic engine for our State, region, and the \nentire country. Unfortunately, Michiganders also know firsthand the \nenvironmental dangers and risks when it comes to pipeline leaks.\n  We had the worst inland pipeline leak in our Nation's history near \nKalamazoo, MI. Cleanup has taken over 4 years and has cost $1.2 \nbillion. There is a 60-year-old pipeline under the Straits of Mackinac \nwhere Lake Michigan and Lake Huron come together. I cannot even fathom \nwhat would happen if there were an accident that contaminated the Great \nLakes. The results would be catastrophic not only for the Great Lakes \nbut also the entire country.\n  That is why we need to act now and act quickly, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Peters-Stabenow amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am not entirely certain I like this \namendment. This is the first I have heard PHMSA may not have the \nresources to do its job. It does seem fair to have PHMSA come tell us \nif they do not have adequate resources.\n  What I most strongly oppose with this amendment is its attempt to tie \nthe construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline to an unrelated pipeline \nin a different State. There is no limit for the PHMSA study and \ncertification included here, so we could be looking, in addition to the \nalready 2,300-some-odd days this delay has been in place, at further \ndelays.\n  If my colleagues from Michigan are interested in a PHMSA study, I \nrecommend they introduce their effort as a stand-alone bill so it can \nbe considered by the committee of jurisdiction. If it is needed, we can \nmove it through the regular order and certainly consider it in the \nfuture.\n  I would ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I remind \ncolleagues that we are on 10-minute votes.\n\n[[Page S568]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 23\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is now 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 23, offered by the Senator from Vermont.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, the scientific community tells us very \nclearly that if we are going to reverse climate change and the great \ndangers it poses for our country and the planet, we must move \naggressively to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels to \nenergy efficiency and sustainable energy.\n  This amendment would provide a 15-percent rebate to homeowners so \nthat we could install 10 million new solar rooftops across the country \nwithin 10 years. This would result in enough new electrical generation \nto retire nearly 20 percent of our dirty coal-fired plants and create a \nsignificant number of new jobs.\n  So if we are interested in reversing the dangers of climate change \nand creating jobs, I would urge Senators to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the sponsor of this bill knows that I, \ntoo, am a supporter of solar, and I think we all are, but it is \nimportant to recognize what this measure would do. When we are talking \nabout the benefits to this country and how much it will cost, it is \nimportant to understand this.\n  When this was first introduced in the 110th Congress, the goal of 10 \nmillion solar roofs legislation was too costly, but we have since seen \ndecreased costs and growth in the solar industry that have made this \nFederal assistance unnecessary. We have seen the residential solar \nmarket grow, we have seen the costs drop. The cost of the solar systems \nhave dropped about 60 percent in the last 4 years. Despite these \ntrends, we are not close to reaching that 1 million mark let alone the \n10 million installations. So the real question is, How much is this \ngoing to cost us to achieve?\n  The proposed rebate per system is the lesser of 15 percent of the \ninitial capital cost. This puts the Federal Government on the hook for \nup to $100 billion to pay for these installations.\n  We can debate the merits of jobs and job creation, but I again urge \nmy colleagues to oppose the Sanders amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there is 2 minutes \nof debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. \n15, offered by the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cruz.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, this amendment would expedite the export of \nliquid natural gas and would provide countries that are members of the \nWTO the same expedited process that is currently available to free-\ntrade agreement countries.\n  There are now in the Department of Energy some 28 applications \npending to export liquid natural gas. This should be an amendment that \nwould bring together Republicans and Democrats. A recent study showed \nthat allowing us to export LNG could create as many as 450,000 new jobs \nby 2035 that could produce GDP growth of up to an additional $73.6 \nbillion and produce 76,000 more manufacturing jobs. It would aid our \nallies such as Ukraine, the Baltics, and Europe, and would weaken \ncountries such as Russia that would use natural gas for economic \nblackmail.\n  I would urge all Senators to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. The amendment offered by the Senator from Texas is\n\n[[Page S569]]\n\ndrafted so broadly that it allows just about every nation which is a \nmember of the World Trade Organization to automatically receive natural \ngas exported from the United States of America. The process is just \neliminated--automatic.\n  What will that do? No. 1, it will increase prices to American \nconsumers. The Energy Information Agency has already determined that \nthe LNG export facilities already approved are going to lead to a 50-\npercent increase in the price of natural gas here in America. It would \njeopardize American manufacturing which has seen 700,000 new jobs \ncreated in the last 5 years in America largely because of low-priced \nnatural gas. It is going to increase carbon pollution because it is \ngoing to slow the pace of change from coal over to natural gas in the \ngeneration of electricity. It is going to undermine our trade \nnegotiations because it is all going to be given away here on the \nSenate floor. And, finally, it is going to harm our national security, \nbecause if we converted one-third of our trucks and buses, it backs out \nall the oil that we import from the Persian Gulf by using natural gas \nin American vehicles. We are going to ship jobs along with that gas \ngoing overseas. I urge a ``no'' vote on the Cruz amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 73, offered by the Senator from Kansas, Mr. Moran.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has \ndetermined that the lesser prairie chicken should be listed in a number \nof States, including Kansas, as a threatened species. The lesser \nprairie chicken has had a significant history in our State and a \nsignificant population of birds, but as a result of a drought, the \nhabitat for the lesser prairie chicken and other wildlife has been \ndiminished and the number of birds has decreased.\n  The consequences of listing the lesser prairie chicken that results \nfrom a drought is so dramatic and so damaging to the Kansas economy and \nto the farmers and ranchers and the use of their lands, to the oil and \ngas industry and the exploration of oil and gas, and to the utility \nindustry in regard to the production and transmission of electricity \nthat this amendment is necessary to set aside that listing as a \nthreatened species and to allow interest holders in Kansas to come \ntogether and find a commonsense solution based upon sound science to \nprotect the habitat of this bird.\n  This is not just a Kansas issue, and in fact, this species is only \nthe precursor to problems others will have in their States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the Moran amendment, \nwhich would delist the lesser prairie chicken as a threatened species.\n  To be clear, I appreciate some of the concerns about this listing by \nfarmers, ranchers, and industry. I am concerned about any unintended \nconsequences this listing may have on rural New Mexicans. I strongly \nsupport and I assume the Senator from Kansas supports the bipartisan \nfive-State effort for a thorough review.\n\n  The Fish and Wildlife Service took numerous steps in this process to \nrespond to all stakeholders and to enable habitat conservation and \neconomic growth. New Mexico has been and continues to be a leader in \ncooperative conservation in places where the prairie chicken is found. \nRanchers and oil and gas industries deserve their praise for their \nefforts. So it is working and the sky is not falling, but we should not \ntake this top-down political approach.

Mr. President, the underlying measure benefits \nspecific investors, specific corporations, and pushes regulatory \napproval of a specific project. In that sense, it has all the earmarks \nof the biggest earmark ever.\n  We have learned from other history with earmarks that when you have a \nproject that benefits specific investors and specific corporations and \nspecific entities, there is a valuable premium on having the public \nknow about the campaign contributions relative to that project.\n  This bill requires the disclosure of over $10,000 in campaign \ncontributions from entities that will make more than $1 million off \nthis project.

Mr. President, my amendment simply expresses the sense of \nCongress that all future national monument designations should be \nsubject to consultation with local governments and the approval of the \nGovernor and legislature of the States in which such designation would \noccur. This amendment ensures that the people affected most by these \ndesignations have a seat at the table and their voices are heard.\n  The current administration, as well as past administrations--both \nRepublican and Democratic--have made efforts to stretch the intent of \nthe Antiquities Act, threatening Montanans' ability to manage our \nState's resources.\n  It is a trend we are seeing. Any bill designation that impacts land \nmanagement should be locally driven, not spearheaded in Washington.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, speaking in opposition to this \namendment, there is a reason why they call it a national monument. That \nis because it is a national process, and it is a national decision.\n  Yes, Presidents of the United States consult with Governors and \nconsult with State legislators, but they are not required to have a \nbill or the authority of the Governor before they make a national \nmonument.\n  Nearly half of our national parks, including the Grand Canyon and \nOlympic National Park, were designated under this Antiquities Act. \nSixteen Presidents--eight Republicans and eight Democrats--have \ndesignated over 130 national monuments since Teddy Roosevelt signed \nthis act in 1906.\n  I think it has worked well for the United States of America.

Mr. President, we need to take steps now to prepare for \nthe coming impact of climate change on our Nation's infrastructure.\n  The Federal Government plays a crucial role in protecting our \ninfrastructure and partnering with State and Federal, tribal, and local \ngovernments to prepare.\n  The Federal Government, including our Pentagon and the highway \nadministration, is already planning and preparing for these impacts. \nMany States are as well. From my home State of Delaware to Alaska to \nFlorida, all are already planning responsibly for the future impacts of \nclimate change. Preparing now is only responsible, because every dollar \ninvested in planning and preparing is projected to save us up to $4 in \nfuture disaster relief.\n  This amendment is supported by a number of organizations--the \nAmerican Society of Civil Engineers, the National Wildlife Federation, \nthe Union of Concerned Scientists, and others.\n  This amendment does not speak to the human role in climate change or \nemissions. It simply acknowledges that climate change is having an \nimpact on our infrastructure and suggests that planning is responsible.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I had a conversation with our colleague \nfrom Delaware, and I told him I think this is an area where we might be \nable to work together.\n  I had actually introduced an amendment that deals with the adaptation \nthat helps to assist those communities that have been affected by \nclimate. We see that up in the coastline of Alaska. Senator Merkley has \nan amendment that also deals with adaptation. This is about resilience.\n  I am going to oppose the sense-of-the-Senate at this time because of \nsome of the language. I get a little confused or am not certain we are \nstating it in the right manner. But I do think this process has been \nhealthy in the sense that by having an opportunity to have amendments \ncome forward, we find out where there might be areas where we can work \nto develop future initiatives that we all might be able to support on a \nbipartisan basis.

Mr. President, I have had an opportunity to speak on \nthis amendment several different times. Effectively, what we are doing \nis releasing wilderness study areas if within 1 year of receiving the \nrecommendation Congress has not yet designated the study area as \nwilderness.\n  Effectively, what is happening is designations will come from the \nadministration. Congress is the entity that is to approve them. But in \nthe interim these areas are managed as de facto wilderness. In fact, \nmany areas have been managed as de facto wilderness for decades because \nthe Congress has not acted.\n  So simply, what we do in this amendment is to put a time period. \nUntil the Congress makes a final determination on the wilderness study \narea, these areas will be determined not to be wilderness and not \nmanaged as such. But they are putting a time parameter on that so that \nthey are not managed as wilderness areas indefinitely.\n  I would urge a ``yes'' vote from my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, this is a sweeping attack on millions of \nacres of land recommended for wilderness. This would nullify much of \nthe Obama administration's plan for the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \nand would also immediately abolish wilderness studies on BLM lands in \n12 Western States. It would also abolish protection for 2.3 million \nacres in national wildlife refuges. These lands have been refuges, and \nthey should be managed accordingly. So I would ask my colleagues to \noppose this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Murkowski \nAmendment No. 166.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, this amendment will provide a sense of \nthe Senate that we will provide some certainty to the American wind and \nother renewable industries by taking a look at the production tax \ncredits and actually having a forward progress report so that they know \nexactly what the rules will be in the future, however short or long \nthat may be. Every year, as we do the tax extenders, there are people \nwaiting to find out if they still have a job. People in my State are \nwaiting to know whether they are going to be put to work the next day \nor even the next week based on what this Congress does. It is so \ncritical that we actually have predictability in this industry.\n  This is a jobs bill, and it is an energy bill. I can't imagine \nanything more germane to the Keystone XL Pipeline than a bill that \nprovides both jobs and certainty to an ``all of the above'' essential, \nwhich is wind.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. I \nbelieve we do need more certainty, and the certainty ought to be that \nit is time for this tax credit--particularly the wind PTC--to expire. \nThis was enacted 23 years ago as a temporary tax measure. There has \nbeen a lot of wind that has blown since that time, and we have a mature \nindustry. In fact, the other day the President said we are No. 1 in the \nworld in wind power.\n  We ought to have more certainty, and the certainty that needs to be \nthere is that the tax credit is going to end and that we stop picking \nwinners and losers in the energy economy.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to speak on Amendment No. \n133, offered by Senator Heitkamp of North Dakota. The amendment is a \nsense of Congress that the renewable electricity tax credit should be \nextended for 5 years. While I supported the amendment, I would like to \nexpress my concerns regarding the consideration of this amendment at \nthis time.\n  I have been an outspoken supporter of renewable energy for many \nyears. In fact, I first authored the wind production tax credit in 1992 \nto drive this renewable energy technology. I have worked for many years \nto provide as much certainty as possible to grow the domestic wind \nindustry. Iowa has seen an enormous investment in wind energy \nmanufacturing and wind farm development. I know firsthand the boom-and-\nbust cycle that exists for renewable energy producers when Congress \nfails to extend these critically important tax incentives.\n  But I also know this credit won't go on forever. It was never meant \nto, and it shouldn't. In 2012 the wind industry was the only industry \nto put forward a phaseout plan. A number of my colleagues here in the \nSenate have been working to construct a responsible, multiyear phaseout \nof the wind tax credit. That is why I am somewhat puzzled by an \namendment that suggests a 5-year extension of this credit. It seems \ndisconnected with reality.\n  I would remind my colleagues on the other side that in November of \n2014, the House offer on tax extenders included a multiyear extension \nof the wind production tax credit that would have provided the \ncertainty and soft landing that most of us and the industry support, \nbut President Obama issued a veto threat before the ink was dry, and as \na result the wind incentive expired.\n  Again, I strongly support wind energy, but I support a prudent way \nforward on an extension of the production tax credit. This amendment \nfails terribly in that regard. That is why I am disappointed that the \nSenator from North Dakota insisted on going forward with a 5-year \nextension on this bill. This is not a real effort to extend the wind \nincentive. I am afraid this was simply a politically motivated effort \ndesigned to score political points.\n\n[[Page S573]]\n\nIt is unfortunate that in this case, politicking has trumped efforts to \nachieve sound, responsible policy.\n  Rather than offer ``gotcha'' amendments on an unrelated bill, we \nshould be working together to craft an extension of these important tax \nincentives that work for the wind industry, that are realistic \npolitically, and that make sense for the American taxpayer. That effort \nrequires regular order, working through the Finance Committee, to \ndetermine the most prudent path forward. It should be done in the \ncontext of comprehensive tax reform, where all energy tax provisions \nare on the table, rather than as a sense of the Congress on the \nunrelated Keystone XL bill.\n  I hope that with this political exercise behind us, those of us who \nseek to ensure a responsible transition for the wind production tax \ncredit can get to work and achieve a sensible policy for those who \ndepend on it. It is too bad that this ill-timed, ill-conceived \namendment may have actually harmed those efforts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. COATS.

Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor \nof the Keystone XL Pipeline Act. As it stands now, gas companies in \nthis country do not have to comply with the Safe Drinking Water Act--\nthe law that keeps our tapwater clear, safe, and clean.\n  For decades now, this loophole has exempted hydrofracking and gas \nstorage companies from this law, even though every other energy \nindustry, including oil and coal industries, is legally obligated to \ncomply. If big coal can comply with this law, so can gas companies.\n  This special exemption is unfair, it is unnecessary, and it is \nunsafe. My amendment would finally remove it from the law. I urge my \ncolleagues not to let this chance pass us by.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, claiming the 1 minute in opposition. As \nthe Senator from New York has described, this would apply to the \nrequirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act to underground ejection of \nnatural gas. Currently the Safe Drinking Water Act expressly prohibits \nthis application.\n  This amendment to add the requirements to the Safe Drinking Water Act \nis beyond the scope of the immediate Keystone debate. We are debating \nthe approval of a pipeline that is going to carry oil, not gas. If the \nSenator from New York wants to debate the issues of fracking--most \ncertainly those issues are before the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, and the Safe Drinking Water Act--I would welcome a stand-\nalone bill. We will have those discussions, but on this measure I would \noppose and encourage Members to vote against the Gillibrand amendment.\n  I would remind Members we are so close to wrapping up this series of \namendments. If we can ask the folks to stick around for these final few \nand keep to the 10-minute line. I know Senator Feinstein is looking to \nencourage the women of the Senate to gather for a meal later on, and \nthat would be important for us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I think Members have been given the \noutline for tomorrow morning that will take us through a final vote on \ncloture so that we can get to final passage of the Keystone XL \nPipeline.\n  I appreciate the consideration and the courtesy of all Members. It \nhas been a long day. We have worked through about a dozen additional \namendments, if my count is correct, and we have done it in pretty good \norder. We have done it while there have been a number of committee \nmeetings going on, which can be very disruptive, but I think with the \nlevel of cooperation we have had, we will be able to conclude our \nbusiness at a relatively civilized hour this evening.\n  I appreciate the good work of my partner and ranking member Senator \nCantwell in getting us to this place. I am hopeful that with the number \nof amendments we have outlined for the morning and then the handful of \ngermane amendments we will have in the afternoon, we will be able to \nmove on to other business before the Senate. But I thank my colleagues \nfor all of the effort and cooperation we have had to this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague from Alaska \nfor her hard work in getting us through this process. I think our \ncolleagues can see the daylight to finishing this up tomorrow, \nhopefully. I know Members have worked across the aisle on some of these \nremaining issues, and we are still trying to work a few of them out. So \nhopefully tomorrow will go as smoothly as today has.\n  I would like to turn now to my colleague from New Mexico to call up \nhis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 77\n\n       (Purpose: To establish a renewable electricity standard, \n     and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment so that I may call up my amendment No. 77.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Udall], for himself, Mr. \n     Markey, and Mr. Bennet, proposes an amendment numbered 77.\n\n  Mr. UDALL. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of January 20, 2015, under \n``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, let me just say to the two leaders on the \nfloor who have participated in this open amendment process that I \nreally appreciate the way Chairwoman Murkowski and Ranking Member \nCantwell have worked through this bill. I really appreciate all their \nhelp.\n  I have heard, at least on our side of the aisle, over and over that \nthis is the way the Senate should be moving, this is the way we should \nbe working. So I think all of us are very appreciative of how the two \nmanagers of the bill have worked together.\n  I thank my colleagues, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I thank our colleague for his kind comments. We do \nhave one more consent request here very briefly.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the order of votes on the Burr and the \nDaines amendments be reversed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. With that, Mr. President, I again thank Members for \ntheir cooperation today and look forward to yet another productive day \ntomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation to the \nbill managers for their hard work today and for their efforts in the \nwork that was done in a bipartisan way on this legislation. I know both \nthe bill managers have spent an awful lot of time putting together \nthese amendments, and I think they have really bent over backward to \nmake sure Members on both sides of the aisle have had an opportunity to \nfile their amendments, to make those amendments pending, and to get \nvotes on the amendments. So I would like to express my appreciation to \nboth of them for all the work they have done and for the process today \nin voting on amendments.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, yesterday the Congressional Budget Office--\nthe CBO--released its budget and economic outlook showing the forecast \nthrough 2025. It should strike fear in the heart of anybody who is \nconcerned about this country's financial future.\n  The very short-term news is good. The deficit is projected to fall--\nbut only for another 2 years. In 2017 the deficit is projected to start \nrising again to $1.1 trillion in 10 years. That is the annual deficit. \nBy 2025 the deficit will be 4 percent of our overall economy.\n  Right now the country's debt in cumulative deficits over the years--\nthe cumulative debt--is $18 trillion. This year we will pay about $277 \nbillion just servicing that debt. That amount might seem low, but it is \nbecause of artificially low interest rates. In 10 years we will pay \nabout $827 billion a year just to service the debt. That is 3 percent \nof our economy just to pay interest on the debt. That is unsustainable.\n  Don't take my word for it, though. You can take CBO's. They said:\n\n       Such large and growing Federal debt would have serious \n     negative consequences, including increasing Federal spending \n     for interest payments; restraining economic growth in the \n     long term; giving policymakers less flexibility to respond to \n     unexpected challenges; and eventually heightening the risk of \n     a financial crisis.\n\n  I have been working on these issues--this issue in particular--for a \nlong time, and I have to admit that sometimes it is tough to get people \nto focus on this topic. But we shouldn't be fooled and patting \nourselves on the back just because we have done things such as getting \nrid of earmarks. That is a good thing, but it is certainly insufficient \nto address our spending.\n  The culture in Washington is still the culture of runaway spending, \nnot just in earmarks, as I said, not just in wasteful spending. For \nexample, spending on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid will \nnearly double over the next decade alone. This is not a revenue problem \nthat we are having. Projected revenues will exceed their 50-year \nhistorical average of 17 percent of GDP this year and will grow to over \n18 percent of the economy in this decade.\n  The culture of spending in Washington is something that defies logic, \ndefies math and an honest assessment of who we are as a country. As a \nresult, the United States is fast becoming a once-prosperous nation. We \ndon't want that designation. It is truly a frightening distinction. Yet \ntoo few in Washington are motivated to get this country's fiscal house \nin order. One has to wonder how bad it is going to have to get to prod \nthose who are not yet motivated.\n  Some will argue that we need to take baby steps to address our fiscal \ncrisis. I think we are well past that time, but whatever kinds of steps \nwe take, we need to take them now. We need to turn this culture of \nspending in Washington to one that will fully repair our economy. That \nwill give the private sector the stability and confidence to create \njobs. We also need to reform our cumbersome Tax Code. Most of all, we \nneed to relieve future generations of the burden of our financial mess.\n  In short, it is well past time to start climbing our way out of this \nfiscal hole we are in.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here now for the 87th consecutive \nweek the Senate has been in session to urge action on climate change.\n  We have had an interesting couple of weeks on the Keystone Pipeline, \nbut from a climate change and carbon pollution point of view, this \nwould obviously not be helpful. Indeed, it would\n\n[[Page S576]]\n\nbe a disaster leading to as much as 27 million--27 million--metric tons \nof additional carbon dioxide emitted per year. To put that number into \nsome perspective, that is the equivalent of adding 6 million cars and \ntrucks to our roads for 50 years. So it is a very considerable carbon \nprice to pay.\n  We have seen a poster used on the Senate Floor that says it will have \nno environmental effect. That is not precisely true. Indeed, precisely \nthe opposite is true. This is the environmental effect it will have, \nand it is considerable. The report referred to went on to say that it \nwould be offset by the fact that this fuel would go out by rail anyway. \nBut that offset was conditioned on a fuel price above $75 per barrel of \noil, and we are at $50. So there is no way that conclusion can stand, \nand the underlying fact is what prevails--27 million metric tons of \nadditional carbon dioxide.\n  It is obviously very bad from an environmental perspective. It is a \nlot of ``not much'' from a jobs perspective. Every 4 days we add more \njobs than the construction of this pipeline just through the economic \nrecovery that is taking place.\n  This is a little bit hard to explain, particularly when you think \nthat this bill is going to be dead on arrival at the White House. We \nhave known from the beginning that this is going to be vetoed. But it \nhas allowed the oil and the fossil fuel industry to show their hands. \nThis is all being done on behalf of a foreign oil company and on behalf \nof the fossil fuel industry.\n  When we look at what we have been through in the past couple of days, \nthere are some interesting choices the Senate has made if you are a \nforeign oil company. If you are a foreign oil company, we will let you \nuse eminent domain to extinguish the property rights of farmers and \nranchers and take their farms and ranches away. If you are a foreign \noil company, we will exempt you from the oilspill recovery fund--the \nFederal excise tax on petroleum--so you don't have to pay the taxes \nAmerican companies have to pay. If you are a foreign oil company, we \nwill not require you to use American steel in a pipeline being built \nacross America being touted as a source of American jobs. If you are a \nforeign oil company, we won't require you to sell it in the American \nmarket even though it is touted as a product that will help balance \nAmerica's energy portfolio.\n\n  So, so far, not much good to show for all of this but one thing, and \nthat is that this exercise has at last brought the issue of climate \nchange to the floor of the Senate.\n  We have not had much debate about climate change since the Citizens \nUnited decision back in 2010 allowed the fossil fuel industry to cast a \nvery long shadow of intimidation across this body. They spend a huge \namount of the money that has been freed up by Citizens United. They \nspend a huge amount of dark money that flows post Citizens United. And \nsince then, the Republican Party has been virtually muzzled on that \nsubject. So having Republicans talk about climate change on the Senate \nfloor was something of a revelation, and I don't think we should \nunderestimate the importance of that or undervalue what was said.\n  The senior Senator from North Carolina came to the floor and said \nthis:\n\n       The concept that climate change is real, I completely \n     understand and accept. To the point of how much man is \n     contributing, I don't know, but it does make sense that man-\n     made emissions are contributing.\n       . . . the greenhouse gas effect seems to me scientifically \n     sound. The problem is that how you fix this globally is going \n     to require more than just the U.S. being involved.\n\n  Which I think we all agree with.\n  The senior Senator from Alaska, who is our chairman of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee and the floor manager on this very bill, \nagreed, stating that she hopes we can all, quoting her, get beyond the \ndiscussion as to whether or not climate change is real and talk about \nwhat do we do.\n  I look forward to that discussion about what do we do. It is not \nenough just to say, OK, we finally concede that climate change is \nreally happening. We really do have to get on to what do we do.\n  Even if you disagree with me that climate change is real and very \nsignificant and consequential for our country, if you will spot me that \nthere is just a 10-percent chance that I am right--even just a 2-\npercent chance that I am right--when we consider the possible harms, it \nis something that grownup adults and responsible people ought to take a \nlook at and come together and decide what to do.\n  We have been through some very notable benchmarks. We hit for the \nfirst time last year 400 parts per million of carbon dioxide in our \natmosphere for more than 3 months. They have been tracking this in \nHawaii, at the top of the mountain at the Mauna Loa laboratory for \ndecades now, and 400 parts per million for more than 3 months is a new \nrecord.\n  To put that in context: For as long as human beings have been on this \nplanet, all the way back to when we were living in caves, the range of \ncarbon in the atmosphere has been 170 to 300 parts per million. So we \nare well outside the range that has been our comfortable safe range for \nhuman habitation of this planet during our entire human experience, and \n400 is a big move when our entire range is only 130 points and now we \nare 100 parts per million out of that.\n  Some of this lands in the oceans. The oceans have absorbed about a \nquarter of all our carbon emissions. We can measure their pH level. \nThis isn't complicated. This isn't something we have to do with \nelaborate computer models.\n  What we see is that the pH level of the oceans is changing rapidly. \nThe oceans are acidifying rapidly. When I say rapidly, they are \nacidifying at a rate that we have not seen in 25 to perhaps 30 or 50 \nmillion years. Indeed, some studies say nothing like this has been seen \non the face of the Earth for as long as 300 million years. When we \nconsider that our species has been around for about 200,000 years, that \nis a pretty long window to be launching new and dramatic changes in our \noceans.\n  There is nothing new about the science that supports this. John \nTyndall wrote the first report about the greenhouse gas effect to the \nBritish Academy of Sciences in 1861. The pages who are here and have \nstudied history will know that 1861 was the year President Lincoln took \noffice. So the scientific community has been aware of the greenhouse \ngas phenomenon since Abraham Lincoln was driving up and down \nPennsylvania Avenue in a carriage with his top hat on.\n  There is not much new that is there, and the latest data is clearer \nand clearer that we just continue apace to warm the planet.\n  Professor Jonathan Overpeck is at the University of Arizona, and \nArizona is certainly feeling the heat. Professor Overpeck said:\n\n       The global warmth of 2014 is just another reminder that the \n     planet is warming and warming fast. . . . Humans, and their \n     burning of fossil fuels, are dominating the Earth's climate \n     system like never before.\n\n  It is equally clear, when we look at the oceans, they not only absorb \na lot of the carbon dioxide and acidify as a result--they absorb most \nof the heat. In fact, they absorb 90 percent of the excess heat that \nhas been trapped by the greenhouse gases that we have flooded our \natmosphere with.\n  I certainly see that in Rhode Island, where Narragansett Bay's mean \nwinter water temperature is up 3 to 4 degrees Fahrenheit since we had \nour big hurricane of 1938. That is significant, because it means more \nlikely storms. It is associated with sea level rise. We have 10 more \ninches of sea level at the Newport Naval Station. So if the 1938 \nhurricane were to repeat itself now, it would have 10 more inches of \nsea to hammer against our shores. And that is not a complicated \nmeasure, either. We do that with thermometers.\n  So since the Industrial Revolution, human beings have dumped 2 \ntrillion metric tons of carbon dioxide into the air and into the \natmosphere. Said another way, that is 2,000 billion metric tons of \ncarbon dioxide.\n  The notion that has no effect, when we have known since Abraham \nLincoln's day that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, and when we put \nthat much in and when we can measure that it is at 400 for the first \ntime in human history--connect the dots. How much does it take? It is \nreally pretty obvious.\n  Folks who remain skeptical--well, I know, I am not a scientist. I get \nthat. So ask one. That is all I request. And I don't think that is too \nmuch to ask of colleagues. And, by the way, do me one favor. You can \nask the scientist that you please, but please don't ask a scientist who \nis in the pay of the fossil\n\n[[Page S577]]\n\nfuel and the denial industry. There are a bunch of them who are out \nthere. They turn up at all the usual denial conferences. They write in \nthe denial journals. They take money from the denial organizations that \nall have fossil fuel industry funding behind them. Go to someplace \nneutral.\n  For instance, go to your own State university, like the University of \nArizona or the University of Oklahoma. The dean of the relevant \ndepartment at the University of Oklahoma signed the IPCC report and \nstarted Climate Central. Ask your own university. Ask any major \nscientific organization. All the major recognized scientific \norganizations in the United States of America are on board, agree that \nthis is real, agree that this is important, agree that it is vital, and \nbelieve that we are actually near the tipping point that may make the \ndamage irrecoverable.\n  If you don't want to go to your home State university and if you \ndon't want to go to America's major scientific societies, try NOAA and \nNASA.\n  Think about NASA for a moment. As I give this speech, there is a \nRover that is the size of an SUV being driven around on the surface of \nMars. We built a Rover, shot it to Mars, landed it safely, and are now \ndriving it around. Do we think those scientists might actually know \nsomething? Do we think they might know what they are talking about? Do \nwe think they might merit our confidence? So ask them and see what they \nsay.\n  Or, if you want, ask some of America's leading corporations. If you \nare from Arkansas, go and ask Walmart. They will tell you. If you are \nfrom Georgia, go and ask Coca-Cola. They will tell you. This is not \nhard to discover once you get away from that little stable of denial \nscientists who are so closely affiliated with the fossil fuel industry.\n  I do this every week because we have the arrogance so often here to \nthink how much our laws--the laws that we pass--matter. But the laws \nthat we pass are passing things. They come and they go. They have their \ntime. They are repealed, they are replaced, they fall into desuetude.\n  But some laws last, and those are the laws that God laid down upon \nthis Earth that guide its operations. Those are the laws of physics, \nthe laws of chemistry, the laws of biology, the law of gravity. We \ncannot repeal those laws. We must face their consequences. And we know \nthe consequences of continuing to emit gigatons of carbon dioxide into \nour planet is going to launch us into an environment in which the \nhabitability of Earth as we have known it will be put into question.\n  History makes its judgments about every generation. If we do not take \ncalm and reasonable and sensible precautions about this obvious known \nand admitted risk, then when that risk comes home to roost, we will be \nduly shamed.\n  So let us avoid that. Let us get to work. Let us take advantage of \nthe opening that the distinguished senior Senator from Alaska and the \ndistinguished senior Senator from South Carolina have opened for us, \nand let us do what is right by our country and by the judgment that we \ncan anticipate from history.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a great \nKentuckian and a man who has dedicated his entire career to promoting \ncivil rights and helping people. My good friend Ben Richmond, the \nlongtime president and CEO of the Louisville Urban League, recently \nannounced his impending retirement from that position. Mr. Richmond has \nserved as president and CEO of the Louisville Urban League for nearly \n30 years--since 1987.\n  Mr. Richmond is a civil rights champion who has led a venerable civil \nrights institution such as the Louisville Urban League to new heights. \nUnder his tenure, the Louisville Urban League has promoted job training \nand education for many in Louisville's African-American community. His \nbody of work is so outstanding that in 2007 he received from the city \nthe Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Freedom Award, a recognition for a local \nactivist who is dedicated to King's principles and who has promoted \npeace, equality, and justice.\n  Since Mr. Richmond took over the Louisville Urban League, the staff \nhas grown from around 20 to 30 and the annual budget grown from under \n$1 million to around $3.3 million. Mr. Richmond is the driving force \nfor fundraising for the budget.\n  The Louisville Urban League placed more than 200 people in jobs last \nyear with a combined annual income of nearly $5 million. It helped \nabout 1,000 prepare for finding employment through career expos, job \ntraining, referrals, and career counseling. It also has many programs \nto help youth and seniors.\n  The Louisville Urban League is nearly halfway towards realizing their \ngoal of seeing 15,000 local African Americans earn college degrees \nbetween 2012 and 2020. Mr. Richmond oversaw the Louisville Urban \nLeague's move to a new headquarters in 1990. And under Mr. Richmond's \ntenure, the Louisville Urban League was just one of 13 Urban League \naffiliates nationwide to receive a top score in a self-audit required \nby the National Urban League.\n  I should add my interest in the Urban League is personal--my father \nonce served on the board of the Louisville Urban League. I believe he \nknew Ben Richmond. We are lucky, that after his retirement, Mr. \nRichmond plans on staying in Louisville. Our city can continue to \nbenefit from his wisdom and experience.\n  I want to wish my good friend Mr. Ben Richmond all the best in \nretirement, and I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in congratulating \nBen for his successful tenure at the helm of the Louisville Urban \nLeague. The city of Louisville and the State of Kentucky have certainly \nbenefitted immeasurably by his many efforts over the decades.\n  The Louisville Courier-Journal newspaper recently published an \narticle extolling Mr. Ben Richmond's many accomplishments. I ask \nunanimous consent that said article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Courier-Journal, Jan. 21, 2015]\n\n                   Urban League CEO Richmond Retiring\n\n                         (By Sheldon S. Shafer)\n\n       Ben Richmond, a cornerstone of local social activism for \n     more than a quarter century and a major advocate of economic \n     equality, is retiring as president and CEO of the Louisville \n     Urban League.\n       Richmond announced his impending retirement at an Urban \n     League board meeting Tuesday, after serving as head of the \n     civil-rights organization since 1987.\n       Under the leadership of Richmond, a mainstay in the push to \n     improve economic development in western Louisville, the Urban \n     League has long been dedicated to promoting job training and \n     education, primarily for Louisville's poorer citizens.\n       Richmond ``has been one of the anchors for diversity and \n     for stability in not only the African-American community but \n     the overall Louisville community,'' said Raoul Cunningham, \n     Louisville NAACP president. ``I am going to miss Ben, his \n     counsel and his cooperative spirit.''\n       Richmond ``has become known around the country for \n     innovative and groundbreaking approaches to helping residents \n     improve their quality of life,'' said Dan Hall, a University \n     of Louisville vice president and the Urban League board \n     chairman. ``He is intensely passionate about helping \n     individuals find a pathway to success.''\n       Richmond received Louisville Metro's Dr. Martin Luther King \n     Jr. Freedom Award in 2007, an annual recognition given by the \n     city to a local activist dedicated to King's principles and \n     who has promoted peace, equality and justice.\n       Then-Mayor Jerry Abramson said at the time that ``over his \n     decades of leadership, countless lives have been improved \n     through Ben's tireless efforts in workforce development, \n     housing and youth programs.''\n       The national Urban League was founded in 1910, and the \n     Louisville agency in 1921. The\n\n[[Page S578]]\n\n     local league was set up chiefly to help rural black \n     Southerners who had moved to Louisville after World War I.\n       The Louisville Urban League under Richmond has greatly \n     expanded its reach. It placed about 250 people in jobs last \n     year and helped around 1,000 more prepare for finding \n     employment. The league's career-development efforts range \n     from helping job seekers draft resumes to mock job \n     interviews.\n       In recent times the league has sponsored Saturday morning \n     enrichment classes for children. And it has found buyers for \n     dozens of new single-family homes built on vacant or \n     abandoned property under its Project Rebound program in \n     Russell, helping to transform the surrounding neighborhood.\n       League efforts annually include career expos; job training, \n     referrals and career counseling; a variety of services for \n     employers; homeownership training and counseling; a health \n     and wellness program called Get Fit Louisville; a walk to \n     defeat childhood obesity; and a long list of programs to help \n     both youths and seniors in many ways.\n       Benjamin K. Richmond, 71 and single, was born in Durham, \n     N.C., and raised in Jackson, Miss.\n       Richmond came to the Louisville Urban League as president \n     and CEO in 1987, after top jobs with league affiliates in \n     Wisconsin and Michigan. Richmond here replaced the league's \n     longtime leader, the late Art Walters. Walters, who died in \n     2010 at age 91, directed the Louisville Urban League from \n     1970 to 1987.\n       Since Richmond took over, the league's staff has grown from \n     around 20 to 30--also aided by dozens of volunteers--and its \n     annual budget has grown from under $1 million to around $3.3 \n     million this year. The funds have been cobbled together \n     largely by Richmond--from Metro United Way and numerous \n     public and private sources.\n       The current budget, for instance, includes about $340,000 \n     from United Way, less than $100,000 from Metro Government and \n     a $1.2 million federal grant earmarked primarily for programs \n     for seniors.\n       The league has several departments, including the Center \n     for Workforce Development, the Center for Housing and \n     Financial Empowerment and the Center for Youth Development \n     and Education.\n       Richmond said in an interview Monday that he expects to \n     remain on the job until around June 30, or until a \n     replacement is named by the agency's board, after a planned \n     national search. He said he may then stay on under a contract \n     for a while longer.\n       Richmond intends to stay in Louisville, while traveling \n     some to visit relatives in Mississippi and Arizona.\n       But he pledges to remain active, noting that ``there are \n     many opportunities in both the public and private sectors \n     here. I will see what emerges. But I want to have fun.''\n       Among many achievements during his tenure, Richmond cited:\n       Opening the league headquarters in 1990 at 1535 W. \n     Broadway, a 19,000-square-foot office, community meeting \n     site, classroom and job-training facility. The league \n     invested $1.6 million in the headquarters, which was paid off \n     long ago. Richmond said the league headquarters has spurred \n     significant nearby development along Broadway.\n       The economic impact of the league in terms of finding jobs \n     for more than 200 people last year. Their combined annual \n     income should be nearly $5 million.\n       Richmond noted that in recent years the league helped find \n     jobs for dozens of minorities in construction of the KFC Yum! \n     Center, and he said the league was instrumental in getting \n     the PGA of America to establish an urban youth golf program \n     and also hire top staff minorities.\n       That a halfway point has nearly been reached toward a \n     goal--shared with partner organizations such as Simmons \n     College and Jefferson Community and Technical College--to \n     have 15,000 local African-Americans earn college degrees \n     between 2012 and 2020. The minority effort is part of the \n     community's 55,000 Degrees effort.\n       That the league last year received a top score in a self-\n     audit--a review of its staff, policies, finances and \n     procedures--required every three years by the National Urban \n     League. The Louisville agency was just one of 13 affiliates \n     of the national organization to achieve that status, Richmond \n     said.\n       Richmond said he is proud that under his oversight the \n     local league has attained financial stability, adding that he \n     believes his organized is widely respected.\n       Under Richmond, the league has become more diversified. \n     About half of its 36-member board and about half the staff \n     are white. Richmond said he has strived to ``practice what we \n     preach--racial diversity.''\n       Richmond ``has been a tremendous leader,'' said Metro \n     Councilman David Tandy, D-4th District. ``There is still work \n     to do, but he has been at the forefront of the second, or \n     third, wave of the civil-rights movement, focusing on \n     economic opportunity. ... He has played a pivotal role in the \n     community.''\n       Richmond ``has tried to create opportunities and meet \n     challenges our community has faced,'' said longtime ally Sam \n     Watkins, president of the Louisville Central Community \n     Center, another West End-based, pro-development group.\n       ``He's been a champion for west Louisville and has been \n     proactive in trying to garner desperately needed attention \n     for the area's issues and problems.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/28/senate-section/article/S578-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S578-S579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE, NUTRITION AND FORESTRY\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS.

The chairman may designate the ranking \n     minority member to preside at hearings of the committee or \n     subcommittee.\n       Rule 3.--Meetings of the committee or a subcommittee, \n     including meetings to conduct hearings, shall be open to the \n     public except as otherwise specifically provided in \n     subsections (b) and (d) of rule 26.5 of the Standing Rules of \n     the Senate.\n       Rule 4.--(a) Subject to paragraph (b), one-third of the \n     membership of the committee, actually present, shall \n     constitute a quorum for the purpose of transacting business. \n     Any quorum of the committee which is composed of less than a \n     majority of the members of the committee shall include at \n     least one member of the majority and one member of the \n     minority.\n       (b) A majority of the members of a subcommittee, actually \n     present, shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of \n     transacting business: provided, no measure or matter shall be \n     ordered reported unless such majority shall include at least \n     one member of the minority who is a member of the \n     subcommittee. If, at any subcommittee meeting, a measure or \n     matter cannot be ordered reported because of the absence of \n     such a minority member, the measure or matter shall lay over \n     for a day. If the presence of a member of the minority is not \n     then obtained, a majority of the members of the subcommittee, \n     actually present, may order such measure or matter reported.\n       (c) No measure or matter shall be ordered reported from the \n     committee or a subcommittee unless a majority of the \n     committee or subcommittee is physically present.\n       Rule 5.--With the approval of the chairman of the committee \n     or subcommittee, one member thereof may conduct public \n     hearings other than taking sworn testimony.\n       Rule 6.--Proxy voting shall be allowed on all measures and \n     matters before the committee or a subcommittee if the absent \n     member has been informed of the matter on which he is being \n     recorded and has affirmatively requested that he be so \n     recorded. While proxies may be voted on a motion to report a \n     measure or matter from the committee, such a motion shall \n     also require the concurrence of a majority of the members who \n     are actually present at the time such action is taken.\n       The committee may poll any matters of committee business as \n     a matter of unanimous consent; provided that every member is \n     polled and every poll consists of the following two \n     questions:\n       (1) Do you agree or disagree to poll the proposal; and\n       (2) Do you favor or oppose the proposal.\n       Rule 7.--There shall be prepared and kept a complete \n     transcript or electronic recording adequate to fully record \n     the proceedings of each committee or subcommittee meeting or \n     conference whether or not such meetings or any part thereof \n     is closed pursuant to the specific provisions of subsections \n     (b) and (d) of rule 26.5 of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     unless a majority of said members vote to forgo such a \n     record. Such records shall contain the vote cast by each \n     member of the committee or subcommittee on any question on \n     which a ``yea and nay'' vote is demanded, and shall be \n     available for inspection by any committee member.

In the case of an \n     executive session, the text of any bill or joint resolution \n     to be considered must be provided to the chairman for prompt \n     electronic distribution to the members of the committee.\n       Rule 9.--The committee or a subcommittee shall require all \n     witnesses heard before it to file written statements of their \n     proposed testimony at least 24 hours before a hearing, unless \n     the chairman and the ranking minority member determine that \n     there is good cause for failure to so file, and to limit \n     their oral presentation to brief summaries of their \n     arguments. Testimony may be filed electronically. The \n     presiding officer at any hearing is authorized to limit the \n     time of each witness appearing before the committee or a \n     subcommittee. The committee or a subcommittee shall, as far \n     as practicable, utilize testimony previously taken on bills \n     and measures similar to those before it for consideration.\n       Rule 10.--Should a subcommittee fail to report back to the \n     full committee on any measure within a reasonable time, the \n     chairman may withdraw the measure from such subcommittee and \n     report that fact to the full committee for further \n     disposition.\n       Rule 11.--No subcommittee may schedule a meeting or hearing \n     at a time designated for a hearing or meeting of the full \n     committee. No more than one subcommittee executive meeting \n     may be held at the same time.\n       Rule 12.--It shall be the duty of the chairman in \n     accordance with section 133(c) of the Legislative \n     Reorganization Act of 1946, as amended, to report or cause to \n     be reported to the Senate, any measure or recommendation \n     approved by the committee and to take or cause to be taken, \n     necessary steps to bring the matter to a vote in the Senate.\n       Rule 13.--Whenever a meeting of the committee or \n     subcommittee is closed pursuant to the provisions of \n     subsection (b) or (d) of rule 26.5 of the Standing Rules of \n     the Senate, no person other than members of the committee, \n     members of the staff of the committee, and designated \n     assistants to members of the committee shall be permitted to \n     attend such closed session, except by special dispensation of \n     the committee or subcommittee or the chairman thereof.\n       Rule 14.--The chairman of the committee or a subcommittee \n     shall be empowered to adjourn any meeting of the committee or \n     a subcommittee if a quorum is not present within fifteen \n     minutes of the time schedule for such meeting.\n       Rule 15.-- Whenever a bill or joint resolution shall be \n     before the committee or a subcommittee for final \n     consideration, the clerk shall distribute to each member of \n     the committee or subcommittee a document, prepared by the \n     sponsor of the bill or joint resolution. If the bill or joint \n     resolution has no underlying statutory language, the document \n     shall consist of a detailed summary of the purpose and impact \n     of each section. If the bill or joint resolution repeals or \n     amends any statute or part thereof, the document shall \n     consist of a detailed summary of the underlying statute and \n     the proposed changes in each section of the underlying law \n     and either a print of the statute or the part or section \n     thereof to be amended or replaced showing by stricken-through \n     type, the part or parts to be omitted and, in italics, the \n     matter proposed to be added, along with a summary of the \n     proposed changes; or a side-by-side document showing a \n     comparison of current law, the proposed legislative changes, \n     and a detailed description of the proposed changes.\n       Rule 16.--An appropriate opportunity shall be given the \n     minority to examine the proposed text of committee reports \n     prior to their filing or publication. In the event there are \n     supplemental, minority, or additional views, an appropriate \n     opportunity shall be given the majority to examine the \n     proposed text prior to filing or publication. Unless the \n     chairman and ranking minority member agree on a shorter \n     period of time, the minority shall have no fewer than three \n     business days to prepare supplemental, minority or additional \n     views for inclusion in a committee report from the time the \n     majority makes the proposed text of the committee report \n     available to the minority.\n       Rule 17.--(a) The committee, or any subcommittee, may issue \n     subpoenas, or hold hearings to take sworn testimony or hear \n     subpoenaed witnesses, only if such investigative activity has \n     been authorized by majority vote of the committee.\n       (b) For the purpose of holding a hearing to take sworn \n     testimony or hear subpoenaed witnesses, three members of the \n     committee or subcommittee shall constitute a quorum: \n     provided, with the concurrence of the chairman and ranking \n     minority member of the committee or subcommittee, a single \n     member may hear subpoenaed witnesses or take sworn testimony.\n       (c) The committee may, by a majority vote, delegate the \n     authority to issue subpoenas to the chairman of the committee \n     or a subcommittee, or to any member designated by such \n     chairman. Prior to the issuance of each subpoena, the ranking \n     minority member of the committee or subcommittee, and any \n     other member so requesting, shall be notified regarding the \n     identity of the person to whom it will be issued and the \n     nature of the information sought and its relationship to the \n     authorized investigative activity, except where the chairman \n     of the committee or subcommittee, in consultation with the \n     ranking minority member, determines that such notice would \n     unduly impede the investigation. All information obtained \n     pursuant to such investigative activity shall be made \n     available as promptly as possible to each member of the \n     committee requesting same, or to any assistant to a member of \n     the committee designated by such member in writing, but the \n     use of any such information is subject to restrictions \n     imposed by the rules of the Senate. Such information, to the \n     extent that it is relevant to the investigation shall, if \n     requested by a member, be summarized in writing as soon as \n     practicable. Upon the request of any member, the chairman of \n     the committee or subcommittee shall call an executive session \n     to discuss such investigative activity or the issuance of any \n     subpoena in connection therewith.\n       (d) Any witness summoned to testify at a hearing, or any \n     witness giving sworn testimony, may be accompanied by counsel \n     of his own choosing who shall be permitted, while the witness \n     is testifying, to advise him of his legal rights.\n       (e) No confidential testimony taken or confidential \n     material presented in an executive hearing, or any report of \n     the proceedings of such an executive hearing, shall be made \n     public, either in whole or in part or by way of summary, \n     unless authorized by a majority of the members of the \n     committee or subcommittee.\n       Rule 18.--Presidential nominees shall submit a statement of \n     their background and financial interests, including the \n     financial interests of their spouse and children living in \n     their household, on a form approved by the committee which \n     shall be sworn to as to its completeness and accuracy. The \n     committee form shall be in two parts--\n       (I) information relating to employment, education and \n     background of the nominee relating to the position to which \n     the individual\n\n[[Page S581]]\n\n     is nominated, and which is to be made public; and,\n       (II) information relating to financial and other background \n     of the nominee, to be made public when the committee \n     determines that such information bears directly on the \n     nominee's qualifications to hold the position to which the \n     individual is nominated.\n       Information relating to background and financial interests \n     (parts I and II) shall not be required of nominees for less \n     than full-time appointments to councils, commissions or \n     boards when the committee determines that some or all of the \n     information is not relevant to the nature of the position. \n     Information relating to other background and financial \n     interests (part II) shall not be required of any nominee when \n     the committee determines that it is not relevant to the \n     nature of the position.\n       Committee action on a nomination, including hearings or \n     meetings to consider a motion to recommend confirmation, \n     shall not be initiated until at least five days after the \n     nominee submits the form required by this rule unless the \n     chairman, with the concurrence of the ranking minority \n     member, waives this waiting period.\n       Rule 19.--Subject to statutory requirements imposed on the \n     committee with respect to procedure, the rules of the \n     committee may be changed, modified, amended or suspended at \n     any time; provided, not less than a majority of the entire \n     membership so determine at a regular meeting with due notice, \n     or at a meeting specifically called for that purpose.\n       Rule 20.--When the ratio of members on the committee is \n     even, the term ``majority'' as used in the committee's rules \n     and guidelines shall refer to the party of the chairman for \n     purposes of party identification. Numerical requirements for \n     quorums, votes and the like shall be unaffected.\n       Rule 21.--First degree amendments must be filed with the \n     chairman at least 24 hours before an executive session. The \n     chairman shall promptly distribute all filed amendments \n     electronically to the members of the committee. The chairman \n     may modify the filing requirements to meet special \n     circumstances with the concurrence of the ranking minority \n     member.\n       Rule 22.--In addition to the foregoing, the proceedings of \n     the committee shall be governed by the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate and the provisions of the Legislative Reorganization \n     Act of 1946, as amended.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n  Guidelines of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions With Respect to Hearings, Markup Sessions, and Related Matters\n\n\n                                HEARINGS\n\n       Section 133A(a) of the Legislative Reorganization Act \n     requires each committee of the Senate to publicly announce \n     the date, place, and subject matter of any hearing at least \n     one week prior to the commencement of such hearing.\n       The spirit of this requirement is to assure adequate notice \n     to the public and other Members of the Senate as to the time \n     and subject matter of proposed hearings. In the spirit of \n     section 133A(a) and in order to assure that members of the \n     committee are themselves fully informed and involved in the \n     development of hearings:\n       1. Public notice of the date, place, and subject matter of \n     each committee or subcommittee hearing should be inserted in \n     the Congressional Record seven days prior to the commencement \n     of such hearing.\n       2. At least seven days prior to public notice of each \n     committee or subcommittee hearing, the majority should \n     provide notice to the minority of the time, place and \n     specific subject matter of such hearing.\n       3. At least three days prior to the date of such hearing, \n     the committee or subcommittee should provide to each member a \n     list of witnesses who have been or are proposed to be invited \n     to appear.\n       4. The committee and its subcommittee should, to the \n     maximum feasible extent, enforce the provisions of rule 9 of \n     the committee rules as it relates to the submission of \n     written statements of witnesses twenty-four hours in advance \n     of a hearing. Witnesses will be urged to submit testimony \n     even earlier whenever possible. When statements are received \n     in advance of a hearing, the committee or subcommittee (as \n     appropriate) should distribute copies of such statements to \n     each of its members. Witness testimony may be submitted and \n     distributed electronically.\n\n\n         EXECUTIVE SESSIONS FOR THE PURPOSE OF MARKING UP BILLS\n\n       In order to expedite the process of marking up bills and to \n     assist each member of the committee so that there may be full \n     and fair consideration of each bill which the committee or a \n     subcommittee is marking up the following procedures should be \n     followed:\n       1. Seven days prior to the proposed date for an executive \n     session for the purpose of marking up bills the committee or \n     subcommittee (as appropriate) should provide written notice \n     to each of its members as to the time, place, and specific \n     subject matter of such session, including an agenda listing \n     each bill or other matters to be considered and including:\n       (a) a copy of each bill, joint resolution, or other \n     legislative matter (or committee print thereof) to be \n     considered at such executive session; and\n       (b) a copy of a summary of the provisions of each bill, \n     joint resolution, or other legislative matter to be \n     considered at such executive session including, whenever \n     possible, an explanation of changes to existing law proposed \n     to be made.\n       2. Insofar as practical, prior to the scheduled date for an \n     executive session for the purpose of marking up bills, the \n     committee or a subcommittee (as appropriate) should provide \n     each member with a copy of the printed record or a summary of \n     any hearings conducted by the committee or a subcommittee \n     with respect to each bill, joint resolution, or other \n     legislative matter to be considered at such executive \n     session.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/28/senate-section/article/S581-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S581-S583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON AGING\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

A witness's counsel shall be permitted to be \n     present during his testimony at any public or closed hearing \n     or depositions or staff interview to advise such witness of \n     his or her rights, provided, however, that in the case of any \n     witness who is an officer or employee of the government, or \n     of a corporation or association, the Chairman may rule that \n     representation by counsel from the government, corporation, \n     or association creates a conflict of interest, and that the \n     witness shall be represented by personal counsel not from the \n     government, corporation, or association.\n       7. Transcript. An accurate electronic or stenographic \n     record shall be kept of the testimony of all witnesses in \n     closed sessions and public hearings. Any witness shall be \n     afforded, upon request, the right to review that portion of \n     such record, and for this purpose, a copy of a witness's \n     testimony in public or closed session shall be provided to \n     the witness. Upon inspecting his or her transcript, within a \n     time limit set by the committee clerk, a witness may request \n     changes in testimony to correct errors of transcription, \n     grammatical errors, and obvious errors of fact. The Chairman \n     or a staff officer designated by him shall rule on such \n     request.\n       8. Impugned Persons. Any person who believes that evidence \n     presented, or comment made by a Member or staff, at a public \n     hearing or at a closed hearing concerning which there have \n     been public reports, tends to impugn his or her character or \n     adversely affect his or her reputation may:\n       (a) file a sworn statement of facts relevant to the \n     evidence or comment, which shall be placed in the hearing \n     record; and\n       (b) request the opportunity to appear personally before the \n     Committee to testify in his or her own behalf.\n       9. Minority Witnesses. Whenever any hearing is conducted by \n     the Committee, the Ranking Member shall be entitled to call \n     at least one witness to testify or produce documents with \n     respect to the measure or matter under consideration at the \n     hearing. Such request must be made before the completion of \n     the hearing or, if subpoenas are required to call the \n     minority witnesses, no later than three days before the \n     hearing.\n       10. Conduct of Witnesses, Counsel and Members of the \n     Audience. If, during public or executive sessions, a witness, \n     his or her counsel, or any spectator conducts him or herself \n     in such a manner as to prevent, impede, disrupt, obstruct, or \n     interfere with the orderly administration of such hearing the \n     Chairman or presiding Member of the Committee present during \n     such hearing may request the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate, \n     his representative or any law enforcement official to eject \n     said person from the hearing room.\n\n            III. Closed Sessions and Confidential Materials\n\n       1. Procedure. All meetings and hearings shall be open to \n     the public unless closed. To close a meeting or hearing or \n     portion thereof, a motion shall be made and seconded to go \n     into closed discussion of whether the meeting or hearing will \n     concern Committee investigations or matters enumerated in \n     Senate Rule XXVI(5)(b). Immediately after such discussion, \n     the meeting or hearing or portion thereof may be closed by a \n     vote in open session of a majority of the Members of the \n     Committee present.\n       2. Witness Request. Any witness called for a hearing may \n     submit a written or an electronic request to the Chairman no \n     later than twenty-four hours in advance for his or her \n     examination to be in closed or open session. The Chairman \n     shall inform the Committee of any such request.\n       3. Confidential Matter. No record made of a closed session, \n     or material declared confidential by a majority of the \n     Committee, or report of the proceedings of a closed session, \n     shall be made public, in whole or in part or by way of \n     summary, unless specifically authorized by the Chairman and \n     Ranking Minority Member.\n\n                            IV. Broadcasting\n\n       1. Control. Any meeting or hearing open to the public may \n     be covered by television, radio, or still photography. Such \n     coverage must be conducted in an orderly and unobtrusive \n     manner, and the Chairman may for good cause terminate such \n     coverage in whole or in part, or take such other action to \n     control it as the circumstances may warrant.\n       2. Request. A witness may request of the Chairman, on \n     grounds of distraction, harassment, personal safety, or \n     physical discomfort, that during his or her testimony \n     cameras, media microphones, and lights shall not be directed \n     at him or her.\n\n                         V. Quorums and Voting\n\n       1. Reporting. A majority shall constitute a quorum for \n     reporting a resolution, recommendation or report to the \n     Senate.\n       2. Committee Business. A third shall constitute a quorum \n     for the conduct of Committee business, other than a final \n     vote on reporting, providing a minority Member is present.\n       3. Hearings. One Member shall constitute a quorum for the \n     receipt of evidence, the swearing of witnesses, and the \n     taking of testimony at hearings.\n       4. Polling:\n       (a) Subjects. The Committee may poll (1) internal Committee \n     matters including those concerning the Committee's staff, \n     records, and budget; (2) Committee rules changes and (3) \n     other Committee business which has been designated for \n     polling at a meeting.\n       (b) Procedure. The Chairman shall circulate polling sheets \n     to each Member specifying the matter being polled and the \n     time limit for completion of the poll. If any Member so \n     requests in advance of the meeting, the matter shall be held \n     for meeting rather than being polled. The clerk shall keep a \n     record of polls. If the Chairman determines that the polled \n     matter is one of the areas enumerated in Rule III(1), the \n     record of the poll shall be confidential. Any Member may \n     request a Committee meeting following a poll for a vote on \n     the polled decision.\n\n                           VI. Investigations\n\n       1. Authorization for Investigations. All investigations \n     shall be conducted on a bipartisan basis by Committee staff. \n     Investigations may be initiated by the Committee staff upon \n     the approval of the Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member. \n     Staff shall keep the Committee fully informed of the progress \n     of continuing investigations, except where the Chairman and \n     the Ranking Minority Member agree that there exists temporary \n     cause for more limited knowledge.\n       2. Subpoenas. The Chairman and Ranking Minority Member, \n     acting together, shall authorize a subpoena. Subpoenas for \n     the attendance of witnesses or the production of memoranda, \n     documents, records, or any other materials shall be issued by \n     the Chairman, or by any other Member of the Committee \n     designated by him. Prior to the issuance of each subpoena, \n     the Ranking Minority Member, and any other Member so \n     requesting, shall be notified regarding the identity of the \n     person to whom the subpoena will be issued and the nature of \n     the information sought, and its relationship to the \n     investigation.\n       3. Investigative Reports. All reports containing findings \n     or recommendations stemming from Committee investigations \n     shall be printed only with the approval of a majority of the \n     Members of the Committee.\n\n                    VII. Depositions and Commissions\n\n       1. Notice. Notices for the taking of depositions in an \n     investigation authorized by the Committee shall be authorized \n     and issued by the Chairman or by a staff officer designated \n     by him. Such notices shall specify a time and place for \n     examination, and the name of the staff officer or officers \n     who will take the deposition. Unless otherwise specified, the \n     deposition shall be in private. The Committee shall not \n     initiate procedures leading to criminal or civil enforcement \n     proceedings for a witness's failure to appear unless the \n     deposition notice was accompanied by a Committee subpoena.\n       2. Counsel. Witnesses may be accompanied at a deposition by \n     counsel to advise them of their rights, subject to the \n     provisions of Rule II(6).\n       3. Procedure. Witnesses shall be examined upon oath \n     administered by an individual authorized by local law to \n     administer oaths. Questions shall be propounded orally by \n     Committee staff. Objections by the witnesses as to the form \n     of questions shall be noted by the record. If a witness \n     objects to a question\n\n[[Page S583]]\n\n     and refuses to testify on the basis of relevance or \n     privilege, the Committee staff may proceed with the \n     deposition, or may at that time or at a subsequent time, seek \n     a ruling by telephone or otherwise on the objection from a \n     Member of the Committee. If the Member overrules the \n     objection, he or she may refer the matter to the Committee or \n     the Member may order and direct the witness to answer the \n     question, but the Committee shall not initiate the procedures \n     leading to civil or criminal enforcement unless the witness \n     refuses to testify after he or she has been ordered and \n     directed to answer by a Member of the Committee.\n       4. Filing. The Committee staff shall see that the testimony \n     is transcribed or electronically recorded.\n       5. Commissions. The Committee may authorize the staff, by \n     issuance of commissions, to fill in prepared subpoenas, \n     conduct field hearings, inspect locations, facilities, or \n     systems of records, or otherwise act on behalf of the \n     Committee. Commissions shall be accompanied by instructions \n     from the Committee regulating their use.\n\n                          VIII. Subcommittees\n\n       1. Establishment. The Committee will operate as a Committee \n     of the Whole, reserving to itself the right to establish \n     temporary subcommittees at any time by majority vote. The \n     Chairman of the full Committee and the Ranking Minority \n     Member shall be ex officio Members of all subcommittees.\n       2. Jurisdiction. Within its jurisdiction as described in \n     the Standing Rules of the Senate, each subcommittee is \n     authorized to conduct investigations, including use of \n     subpoenas, depositions, and commissions.\n       3. Rules. A subcommittee shall be governed by the Committee \n     rules, except that its quorum for all business shall be one-\n     third of the subcommittee Membership, and for hearings shall \n     be one Member.\n\n                              IX. Reports\n\n       Committee reports incorporating Committee findings and \n     recommendations shall be printed only with the prior approval \n     of a majority of the Committee, after an adequate period for \n     review and comment. The printing, as Committee documents, of \n     materials prepared by staff for informational purposes, or \n     the printing of materials not originating with the Committee \n     or staff, shall require prior consultation with the minority \n     staff; these publications shall have the following language \n     printed on the cover of the document: ``Note: This document \n     has been printed for informational purposes. It does not \n     represent either findings or recommendations formally adopted \n     by the Committee.''\n\n                         X. Amendment of Rules\n\n       The rules of the Committee may be amended or revised at any \n     time, provided that not less than a majority of the Committee \n     present so determine at a Committee meeting preceded by at \n     least 3 days notice of the amendments or revisions proposed \n     or via polling, subject to Rule V (4).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/28/senate-section/article/S583-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S583-S584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            COMMITTEE ON SMALL BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship today adopted rules governing its procedures for the \n114th Congress. Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 2, of the Standing \nRules of the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying \nrules adopted by the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       RULES FOR THE U.S. SENATE COMMITTEE ON SMALL BUSINESS AND \n                ENTREPRENEURSHIP FOR THE 114TH CONGRESS\n\n\n        JURISDICTION (ESTABLISHED IN THE SENATE STANDING RULES)\n\n       Per Rule XXV(1) of the Standing Rules of the Senate:\n       (1) Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship to \n     which committee shall be referred all proposed legislation, \n     messages, petitions, memorials, and other matters relating to \n     the Small Business Administration;\n       (2) Any proposed legislation reported by such committee \n     which relates to matters other than the functions of the \n     Small Business Administration shall, at the request of the \n     chairman of any standing committee having jurisdiction over \n     the subject matter extraneous to the functions of the Small \n     Business Administration, be considered and reported by such \n     standing committee prior to its consideration by the Senate; \n     and likewise measures reported by other committees directly \n     relating to the Small Business Administration shall, at the \n     request of the Chair of the Committee on Small Business and \n     Entrepreneurship, be referred to the Committee on Small \n     Business and Entrepreneurship for its consideration of any \n     portion of the measure dealing with the Small Business \n     Administration and be reported by this committee prior to its \n     consideration by the Senate.\n       (3) Such committee shall also study and survey by means of \n     research and investigation all problems of American small \n     business enterprises, and report thereon from time to time.\n\n\n                            GENERAL SECTION\n\n       All applicable provisions of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate, the Senate Resolutions, and the Legislative \n     Reorganization Acts of 1946 and 1970 (as amended), shall \n     govern the Committee.\n\n\n                                MEETINGS\n\n       (a) The regular meeting day of the Committee shall be the \n     first Thursday of each month unless otherwise directed by the \n     Chair. All other meetings may be called by the Chair as he or \n     she deems necessary, on 3 business days notice where \n     practicable. If at least three Members of the Committee \n     desire the Chair to call a special meeting, they may file in \n     the office of the Committee a written request therefore, \n     addressed to the Chair. Immediately thereafter, the Clerk of \n     the Committee shall notify the Chair of such request. If, \n     within 3 calendar days after the filing of such request, the \n     Chair fails to call the requested special meeting, which is \n     to be held within 7 calendar days after the filing of such \n     request, a majority of the Committee Members may file in the \n     Office of the Committee their written notice that a special \n     Committee meeting will be held, specifying the date, hour and \n     place thereof, and the Committee shall meet at that time and \n     place. Immediately upon the filing of such notice, the Clerk \n     of the Committee shall notify all Committee Members that such \n     special meeting will be held and inform them of its date, \n     hour and place. If the Chair is not present at any regular, \n     additional or special meeting, such member of the Committee \n     as the Chair shall designate shall preside. For any meeting \n     or hearing of the Committee, the Ranking Member may delegate \n     to any Minority Member the authority to serve as Ranking \n     Member, and that Minority Member shall be afforded all the \n     rights and responsibilities of the Ranking Member for the \n     duration of that meeting or hearing. Notice of any \n     designation shall be provided to the Chief Clerk as early as \n     practicable.\n       (b) It shall not be in order for the Committee to consider \n     any amendment in the first degree proposed to any measure \n     under consideration by the Committee unless thirty written \n     copies and an electronic copy, with a summary page attached, \n     of such amendment has been delivered to the Clerk of the \n     Committee at least 24 hours prior to the meeting. Following \n     receipt of all amendments, the Clerk shall disseminate the \n     amendments to all Members of the Committee. This subsection \n     may be waived by agreement of the Chair and Ranking Member or \n     by a majority vote of the members of the Committee.\n\n\n                                QUORUMS\n\n       (a)(1) A majority of the Members of the Committee shall \n     constitute a quorum for reporting any legislative measure or \n     nomination.\n       (2) One-third of the Members of the Committee shall \n     constitute a quorum for the transaction of routine business, \n     provided that one Minority Member is present. The term \n     ``routine business'' includes, but is not limited to, the \n     consideration of legislation pending before the Committee and \n     any amendments thereto, and voting on such amendments, and \n     steps in an investigation including, but not limited to, \n     authorizing the issuance of a subpoena.\n       (3) In hearings, whether in public or closed session, a \n     quorum for the asking of testimony, including sworn \n     testimony, shall consist of one Member of the Committee.\n       (b) Proxies will be permitted in voting upon the business \n     of the Committee. A Member who is unable to attend a business \n     meeting may submit a proxy vote on any matter, in writing, or \n     through oral or written personal instructions to a Member of \n     the Committee or staff. Proxies shall in no case be counted \n     for establishing a quorum.\n\n\n                              NOMINATIONS\n\n       In considering a nomination, the Committee shall conduct an \n     investigation or review of the nominee's experience, \n     qualifications, suitability, and integrity to serve in the \n     position to which he or she has been nominated. In any \n     hearings on the nomination, the nominee shall be called to \n     testify under oath on all matters relating to his or her \n     nomination for office. To aid in such investigation or \n     review, each nominee may be required to submit a sworn \n     detailed statement including biographical, financial, policy, \n     and other information which the Committee may request. The \n     Committee may specify which items in such statement are to be \n     received on a confidential basis.\n\n\n                                HEARINGS\n\n       (a)(1) The Chair of the Committee may initiate a hearing of \n     the Committee on his or her authority or upon his or her \n     approval of a request by any Member of the Committee. If such \n     request is by the Ranking Member, a decision shall be \n     communicated to the Ranking Member within 7 business days. \n     Written notice of all hearings, including the title, a \n     description of the hearing, and a tentative witness list \n     shall be given at least 5 business days in advance, where \n     practicable, to all Members of the Committee.\n       (2) Hearings of the Committee shall not be scheduled \n     outside the District of Columbia unless specifically \n     authorized by the Chair and the Ranking Minority Member or by \n     consent of a majority of the Committee. Such consent may be \n     given informally, without a meeting, but must be in writing.\n\n[[Page S584]]\n\n       (b)(1) Any Member of the Committee shall be empowered to \n     administer the oath to any witness testifying as to fact.\n       (2) The Chair and Ranking Member will negotiate the number \n     of witnesses for each hearing, but in the absence of an \n     agreement between the Chair and the Ranking Member the ratio \n     between the majority and minority witnesses will be no less \n     than 3-2 or 2-1 when a smaller panel is justified. \n     Interrogation of witnesses at hearings shall be conducted on \n     behalf of the Committee by Members of the Committee or such \n     Committee staff as is authorized by the Chair or Ranking \n     Minority Member.\n       (3) Witnesses appearing before the Committee shall file \n     with the Clerk of the Committee a written statement of the \n     prepared testimony at least two business days in advance of \n     the hearing at which the witness is to appear unless this \n     requirement is waived by the Chair and the Ranking Minority \n     Member.\n       (c) Any witness summoned to a public or closed hearing may \n     be accompanied by counsel of his or her own choosing, who \n     shall be permitted while the witness is testifying to advise \n     the witness of his or her legal rights. Failure to obtain \n     counsel will not excuse the witness from appearing and \n     testifying.\n       (d) Subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses or the \n     production of memoranda, documents, records, and other \n     materials may be authorized by the Chair with the consent of \n     the Ranking Minority Member or by the consent of a majority \n     of the Members of the Committee. Such consent may be given \n     informally, without a meeting, but must be in writing. The \n     Chair may subpoena attendance or production without the \n     consent of the Ranking Minority Member when the Chair has not \n     received notification from the Ranking Minority Member of \n     disapproval of the subpoena within 72 hours of being notified \n     of the intended subpoena, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and \n     holidays. Subpoenas shall be issued by the Chair or by the \n     Member of the Committee designated by him or her. A subpoena \n     for the attendance of a witness shall state briefly the \n     purpose of the hearing and the matter or matters to which the \n     witness is expected to testify. A subpoena for the production \n     of memoranda, documents, records, and other materials shall \n     identify the papers or materials required to be produced with \n     as much particularity as is practicable.\n       (e) The Chair shall rule on any objections or assertions of \n     privilege as to testimony or evidence in response to \n     subpoenas or questions of Committee Members and staff in \n     hearings.\n       (f) Testimony may be submitted to the formal record for a \n     period not less than two weeks following a hearing or \n     roundtable, unless otherwise agreed to by Chair and Ranking \n     Member.\n\n\n                              DEPOSITIONS\n\n       At the direction of the Chair, with notification to the \n     ranking minority member of not less than 72 hours, the staff \n     is authorized to take depositions from witnesses. Such \n     notices shall specify a time and place for examination, and \n     the name of the Senator, staff officer or officers who will \n     take the deposition. Any Committee member, or a member of the \n     Committee staff designated by the Chair or ranking minority \n     member, shall be given the opportunity to attend and \n     participate in the taking of any deposition. Witnesses at \n     depositions shall be examined under oath administered by an \n     individual authorized by law to administer oaths, or \n     administered by any member of the Committee if one is \n     present. The transcript of a deposition shall be filed with \n     the committee clerk. The transcript or any portion of the \n     transcript shall only be made public either by vote of the \n     majority or at the direction of the Chair after notifying the \n     ranking minority member.\n\n\n                        CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\n\n       (a) No confidential testimony taken by, or confidential \n     material presented to, the Committee in executive session, or \n     any report of the proceedings of a closed hearing, or \n     confidential testimony or material submitted pursuant to a \n     subpoena, shall be made public, either in whole or in part or \n     by way of summary, unless authorized by a majority of the \n     Members. Other confidential material or testimony submitted \n     to the Committee may be disclosed if authorized by the Chair \n     with the consent of the Ranking Member.\n       (b) Persons asserting confidentiality of documents or \n     materials submitted to the Committee offices shall clearly \n     designate them as such on their face.

Mr. President, today I honor the 100th anniversary of \nthe U.S. Coast Guard, officially established on this day, January 28, \n1915, when President Woodrow Wilson signed legislation merging the \nRevenue Cutter Service and the U.S. Life-Saving Service into one \norganization.\n  The Coast Guard has a long and noble history, dating back to 1790, of \ndefending the shores of our Nation. It remains a vital component of our \nnational security infrastructure--performing law enforcement, \nlifesaving, and military duties. Whether it is intercepting drug \nsmugglers in the Gulf of Mexico or rescuing stranded fishermen off the \ncoast of Alaska, the Coast Guard always answers the call and performs \nits mission bravely. Our Nation is safer thanks to the work done by the \nbrave men and women of the U.S. Coast Guard.\n  I am honored that my home State of Alabama has a significant Coast \nGuard presence in the city of Mobile. U.S. Coast Guard Sector Mobile is \nhome to over 200 Active-Duty military and civilian personnel who play a \ncrucial role in enforcing our Nation's laws and providing maritime \nsecurity along the gulf coast of Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida. \nMobile is also home to one of the Coast Guard's largest units, the U.S. \nCoast Guard Aviation Training Center. The Aviation Training Center is \nhome to roughly 600 Active-Duty military and civilian personnel, and it \nserves as the Coast Guard's aviation and capabilities development \ncenter--responsible for training Coast Guard pilots. It also serves as \nan operational Coast Guard air station, performing traditional Coast \nGuard aviation missions such as search and rescue, homeland security, \nand environmental protection in an area encompassing the Gulf of Mexico \nfrom the Louisiana-Texas border to the Florida panhandle.\n  I am proud of what these Coast Guard installations do to protect the \npeople of the gulf coast and the Nation as a whole. I would like to \nthank the U.S. Coast Guard for everything it does to enhance and ensure \nthe national security of the United States, and I congratulate and \nhonor the Coast Guard on its 100th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/28/senate-section/article/S585-2", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S585-S586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SUPPORTING TEACHERS AND SCHOOL LEADERS\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of \nmy remarks at the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee hearing yesterday be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Supporting Teachers and School Leaders\n\n       Today's hearing is all about better teaching--how we can \n     create an environment so teachers, principals, and other \n     leaders can succeed.\n       Governors around the country are focused on one issue: \n     better jobs for the citizens in their states. And it doesn't \n     take very long for a governor, which I once was, to come to \n     the conclusion that better schools mean better jobs and a \n     better life.\n       Since no one has figured out how to pass a better parents \n     law, it doesn't take long to realize how important a great \n     teacher is.\n       I certainly came to that conclusion quickly in 1984, when I \n     was governor of Tennessee and I considered the holy grail of \n     K-12 education to be finding a fair way to encourage and \n     reward outstanding teaching.\n       I spent a year and a half, devoting 70 percent of my time, \n     persuading the legislature to establish a career ladder--a \n     master teacher program that 10,000 teachers voluntarily \n     climbed. They were paid more and had the opportunity for 10- \n     and 11-month contracts.\n       Tennessee became the first state in the nation to pay \n     teachers more for teaching well. Rarely a week goes by that a \n     teacher doesn't stop me and say, ``Thank you for the master \n     teacher program.''\n       It was not easy. A year before I'd been in a meeting of \n     southern governors and one of them said, ``Who's gonna be \n     brave enough to take on the teachers union?''\n       I had a year and a half brawl with the National Education \n     Association before I could pass our teacher evaluation \n     program.\n       Since then, there's been an explosion of efforts to answer \n     these questions a great number of states and school districts \n     are tackling: How do we determine who is an effective \n     teacher? How do we relate student achievement to teacher \n     effectiveness? And, having decided that, how do we reward and \n     support outstanding teaching so we don't lose our best \n     teachers?\n       In 1987, the National Board for Professional Teaching \n     Standards began to strengthen standards in teaching and \n     professionalize the teaching workforce. To date, more than \n     110,000 teachers in all 50 states and DC have achieved \n     National Board Certification.\n       In 2006, the Teacher Incentive Fund was created to help \n     states and districts create performance-based compensation \n     system for teachers based on evaluation results.\n       According to the National Center on Teacher Quality, in \n     2014:\n       27 states required annual evaluations for all teachers\n       44 states required annual evaluations for new teachers\n       35 states required student achievement and/or student \n     growth to be a significant or the most significant measure of \n     teacher performance.\n       So when I came to Washington as a United States Senator in \n     2003, everyone expected--since I thought rewarding \n     outstanding teaching was the Holy Grail--that I would make\n\n[[Page S586]]\n\n     everyone do it. To the surprise of some, my answer was no--\n     you can't do it from Washington. Nevertheless, over the last \n     10 years, Washington has tried.\n       Here is how: No Child Left Behind told states that all \n     teachers of core academic subjects needed to be ``Highly \n     Qualified'' by 2006, and it prescribed that definition in a \n     very bureaucratic manner. That hasn't worked. I don't know of \n     many people who really want to keep that outdated \n     definition--even Secretary Duncan waived the requirements \n     related to highly qualified teachers when he granted waivers \n     to 43 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.\n       Unfortunately, the Secretary replaced those requirements \n     with a new mandate requiring teacher evaluation systems--\n     first in Race to the Top, which gave nearly $4.4 billion to \n     states, and second, in the waivers.\n       To get a waiver from No Child Left Behind, a state and each \n     local school district must develop a teacher and principal \n     evaluation system with seven required elements--such as that \n     it will use at least three performance levels; and will use \n     multiple measures, including student growth; and will include \n     guidelines and supports for implementation--and each element \n     must be approved by the U.S. Department of Education.\n       The problem is that, after 30 years, we are still figuring \n     out how to do this.\n       Our research work on measuring growth in student \n     achievement and relating it fairly to teacher effectiveness \n     was started in 1984, but former Institute of Education \n     Science Director Russ Whitehurst told the New York Times in \n     2012 that states ``are racing ahead based on promises made to \n     Washington or local political imperatives that prioritize an \n     unwavering commitment to unproven approaches. There's a lot \n     we don't know about how to evaluate teachers reliably and how \n     to use that information to improve instruction and \n     learning.''\n       The second problem is that some states haven't been willing \n     or able to implement the systems the way the U.S. Department \n     of Education wants them to.\n       California, Iowa, and Washington state had their waiver \n     requests denied or revoked over the issue of teacher \n     evaluations.\n       In Iowa's case, it was because the state legislature \n     wouldn't pass a law that satisfied the requirement that \n     allowed for teachers and principals to be placed into at \n     least three performance levels--not effective, effective, and \n     highly effective.\n       California simply ignored the Administration's conditions \n     when they applied for a waiver, particularly the requirement \n     that teacher evaluation systems be based significantly on the \n     results of state standardized tests.\n       In April, Washington state's waiver was revoked by \n     Secretary Duncan because their state legislature would not \n     pass legislation requiring standardized test results to be \n     used in teacher and principal evaluation systems--instead the \n     law in Washington allows local school districts to decide \n     which tests they use.\n       Whether or not this federal interference with state \n     education law offends your sense of federalism, like it does \n     mine, it has proved impractical.\n       The federal government in its well-intentioned way, trying \n     to say, ``We want better teachers, and we're going to tell \n     you exactly how to do it, and you must do it now'' has \n     created an enormous backlash. It's made even harder something \n     that was already hard.\n       Even in Tennessee, despite 30 years of experience and \n     nearly $500 million in Race to the Top funding, the \n     implementation of a new teacher evaluation system has been \n     described in an article in my hometown newspaper as \n     ``contentious.''\n       Given all of the great progress that states and local \n     school districts have made on standards, accountability, \n     tests, and teacher evaluation over the last 30 years--you'll \n     get a lot more progress with a lot less opposition if you \n     leave those decisions there.\n       I think we should return to states and local school \n     districts decisions for measuring the progress of our schools \n     and for evaluating and measuring the effectiveness of \n     teachers.\n       I know it is tempting to try to improve teachers from \n     Washington. I also hear from governors and school \n     superintendents who say that if ``Washington doesn't make us \n     do it, the teachers unions and opponents from the right will \n     make it impossible to have good evaluation systems and better \n     teachers.''\n       And I understand what they're saying. After I left office, \n     the NEA watered down Tennessee's Master Teacher program.\n       Nevertheless, the Chairman's Staff Discussion draft \n     eliminates the Highly Qualified Teacher requirements and \n     definition, and allows states to decide the licenses and \n     credentials that they are going to require their teachers to \n     have.\n       And despite my personal support for teacher evaluation, the \n     draft doesn't mandate teacher and principal evaluations.\n       Rather, it enables States to use the more than $2.5 billion \n     under Title II to develop, implement, or improve these \n     evaluation systems.\n       In a state like Tennessee, that would mean $39 million \n     potentially available for continuing the work Tennessee has \n     well underway for evaluating teachers, including linking \n     performance and student achievement.\n       In addition, it would expand one of the provisions in No \n     Child Left behind--the Teacher Incentive Fund that Secretary \n     Spellings recommended putting into law and that Secretary \n     Duncan said, in testimony before the HELP Committee in \n     January 2009, was ``One of the best things I think Secretary \n     Spellings has done . . . the more we can reward excellence, \n     the more we can incentivize excellence, the more we can get \n     our best teachers to work in those hard-to-staff schools and \n     communities, the better our students are going to do.''\n       And third, it would emphasize the idea of a Secretary's \n     report card--calling considerable attention to the bully \n     pulpit a secretary or president has to call attention to \n     states that are succeeding or failing.\n       For example, I remember President Reagan visited Farragut \n     High School in Knoxville in 1984 to call attention to our \n     Master Teacher program. It caused the Democratic speaker of \n     our House of Representatives to say, ``This is the American \n     way,'' and come up with an amendment to my proposal that was \n     critical to its passage. President Reagan didn't order every \n     other state to do what Tennessee was doing, but the \n     president's bully pulpit made a real difference.\n       Thomas Friedman recently told a group of senators that one \n     of his two rules of life is that he's never met anyone who \n     washed a rented car.\n       In other words, people take care of what they own.\n       My experience is that finding a way to fairly reward better \n     teaching is the holy grail of K-12 education--but Washington \n     will get the best long-term result by creating an environment \n     in which states and communities are encouraged, not ordered, \n     to evaluate teachers.\n       Let's not mandate it from Washington if we want them to own \n     it and make it work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/28/senate-section/article/S586-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:24 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 159.

A bill to amend the Indian Self-Determination and Education \nAssistance Act to provide further self-governance by Indian tribes, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would further advance the goals of Indian self-governance and \nself-determination. The legislation is entitled, the Department of the \nInterior Self-Governance Act of 2015. I thank my colleagues who have \njoined me as original cosponsors of this legislation, including Indian \nAffairs Committee Vice Chairman Senator Tester and Senator Murkowski.\n  One of the cornerstones of Federal Indian policy is the concept of \ntribal self-determination and self-governance. In 1975, Congress passed \nthe Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. The Act, \nPublic Law No. 93-638 authorizes Indian tribes to carry out certain \nFederal Indian programs, activities, and functions within the \nDepartment of the Interior and the Department of the Health and Human \nServices.\n  Self-governance is both a policy and procedure whereby, pursuant to \nthe Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, Indian \ntribes administer Federal programs for Indians. Tribal administration \nof these programs promotes local control and decision-making for these \nimportant programs that affect the local tribal community.\n  Tribal administration through these processes also serves to reduce \nFederal bureaucracy. This legislation promotes accountability by \nmaintaining requirements that Indian tribes must demonstrate a higher \nlevel of responsible governance and administration. Good governance is \nvital for continuing this policy.\n  The act gives authority to the Secretaries of the Interior and Health \nand Human Services to enter into 638 contracts and self-governance \ncompacts with Indian tribes. Each 638 contact or self-governance \ncompact identifies functions and activities to be carried out by the \ntribe, as well as any administrative, reporting, or other requirements \nthat must be followed.\n  Despite the increased flexibility in the tribal self-governance \nprogram, Indian tribes have stated to Congress that the Department of \nthe Interior has, for many years, resisted the efforts by tribes to \ncarry out Interior programs. Without additional reforms, the success of \nthe Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act cannot reach \nits full potential.\n  The bill intends to clarify and expand the provisions of the Indian \nSelf-Determination and Education Assistance Act. This legislation will \ngive tribes a better opportunity to advance the policy of tribal self-\ngovernance by authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to select up to \n50 new Indian tribes to participate in the tribal self-governance \nprogram. In addition, the bill clarifies that provisions of water \nsettlements and their authorizing legislation will not be affected by \nthe self-governance amendments. Furthermore, nothing in this will \nexpand or limit programs eligible for self-governance compacts beyond \nthose already authorized under current law.\n  This bipartisan bill is supported by Indian tribes across the \ncountry. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n[[Page S592]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. Gillibrand, and \n        Mr. Blumenthal):\n  S. 287.

FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the safety of the food supply of the United States is \n     vital to the public health, to public confidence in the food \n     supply, and to the success of the food sector of the Nation's \n     economy;\n       (2) lapses in the protection of the food supply and loss of \n     public confidence in food safety are damaging to consumers \n     and the food industry, and place a burden on interstate \n     commerce;\n       (3) the safety and security of the food supply requires an \n     integrated, systemwide approach to preventing foodborne \n     illness, a thorough and broad-based approach to basic and \n     applied research, and intensive, effective, and efficient \n     management of the Nation's food safety program;\n       (4) the task of preserving the safety of the food supply of \n     the United States faces tremendous pressures with regard to--\n       (A) emerging pathogens and other contaminants and the \n     ability to detect all forms of contamination;\n       (B) an aging and immune-compromised population, with a \n     growing number of people at high risk for foodborne \n     illnesses, including infants and children;\n       (C) a concern regarding food fraud for economic gain, \n     especially with mislabeling and intentionally misleading \n     claims;\n       (D) an increasing volume of imported food, without adequate \n     monitoring and inspection; and\n       (E) maintenance of rigorous inspection of the domestic food \n     processing and food service industries;\n       (5) Federal food safety standard setting, inspection, \n     enforcement, and research efforts should be based on the best \n     available science and public health considerations and food \n     safety resources should be systematically deployed in ways \n     that most effectively prevent foodborne illness;\n       (6) the Federal food safety system is fragmented, with at \n     least 15 Federal agencies sharing responsibility for food \n     safety, and operates under laws that do not reflect current \n     conditions in the food system or current scientific knowledge \n     about the cause and prevention of foodborne illness;\n       (7) the fragmented Federal food safety system and outdated \n     laws preclude an integrated, systemwide approach to \n     preventing foodborne illness, to the effective and efficient \n     operation of the Nation's food safety program, and to the \n     most beneficial deployment of food safety resources;\n       (8) the National Academy of Sciences recommended in the \n     report ``Ensuring Safe Food from Production to Consumption'' \n     that Congress establish by statute a unified and central \n     framework for managing Federal food safety programs, and \n     recommended modifying Federal statutes so that inspection, \n     enforcement, and research efforts are based on scientifically \n     supportable assessments of risks to public health; and\n       (9) the lack of a single focal point for food safety \n     leadership in the United States undercuts the ability of the \n     United States to exert food safety leadership \n     internationally, which is detrimental to the public health \n     and the international trade interests of the United States.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to establish a single agency to be known as the ``Food \n     Safety Administration'' to--\n       (A) regulate food safety and related labeling to strengthen \n     the protection of the public health;\n       (B) ensure that food facilities fulfill their \n     responsibility to produce food in a manner that protects the \n     public health of all people in the United States;\n       (C) lead an integrated, systemwide approach to food safety \n     and to make more effective and efficient use of resources to \n     prevent foodborne illness;\n       (D) provide a single focal point for food safety \n     leadership, both nationally and internationally; and\n       (E) provide an integrated food safety research capability, \n     utilizing internally-generated, scientifically and \n     statistically valid studies, in cooperation with academic \n     institutions and other scientific entities of the Federal and \n     State governments, to achieve the continuous improvement of \n     research on foodborne illness and contaminants;\n       (2) to transfer to the Food Safety Administration the food \n     safety, labeling, inspection, and enforcement functions that, \n     as of the day before the effective date of this Act, are \n     performed by other Federal agencies; and\n       (3) to modernize and strengthen the Federal food safety \n     laws to achieve more effective application and efficient \n     management of the laws for the protection and improvement of \n     public health.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the National Labor Relations Act to reform \nthe National Labor Relations Board, the Office of the General Counsel, \nand the process for appellate review, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the NLRB \nReform Act with Senator McConnell.\n  Our legislation will change the National Labor Relations Board from \nan advocate to an umpire.\n  The board was created 80 years ago to act as an impartial umpire in \nlabor disputes that threaten the free flow of commerce.\n  The board's decisions affect about 85 million private-sector workers \nand 5.7 million private-sector employers.\n  But over time, the board has become an advocate for one interest \ngroup over the other--changing positions with each new administration.\n  There are three significant problems the board faces today:\n  First, the biggest problem is partisan advocacy. Today, the majority \nof the 5-member board is made up of appointees who follow the \npresident's political leanings. President Obama has appointed 3 labor \nunion lawyers to the board.\n  Second, the board has a freewheeling advocate for a general counsel. \nThe board's most recent general counsels have been exceeding their \nstatutory authority and bringing questionable cases that threaten \nAmerican jobs.\n  Third, it is too slow to resolve disputes. Right now, 145 cases, that \nis 32 percent of the board's caseload, have been pending for more than \na year.\n  Our bill provides three fixes.\n  First, it ends partisan advocacy. A 6-member board of 3 Republicans \nand 3 Democrats and a majority of 4 will require both sides to find a \nmiddle ground.\n  Second, it reins in the general counsel. Businesses and unions would \nbe able to challenge complaints filed by the General Counsel in Federal \ndistrict court, and they will have greater transparency about the basis \nand legal reasoning of charges brought by the General Counsel.\n  Third, it encourages timely decisions in two ways. First, either \nparty in a case before the board may appeal to a Federal Court of \nAppeals if the board fails to reach a decision in their case within one \nyear.\n  Second, funding for the entire NLRB would be reduced by 20 percent if \nthe board is not able to decide 90 percent of its cases within one year \nover the first 2-year period post-reform.\n  Our bill would offer these solutions without taking away rights or \nremedies for any employee, business, or union.\n  While the increasing partisanship at the board has occurred in \nRepublican administrations as well as Democrat administrations, it has \nreached a climax in this administration.\n  Three of President Obama's recent nominees came to the board from a \nmajor labor union's leadership.\n  One labor law professor at a major university recently said that she \ncan't even use the most recent textbook, instead she has to resort to \nhanding out NLRB decisions. The decisions are coming out so rapidly and \nthis NLRB is venturing into new territory with efforts at rulemaking.\n  This is no way to maintain a national labor law policy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Brown, Ms. Klobuchar, Mrs. Boxer, \n        Mr. Markey, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Franken, Mr. Casey, and Mr. \n        Schumer):\n  S. 289.

A bill to amend section 2259 of title 18, United States Code, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to help \nvictims of child pornography, one of society's most heinous crimes. I \nam joined by 34 Senators on both sides of the aisle. I hope this \nlegislation will soon become law.\n  Sexually exploiting a child distorts her life and leaves scars long \nafter the abuse itself ends and the abuser has been prosecuted. For \nthis reason, the Violence Against Women Act includes a provision \nrequiring that in such cases a defendant must pay restitution to cover \nall of the victim's losses. Those losses can include future lost income \nas well as medical care, mental health counseling, and therapy.\n  Child pornography isn't merely the record of a child's sexual abuse, \nit is itself an instance of abuse. The ongoing trafficking and those \nimages pile harm upon harm. As a result, it becomes even more difficult \nfor a victim to put together a life that was shattered before it had \nbarely begun.\n  As the Supreme Court has recognized, ``every viewing of child \npornography is a repetition of the victim's abuse.'' The current \nrestitution statute was enacted in 1994, before the Internet became \nprime real estate for trafficking of child pornography.\n  It puts victims in an impossible bind. In a case decided last spring, \nthe Supreme Court said the current restitution statute requires the \nvictim to prove how much of her losses were specifically caused by a \nsingle defendant's possession of her images. With a burden like that, \nit is no wonder that under this statute victims receive no restitution \nat all in more than three-quarters of child pornography cases.\n  The cruel irony today is that the more individuals who participate in \nharming a victim, the less any of them is financially responsible, and \nthe less timely help the victim will receive. Perpetrators are easily \nlost in a crowd.\n\n[[Page S603]]\n\n  The bill I introduce today will amend the restitution statute so that \nit works for child pornography victims. It is named for Amy and Vicky, \nbrave women who are the victims of two of the most widely viewed child \npornography series in the world. Amy's case went before the Supreme \nCourt last year, and my staff worked with the legal team for these \nwomen in developing this bill.\n  I want to mention in particular James Marsh, whose legal practice in \nNew York focuses exclusively on helping victims; Professor Paul Cassell \nat the University of Utah, who argued Amy's case before the Supreme \nCourt; and Carol Hepburn, who practices law in Seattle on behalf of \nVicky and many other victims.\n  This bill changes the current restitution statute in three important \nways so that it works for child pornography victims. First, it gives \njudges options for determining a victim's losses and calculating \nrestitution. Second, it gives judges the ability to impose restitution \non defendants in different kinds of cases to ensure that victims \nactually receive meaningful restitution. Third, it shifts the burden of \nchasing defendants all over the country from victims to defendants who \ncan share the restitution costs with other defendants.\n  Both Amy and Vicky personally support this bill. I am also pleased \nthat many national victim advocacy groups support this bill, including \nthe National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the National \nOrganization for Victim Assistance, the National Crime Victim Law \nInstitute, the National Center for Victims of Crime, and the National \nTask Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence Against Women.\n  Last October I received a letter endorsing this bill signed by the \nattorneys general of 43 States, 22 Republicans and 21 Democrats.\n  I want to share with my colleagues the story of a young man, a Utah \nresident, who uses the name Andy.\n  Between the ages of 7 and 12, he was sexually abused by a trusted \nadult and family friend. Dr. David Corwin, the University of Utah child \npsychologist who examined him, said that based on 30 years of \nexperience with child sexual abuse victims, the images and videos of \nAndy's abuse were the most disturbing he had ever seen.\n  According to the FBI, the images and videos created from Andy's abuse \nare one of the most widely distributed boy series in the country. The \nFBI says that as of last month Andy is a named victim in 726 cases. He \nhas been granted restitution in 24 of the 101 cases in which he \nrequested it and has collected anything at all in only 2 cases.\n  Andy wrote to support the bill I am introducing today. He addresses \nletters to the Members of the Congress, which means that he is writing \nto each Member of this body. Andy says this legislation will prevent \nhim from having to spend decades trying to recover minuscule amounts of \nrestitution from hundreds, if not thousands of defendants all over the \ncountry. I want my colleagues to hear his words:\n\n       My images may never be taken off the Internet and may \n     always be circulating around the country. At least with this \n     congressional change, I can start to heal, learn how to \n     handle my circumstances, and re-build my life.\n\n  There are many more Amys, Vickys, and Andys than any of us want to \nadmit, and they need our help. In our system of government, we have the \nresponsibility to pass or change legislation to address issues and \nproblems Americans face. All the courts could do was confirm that the \ncurrent restitution statute is no longer suited to help child \npornography victims. It is now up to us to do our duty and enact a \nstatute that will. Amy, Vicky, and Andy are counting on us, and we must \nnot let them down.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/28/senate-section/article/S603-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 43--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT CHILDREN \n TRAFFICKED IN THE UNITED STATES SHOULD BE TREATED AS VICTIMS, AND NOT \n CRIMINALS, ESPECIALLY DURING THE UPCOMING SUPER BOWL, AN EVENT AROUND \n      WHICH MANY CHILDREN ARE AT RISK FOR BEING TRAFFICKED FOR SEX\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN (for himself and Mr. Blumenthal) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                               S.

The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 51) recognizing the goals of Catholic \n     Schools Week and honoring the valuable contributions of \n     Catholic schools in the United States.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of Catholic schools \nacross our Nation who provide our children with an outstanding \neducation while preparing them to lead lives in the example of Jesus \nChrist. This year, we mark the 41st year of celebrating Catholic \nSchools Week, shedding light on the extraordinary contributions these \nschools and their students make to communities across the country.\n  This year's theme, ``Catholic Schools: Communities of Faith, \nKnowledge, and Service,'' provides a solid representation of the \nmission of these schools in educating the whole person and forming our \nchildren into responsible stewards ready to take on the challenges of \nthe future. Today, more than 2 million children are educated in \nCatholic schools in the United States. Ninety-nine percent of them \ngraduate from high school and 85 percent pursue post-secondary \neducation. Such a rate of success is a great testament to the quality \nof our Catholic schools and their educators.\n  As an alumnus of a Catholic school in New Orleans, I have firsthand \nexperience of the benefits of receiving a Catholic education. These \nschools are devoted to nurturing the young minds that pass though their \nhalls each year, instilling in them the values necessary to become \nactive and caring members of their communities, cities, and Nation. In \nthe words of Pope Francis, ``[o]ur generation will show that it can \nrise to the promise found in each young person when we know how to give \nthem space. This means that we have to create the material and \nspiritual conditions for their full development; to give them a solid \nbasis on which to build their lives; to guarantee their safety and \ntheir education to be everything they can be.''\n  During the week of January 25 to January 31, let us recognize the \nsteadfast commitment of the administrators, teachers, students, and \nfamilies, who support Catholic schools across the United States, and \nappreciate their efforts to educate the youth of our Nation. In that \nrespect, I am hopeful that the Senate will pass this resolution \ncelebrating Catholic Schools Week.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
