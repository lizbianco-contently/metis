I recently met with Dr. Califf and \nraised my concerns and desire for the FDA to take a more assertive role \nin addressing this serious epidemic. He shared with me his proposed \nplan for dealing with the issue and for establishing a necessary \ncultural shift over the agency. I plan to support his nomination today, \nand I look forward to working with him.\n  That said, I have proudly led many efforts over the years to push the \nFDA to take a stronger approach when it comes to ending today's \nprescription opioid epidemic. I don't plan to let up now. The FDA \nshould expect continuous, rigorous oversight in the way the agency \naddresses this epidemic in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/23/senate-section/article/S925-6", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          GUANTANAMO DETAINEES\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we understand that in just a few \nminutes the President is set to make an announcement on the secure \nfacility in Guantanamo. In light of that, colleagues should consider \nthe following things we have heard in recent weeks.\n  General Dunford has spoken of the need for our military to take more \naggressive action against the ISIL group that is operating inside \nLibya.\n  General Campbell has spoken of the need to retain a sizable enough \nforce in Afghanistan to accomplish the dual missions of both conducting \ncounterterrorism operations and training and advising the Afghan \nsecurity forces.\n  Secretary of Defense Ash Carter has issued a budget request that \nseeks funding for the weapons systems and programs we will need to \nbalance against the regional ambitions of China and Russia.\n  In other words, some of the most senior national security officials \nwithin this administration are already working to better position the \nnext President for the national security challenges we will face in \n2017 and beyond. Yet President Obama seems to remain captured on one \nmatter by a campaign promise he made in 2008--his ill-considered \ncrusade to close the secure detention facility at Guantanamo.\n  Today we received the descriptions of where the President would like \nto detain terrorists within the United States--though not any actual \nproposed locations--despite the fact that it would be illegal under \ncurrent law to transfer foreign terrorists at Guantanamo into the \nUnited States. This isn't a case where the President can even try to \njustify the use of some pen-and-phone strategy by claiming Congress \nfailed to act. To the contrary, Congress acted over and over again in a \nbipartisan way to reject the President's desire to transfer dangerous \nterrorists to communities in the United States. The President signed \nall these prohibitions and his Attorney General recently confirmed that \nit is illegal for the President to transfer any of these terrorists \ninto the United States.\n  We will review President Obama's plan, but since it includes bringing \ndangerous terrorists to facilities in U.S. communities, he should know \nthat the bipartisan will of Congress has already been expressed against \nthat proposal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/23/senate-section/article/S925-7", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S925-S926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the signs of the season are all around \nus. Volunteers are knocking on doors,\n\n[[Page S926]]\n\ncaucusers are caucusing, voters are voting, and countless ballots have \nbeen cast already in places as diverse as Council Bluffs, Nashua, and \nMyrtle Beach. Thousands more Nevadans are making their voices heard \ntoday, and Americans in over a dozen more States will have an \nopportunity to do the same next week.\n  It is campaign season. We are right in the middle of it, and one of \nthe most important issues now is this: Who will Americans trust to \nnominate the next Supreme Court justice? The Presidential candidates \nare already debating the issue on stage. Americans are already \ndiscussing the issue among themselves, and voters are already casting \nballots--in the case of the Democratic leader's constituents on this \nvery day--with this issue very much in mind.\n  One might say this is an almost unprecedented moment in the history \nof our country. It has been more than 80 years since a Supreme Court \nvacancy arose and was filled in a Presidential election year, and that \nwas when the Senate majority and the President were from the same \npolitical party. It has been 80 years.\n  Since we have divided government today, it means we have to look back \nalmost 130 years to the last time a nominee was confirmed in similar \ncircumstances. That was back when politicians such as mugwumps were \ndebating policy like free silver and a guy named Grover ran the \ncountry. Think about that.\n  As Senators, it leaves us with a choice. Will we allow the people to \ncontinue deciding who will nominate the next Justice or will we empower \na lameduck President to make that decision on his way out the door \ninstead?\n  The question of who decides has been contemplated by many, including \nour friends on the other side of the aisle. We already know the \nincoming Democratic leader's view. The senior Senator from New York \ndidn't even wait until the final year of President George W. Bush's \nterm to declare that the Senate ``should reverse the presumption of \nconfirmation'' and ``not confirm a Supreme Court nominee except in \nextraordinary circumstances.''\n  We also know how the current Democratic leader feels about judicial \nnominees from a President of the other party. This is what he said:\n\n       ``The Senate is not a rubberstamp for the executive \n     branch,'' he said. ``Nowhere in [the Constitution] does it \n     say the Senate has a duty to give presidential nominees a \n     vote. It says appointments shall be made with the advice and \n     consent of the Senate. That's very different than saying \n     every nominee receives a vote.''\n\n  What about the views of the top officer of this body, the President \nof the Senate? Joe Biden was a Senator for many decades. He was a loyal \nDemocrat. He developed enduring friendships in both parties, and before \nbecoming Vice President, he served here as chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee. Let's consider what he said in circumstances similar to \nwhere we find ourselves today. It was an election year with campaigns \nalready underway, a President and a Senate majority from different \npolitical parties, just as we have today. This is what appeared on page \nA25 of the Washington Post:\n\n       Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), chairman of the \n     Judiciary Committee, has urged President Bush not to fill any \n     vacancy that might open up on the Supreme Court until after \n     the November election. Warning that any election-year nominee \n     ``would become a victim'' of a ``power struggle'' over \n     control of the Supreme Court, Biden said he would also urge \n     the Senate not to hold hearings on a nomination if Bush \n     decided to name someone.\n\n  The article continued, quoting then-Senator Biden:\n\n       ``If someone steps down, I would highly recommend the \n     president not name someone, not send a name up,'' Biden said. \n     ``If he [Bush] did send someone up, I would ask the Senate to \n     seriously consider not having a hearing on that nominee.''\n\n  And then, this:\n\n       ``Can you imagine dropping a nominee, after the three or \n     four or five decisions that are about to [be] made by the \n     Supreme Court, into that fight, into that cauldron in the \n     middle of a presidential year?'' Biden went on. ``I believe \n     there would be no bounds of propriety that would be honored \n     by either side. . . . The environment within which such a \n     hearing would be held would be so supercharged and so prone \n     to be able to be distorted.''\n       ``Whomever the nominee was, good, bad or indifferent,'' he \n     added, ``would become a victim.''\n\n  As the current chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Grassley, \npointed out yesterday, Biden went even further on the Senate floor. He \nsaid that ``[it does not] matter how good a person is nominated by the \nPresident'' because it was the principle of the matter, not the person, \nthat truly mattered.\n  Biden cautioned that ``Some of our nation's most bitter and heated \nconfirmation fights have come in presidential election years'' but also \nreminded colleagues of several instances when Presidents exercised \nrestraint and withheld from making a nomination until after the \nelection.\n  One of them was Abraham Lincoln. It offers an example others may \nchoose to consider.\n  President Obama, like Lincoln, once served in the Illinois \nlegislature. It is a place he returned to just the other day to talk \nabout healing the divide in our country. He said:\n\n       It's been noted often by pundits that the tone of our \n     politics hasn't gotten better since I was inaugurated. In \n     fact it's gotten worse. . . . One of my few regrets is my \n     inability to reduce the polarization and meanness in our \n     politics.\n\n  Well, this is his moment. He has every right to nominate someone, \neven if doing so will inevitably plunge our Nation into another bitter \nand unavoidable struggle. That certainly is his right. Even if he never \nexpects that nominee to be actually confirmed but rather to wield as an \nelection cudgel, he certainly has the right to do that. But he also has \nthe right to make a different choice. He could let the people decide \nand make this an actual legacy-building moment, rather than just \nanother campaign road show.\n  Whatever he decides, his own Vice President and others remind us of \nan essential point. Presidents have a right to nominate just as the \nSenate has its constitutional right to provide or withhold consent. In \nthis case, the Senate will withhold it. The Senate will appropriately \nrevisit the matter after the American people finish making in November \nthe decision they have already started making today.\n  For now, I would ask colleagues to consider once more the words of \nVice President Biden. He said:\n\n       Some will criticize such a decision and say it was nothing \n     more than an attempt to save the seat on the Court in the \n     hopes that a . . . [member of my party] will be permitted to \n     fill it, but that would not be our intention, Mr. President, \n     if that were the course to choose in the Senate to not \n     consider holding hearings until after the election. Instead, \n     it would be our pragmatic conclusion that once the political \n     season is underway, and it is, action on a Supreme Court \n     nomination must be put off until after the election campaign \n     is over.\n\n  That is Vice President Biden when he was chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee in a Presidential election year. Fair to the nominee, \nessential to the process, a pragmatic conclusion--the words of \nPresident Obama's own No. 2. What else needs to be said?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/23/senate-section/article/S926-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on behalf of the entire Senate, we \nacknowledge the prayer of the Chaplain today regarding Claire \nMcCaskill. Claire McCaskill, as is known now, has breast cancer. She \nfeels comfortable with the diagnosis.

But our \nthoughts are with her, recognizing the number of people in the Senate \nwho have been stricken with cancer of one kind or another.\n  Without belaboring the point, breast cancer is personally very \ndevastating not only to the patient, of course, but to the family who \nis doing everything they can in a compassionate way to support their \nloved one. We know Joe, her husband, is terribly concerned, but I sent \na message to him that the treatment of breast cancer is so much better \nthan it was just a few years ago and that we believe Claire will be OK, \nand we certainly hope that is the case.\n\n[[Page S927]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/23/senate-section/article/S927-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S927]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                        PRESCRIPTION DRUG ABUSE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Republican leader mentioned a number of \nthings, and I am not going to talk about all of them, but there is one \nthing I want to focus on for just a minute. We have something that is \ndevastating moving forward throughout this country, and that is \npoisoning by opioids. These products that come in the form of medicine \nprescribed by doctors have been devastating and sweeping the country.\n  Of course, I am glad we are moving forward on Dr. Califf--he is a \nfine man, and he will do a good job as head of the Food and Drug \nAdministration--but we are going to move to some legislation dealing \nwith these poisons. I would hope that everyone would appreciate the \nfact that what we are going to do, as we do too often, is celebrate the \npassing of legislation that really doesn't have much to do with \nreality. The only way we are going to do a better job of fighting this \nscourge is to have some resources to help people who have the \nresponsibility to do something about that. We need to take up the \nJudiciary Committee's opioid bill, maybe even as early as next week, \nbut we also need to devote real resources, not just lipservice, to this \nimportant problem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/23/senate-section/article/S927-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S927-S928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know the Republican leader is doing his \nbest to try to make a good picture here as to why he has made the \ndecision that the Senate is not going to confirm any Supreme Court \nnominee the President puts forward. I heard one statement by the former \nchair of the Judiciary Committee this morning saying it doesn't matter \nwhom he puts up, we are not going to vote for him or her, whatever the \ncase may be. But the facts my friend provides are absolutely \ndistracting and they are wrong. He can read all the statements he wants \nfrom the senior Senator from New York and the Vice President, but never \nwere any nominees held up.\n  In fact, we don't have to go back to Grover, as he indicated, to find \na similar situation. Let's talk about Ronald, a more recent President. \nIn 1988, in the last year of his Presidency, President Reagan put \nforward the nomination of Anthony Kennedy to be a Supreme Court \nJustice. That was in the last year of his term. And what did we do? We \ntook it up, and he was confirmed.\n  There is a lot of time to do things. Vice President Biden's statement \nwas made in the middle of the summer of the year he spoke, but there is \nso much time left. We have 333 days left in President Obama's term of \noffice, so there is plenty of time to get the work done. The average \nnumber of days to confirm Justices is 67 days, so I think we should be \nable to squeeze 67 days out of 333 days.\n  I don't want to burden everyone with facts, but sometimes they can \nget in the way of some of these ridiculous diversions from what our job \nshould be. When Senator Biden was chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nin 1991 and 1992 during George W. Bush's term, we confirmed 120 judges. \nCertainly that hasn't been the case in the last few years because \nRepublicans basically have opposed all judges. And now this new \ndirection toward making sure there is no confirmation of a Supreme \nCourt Justice is obstruction on steroids.\n  This is really a pivotal moment for the Republican Party and this \nRepublican Senate. The Republican Party of Abraham Lincoln and Theodore \nRoosevelt is transforming before our eyes, abandoning its last vestiges \nof decency and rationality and unconditionally surrendering its moral \ncompass to Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Gone are the days of \nlevelheadedness and compromise. The radicals in the Republican Party \nhave turned ``bipartisanship'' into a dirty word. Behind closed doors, \nmy Republican colleagues like to express disappointment at the \ndirection the party is taking, but never, never will they say anything \npublicly because the extreme elements in their party who seem to be \nrunning the party will criticize them.\n  Republicans should think long and hard about this simple fact: If \nthey follow the course set by the Republican leader, every one of them \nwill be as responsible as Trump and Cruz in the debasement of the \nRepublican Party. He will join them in what they have done to the \nparty. It will be a new and much worse Republican Party.\n  Clearly, Senator McConnell is absolutely following the lead of \nextremists Trump and Cruz. There is no clearer example of this than the \nRepublican leader's response to the Supreme Court vacancy. In the \naftermath of Justice Scalia's passing, the senior Senator from Kentucky \ncould have announced his intent to fulfill the Senate's constitutional \nresponsibility and invited the President to send a well-qualified \ncandidate to the Senate for confirmation. But that is not what he did \nbecause that is not the party of Trump. Instead, the Republican leader \nannounced that he will deny President Obama his constitutional right to \nappoint nominees to the Supreme Court, defying all precedent that has \nbeen set, and by so doing, he will leave the Supreme Court in a state \nof uncertainty.\n  Senator McConnell is leading a charge to obstruct and cheapen the \nPresidency at all costs, regardless of the damage it does to our \ndemocracy. Doesn't that sound familiar? Sounds like something Donald \nTrump would do. That is because it is exactly what Donald Trump urged \nSenator McConnell to do. At a Republican Presidential debate in South \nCarolina 10 days ago, Mr. Trump said of the Supreme Court vacancy:\n\n       I think it's up to Mitch McConnell and everybody else to \n     stop [the nomination]. It's called delay, delay, delay.\n\n  That is from Donald Trump, and that is exactly what the Republican \nleader is doing--delay, delay, delay.\n  I believe 333 days is enough to do the work we ordinarily do in 67 \ndays.\n  It is disappointing that the Senator from Kentucky takes his marching \norders from extremists such as Donald Trump. It is a pretty stark \nchange from what Senator McConnell used to believe. He used to loathe \nthis radical tea party faction of the Republican Party. According to an \naccount in the New York Times, the Republican leader once referred to \nthe tea party Republicans as ``those idiots, those people come up here \nand have never been in office and know nothing about being in office.'' \nYet, today, he is meeting with those same Republicans. He is meeting \nwith the House Freedom Caucus--the same Republicans who worked with Ted \nCruz to shut down the government. And they did shut it down. It seems \nas though the Republican leader now subscribes to this new, radical \nRepublicanism.\n  Even though this extremist brand of politics may sell in Republican \nPresidential primaries, mainstream Americans categorically reject it. \nYesterday, Public Policy Polling released a survey of Independent \nvoters in Pennsylvania and Ohio--not Democrats, not Republicans, but a \nlarge swath of Americans who are now Independents. These numbers should \nserve as a wake-up call to the Republican leader's party: 70 percent of \nIndependent voters in Ohio believe a new Supreme Court Justice should \nbe named this year. More than 60 percent of Independent voters in \nPennsylvania believe a new Supreme Court Justice should be named this \nyear.\n  The American people are telling Republicans in the Senate that they \nreject this obstruction of a Supreme Court nominee. Unfortunately, the \nRepublican leader is listening to Donald Trump and the junior Senator \nfrom Texas. He is not listening to mainstream America. He is not \nlistening to the few voices of reason coming from his own party, even \nfrom his own Senators.\n  Yesterday the senior Senator from Maine, a Republican, told CNN:\n\n       For my part, it's clear the President can send up a \n     nominee--regardless of where he is before he leaves office. \n     It is the duty of the Senate, under the Constitution, to give \n     our advice and consent or withhold our consent. I believe we \n     should follow the regular order and give careful \n     consideration to any nominee that the President may send to \n     the Senate.\n\n  There is precedent in this body. Even in the Judiciary Committee, if \nthere is a hearing held and the person is not reported out with a \nmajority vote, it comes to the floor anyway. Senator Leahy--longtime \nchair of the Judiciary Committee, the President pro tempore of the \nSenate, and now ranking member of the Judiciary Committee--\n\n[[Page S928]]\n\nwill come and talk about that this morning.\n  I just read a quote from Senator Collins, but she is not alone in \nurging the Republican leader to follow regular order. Other sitting \nSenators are saying the same thing. I will not read what all of them \nsay, but there is a small nucleus of Republican Senators who believe \nstrongly that what Senator McConnell is doing is wrong.\n  The Republican Senator from Indiana, Senator Coats, was quoted in one \ninterview as saying:\n\n       If the President nominates someone, which is his choice, I \n     think that person would deserve a hearing if that person is \n     not someone that is just obviously nominated for political \n     purposes.\n\n  Even the Republican leader's former colleagues agree that the \nPresident's nominee deserves a fair shake. The former Senator from \nIndiana, Dick Lugar, is urging Senate Republicans to do the right thing \nand honor their constitutional duty. He served here for more than three \ndecades. Here is what he said yesterday:\n\n       I can't understand their reluctance given the controversy \n     that surrounds all of the debate that has already occurred. \n     But that is not sufficient reason to forgo your duty.\n\n  But perhaps the former Republican Senator from Maine, Olympia Snowe, \nsaid it best:\n\n       I believe that the process should go forward and be given a \n     good-faith effort.\n\n  ``A good-faith effort''--it is a phrase we hear often, but it is \nabsolutely crucial to American democracy. Our Constitution is \nconstructed with the expectation that elected leaders would act in good \nfaith. That is how our government operates. It should. Under the \nRepublican obstruction, that has not been the case.\n  I ask my Republican colleagues, whose side do you want to be on? \nWhose voice are you listening to? These voices of moderation and reason \ncoming from within your own party or the shrill voices--the shrill, \nshrill voices--of Trump and Cruz? There isn't time to vacillate.

The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                      Nomination of Michael Missal\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is quite a discussion when we talk \nabout confirmations, one of the responsibilities this body has that the \nother body does not have. In the case of a U.S. Supreme Court vacancy, \nhowever, during an election year, I think it has actually been some 80 \nyears since they have actually filled a vacancy as opposed to waiting \nuntil after the next election.\n  I am concerned today, though, about another confirmation. VA IG \nnominee Michael Missal has been nominated, and I have a hold. To \nexplain what that means, when you have a hold, that doesn't necessarily \nmean you don't approve of the nominee, but it does mean there is one \nreason or another you don't want to go ahead and confirm that person. \nThat happened in the case of the nominee to be a VA inspector general, \nMichael Missal. Actually, I am not placing a hold on him because of \ndeficiencies in him but deficiencies in the Office of the Inspector \nGeneral. Today what I am announcing is that I am lifting that hold. \nThat means they are free to go ahead and have this nominee go forward, \nand I think that is the right thing to do.\n  At the Muskogee VA facility alone, the IG office has conducted nine \ninvestigations since 2009, and there has been little or no change in \nthe quality of care. Right now, my office is working hundreds of cases \nof Oklahoma veterans facing inadequate care or blocked access to \nbenefits. I wrote the VA IG in January of 2016 simply requesting that \nthe VA IG--inspector general--visit Oklahoma facilities and to do so \nwith an outside entity such as a joint commission. There is an attitude \nsometimes with individuals not wanting outside help, a kind of \nassumption that ``I don't need their help.'' Their response letter \ndenied my request to conduct an investigation with a third party. It is \ntime for our VA facilities in Oklahoma to be held to those same \nstandards as private hospitals, and I believe it would take the aid of \nan outside group to make this happen because right now they are not \nmeeting that quality.\n  Since placing a hold on Mr. Missal, the IG office has committed to \ninvestigating Oklahoma's VA facilities with the oversight of an outside \nentity, and I have also had commitment from Michael Missal that he will \ndo that. I appreciate their commitment, but our work to improve the \ncare for Oklahoma veterans doesn't end there.\n  Since the VA reform bill passed Congress this last summer--and it was \na good bill--it is clear our facilities in Oklahoma have continued \nbusiness as usual. I haven't seen any noticeable difference in the \nperformance and treatment of our veterans since the passage and \nactivation of that bill. I believe the impending investigations will \nshow it is going to require a change in the management level to bring \nabout lasting improvements for veterans care.\n  That is why I, along with my junior Senator from Oklahoma James \nLankford, introduced S. 2554, the Department of Veterans Affairs \nAccountability Act, on February 12. This legislation is critical to \nproviding the best treatment for our country's veterans. Building upon \nthe comprehensive plan of the 2014 VA reform bill, our legislation \ngrants VA leadership at the regional level the authority to fire and \ndemote staff working in these facilities. I think a lot of them thought \nthe reform bill did that, but it didn't. We haven't been able to do it. \nIt also allows directors of veterans regional chapters to contract with \nan outside entity to conduct investigations of their VA medical \nfacilities. As I have worked to address the many concerns I have with \nOklahoma's VA facilities, I have come to trust the leadership at the \nregional level. One individual who has come in is Ralph Gigliotti. He \nhas done a great job. He doesn't have the authority to do what this \nbill would allow him to do. Not only were intermediate surgeries \nsuspended due to what they have now uncovered, but also the chief of \nstaff has been temporarily removed from his position.\n  However, this process revealed that regional directors are not \npresently empowered to address staffing concerns in the facilities they \noversee. We have seen this in the State of Oklahoma numerous times. Our \nlegislation peels away the layers of bureaucracy and allows the \ndirectors and each of the regional areas to play a larger role with \nimproving the VA system as a whole.\n  As we all know, freedom isn't free. Many of our veterans have paid \nthe prices with scars, some visible and some may go unseen such as \npost-traumatic stress disorder--PTSD--depression, and traumatic brain \ninjuries. In my great State of Oklahoma, there are more than 37,000 \nmilitary families and roughly 340,000 veterans that call our State \nhome, attend our churches, and contribute to our communities. On behalf \nof Oklahoma, I say we are humbled by the immeasurable dedication of \neach and every one of them. I think it is the government's duty to \nhonor the promises made to our veterans in return for their sacrifice. \nI urge our colleagues to remember that.\n  I can remember when I was in the Army, commitments were made to me\n\n[[Page S929]]\n\nwhen a decision was made--actually, mine was not a decision because it \nwas compulsory service at that time, which I think we ought to go back \nto. Anyway, I think this is going to be good, and this is going to give \nus the resources and the capability of correcting the problems as we \nsee them. For that reason, I am lifting my hold on Mr. Michael Missal \nand his nomination will move forward.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                   Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this past weekend the Nation honored \nJustice Antonin Scalia, who was laid to rest after serving on the \nSupreme Court for nearly three decades. Marcelle and I were home in \nVermont when we learned that Justice Scalia had passed. Frankly, we \nwere stunned by the news. I did not often agree with Justice Scalia, \nbut he was a brilliant jurist with a deep commitment to our country and \nto the Constitution, and we enjoyed his friendship for decades. He will \nbe remembered as one of the most influential Justices in modern \nhistory.\n  While his family and all should have had a chance to mourn his \npassing, I was shocked when, in the immediate wake of his death, Senate \nRepublicans moved quickly to shut down the constitutionally mandated \nprocess to fill the vacancy left on the Supreme Court. Within hours of \nhis death being announced, they declared they would oppose any effort \nto confirm the next Supreme Court Justice this year. I have served in \nthis body longer than any Member here and I have heard some shocking \nthings during that time, but I am surprised by the political crassness \nof these statements.\n  Before a nominee had even been named, some Republicans reflexively \ndecided to prematurely reject anyone--anyone--nominated by the \nPresident. This impulsive rush to judgment runs completely contrary to \nhow this body has always treated nominees--always treated nominees--to \nthe highest Court in the land. Republicans should not allow the hyper-\npartisan rhetoric of the campaign trail to trump one of the Senate's \nmost important constitutional duties.\n  I have talked to the President, and I know he will fulfill his \nconstitutional duty. He will nominate an individual to bring the \nSupreme Court back to full strength, and of course he should. The \nPresident has already begun consulting with Members of both parties in \nSenate, but after a nomination has been made, we in the Senate should \nget to work and do our jobs--the jobs we were elected to do.\n  I was all over my State of Vermont last week. The Vermonters I spoke \nwith last week reflect Americans across the country who are tired of \npartisan political games that are chipping away at the foundation of \nour constitutional democracy. I heard this from both Republicans and \nDemocrats in Vermont.\n  As Oliver Goodenough, a law professor at Vermont Law School, wrote \nthis weekend in the Rutland Herald, an extended Supreme Court vacancy \ncaused by Senate inaction ``would certainly create a constitutional \nembarrassment.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Rutland Herald, Feb. 21, 2016]\n\n                    Court Battle--Another Shutdown?\n\n                       (By Oliver R. Goodenough)\n\n       Within hours of the announcement of Anton Scalia's death, \n     one of our political parties was already trying to make \n     points with the electorate about the process of picking his \n     successor. At that evening's debate, the GOP presidential \n     candidates advocated that the constitutional process should \n     be suspended, either voluntarily by President Barack Obama or \n     by purposeful inaction by the Senate.\n       Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, was just as \n     speedy, trying to warn Obama off from acting on the mandate \n     of Article II, Section 2, which charges the president with \n     nominating a replacement for Justice Scalia and the Senate \n     with providing its advice and consent on the president's \n     choice.\n       One can understand McConnell's disappointment. Appointments \n     to the Supreme Court are for life, which means only \n     resignation, impeachment or death will create a vacancy. In \n     the somewhat ghoulish game of waiting for a slot on the \n     closely divided Supreme Court to open up, the short-term \n     expectations of mortality had been focused elsewhere--Justice \n     Ruth Bader Ginsberg, in particular, has been a survivor of \n     long-odds pancreatic cancer.\n       So Republicans were brought up short by the death of a \n     conservative hero, whose replacement could shift the balance \n     of the court. The accidents of history will do that \n     sometimes.\n       The Constitution makes provision for what happens in such a \n     case--in the kind of clear, unequivocal language that is the \n     best target for Justice Scalia's vaunted originalism. The \n     president nominates. The Senate, for its part, gives the \n     qualifications of any nominee a serious vetting; it is not \n     entitled to just ignore the nomination.\n       Some reports have argued that such a course of process \n     sabotage would create a ``constitutional crisis.'' This is \n     probably an overstatement; it would certainly create a \n     constitutional embarrassment. With nearly a year left in \n     Obama's term, waiting for his successor to name the new \n     justice in 2017 would remove the ninth voice from the court \n     not just for the current yearly term but also for most of the \n     following term as well, since the replacement would arrive in \n     the spring and miss months of argument and deliberation. For \n     the better part of a year, the vacancy would sit like a \n     broken tooth in the operations of the court. Close cases \n     would often end up tied, with the result that the lower court \n     finding would remain the binding result. Not itself a \n     disaster, but a result that the constitutional provisions for \n     naming a successor are designed to avoid.\n       The embarrassment of sabotage on judicial appointments \n     actually already exists: Republicans in the Senate have \n     effectively shut down the process of nominating new judges \n     for the federal courts of appeal. The blockage isn't over \n     qualifications--such considerations would be a proper \n     exercise of the Senate's confirmation role, raised in \n     committee and on the Senate floor Rather, the nominations are \n     sitting in a limbo of inaction: It is simply a matter of not \n     doing the job at all.\n       This is the real crisis, a state of politics where \n     Republicans in the House and Senate are willing to derail the \n     processes of government to thwart the actions of President \n     Obama, good, bad or indifferent. The most obvious example was \n     the full shutdown of government. Limited shutdowns on matters \n     like judicial appointments are parts of the same pattern.\n       Of course, obstructionism is not just a Republican failing, \n     and it can be present in both parties to some degree in the \n     spicy stew of politics in our robust democracy. But the \n     bottom-line commitment of all parties should be to \n     maintaining a functioning government, structured and \n     administered in accordance with the framework set out in our \n     Constitution, even when it is not working to their advantage. \n     Why is this so hard for at least some Republicans to buy \n     into? Why the willingness, indeed eagerness, to bring down \n     the house we all live in?\n       The key is a widespread denial among Republicans of the \n     legitimacy of the Obama presidency. This is partly related to \n     the man himself--all the blather about his birth, his \n     religion, etc. While many Americans find it a vindication \n     that we can elect an African-American to our highest office, \n     for some it is an impossibility which in turn justifies the \n     most extreme forms of resistance. Race is our original sin as \n     a country, and its legacy haunts us still.\n       Republicans are also in denial over changes in the social \n     and economic fabric of America. We are, as always, in the \n     process of moving from what America has been to what it will \n     be. Conservatives have a role to play, reminding us of the \n     valuable parts of where we came from. Progressives have a \n     role, recognizing the imperatives of the future and charting \n     the paths of change toward positive outcomes. Politics is the \n     sometimes rough and tumble playing field where the dialog on \n     this goes forward.\n       The intransigence of shutdowns, however, whether of the \n     full government or a critical aspect like the nomination \n     process, exceeds the boundaries of acceptable play and hurts \n     us all. Obama needs to make a good faith nomination to fill \n     the vacancy on the Supreme Court. McConnell and his \n     colleagues in the Senate majority need to review it in good \n     faith. That is what the Constitution provides; that is what \n     the country needs. Get on with it.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. We must not let that dysfunction infect the Supreme Court, \nan independent, coequal branch of government that was designed to be \nabove politics. The next nominee to the Supreme Court deserves full and \nfair consideration by the Senate. This includes a timely hearing and \nthen having an up-or-down vote.\n  I am worried that even before President Obama took office, and ever \nsince then--even after he was reelected by a 5 million-vote plurality--\nthere has been an unrelenting and cynical campaign by some hyper-\npartisans to delegitimize the President's authority. There were the \nbirthers, and there have been and still are spurious slurs of all \nkinds.\n  Outside of this body, the efforts to undermine President Obama's \nconstitutional authority to fill this Supreme Court vacancy draws some \nof their vehemence and venom from these dark corners. But every one of \nus took an oath of office--every one of us--and we\n\n[[Page S930]]\n\nare sworn to uphold our constitutional duties. Let us not be \nintimidated and pressured to avoid our sworn duty. Let us act for the \ngood of the American people and for the good of this great Nation.\n  Some have justified their call for unprecedented obstruction by \nclaiming it is because the American people need a voice. Give me a \nbreak. The American people have spoken--millions of Americans--and an \noverwhelming majority of Vermonters voted in record numbers in 2008 and \nagain in 2012 to elect President Obama. In doing so, they granted him \nconstitutional authorities for all 8 years of those two terms. A \nPresident isn't elected for 1 year or 2 years or 3 years. A President \nis elected for 4 years at a time. Just saying that President Obama is a \n``lame duck'' President does not make it true. In fact, the next \nelection is not until November. The American people expect those they \nelected to do their jobs for their entire term. That means both in the \nSenate and in the White House. They don't expect Senators to say: Well, \nwe can't vote on anything this year because it is an election year. We \nwill collect our full salary, but we are not going to vote on anything. \nThe American people don't like that.\n  It is rare that a vacancy in the Supreme Court arises during an \nelection year, but it is just false to say Justices do not get \nconfirmed in Presidential election years. More than a dozen Supreme \nCourt Justices have been confirmed in a Presidential election year.\n  The Democrats led the Senate during President Reagan's final year in \noffice, and we voted. President Reagan's nominee was confirmed by a \nDemocratic-led Senate during the President's final year in office. He \nreceived a hearing and a confirmation vote. It would be the height of \nhypocrisy to say we shouldn't apply the same process with a Democrat in \nthe White House and Republicans in control of the Senate. We can't say \nthat we will follow our constitutional duties and do our work if we \nhave a Democratic-controlled Senate and a Republican President but we \ncan't do it if it is the other way around.\n  Some Republican Senators have acknowledged that the next Supreme \nCourt nominee should receive a fair hearing. But the process can't end \nthere. I have served on the Judiciary Committee for 36 years. During my \ntime on the committee, we have never refused to send a Supreme Court \nnominee to the full Senate for a confirmation vote. Even in those cases \nwhere a majority of the committee had opposed the nomination, we still \nreported the nominee to the full Senate. Once reported to the full \nSenate, every Supreme Court nominee has received an up-or-down \nconfirmation vote during my 40 years in the Senate. We have to uphold \nthis bipartisan tradition for the next Supreme Court nominee because so \nmuch is at stake. Merely holding a hearing without full committee \nprocess and a confirmation vote is insufficient for a Supreme Court \nnominee. It would be a charade, and it would be an avoidance of our \nconstitutional duties.\n  If Republicans refuse to uphold their constitutional responsibility \nto consider the next Supreme Court nominee, I believe it will harm our \nconstitutional system of government. If they succeed in deliberately \nholding open a seat on the Supreme Court for more than a year, they \nwill be intentionally disabling the Court's ability to fulfill its \nconstitutional role, and Republicans will be harming the Supreme Court \nfor more than a year.\n  Justice Scalia once wrote that a Supreme Court of just eight Justices \nrisked the possibility the Court ``will find itself unable to resolve \nthe significant legal issue presented by the case.'' The legal issues \nbefore the Supreme Court are significant, and the importance of a \nsingle vote on the Court cannot be overstated. One vote on the Supreme \nCourt decided landmark cases concerning our campaign finance laws, \nclean water and air policies, marriage equality, and voting rights. \nAmericans deserve a fully functioning Supreme Court.\n  I have traveled all over my State. I have traveled all over this \ncountry. I have talked to Republicans and Democrats alike. What I know \nabout my fellow Americans that makes me so proud is that they show up \nfor work and they do their jobs. Americans don't have the luxury of \ntelling their bosses that instead of doing their job, they would rather \ndelay, delay, delay. If they did, they would probably be fired. The \nU.S. Senate shouldn't tell the American people that we are not going to \ndo our jobs; that we will delay, delay, delay. The stakes are too high.\n  The American people actually expect us to show up for work and do our \njob. Let's get to work, do the job the American people sent us here to \ndo. And we may want to reread our oath to uphold the Constitution. It \nrequires no less.\n  Mr. President, I don't see others on the floor about to speak. I will \nyield the floor when I do.\n  We have allowed this whole process to become far too partisan. I am a \nlawyer, a former prosecutor. I have argued cases in the State court, \nFederal courts, Federal trial courts, and Federal appellate courts. \nWhen I have gone to the Federal courts, I have always thought that the \nbeauty of this--whether Republican or Democratic nominees--is that I \ncould get a fair hearing. I thought it was a great honor to go there.\n  People come from other parts of the world, and they talk about our \nFederal judiciary as an example for them. I recall that when a country \nthat had been under dictatorship changed to a more democratic form of \ngovernment, some of their people came to my office and asked about our \njudicial system.\n  They said: Is it true that in the United States of America, people \ncan actually sue their government?\n  I said: That is true. It happens all the time.\n  They said: Well, is it true that sometimes the government loses?\n  I said: It happens all the time.\n  They said: Well, do you replace the judge when that happens?\n  I said: No. They are independent.\n  It was like a lightbulb went on. They realized how different we are. \nThink of the image we send to the rest of the world--as well as 300 \nmillion Americans--if we say: No, we are going to politicize the \nSupreme Court, the Court that is supposed to be the final arbiter on \nconstitutional questions. Look at what it says to them if we say: Yes, \nwe have time to take more recesses this year than I think the Senate \never has, that I can ever remember, but we don't have time to do the \njob we were elected to do, the job we are paid to do--have a hearing on \nand vote on a Supreme Court nominee.\n  The American people have jobs. They can't pick and choose when they \nwill bother to show up. They can't say ``I know this is what I am \nsupposed to do in this job, but I don't feel like it'' or ``I have a \npartisan reason not to do it. I am going to sit this out. See me next \nyear, and I may do my job.'' Nobody would accept that. But that is \nreally what is happening. The Republican leadership is saying ``No, we \nwant to sit this out. We don't want to do our work. We don't want to do \nour job. See us next year, and maybe we will then.'' That has never \nhappened. It never happened during an election year. There have been at \nleast a dozen Supreme Court vacancies during an election year, and a \ndozen times the Senate, no matter who was President, came together and \nhandled the nominee and got them confirmed. Why did Senators do that in \nthe past? Probably because they figured they had been elected, they \nwere being paid by the American people, it was part of their job, and \nso they showed up and did their job.\n  Are we now going to change what has been the precedent ever since the \nbeginning of this country and say ``Oh, we are better than that. We \ndon't have to do our job. Keep paying us, but we don't have to do our \njob even though we have taken an oath to uphold the Constitution and do \nour job''? Even Justice Scalia said that would be wrong, that you \nshouldn't have an eight-member Supreme Court. And we don't.\n  Let's actually show up and do the job we were elected to do, do the \njob we are paid to do. Let's do what every other American has to do. \nThey have to show up for work. They have to do their jobs. They can't \nsay ``I don't feel like it this year. I will see you next year. Oh, by \nthe way, send me my paycheck.'' That is not the American way; it should \nnot be the Senate way.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S931]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today first to praise and echo the \nwords of the senior Senator from Vermont, our ranking member on \nJudiciary, in urging our Republican colleagues to give a fair and full \nconsideration of a Supreme Court nominee. I particularly wish to praise \nmy friend, the ranking member, for his eloquent remarks and for his \nleadership of the committee when he was chair and as ranking member.\n  My friend from Vermont is absolutely right. Just as the President has \na constitutional responsibility to name a nominee to the Court, the \nSenate has a constitutional duty to provide advice and consent on that \nnominee. Frankly, it is the Senate's job to consider Supreme Court \nnominees, and the American people expect the Senate to do its job. We \nare telling Senate Republicans, America is telling Senate Republicans: \nDo your job. Plain and simple.\n  My friend, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, should commit to \nholding hearings. The distinguished majority leader should commit to \nholding a vote. It has been a longstanding precedent of the Senate to \nconsider Supreme Court nominees in a timely manner, even in election \nyears: Justice Pitney in 1912; Brandeis and Clarke in 1916; Cardozo at \na time when America was even more divided than now, 1932. In the middle \nof the Depression, the great election between Roosevelt and Hoover, \nthey put in Cardozo in that last year. Murphy in 1940 and Kennedy in \n1988 were confirmed. Justice Kennedy was confirmed in the last year of \na Presidency with a Republican in the White House and Democrats in \ncontrol of the Senate. That is the mirror image and the most recent \nchance we have to compare how Democrats were acting, how Republicans \nwere acting. All of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who were \nhere voted that way.\n  I know today our Republican colleagues point to what Senator Biden \nsaid. They have pointed to what Chairman Leahy said. They have pointed \nto what I and other Democrats have said. There are equal quotations \nthat Senator McConnell, Senator Grassley, and others have said, each \nvoicing a different view than maybe is being voiced today. But none of \nthose were held up. You can have all the competing quotes you want; \nthey amount to nothing. The American people are strong--Democrats and \nRepublicans--in telling Senate Republicans: Do your job.\n\n  The bottom line is very simple. To say that there will be no hearing, \nno vote, no consideration whatsoever even before a nominee is named to \na vacancy, that is not doing your job; that is quitting before you \nstart. Senator Leahy said it well. Imagine someone showing up at work. \nImagine if an average American showed up at work and said: I am going \nto take a year off, but you still have to pay me. Your boss wouldn't \nstand for it. Well, our boss, the American people, will not stand for \nthis because it will take over 300 days before a Supreme Court nominee \nis filled, at best.\n  The kind of knee-jerk political obstruction the American people have \ngrown so frustrated with in the Congress is what our Republican \ncolleagues are saying. If Republicans truly respect the Constitution, \nthey should follow it and consider a nomination from the sitting \nPresident rather than playing political games. Instead, they are once \nagain threatening to bow to the most extreme rightwing voices and \nengage in the kind of political obstruction that brought us a 3-week \ngovernment shutdown that cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs and took \n$15 to $20 billion out of the economy.\n  In 2013, after the hard right didn't get its way in its fight to undo \nthe Affordable Care Act, they waged a war to shut down the government. \nRepublican leaders listened. They probably knew it was wrong in their \nheads, but they listened. What happened? After 3 weeks with their tails \nbetween their legs, the leadership had to say we have to open up the \ngovernment even though we haven't repealed the Affordable Care Act. The \nnow-junior Senator from Texas had urged that course, and they were \nfoolhardy to follow. The junior Senator from Texas is now urging the \ncourse of having no hearings and no votes. I tell my Republican \ncolleagues--and to his credit, Senator McConnell said we have to get \nthe Senate working again--that this is a foolhardy course, and it will \nnot stand. It will not last because the American people are telling \nSenate Republicans: Do your job.\n  Republicans say the American people should have a voice in choosing a \nSupreme Court Justice. Well, guess what. President Obama won reelection \nby a large margin in 2012. Many of the issues they bring up now were \nthere then, such as security and the Affordable Care Act. There was a \nreferendum on all these kinds of things.\n  The people spoke loudly and clearly on November 6, 2012, when they \nelected the President to another 4-year term. That is 4 years, as \ncalled for in the Constitution, not 3 years, as some of my Republican \nfriends like to say now. If Republicans get their way, we would have a \n4-to-4 gridlocked Supreme Court for a year that would tie the Court and \nlarge parts of the country in knots. Let me say, if we have a tie in \nthe Supreme Court decision, the decision has no Presidential value. You \nget gridlock and confusion. America doesn't want gridlock. They don't \nwant gridlock on the floor of the Senate, they don't want gridlock on \nthe floor of the House, and they don't want gridlock in the Supreme \nCourt. The American people expect the Senate to do its job. They are \ntired of obstruction and ``my way or the highway'' politics.\n  Again I say that our friend, the junior Senator from Texas, likes to \nquote the Constitution. He likes to walk around carrying the \nConstitution. That is great. I am all for that. I would like him to \nshow me the lines in the Constitution that say in the last year of the \nPresident's term, he doesn't have the power or the right to nominate a \nSupreme Court Justice. Of course he does. Yet the Republican majority--\nat least by its stance now--is taking away that right because they will \nnot even have a hearing.\n  Some people say: Well, they will just vote no after the hearing. \nMaybe yes, maybe no. I believe every Member has the right to vote no if \nthey think the nominee is out of the mainstream, and I will be the \nfirst to admit mainstream is defined differently by different people. \nBut hearings are amazing things. If the candidate is being open and \nhonest, hearings help us to get to know the candidate better. Whatever \none thinks of hearings, the last four nominees of the Supreme Court--\ntwo under President Bush, two under President Obama--got bipartisan \nvotes and passed.\n  This idea of not having a vote is wrong. For the sake of our \nConstitution and for the sake of getting our country moving again, I \nurge and plead with my colleagues on the other side to do their job. \nThat is what the American people want, plain and simple.\n  It is time for the Senate to do its job. Once the President nominates \nsomeone, we need to have hearings with our Republican colleagues in a \ncareful and thoughtful way. They don't have to rush a nominee through--\nno dilatory tactics--and then there should be a vote.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n   Remembering Justice Antonin Scalia and Filling the Supreme Court \n                                Vacancy\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, on February 13 the Nation was shaken by \nthe news that Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia had passed away. \nJustice Scalia served on the Nation's highest Court for 29 years, and \nhe was a major figure on the American legal landscape. Justice Scalia \nwas described by Judge Richard Posner of the Seventh Circuit as ``the \nmost influential justice of the last quarter century.''\n  Over the years I came to know Justice Scalia. He was a man of great \nintellect, good humor, and he was a very social person. We certainly \ndisagreed on many fundamental issues, but even those who disagreed with \nJustice Scalia on legal matters still admired him as a person.\n  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg--no ideological ally of Justice Scalia--\nwrote\n\n[[Page S932]]\n\nafter his death, ``we were best buddies.'' She described him as ``a \njurist of captivating brilliance and wit, with a rare talent to make \neven the most sober judge laugh.'' Justice Ginsberg said she and \nJustice Scalia were ``different in our interpretation of written \ntexts,'' but they were ``one in our reverence for the Constitution and \nthe institution we serve.'' I have great respect for the decades \nJustice Scalia spent in public service. My thoughts and prayers clearly \ngo with his family.\n  As surprised as I was by the news of Justice Scalia's passing, I was \namazed at how quickly the Senate majority leader, Senator McConnell of \nKentucky, issued a press release saying, ``this vacancy should not be \nfilled until we have a new President.'' His statement came out within \n90 minutes of the press report of the Justice passing. This statement \nclearly came at a time when most people reflected on the loss of the \nSupreme Court Justice, and just like that, the conversation shifted \nfrom the passing of an American legal giant to an attack on President \nObama's authority to fill his vacancy on the Supreme Court.\n  What does the Constitution tell us about filling a vacancy on the \nSupreme Court? There are very few oaths a person takes in their life. \nAs Members of the Senate, we swear each time we are reelected to a new \nterm to uphold and defend that Constitution.\n  What does the Constitution say about a vacancy on the Supreme Court? \nIf you go to article II, section 2, it is explicit and very simple. The \nPresident ``shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of \nthe Senate, shall appoint . . . Judges of the Supreme Court.''\n  The President, under the Constitution, has an express responsibility \nto submit to the Senate the nomination of a person who is qualified to \nserve on our Nation's highest Court. Then, of course, the Senate has a \njob to do: Give that nominee a fair hearing and a timely vote. This is \nour constitutional responsibility as U.S. Senators. This is what we \nhave been elected to do. Aside from voting on a declaration of war, I \nbelieve there is no greater responsibility than voting on the \nconfirmation of a Supreme Court nominee.\n  I serve on the Judiciary Committee, and it has been my privilege and \nhonor to consider the nominations of four of the current Supreme Court \nJustices. There is no question that we have the time remaining to meet \nour constitutional responsibility in a thoughtful and careful way.\n  It is now February of 2016. We are almost a year away from January of \n2017 when President Obama will officially leave office. The Republican \nleader would have us leave a seat on the Nation's highest Court vacant \nfor at least 1 year. Not since the Civil War has the Senate taken \nlonger than a year to fill a Supreme Court vacancy, and it certainly \nshouldn't happen now.\n  Usually it takes the Senate about 2 months to consider a Supreme \nCourt nominee. Senator Leahy, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary \nCommittee said that on average it takes about 67 days. So we have more \nthan enough time to do this in a thoughtful and responsible way.\n  Even during Presidential election years, the Senate has routinely \nconfirmed Supreme Court Justices. It has happened over a dozen times, \nmost recently in 1988, when Justice Anthony Kennedy was confirmed by a \n97-to-0 vote during President Reagan's final year in office. President \nReagan--a Republican President about to leave office--submitted a name, \nJustice Kennedy, to the Supreme Court, and a Democratic-controlled \nSenate approved it with a vote of 97 to nothing. So to argue that this \nhas never happened before is to ignore history, and even recent \nhistory.\n  In the past, Senate Republican leaders have said that the \nconfirmation process should move forward with as little time as a month \nbefore an election. Consider the Presidential election of 1968. On June \n13 of that year, Chief Justice Earl Warren informed the President he \nwanted to step down. On June 26 of the election year, Johnson nominated \nAssociate Justice Abe Fortas to become Chief Justice and nominated \nGeorge Homer Thornberry to fill his seat.\n  President Johnson had already announced he would not run again, but \nSenate Republican leaders did not call President Johnson a lame duck \nand question his right to put forward nominees. In fact, Senate \nRepublican leader Everett Dirksen of my State of Illinois said on July \n13 of that year, ``I find that term `lame duck' as applied to the \nPresident of the United States as an entirely improper and offensive \nterm.'' Republican Senator Dirksen was referring to the lame duck \nstatus of President Lyndon Johnson, a Democrat.\n  The Senate gave the President's nominee a prompt hearing in the \nJudiciary Committee. As it turned out, the hearing uncovered a range of \nethics concerns about Justice Fortas, and in late September and early \nOctober, Senate Republicans filibustered his nomination. Fortas \nsubsequently withdrew. But on October 3--same election year, just a \nmonth before the election--the New York Times reported that ``Senator \nDirksen said there was still time for the President to submit a new \nname and rush it through the Senate before the Congress adjourned.'' \nThe Republican leader said that even with a month left, we should try \nto fill the vacant seat. This was a month before the Presidential \nelection. Where are the leaders like Everett Dirksen in today's \nRepublican Party, Senators who are willing to roll up their sleeves and \nget down to the work of considering the nominees on their merits so the \nSupreme Court can do its work? We have a constitutional responsibility, \nas does the President.\n  Make no mistake--the Supreme Court needs a full complement of \nJustices on the bench. When the Court has an even number, as it does \ntoday, four to four, important cases are increasingly likely to end up \nin a tie vote. When that happens in a case, the ruling of the lower \ncourt stands and it is as if the Supreme Court never heard the case at \nall.\n  Major legal and constitutional questions are constantly brought \nbefore the Court. When the Court is frozen at an even number of \nJustices, many of those questions go unresolved and millions of \nAmericans who are impacted by these questions have to wait. That is not \nfair to the American people. That is why historically the Senate moved \nto fill vacancies of the Court. That is why so many Americans are \ntroubled by Senate Republicans' call for a 1-year hiatus in filling the \nSupreme Court vacancy.\n  Former Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said in an interview last week \nthat she disagreed with the idea of waiting for the next President to \nappoint a new Justice. Justice O'Connor said, ``We need somebody there \nnow to do the job. Let's get on with it.'' I agree with Justice \nO'Connor.\n  When President Obama submits a nominee, which he will do in coming \ndays, the Senate needs to do its job, its constitutional \nresponsibility, and give that nominee a fair hearing and timely vote. \nMy Republican colleagues can choose to vote for or against the nominee. \nThat is their prerogative. They should not simply duck the vote. We \nwere not elected to this job to ignore important issues; we were \nelected to cast votes on important issues. This is too important an \nissue to simply ignore.\n  When it comes to giving the President's nominee a fair hearing, I \ncertainly hope Senate Republicans don't adopt the Donald Trump \nposition. When asked about the President's nomination, Mr. Trump, as he \nis wont to do, gave us a juicy quote. Here is what he said: ``I think \nit's up to Mitch McConnell and everybody else to stop it--it's called \ndelay, delay, delay.''\n  I am sure the Senate Republicans were not happy with that statement \nby Trump, but he did speak for a number of people who believe that is \nthe right strategy: stop the President from using his constitutional \nauthority; stop the Senate from accepting its constitutional \nresponsibility. I hope my Republican colleagues don't follow Mr. \nTrump's lead and try to stop President Obama's nominee through endless \ndelays. No one is going to be fooled if Senate Republicans spend weeks \nhaggling over unreasonable document requests or swamping the nominee \nwith endless written questions. Mr. Trump has already made it clear \nthat ``delay, delay, delay'' is simply a strategy to stop the seat from \nbeing filled.\n  If Republicans delay in an effort to run out the clock, we will know \nit, and the American people will know it. The American people want us \nto act. They want us to accept our constitutional\n\n[[Page S933]]\n\nresponsibility. It is time for us to get down to work and do our job. \nThe Senate can't afford to sit on its hands for 1 year and leave the \nSupreme Court hanging in the balance.\n  When President Obama names a nominee, I urge my Republican colleagues \nto give that person a fair hearing and timely vote.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING CHAIR. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to express my \nserious concerns with the FDA's actions on opioid pain relievers and my \nconcern that they have not sufficiently addressed what we are seeing as \nan epidemic in my home State of New Hampshire. The implications of \nprescribing opioids and ensuring that we take a very strong public \nhealth approach toward these pain relievers is important.\n  I know my that my colleagues--Senators Markey, Manchin, and \nBlumenthal--have been on the floor previously to discuss the concerns \nthey share about the FDA as well. I thank them for their leadership on \nthis important issue.\n  I think what is important to understand here is what we are facing \nwhen it comes to heroin, the drug deaths that are occurring in my home \nState of New Hampshire, the connection between people who are misusing \nprescription opioids and then becoming addicted to heroin, and the \ndeadly use of a drug called fentanyl, which is 50 times more powerful \nthan heroin. When we bring this all together, we have a situation with \nopioid abuse which includes painkiller abuse, heroin use, fentanyl \nabuse, and it is killing people in New Hampshire and across this \ncountry.\n  Across this country, approximately 30,000 people died of heroin or \nprescription opioid overdoses in 2014. As we come to receive the 2015 \nnumbers, unfortunately, if the experience is anything like my home \nState of New Hampshire, the numbers are going to be much larger than \n30,000 because in New Hampshire, every corner of my State has been \nimpacted by this.\n  I had the privilege of serving as attorney general before I came to \nthe Senate, and I dealt with many drug issues as attorney general. In \nfact, I had a drug task force that reported to me. We dealt with the \nsurge of methamphetamine, cocaine, and other illegal drugs that \ncertainly have caused addiction and people to struggle with addiction. \nObviously, alcohol is also something people struggle with when it is \nmisused, but I have never seen anything like this.\n  I talk to my law enforcement officers and I talk to my first \nresponders about what they are dealing with. In 2015, in New Hampshire, \nwe had over 400 overdose deaths, and those 400 deaths were situations \nwhere there was a combination--many of them, hundreds of them--of \nheroin and/or fentanyl. And that was a dramatic increase over 2014. In \n2014, we had 320 deaths. And by the way, that is a 60-percent increase \nfrom the year before.\n  Unfortunately, this is not stopping. It is the single most important \npublic health and safety issue facing the State of New Hampshire right \nnow, but I know New Hampshire is not alone. Certainly working with my \ncolleague Rob Portman from Ohio, I know this is hitting Ohio. Working \nwith Sheldon Whitehouse from Rhode Island, I know this is hitting Rhode \nIsland. Amy Klobuchar from Minnesota--this is hitting so many different \nplaces in our country. That is why I know Senator Markey from \nMassachusetts is concerned about this and Senator Manchin from West \nVirginia, who was on the floor earlier. This is about our quality of \nlife in this country and the ability for people to live full lives and \nabout our public safety and about our children most of all.\n  The headline from the Union Leader over this weekend: ``Fentanyl, \nother drugs suspected in three Manchester deaths.'' So we had three \ndeaths in New Hampshire, in our largest city, within 24 hours, and \nthose three deaths were from a combination of heroin and fentanyl. \nAccording to Assistant Fire Chief Daniel Goonan, in just 24 hours in \nManchester, these overdoses claimed the lives of a 23-year-old man, a \n29-year-old woman, and a 34-year-old man. That was in just a 24-hour \nperiod.\n  In fact, what our first responders are seeing--I did a ride-along \nwith the Manchester fire department. I was there less than an hour. We \nwent to an overdose, and I saw the firefighters and their emergency \npersonnel bring someone back to life using CPR and Narcan. If we did \nnot have that drug, the over 400 we had in New Hampshire--I can't even \ntell you what the numbers would be, because not only did I do a ride-\nalong with the Manchester fire department, I did one with the police, \ntoo, and we went to two overdoses in an hour and a half, and I saw them \nbring those individuals back to life.\n  But lest we think this is something that happens on some other street \nor in some other neighborhood, I can assure you that this can happen to \nany family, and that is something we need to understand. That was \nreally brought home for me from a wonderful family I met, Doug and Pam \nGriffin, who lost their beautiful daughter Courtney. They are wonderful \npeople.\n  I think about what our first responders are facing. This same article \nI just talked about, over the weekend--unbelievable. Twice the fire \ndepartment in Manchester revived a woman who was 4 months pregnant, \nworking on her in front of her young children.\n  I will never forget the overdose I went to. The firefighters came \ninto the room, and there was a young man on the ground. They \nadministered the Narcan and brought him back. But do you know what was \nin the corner? A crib with a baby in it. The firefighter grabbed the \nbaby and was bringing the baby over. The father was lying on the \nground.\n  So this is having a tremendous impact on not only those who are \nstruggling with addiction but also their families and the children \naround them and the future generations.\n  In this article, the assistant fire chief from Manchester basically \nsaid: It is more deadly than we have ever seen.\n  So that is why I have been proud to work with my colleagues, proud to \nwork with Senators Whitehouse, Portman, Klobuchar, and so many others \non the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act. I thank the members of the \nJudiciary Committee for voting that important piece of legislation out \nof the committee, and I look forward to us taking that up on the floor.\n  Right now pending on the floor, we have an important nomination for \nthe FDA. That is why I come to the floor today, because if you look at \nwhat we are addressing here, we are concerned about heroin and \nfentanyl, but there is a very important connection for us to \nunderstand, unfortunately, and it is also why I have been such a strong \nsupporter of prescription-monitoring programs. The opiates that are \nprescribed--SAMHSA has found that four out of five individuals who \nturned to heroin actually started with prescription opiates and \nmisusing prescription opiates or overusing those and then transitioning \nto heroin because heroin is cheaper, unfortunately, on our streets.\n  So it is very important that we have the FDA engaging on this issue \nvery aggressively with our medical community, that the FDA take a \nprominent role in ensuring that what they are saying is, this is the \nappropriate use of prescription opiates. In my humble opinion, the FDA \nneeds to take a much more aggressive role than it has in recommending \nthe appropriate uses and engaging the medical community and the \npharmaceutical community, very importantly, on this discussion, this \npublic health crisis we are facing.\n  We have come together as a body on this issue, and I think it is \nimportant that we have been working on this in a very bipartisan basis. \nBut just to talk about the importance of the FDA and the leadership we \nneed there, in 2013 we saw the FDA approve Zohydro--a powerful, pure \nhydrocodone drug--without an abuse-deterrent formulation, and an abuse-\ndeterrent formulation is important so that it will be used for its \nintended purpose and not chopped up or otherwise abused. Yet the FDA \napproves Zohydro--this powerful, pure hydrocodone drug--without an \nabuse-deterrent formulation despite the fact that its own advisory \ncommittee voted against approving the drug by a vote of 11 to 2.\n  I see Senator Markey coming to the floor, and I appreciate his \nleadership on this. One of the things that I know have troubled Senator \nMarkey, Senator Manchin, and me as well is that last year the FDA \napproved OxyContin\n\n[[Page S934]]\n\nfor use by children as young as 11, and when they did that, they did \nnot have an advisory committee or use an advisory committee before \ntaking that step.\n  So I would say that I certainly appreciate that I had the opportunity \nto sit down with Secretary Burwell on this issue and learn more about \nthe FDA's action plan that it issued, but unfortunately I believe the \nagency has to go further than it is going. The example I would use is \nthe issuance of the recommendations for the children as young as 11 \nwith OxyContin, without an advisory committee on something so \nimportant, seems--to me, it just doesn't pass the commonsense test. So \nI would recommend to the FDA, let's make sure we have an advisory \ncommittee look at this issue carefully and then reissue a \nrecommendation, because to me it seems important that we have that \nguidance and the careful, thoughtful approach of the advisory \ncommittee. Of course, what troubles me is we hope they would take the \nadvisory committee's recommendations, unlike what happened with \nZohydro, unfortunately.\n\n  So we need leadership right now in the FDA. I have concerns that we \nare not going to be in a position where we get the strongest leadership \nwe can have. We have a nominee pending on the floor. These concerns are \nvery important. I hope, if he is confirmed, he will be aggressive on \nthis issue and that the FDA will take a stronger leadership role on \nopiates, understanding that they have a very important role when it \ncomes to this public health concern.\n  Right now I am not satisfied with where we are. I believe there is so \nmuch more we need to do. That is actually why yesterday I voted to not \ngo forward with this nomination, because I haven't heard this clear \nstatement, I haven't heard what the leadership plans are on this issue.\n  While I appreciate some of the steps the Department of Health and \nHuman Services has taken, those steps to me need to be very much \nstrengthened. As I look at the FDA's action plan, it pledges to make \nthe use of advisory committees more frequent, but it should require the \nuse of advisory committees for all opioid pain relievers, not just when \nwe decide we want to use it. This should be consistent, given that we \nunfortunately know that the data is there on the connection between \nmisuse of opioid pain relievers and the connection to those who \nunfortunately then turn to heroin, with the deadly combination of \nfentanyl, which is killing people in this country.\n  Again, I wish to thank Senator Markey for his leadership on this \nissue. There isn't a place I go in my State where I don't hear from a \nmother, a father, a sister, a brother, a grandmother, a grandfather, a \nfriend about someone who lost a loved one, lost someone they care \nabout, because of heroin, opioids, fentanyl, the deadly combination \nthat is killing people.\n  We have an opportunity, not only with the important work in the \nComprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act to add more resources to \naddress prevention, treatment, and support for our first responders but \nalso the FDA has a very important role, and we need stronger leadership \nthere and greater engagement of our medical community on the best \nprescribing practices for opioids. To me, this is an opportunity where \nI would like to see stronger leadership and I would like to hear a much \nmore aggressive stance from this FDA.\n  Of all the issues we struggle with, the things we disagree on in this \nbody--heroin, fentanyl, they don't care whether you are a Republican or \na Democrat, I can assure my colleagues, or an Independent or a \nLibertarian because these drugs are taking everyone's lives. So as I \nthink about all the issues we can come together on, this is one about \nour public health, about our public safety, about our quality of life, \nand it requires all of our leadership. There is nothing partisan about \nthis.\n  I hope we will see stronger leadership from the FDA. I hope we as a \nbody will build on what the Judiciary Committee did and bring to the \nfloor the CARA bill that many of us have worked hard on and support \neach other's efforts to do all we can to end this public health crisis \nand ensure that none of us have to run into families of people in our \nState whom we represent who are losing people they love to heroin or \nfentanyl or misuse of opioid prescription drugs.\n  This is devastating. I know we can make a difference. This is \nsomething we can make a difference on in this body.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I want to follow on with the discussion \nthat Senator Ayotte from New Hampshire was bringing to the Senate \nfloor. What she is saying is just so accurate in terms of the pervasive \nnature of this opioid-driven epidemic--pandemic--in the United States \nof America. It is time for us to come together in a bipartisan fashion \nto deal with what is now the great medical storm sweeping across this \ncountry.\n  There has been a quadrupling of opioid-related deaths in just the \nlast 14 years in our country. This is something that has to be \nunderstood. I heard Senator Ayotte mention it, but we can't say it \nenough: 80 percent of all people in the United States who die from \nheroin overdoses begin with prescription painkillers--opioids--that \nhave been given to them by physicians. Let me say that again. Eighty \npercent of the people who die from heroin overdoses started on \nprescription pills. They got addicted to the prescription painkiller. \nIt deals with the same receptors in the brain. It creates the same kind \nof need in the brain, and when people get addicted to prescription pain \nmedicine, it is ultimately a very short to a product which is much less \nexpensive--heroin--on the streets of the United States.\n  This epidemic has to be dealt with and it has to be dealt with where \nit starts and it starts at the FDA. It starts at the Food and Drug \nAdministration. It starts with the agency that approves these drugs for \nsale in the United States of America.\n  Yes, the FDA stands for Food and Drug Administration, but over the \nlast 20 years it really stands for ``Fostering Drug Addiction,'' and it \nhas to end. This is why the nomination right now of Dr. Robert Califf \nto be the new head of the FDA gives us an opportunity to talk about \nthis issue, to talk about where it all starts, how it began, and what \nwe are going to have to do in this body to reverse this trend, which \nlast year led to the deaths of 30,000 people in our country. Again, I \nsay to my colleagues that between 2000 and 2014, the heroin overdose \ndeath rate has quadrupled in the United States of America.\n  This is something that is recent. It is related to the FDA, and we \nhave to now have an honest discussion about the role that agency is \nplaying because we have become the ``United States of Oxy.'' We have \nbecome a nation of 5 percent of the world's population that consumes 80 \npercent of the prescription painkillers in the world.\n  This overprescribing, this consumption of Oxy and Percocet, down the \nline has led to this epidemic, this contagion that is killing people on \na daily basis in our country who otherwise would never have even \ncontemplated using heroin or using any of these other more dangerous \ndrugs.\n  That is why we are here. That is why I am recommending a ``no'' vote \non Dr. Robert Califf.\n  The FDA has a chance to change its policies. Thus far, it is saying \nit will not change its policies.\n  In 2012, health care providers wrote 259 million prescriptions for \nopioid painkillers. That is enough for every single adult in America to \nhave a bottle of these pills in their medicine cabinet. We should \nunderstand as we talk about this that the molecular composition of \nOxyContin is very similar to heroin. In fact, Oxycodone is the sole \ningredient in OxyContin. OxyContin stands for oxycodone continuously in \nthe bloodstream of the patient who is taking these pills. It creates \nthis sense that you are able to deal with the pain. It creates this \nsense that you are being taken care of, but if it is not handled \ncorrectly over time, it then creates an addiction, and that addiction \nthen leads to, once you are off these pills, to being out on the street \nbuying the heroin or buying the Oxy you need in order to continue this \nhabit.\n  So we have to start to deal with the issue very realistically in \nterms of this pathway that has been created into the minds of millions \nof people all across this country.\n  Thirteen hundred people died in Massachusetts in 2014, of the 30,000 \npeople\n\n[[Page S935]]\n\nin our country, as a result of this issue. We have the FDA, going back \nto the year 1996, accepting the misrepresentation of the pharmaceutical \ncompany Purdue, which represented to the FDA that OxyContin, in its \noriginal formulation, was abuse deterrent, meaning that since it was \ntime-released inside of the patient, that, therefore, it was abuse \ndeterrent and it could be prescribed safely to people all across our \ncountry. Well, it turned out that not only was that a misrepresentation \nto the FDA, but Purdue Pharma subsequently was fined millions of \ndollars and its executives punished for the misrepresentation they made \nto the Food and Drug Administration.\n  That was a brief 20 years ago, but that is pretty much where it all \nstarted. That is the original sin--accepting this whole notion of abuse \ndeterrent.\n  Let's go to the FDA in more recent times. In 2012, there was a new \nopioid that the FDA had to consider for approval. That new opioid's \nname is Zohydro. The FDA impaneled 13 experts to examine that drug for \nthe FDA. When those 13 experts concluded their examination of the drug \nby an 11-to-2 vote, the expert advisory panel voted, no, do not allow \nthis new Zohydro drug out on to the marketplace. They said the \nstandards for abuse are too low. The standards to deal with addiction \nare too low. The standards to deal with a diversion of the drug are too \nlow. What did the FDA do in 2012? It approved Zohydro for sale in the \nUnited States over the objections of the advisory panel that had voted \n11 to 2 against it--and these are experts.\n  Moving forward, the FDA decided to reexamine what it was going to do. \nSo when it was considering Targiniq, when it was considering Hysinla, \nit decided to solve the problem by having no expert advisory panels \nwhich it would convene to examine the impacts of that drug before it \ngot approved. That is a good way to solve the problem--just accept the \nrepresentations of the company that it had abuse deterrent in it, and \nthen you don't have to worry because you will not have to talk to \nexperts on the outside again. So those two drugs got approved.\n  Then, in August of 2015, there was an application by Purdue Pharma, \nonce again--that company's name just keeps coming back into the \nequation--they wanted approval to sell OxyContin to children ages 11 to \n16. Now mind you, the actual standards at the FDA require an outside \nexpert panel to look at approval for opioids being sold in America if \nit is controversial, if it could have a huge social impact in our \nsociety. And it specifically says in the FDA's own guidelines that if \npediatric doses--if the proper dose for a child is involved--then the \nFDA should have an expert panel. What did the FDA do? The FDA decided \nno expert panel would examine the appropriateness of OxyContin being \nprescribed for children ages 11 to 16 in our country--no expert \nadvisory panel, which brings us to the nomination of Dr. Robert Califf.\n\n  We are now in a process where we are examining his nomination and his \nqualifications. This Senator leaves aside his own personal \nqualifications. This is not a debate, really, over Dr. Califf. It is a \ndebate over the agency because the agency is saying--even today as we \nwill be voting on Dr. Califf's nomination--they will not change. They \nwill not convene expert outside advisory panels to look at this new \ngeneration of opioids with abuse deterrents built into them to \ndetermine whether or not they are actually appropriately being put into \nour society.\n  Today is the day to begin this debate. This nomination is the \noccasion that we can use in order to debate what has gone wrong at the \nFood and Drug Administration. If we don't start with a brandnew \ndefinition that gets created for abuse, for addiction, for what the \nstandards should be for the use of these opioids, then this issue is \njust going to escalate until we are losing a Vietnam war's number of \npeople every single year in the United States.\n  This is a pharmaceutical industry-created problem. This is a \nphysician-created problem. This is an FDA-created problem. It is \ncreated by men and women, and it can be solved by men and women. This \nis not Zika, this is not Ebola, and this is not some disease that you \ncan't really point to that is responsible. This is us, this is our \ncountry, and this is our culture. We did it. We created this problem. \nWe are 5 percent of the world's population consuming 80 percent of all \nopioids--crazy. Really, it is crazy.\n  We have to finally come to the recognition that this is no longer \nsome inner city heroin epidemic. This disease knows no barrier--racial, \nincome, geography, employment--no barriers at all. It is spread across \nevery single segment of the American population, top to bottom. There \nis no discrimination whatsoever.\n  We have to decide what we are going to do in order to make sure that \nwe put the proper safeguards in place. Senator Manchin and I, Senators \nAyotte, Sanders, Blumenthal, and others have been raising these \nquestions. To the credit of the Senate Judiciary Committee, they are \nconsidering legislation to bring to the floor. I thank Senators \nWhitehouse, Portman, Shaheen, Ayotte, and Senators Grassley and Leahy \nfor their work on that legislation, but that legislation does not \nconclude anything on this issue that I am talking about right now. This \nhas to be solved by the FDA.\n  That is why this Senator has put a hold on this nomination, saying \nthat they will not get this nomination until they change their \npolicies. We are in the eighth year of this administration, and the \npolicies still remain in place.\n  Abuse deterrent is really a contradiction in terms. If you take these \npills--you are a carpenter or an ironworker, and you have a bad back--\nyou start taking these OxyContin pills right now, and you take them as \nthey are prescribed, and you keep going month after month after month. \nYou are increasing the likelihood on a daily basis that you are going \nto become addicted to these pills.\n  We have heard these stories over and over again about the pathway in \nfrom family members. They come into the office and talk about the \npathway in that their child, husband, or son took. It all starts with \nthe same story. They were given the prescribed pills.\n  Right now the industry is saying: Don't worry; there is an abuse \ndeterrent. Tell that to these family members. Tell that to the families \nwho have lost their loved ones. The drugs are not abuse deterrent. It \nis a contradiction in terms, like jumbo shrimp. There is no such thing. \nYou need to be realistic about what this drug represents once it is \nconsumed over and over again by people in our country who think that \nbecause the doctor has given them a bottle of pills, that is going to \nhelp them. That is one of the stories we hear over and over again from \nfamily members.\n  They say that they question themselves. Could they have done more \nthemselves to help their family member before they became addicted? The \ncommon theme from each of them is that you have to assume, when a \ndoctor is giving you a bottle of pills for your family member, that it \nmust be good for them. It must be good for them.\n  It turns out that for 30,000 people in 2014, it wasn't good for them. \nThis number is going to continue to escalate because we haven't put \ntough enough standards on the books in order to deal with these issues. \nBy refusing to convene expert advisory boards to come in and to create \nthe guidance which is going to be needed in our country going forward, \nwe are going to have a continued flood of opioid deaths that could have \nbeen stemmed if we had dealt with this issue in the proper fashion.\n  This is not a hypothetical concern. The policy announced last week by \nthe FDA would not have guaranteed an advisory panel for OxyContin on \nthe market today. The FDA must change its decision not to seek expert \nadvice against the risk of addiction before it approves any and all \nopioids.\n  I want to tell a little story. It is a story about one of maybe the \nfive greatest basketball players ever to come out of the State of \nMassachusetts. His name is Chris Herren. Chris became a Boston Celtic. \nHe was the greatest basketball player in Fall River history, was \ndrafted in the first round by the NBA, and went to the same college I \nwent to--Boston College. In an excerpt of remarks he recently made in \nDC at the Unite to Face Addiction rally on the National Mall, here is \nwhat Chris Herren said:\n\n\n[[Page S936]]\n\n\n  \n\n       I truly believe when it comes to prevention and educating \n     our kids, we need to stop focusing on the worst days and \n     start educating about the first day.\n       At 18 years old, on the campus of Boston College I was \n     introduced to cocaine. I promised myself one time--just one \n     line. That one line took me 14 years to walk away from.\n       Despite myself at 22, my dream came true. I was 33rd pick \n     in the NBA draft, but that same year I was introduced to a \n     little yellow pill--a 40 milligram OxyContin that cost a 20 \n     dollar bill. That 40 milligrams turned into 1600 milligrams a \n     day. And that 20 dollars became a $20,000-a-month Oxy habit. \n     And just 2 years later, that pill turned into a needle and \n     that needle stayed in my arm for the next 8 years.\n       I often say if you can't find it in your heart to have \n     empathy for someone who is battling their illness, then you \n     must know that he or she has a mother, father, son or \n     daughter that is at home with a broken heart that wants them \n     back. Just one pill, lives impacted, some recover and many \n     are lost.\n\n  Another story--Kaitlyn Oberle from Scituate, MA. Here is what she \nsays:\n\n       I have survived a fatal opiate overdose, yet I never abused \n     opiates.\n       On November 13, 2015 I spoke to my 27-year-old brother for \n     the last time. Less than 30 minutes after our final \n     conversation, he passed away from an opiate overdose.\n       He was only 16 years old when he first encountered the \n     demon that consumed the better part of his adult life; sadly, \n     that same demon ultimately killed him. Injuries from a dirt \n     bike accident left him with two broken arms, a knee injury, \n     and what felt like an unending supply of prescription opiate \n     painkillers. After his bones mended, he was left with an \n     untreated gaping open wound that would never fully heal \n     itself: an opiate addiction.\n       During my brother's recovery he painted a picture for me of \n     how easy it was for him as a high school teenager and student \n     athlete to call his doctor and request refills for his pain \n     pill prescriptions. When he no longer had injuries to \n     substantiate a prescription, he turned to illegal forms of \n     opiates in both pill and intravenous form. Unfortunately, the \n     damage to his brain had been done.\n       There are many facets to what may cause someone to become \n     addicted to opiates, and there are equally as many angles of \n     attack before there is substantial progress to a viable \n     solution. Mr. Senator, I am writing to you because I am a \n     survivor. I've lived through my worst fear by knowing I can \n     be a voice in helping prevent future deaths caused by opiate \n     addiction.\n       As you convene to debate the fitness of Dr. Robert Califf's \n     nomination for head of the Food and Drug Administration, \n     please ask the Senate to reflect on his time as deputy \n     commissioner.\n\n  As second in power at the FDA, he has had a chance to do something \nabout these issues. It is time for a change in culture at that agency.\n  A third letter--final letter written by Stephen Jesi, from Malden, \nMA:\n\n       I am writing to you as a longtime Maldonian and a father of \n     a 33-year-old daughter Stephenie who passed away on December \n     13, 2015 of a heroin overdose.\n       Stephenie overdosed on Thursday, two days prior to her \n     death and was released by the hospital at 11:39 p.m. on to \n     the streets. We've experienced this first hand many times. \n     Thank God for Chief Campanello of the Gloucester Police \n     Department who picked up the phone, talked to us, talked to \n     Stephenie, and assisted us in every way he could to get her \n     into treatment. Everybody else just said sorry, there is \n     nothing we can do.\n       I believe that our medical community along with the \n     pharmaceutical industry are grooming and developing drug \n     addicts and putting them right into the hands of the cartels \n     and the drug dealers. Way too many prescriptions are written \n     for more narcotics than are necessary after surgeries with no \n     follow up. Many of those who are predisposed to addiction, \n     either by genetics or co-existing mental health issues, are \n     easy prey for these drugs that begin as legally prescribed. \n     Once they are addicted and can no longer afford the medically \n     prescribed version of the medication they fall into illegal \n     drugs and from there too often the addiction has taken \n     control of their lives.\n       The pharmaceutical industry along with our medical \n     community has to prescribe these highly addictive narcotics \n     much more carefully and offer less addictive medication \n     whenever possible. Most patients take these narcotics for \n     just a couple of days after the surgery but are provided a \n     much longer supply where they can easily fall into the hands \n     of the addict. Our legislators and government officials \n     cannot be tied to the desires of the pharmaceutical \n     lobbyists.\n\n  This is the cry that is coming out from every community in America. \nIndividuals are saying: How did this happen to my family? How could \nthat accident with the broken leg or the back pain turn into an opioid \noverdose? How could it have happened? Well, it happened because the \nmedical community and the pharmaceutical industry have not put the \nprotections in place for us to be able to deal with it.\n  Let me give you this number. This is a crazy number. It is a crazy \nnumber. Over the last 15, 20 years, there has been a dramatic increase \nin the number of prescription opioid pills that have been allowed to be \nsold in America.\n  So I am just going to ask people who are listening to this, pick a \nnumber. How many 10 milligram prescription opioids were allowed to be \nmade in America last year? Just pick a number. We have 300 million \npeople in America. How many of these pills were allowed or given the \npermission to be made by pharmaceutical companies? Here is the answer--\n14 billion. May I say that again--14 billion opioid pills for our \ncountry.\n  The numbers are out of control. The overprescribing is out of \ncontrol. We have to find a way to dramatically reduce the amount of \ndrugs that are being sold legally in our country. Before we even reach \nillegal, you have to start with legal. That is the problem because the \nDrug Enforcement Administration, the agency responsible for deciding \nhow much each pharmaceutical company can manufacture each year, doesn't \neven announce how much each company is given permission to manufacture; \ninstead they just announce the gross number of total opioid materials \nthat can be put into pills in our country each year.\n  Does anyone understand this in America, that that is the process? The \nFDA allows the company to sell it. Then it goes over to the DEA. Then \nthe DEA picks a number of pills that can be sold, and then physicians \nare allowed to prescribe these pills, but this is the FDA's own number.\n  Listen to this. The FDA asks for voluntary guidelines to be put \ntogether for physicians' education so they know what they are doing \nwith these opioids. Pick a number in your brain as to how many \nphysicians have voluntarily accepted medical education on the \nconsequences of prescribing opioids.\n  Pick a number. Here is the correct answer: 10 percent of physicians. \nThat is it. On something that is so catastrophic, something that is \ncreating an epidemic in our country, you would think this would be \nmandatory; that the medical associations at the State level, the \nnational level had created some kind of mandatory education. It hasn't \nhappened.\n  Is it mandatory in medical schools across America that they receive \neducation as to what the consequences are of prescribing opioids? Not \nat all.\n  So who would think a physician would have to be trained in how to \nhandle pain? I mean, a physician is only dealing with the issue all day \nlong, every single day. You would think there would be some \nunderstanding then of what the consequences were of the medicines they \nwere prescribing. No courses in medical school are mandated. No courses \nare mandated after you have graduated, you are practicing medicine, and \nnow you are licensed by the DEA to prescribe opiates--no courses.\n  So as we move forward on the legislation that is going to be coming \nout on the floor of the Senate, I intend to make an amendment--Senator \nBlumenthal and I tried to make it in the Judiciary Committee, and we \nare going to be making it on the Senate floor--requiring the Drug \nEnforcement Administration to require mandatory education for any \nphysician who wants to prescribe these drugs. That is the minimum, the \nminimum that the medical profession should have to accept as a \nresponsibility before they are allowed to prescribe these drugs.\n  There is another amendment which I am working on with Senator Paul of \nKentucky, and that is an amendment that is going to increase access to \nmedication that can help people deal with their addictions. Again, that \nis a classic example of a Democrat and Republican working together on \nthese issues. Senator Ayotte and I have an amendment that would create \na Good Samaritan protection for any American, any family member who \nwants to apply Narcan to a family member or someone who has overdosed \nand would die in the absence of Narcan, the antidote, being applied to \nthem. Senator Ayotte and I are working on that amendment.\n  We are trying hard to find ways where, unfortunately, legislatively \nwe can act. This should have happened at the agencies. This should have \nhappened in the medical profession. We shouldn't be forced to debate \nthis on the Senate floor, but it is absolutely,\n\n[[Page S937]]\n\nindispensably necessary for us to take this action.\n  This is the epidemic of our time. The death rates now in the age \ngroup that is affected by this epidemic are now declining at the same \nrates as they did during the war in Vietnam. We haven't seen anything \nlike this since the war in Vietnam in the death rates--30,000 people--\nquadrupling in 14 years, escalating on a daily basis. It is time for \nthe Senate to take real action on this issue so we can deal with it.\n  In Boston, MA, we had a police chief who saw that something had gone \nwrong, Chief Campanello. He said that incarceration doesn't work and \ninstead treatment should be substituted. So beginning last June, what \nChief Campanello said in Gloucester, MA, was that if you come in and \nyou are an addict, you have a problem, you come into the police \nstation, bring your drugs with you, we are not going to arrest you, we \nare going to put you into treatment immediately--no arrests. Four \nhundred people have walked into that police station in Gloucester, MA, \nin just 8 months--400 people. By shifting the paradigm from arrests to \ntreatment, 800 more people--800 total across the country--as city after \ncity, town after town adopts this model, have now accepted that as a \nbetter route for them in their lives, to just turn themselves in at the \nlocal police stations.\n  He has partnered with a man named John Rosenthal. John Rosenthal is \nan activist in our State, and he helps to fund this program. Last \nWednesday night, tragically, John Rosenthal's own nephew, Nathan \nHuggins-Rosenthal, age 34, died of an overdose in Calgary, Canada. My \nheart goes out to the Rosenthal family because obviously they were \ncommitted to dealing with this issue, pioneering ways to have addicts \nbe able to have a place they can go. Yet in John Rosenthal's own \nfamily, his nephew overdosed just last Wednesday night.\n  As Senator Ayotte was saying, there is no neighborhood immunity. \nThere is no family who is completely protected. This epidemic has been \ncreated by pharmaceutical companies, by physicians, by the agencies \nresponsible to deal with it, and it is now time for us to put in place \nthe protections which are needed to deal with it.\n  Let me give you opioids 101 so you can understand how we get to \nthis--what are opioids, how do they work, and why do they lead to \nheroin abuse. Here is how it works. It starts with a seed pod of the \nopium poppy. We get the morphine, a naturally occurring opiate pain \nreliever from that pod seed. The morphine interacts with so-called \nopioid receptors that are found in high concentrations in areas of the \nbrain that control pain and emotions. Taking opiates can increase the \nlevels of dopamine in the brain's reward areas and produce euphoria or \na rush of pain relief and relaxation. In fact, morphine, which was \nfirst identified in the early 1800s is named after Morpheus, the Greek \ngod of dreams.\n  In 1895, the Bayer Corporation, Bayer Aspirin--the Bayer Corporation \nin Germany introduced a new cough suppressant marketed as a safer \nalternative to morphine. This new wonder drug was called heroin. In the \n1920s, drug manufacturers began making fully synthetic analogs to \nmorphine. They were called opioids. These drugs contain the same basic \nchemical framework as morphine, and they have exactly the same \nmechanism of action in the brain. They share common chemical features \nthat allow them to buy into the brain's opioid receptors, and they all \nare considered highly addictive. These drugs vary widely in potency. \nThat is the amount of the drug required to reach the same level of pain \nrelief and sedation as morphine.\n  OxyContin, for example, is 150 percent as strong as morphine. Heroin \nis also an opioid. They share the same fundamental chemical structure. \nHeroin binds to the very same receptors in the brain and produces the \nsame euphoria and sedation, and heroin is plagued by the same addiction \npotential. Heroin is classified as a schedule I drug, the most \ndangerous class, because it has no accepted medical use and a high \npotential for abuse and addiction.\n  So this is the pathway between opioids and heroin and why that \npathway is very short. It is all about the chemistry because OxyContin \nhas the nearly identical molecular constitution as heroin. Over time, \nthe brain, the receptors are saying: I need to have to continue to have \nthat hit. Thus, we have this epidemic where 80 percent of all people in \nthe United States who are dying from heroin overdoses started on \nprescription opioid drugs that had been prescribed by their physicians. \nPhysicians should have to be educated. The FDA should have expert \nadvisory panels that give the strongest possible guidance to the \npharmaceutical companies. That is what is missing in this equation. It \nstarts there.\n  We need a debate on $1.1 billion for more treatment and more \neducation, and we are going to have that debate on the Senate floor. \nThese local families, these local groups, they are heroes, but heroes \nneed help, and it is time for us to fund those programs in the same way \nwe funded the Ebola crisis and the same way we are being asked to help \nto fund the Zika crisis. We have a crisis in America ourselves, but if \nwe don't deal with the issue right from the beginning at the FDA, at \nthe DEA, and at the AMA, we are not going to solve this problem. We are \njust putting medical facilities in place to deal with the consequences \nof having no policy. This is our great opportunity to have a debate in \nour country.\n  I can't thank the Members enough for beginning to deal with this \nissue on a serious basis, but we can't be afraid of the pharmaceutical \nindustry. We can't be afraid of the American Medical Association. We \ncan't be afraid of the bureaucrats in these agencies who say: Oh, Mr. \nor Ms. Senator, we are the experts. You don't know what you are talking \nabout.\n  Well, just let me tell you this. The people of the United States \ndon't trust the experts anymore in these agencies. They want more \naccountability. They want other experts to come in to check those \nexperts, to ask the tough questions on behalf of the American people.\n  That is why I have a hold on Dr. Robert Califf's nomination for the \nFDA, because right now the FDA is saying it is going to continue \nbusiness as usual and that is just wrong. That is just plain wrong. It \nhas to stop there. The signal must come from this administration.\n  I thank all the Members for this discussion, for where we are today \nand where we are going to have to go in the months ahead, but I don't \nthink we should end this year without a fundamental change that has \ntaken place in our society in this relationship.\n  I will just add one final issue, and that is the issue of how many \npills, how many pills a doctor can prescribe initially to a patient. We \nare now debating that issue in the State of Massachusetts. Governor \nBaker has been saying it should only be 3 days' worth of pills. One of \nthe counterproposals is 7 days of pills that can be used by the \npatient.\n  I do know this. We have to start here because right now doctors are \nhanding out bottles of 60 to patients who only need a week's worth or 3 \ndays' worth. When you leave a dentist's office, you don't need 60 days' \nworth of pills for your wisdom teeth that have been removed. When you \nhave some pain that you just got from playing a softball game and you \nhave twisted your back, you don't need a bottle of 60 or 30. You might \nneed a few pills for 3 days or 7 days, but you don't need the 60. \nHaving that 60 in that medicine cabinet is the beginning of the \nproblem.\n  I thank Governor Baker for what he is doing on this issue. They \nhaven't resolved it in Massachusetts. I think we have to debate that in \nthe Halls of Congress as well. They are all related, how these pills \nget into the blood system of our country.\n  Again, I thank all of the Members for their consideration of this \nissue.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/23/senate-section/article/S937-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S937-S938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. MORAN.

The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, are we still in recess?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is now postcloture on the \nnomination.\n  The Senator may proceed.\n\n\n                   Remembering Justice Antonin Scalia\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to honor the memory of one of our \nNation's greatest champions of limited government under the \nConstitution, Justice Antonin Scalia. Justice Scalia set the standard \nfor the kind of judge upon which liberty depends. He was a dear friend, \nand I will miss him greatly.\n  The purpose of government, according to the Declaration of \nIndependence and the Constitution, is to secure inalienable rights and \nthe blessings of liberty. Liberty exists by design and, as Andrew \nJackson put it, by eternal vigilance. America's Founders were clear \nthat liberty requires separated and limited government powers, \nincluding a particular role for unelected judges. Judges who seek to \ndetermine what the law is promote liberty; judges who say what they \nthink the law should be undermine it.\n  Put simply, judges must interpret and apply the law impartially; that \nis, by setting aside their own opinions, preferences, or prejudices. \nInterpreting and applying the law impartially particularly leaves the \nAmerican people and their elected representatives in charge of the law. \nWhen they interpret written law impartially, they discern what the \noriginal public meaning of the law is. When judges apply the law \nimpartially, they pay no regard to the identity of the parties or the \npolitical effects of their decision. Judges can neither make nor change \nthe law they use to decide cases. That is the kind of judge liberty \nrequires. That is the kind of judge Antonin Scalia was.\n  When President Ronald Reagan first appointed Antonin Scalia to the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit in 1982, the future Justice \nsaid to those of us on the Judiciary Committee that if confirmed the \ntime for him to opine on the wisdom of laws would be ``bygone days.'' \nWhen he again came before the committee a few years later as a Supreme \nCourt nominee, he repeated that setting aside personal views is ``one \nof the primary qualifications for a judge.'' He described a ``good \njudge'' as one who starts from the law itself and not ``where I would \nlike to come out in [a] particular case.''\n  Justice Scalia's brilliance and wit were certainly impressive, but \nthey were powerfully connected to this deeply considered and \ndeliberately framed judicial philosophy rooted in the principles of the \nConstitution. He stuck doggedly to this ideal of the good judge whose \nrole in our system of government is limited to properly interpreting \nthe law and impartially applying it to decide cases. His approach \nrequires self-restraint by judges. Judges, he often said, must take the \nlaw as they find it and apply it even when they do not like the \nresults. In his own words, ``If you're going to be a good and faithful \njudge, you have to resign yourself to the fact that you're not always \ngoing to like the conclusions you reach.''\n  Liberty requires such judicial self-restraint, whether it is en vogue \nor not. As President Reagan put it when he witnessed the oath of office \nadministered to Justice Scalia in September 1986, America's Founders \nintended that the judiciary be independent and strong but also confined \nwithin the boundaries of a written Constitution and laws.\n  No one believed that principle more deeply and insisted on \nimplementing it more consistently than our Justice Scalia. His approach \nto the law was often called textualism or, in the constitutional \ncontext, originalism--an approach which is nothing more than \ndetermining the original public meaning of the legal text. It leaves \nthe lawmaking to the lawmakers and the people they represent, rather \nthan to the judge.\n  The Senate unanimously confirmed Justice Scalia's nomination on \nSeptember 17, 1986, the 199th anniversary of the Constitution's \nratification. That was very appropriate because his approach gives the \nConstitution its real due, treating it as more than empty words on a \npage but as words that already have meaning and substance. Justice \nScalia knew that the Constitution cannot limit government's power if \ngovernment actors--including judges--define the Constitution.\n  Justice Scalia rejected judicial activism--what he called power-\njudging--that treats the law as shape-shifting. For activists, the laws \nand the Constitution have no fixed meaning but can rather be contorted \nand manipulated to fit the judge's own policy preference. Such an \napproach puts the unelected judge, not the American people in their \nelected representatives, in the position of supreme lawmaker.\n  Thomas Jefferson warned that if judges controlled the Constitution's \nmeaning, it would be ``a mere thing of wax in the hands of the \njudiciary, which they may twist and shape into any form they please.'' \nThat is exactly what activist judges do, treating the law like clay \nthat they can mold in their own image.\n  Rather than reinterpreting the law in his own image, the good judge \nconforms his decisions to the fixed meaning of the law. By insisting \nthat even judges must be the servants rather than the masters of the \nlaw, Justice Scalia was simply following the lead of America's Founders \nand empowering the American people.\n  Justice Scalia's approach to judging not only requires self-restraint \nby judges, but it also demands rigor and accountability by legislators. \nThe good judge takes seriously the language the legislators enact, so \nthe people can hold accountable the legislators they elect.\n  The famed Senator and Supreme Court advocate Daniel Webster once said \nthat ``there are men in all ages who mean to govern well, but they mean \nto govern. They promise to be good masters, but they mean to be \nmasters.'' Those who object to Justice Scalia's approach embrace the \nnotion that judges, rather than the people, should be the masters of \nthe law.\n  Justice Scalia's impact has been enormous. A liberal legal \ncommentator may have put it best in his review of Justice Scalia's \nbook, ``A Matter of Interpretation,'' with these words:\n\n       We are all originalists now. That is to say, most judges \n     and legal scholars who want to remain within the boundaries \n     of respectable constitutional discourse agree that the \n     original meaning of the Constitution and its amendment has \n     some degree of pertinence to the question of what the \n     Constitution means today.\n\n  Justice Scalia brought the boundaries of respectable constitutional \ndiscourse more in line with the principles of liberty than they had \nbeen in a generation. For that, our liberty is more secure, and we \nshould be deeply grateful.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n   Remembering Justice Antonin Scalia and Filling the Supreme Court \n                                Vacancy\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this past Saturday I was honored to attend \nthe funeral mass for Justice Scalia. I couldn't help but recall back \nwhen President Reagan nominated him for the Supreme Court of the United \nStates. At that time Judge Scalia said that ``[his] only [agenda] was \nto be a good judge.''\n  Today, 30 years later, it is clear that Justice Scalia, who until his \ndeath served longer than any of the current members of the Supreme \nCourt of the United States, was more than a good judge. In fact, he was \na great judge. He was a giant of American jurisprudence.\n  As I got to know him even better during the course of the more recent \nyears, thanks to a mutual acquaintance, I can tell you he was also a \ngood man. My first encounter with Justice Scalia was back in 1991 when \nI won an election to be on the Texas Supreme Court and the court \ninvited Justice Scalia to come to Austin, TX, and administer the oath \nof office. At that time I already admired his intellect\n\n[[Page S939]]\n\nand commitment to the Constitution and the rule of law, and believe me, \nhe was an inspiration to young judges like me who were inspired to do \nthe same. He has been an inspiration to so many judges, lawyers, and \nlaw students for decades.\n  I admired and respected Justice Scalia. Like many Texans, I was proud \nof the fact that he also seemed to love Texas, believe it or not, even \nthough he was a Virginian. He remarked once that if he didn't live in \nVirginia, he would ``probably want to be a Texan.''\n  I wish to spend a couple of minutes remembering this great man and \nthe contributions he made to our Nation. Beyond his incredible resume, \nJustice Scalia was a devoted husband to Maureen for more than 50 years. \nHe was a dedicated father to 9 children and a grandfather to more than \n30 grandchildren. As I said earlier, he was not only a family man, \nwhich I am sure he would have considered his most important job, he was \na role model for a generation of lawyers, judges, legal scholars, and \nthose who loved the Constitution.\n  One of the interesting things about Justice Scalia--and perhaps he \ncould teach all of us a little something these days--was that he was \nquick to build relationships with people who had different views from \nhis own and fostered an environment of collegiality and friendship on \nthe Court.\n  As we learned earlier, Justice Scalia had relationships with people \nwith whom he couldn't have disagreed more on key issues that the Court \nconfronted--people like Justice Ginsburg, for example. We all know he \nwas a gifted writer and possessed an infectious wit, but Justice \nScalia's most important legacy is his life's work and his call for a \nreturn to our constitutional first principles.\n  Justice Scalia strongly believed that words mattered, and I think \nthat is one of the reasons why he quickly became one of the most \nmemorable writers on the Court and one of the best in the Court's \nentire history. He believed the words written in the Constitution \nmattered because that was the only thing the States voted on when they \nratified the Constitution. Those were the words with which the American \npeople chose to govern themselves. For decades he tried to give those \nwords force and fought against an attempt to say that we really don't \nhave a written Constitution; we have a living Constitution that should \nbe reinterpreted based on the times when, indeed, the text had not \nchanged one bit.\n  His originalist interpretation of the Constitution meant that he \nviewed the Court as a place to vindicate the law and what it meant, not \nexpress the preferences of five Justices. Justice Scalia was one of the \nmost fervent advocates for the rule of law and a written Constitution. \nOn many instances, he made the important point that if the Supreme \nCourt was viewed merely as a group of nine individuals making value \njudgments on how our country ought to be governed under our \nConstitution, then the people may well feel that their values were \nequally as valid as those of the ``high nine'' on the Potomac given \nlife tenure and a seat on the Supreme Court. It was his strict \nadherence to the text of the Constitution, and not evolving value \njudgments over time, that gave protection to our democracy.\n  Justice Scalia was strongly committed to the separation of powers. \nThis is so fundamental to the Constitution that, until the first \nCongress, James Madison didn't even think that we needed a Bill of \nRights because he felt that the separation of powers and the division \nof responsibilities would be protection enough because they viewed the \nconcentration of powers, the opposite of separation of powers, as a \nthreat to our very liberty. I think he said that the very definition of \ntyranny was the concentration of powers. So he saw the separation of \npowers as nothing less than the most important guarantor of our liberty \nand the most important shield against tyranny.\n  In one dissent Justice Scalia wrote ``without a secure structure of \nseparated powers, our Bill of Rights would be worthless.'' I guess you \nwould have to say he is a Madisonian and not a Federalist by \ntemperament and view. This recognition of the importance of separation \nof powers could not be any more important at this point in our history \nbecause scarcely a month goes by when this administration has chosen to \nundermine this basic constitutional precept by exerting itself and \nclaiming authorities which the Constitution does not give the \nPresident.\n  Justice Scalia understood what was at stake. He believed that every \nblow to the separation of powers would harm our Republic and liberty \nitself.\n  As Justice Scalia wrote in a case in which the Court unanimously \nstruck down the President's violations of the constitutional doctrine \nof separation of powers, he said: ``We should therefore take every \nopportunity to affirm the primacy of the Constitution's enduring \nprinciples over the politics of the moment.'' He continued, warning \nagainst ``aggrandizing the Presidency beyond its constitutional \nbounds.'' That is what Justice Scalia did time and again, and that is \nwhat he reminded all of us about--the importance of doctrines of \nseparation of powers, adherence to the text of the Constitution, and \nnot making it up as you are going along or expressing value judgments \nthat can't be related to the actual text and original understanding of \nthe Constitution.\n  The question arises: When the President makes a nomination to fill \nthe vacancy left by Justice Scalia's death, what is the constitutional \nresponsibility of the U.S. Senate? It is true that under our \nConstitution, the President of the United States has a unique role and \nthe authority to make a nomination to fill this vacancy, but it is also \ntrue that the Senate has an essential and unique role to play as well. \nThe founding generation regarded the Senate's role in the appointment \nprocess as ``a critical protection against `despotism.' '' Nothing \nless. That means that the U.S. Senate has a unique and separate role to \nplay, and certainly a coequal role with that of the President, in the \nprocess of filling vacancies on the Court. We are not, and the \nConstitution never intended us to be, a rubber stamp for the President \nof the United States.\n  I know that President Obama would love to nominate somebody in the \nwaning months of his last term of office as he is heading out the door \nand perhaps fill this vacancy, which in the case of Justice Scalia was \nfilled for 30 years, far extending President Obama's term of office. \nThat is not what the U.S. Senate is about. We are a coequal branch of \ngovernment, and we have an independent and separate responsibility from \nthat of the President. He can nominate anybody he wants, but it is up \nto the Senate, in its collective wisdom, on whether or not to grant \nadvice and consent. When we say that, we mean that if the Senate did \nnot play its unique role, liberty itself would be weakened and \ndespotism strengthened.\n  As I said before, the American people can and should have a voice in \nthe selection of the next Supreme Court Justice. In the waning days of \nthis Presidential election year after voters have already cast their \nballots in primaries for Republican and Democratic candidates--even as \nI speak, there is a caucus convening today in Nevada--I believe giving \nthe American people a choice in who selects the next Justice of the \nSupreme Court is very important. I think it elevates what is at stake \nin this next election this November, and that means simply that this \nvacancy should not be filled at this time by this President.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The Senator from California.\n\n\n                   Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I came to the floor because I am stunned. \nI just learned that the Republicans have announced to the country they \nwill not even call a hearing, if and when President Obama does his job \nand nominates a replacement for Justice Scalia.\n  We send our heartfelt sympathy to his family.\n  I don't know where the Republicans have come up with this notion that \nthis is the right thing to do. If you look at the strict \nconstitutionalists, you know they are reading the Constitution, unless \nthey are phonies. This is what the Constitution says, the President \nshall ``nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, \nshall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges \nof the supreme Court.'' Where in this does it say: except in election \nyears. As a matter of fact, we have acted 14 times in election years.\n\n[[Page S940]]\n\n  Whoever is a strict constructionist should read the Constitution, \narticle II, section 2, clause 2. I am going to read it again: The \nPresident shall ``nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of \nthe Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and \nConsuls, Judges of the supreme Court.''\n  It doesn't say as Senator Cornyn said: Oh, the President can \nnominate, but nobody else has a job to do. Oh no. It says: ``. . . and \nwith the Advice and Consent of the Senate . . .''\n  To have such a press conference, as I understand it--I didn't see it \nmyself, but it has been reported to me--there has been an announcement \nthat the Republicans will not even hold a hearing, which goes against \nthis Constitution. I wouldn't be surprised if there is a lawsuit \nbrought by the people of this country, 70 percent of whom believe we \nhave an obligation. We have an obligation.\n  Nowhere in the Constitution does it say it is too late for the \nPresident to nominate. Guess what. The Republicans keep saying we need \nan elected President. Well, I have good news for them. This President \nwas elected twice and he has about a year left. Guess what. I am not \ngoing to run again, but I am here now. I want to work. I did not take \nthis job to have a year off and not worry about working in my last \nyear.\n  Nowhere in the Constitution does it say: Oh, and by the way, don't \nadvise and consent if it is a Democratic President in his second term. \nIt does not say that. So if you consider yourself a strict \nconstructionist, then pay attention to this. I am proud that several \nRepublicans on the other side said: Baloney, we don't go along with it. \nGood for them and more should do it.\n  It doesn't say in the Constitution, you only advise and consent if it \nis a Republican President with a Republican Senate.\n  Again, the Senate over the years has repeatedly considered Supreme \nCourt nominees in both election years and in the final year of a \nPresident's term.\n  Justice Kennedy, who serves now, a fellow Californian, was nominated \nby President Reagan in 1987. I was over on the House side, and I didn't \nhave anything to do with it, but I sure watched it. Kennedy was \nconfirmed by a Democratic Senate during Reagan's last year in office.\n  My Republican friends say: Oh, but this Senator said this about it \nand that Senator said that and Joe Biden said this. It doesn't matter \nwhat people say. It is what we do, and 14 times in history we have \nvoted on judges in an election year.\n  My Republican colleagues who suggest that this process cannot be done \nbefore President Obama leaves office are fooling themselves. History \nhas disproven them and the Constitution is going to chastise whoever \nsays: I want a dead Constitution. Read this. This is very clear. It \nabsolutely is.\n  So I have a message for my Republican friends. Pretty simple. Pretty \nsimple. Do your job. Do your job. If you are afraid to do your job, \nthen do something else with your life. If you don't want to do your job \nbecause you are worried that one moderate may get through, then make \nyour argument. If you want to vote no, vote no, but to hold a press \nconference and say you will not even hold a hearing is outrageous.\n  Every day in talented cities across this country, Americans show up \nfor work and they do their jobs. They don't call their bosses and say: \nYou know, I just don't feel like doing this today. I am healthy, I am \nfine, I am well, but you know what, I don't want to do my job. They \nwould be fired and they should be. Do your job. You are elected to do \nyour job. The American people show up for their jobs. They do their \njobs. It is as simple as that. The Justices of the Supreme Court show \nup and they do their jobs every day. Justice Scalia did it. They all do \nit. They hear cases. They write opinions.\n  The Supreme Court is the last stop on the justice train, but to be \nable to function as our Founding Fathers in the U.S. Constitution \nintended, they need a full bench with all nine Justices. A Supreme \nCourt with eight Justices is not a functioning Court.\n  Let us look at the Republicans' hero, Ronald Reagan. We always hear \nthem say: Ronald Reagan. I was proud to serve in the House during \nRonald Reagan's term. I didn't agree with him on a lot of things, but I \nagree with him on this. Do you know what he said?\n\n       I look forward to prompt hearings conducted in the spirit \n     of cooperation and bipartisanship. I will do everything in my \n     power as President to assist in that process.\n\n  President Ronald Reagan, November 12, 1987. What did he say? Did he \nget up and say: Oh, it is an election year--which it was. No. Kennedy \nwas voted on in an election year and President Reagan made the case.\n  This is what else Ronald Reagan said: ``Every day that passes with a \nSupreme Court below full strength impairs the people's business in that \ncrucially important body.''\n  Let me say that again. Ronald Reagan, who was pushing for a vote on a \nSupreme Court Justice in an election year, said the following: ``Every \nday that passes with a Supreme Court below full strength impairs the \npeople's business in that crucially important body.''\n  I don't understand where the Republicans are coming from. They are \ndisregarding Ronald Reagan, their hero. They are disregarding the \nConstitution that they say is their shining star of their being, which \nit should be for all of us, and they stood there today and blatantly \nannounced they are not even going to hold a hearing on a nominee before \nthey even know who he or she is. What is that about? I am truly \nstunned. I thought I had seen everything, but I have never seen this. \nYou show up and you do your job.\n  I am going to show you a few other quotes of people who are very \nimportant to this conversation and what they are saying about not \nmoving forward. How about Sandra Day O'Connor, what an incredible \nwoman. She was appointed by Ronald Reagan, the first female ever \nappointed to the Supreme Court, a magnificent person and a Republican.\n  What did she say? ``I think we need somebody there, now, to do the \njob, and let's get on with it.'' She just said that 10 days ago or \nless. Is she a partisan? I don't think so. She is speaking from the \nheart. She is speaking from her soul. She is speaking from experience. \nShe knows the Court has important cases before it and will be tied in \nknots if we don't have a Court at full strength.\n  Again, here is what she said, Republican Sandra Day O'Connor, \nesteemed member of the Supreme Court, a Ronald Reagan nominee: ``I \nthink we need somebody there, now, to do the job, and let's get on with \nit.''\n  I am going to show you two more quotes. This is from the American \nConstitution Society:\n\n       A vacancy on the Court for a year and a half, which is what \n     the Republicans want, at least a year and a half, would mean \n     many instances where the Court could not resolve a split \n     among the circuits. There would be the very undesirable \n     result that the same federal law would have differing \n     meanings in various parts of the country.\n\n  That is the American Constitution Society.\n  Then we have another quote I wish to share with you by the director \nof the Byron White Center at the University of Colorado:\n\n       It would essentially shut the Supreme Court down for two \n     years. It would be a monumental crisis for the development of \n     the law and the need to resolve large legal questions.\n\n  Let me say it again.\n\n       It would essentially shut the Supreme Court down for two \n     years. It would be a monumental crisis for the development of \n     the law and the need to resolve large legal questions.\n\n  It is not as if large legal questions aren't at stake. Right now the \nSupreme Court is set to look at some incredibly important cases that \nhave real effects on our people. This isn't some argument in a salon. \nThis is real stuff. The cases can't wait, and it doesn't matter what \nside you are on with these cases. They have to be resolved.\n  What about voting rights? I don't think there would be a difference \nof opinion in this Chamber that this is what makes this country great \nand special, the right to vote, the responsibility to vote. We have \nmany States that have put forward voter ID laws. They need to be told \nwhether they are fair or unfair, whatever side you come down on. We \nneed a Court to look at voting rights cases and see who the eligible \nvoters are.\n  Affirmative action. They are going to reexamine that case. Whatever \nside you are on, it has to be decided.\n\n[[Page S941]]\n\n  Workers' rights. The Court will decide the impact of the ability of \nthe union to represent millions of working Americans. Whatever side you \nare on, there needs to be a decision, otherwise you are going to have \ndifferent States with different laws and it makes no sense.\n  This is one Nation under God. That is why we have a U.S. Senate and a \nU.S. House and a U.S. President and a U.S. Supreme Court--because we \nare one Nation and these issues have to be decided. There is one on \nemployee discrimination. How do people get their day in court if they \nare being discriminated against? It doesn't matter what side you are \non. The fact is there needs to be a decision.\n  Women's health. There is a big case on women's health as to whether \nworkers can get birth control. Again, whatever side you are on, pro, \ncon, there needs to be a decision.\n  It is about women, health care, voting rights, students. These cases \nhave real consequences. I am going to conclude with one more chart that \ndeals with the length of Supreme Court Justices for the past 35 years. \nHere you see the list of the various nominees. Not all of these made \nit, a couple did not, but here is the deal with these. O'Connor waited \n95 days, Rehnquist 92, Scalia 82, Bork 109, Kennedy 113, Souter 74, \nThomas 110, Ginsburg 137, Breyer 114, Roberts 90, Alito 95, Sotomayor \n97, Kagan 118.\n  Under Mitch McConnell's plan, the Republican plan that they laid out, \nif you averaged all of this, you get 102 days. That is the average it \ntakes. Under McConnell's plan, it would take 444 days, at best. That is \nassuming everything goes perfectly well. It could take a lot longer.\n\n  What does this mean? Anyone within the sound of my voice has heard \nthis: Justice delayed is justice denied. That is a fact. And it is used \nthroughout the country when we talk about the importance of making \nthese decisions. When our constituents go to jury duty, what are they \nasked? Can you make this decision? Can you come to this decision? \nBecause everyone deserves to have an answer.\n  So, in conclusion, take a look at this. This is an abomination. This \nis the number of days we have seen over the last 35 years that it took \nto confirm. Fourteen of our Justices have been confirmed in election \nyears since the beginning of this country, and this takes us back to \nthe Civil War days--imagine--when we really had a country divided.\n  This is not what we need to do right now, with all of these decisions \ncoming up. Regardless of your stand on them, people deserve justice.\n  I will conclude with the ``Do Your Job'' chart because I have to say \nthat is what it comes down to. I urge the people of this great country \nto call the Republicans, every one of them, with three words: Do your \njob. And if the person who answers says ``I don't know what you mean,'' \nsay ``Do your job. Let the process move forward on the Supreme Court \nJustice.'' And if they say ``Well, we want an elected President,'' what \nwill be told to them is ``We are fortunate. We have one, elected not \nonce but twice.'' More than enough time remains for him to do his job, \nand more than enough time remains for us to do ours.\n  Republicans, do your job.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the \nimportance of filling the current vacancy on the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States. I appreciate the words of my colleague from California.\n  I wish to begin by saying that my prayers and thoughts are with the \nfamily and friends and Supreme Court colleagues of Justice Scalia. He \nwas a great scholar who had friends in many places. Just last week I \nwas at the University of Chicago Law School, where I went to law \nschool, and so many people have stories. He used to teach there. He \ntaught there for a long period of time, and they miss him very much.\n  The Supreme Court has the constitutional responsibility to weigh some \nof the most important issues facing the American people. From freedom \nof speech, to due process, to doing business in America, Supreme Court \ndecisions have impacted and continue to impact the daily life of every \ncitizen of this country. As one of the three pillars of our government, \nwe value the Court's distinctive insulation from public opinion. \nJustices commit themselves to the law and to the Constitution and not \nto politics or partisanship.\n  Americans need and deserve to have a functional and fully staffed \nSupreme Court. We cannot delay consideration of the next Supreme Court \nnominee. As my colleague just pointed out, we would have to go back to \nthe Civil War, to a time where a position--an important key position on \nthe Supreme Court of the United States--was left open. We would have to \ngo back to a time when it was left open for more than a year. We would \nhave to go back to a time before we had planes, before we had \nautomobiles, before we had washing machines--you name it. We would have \nto go back to the Civil War.\n  Delaying the confirmation of a new Justice will prevent the Court \nfrom issuing binding precedent and deny access to justice for \nAmericans. Lower courts will be left with decisions, and decisions will \nnot be made in those cases. That is why the Constitution of the United \nStates says that the President shall--shall--nominate someone to the \nSupreme Court. It doesn't say that he will wait for a year. It doesn't \nsay that he can't do it in an election year. It says that he shall \nnominate someone.\n  We have a lot of Members of this great body who are lawyers, a lot of \nwhom I have heard quoting the Constitution. A lot of them believe in \nstrict interpretation of the words of the Constitution. Well, the words \nof the Constitution say that the President ``shall nominate'' and that \nthe Senate's job is to ``advise and consent.'' It says that it is the \nSenate's job. It doesn't say that it is the Senate's job to avoid \nthings and to just go on TV and to run ads. No. It says that the Senate \nhas a job to do. The Senate has a job to do.\n  Both the President and the Senate have a constitutional duty to \nprotect the Supreme Court's ability to function and dispense justice--\nnot to tell the Supreme Court what to do, not to dictate their \ndecisions, but to make sure they are simply able to do justice. This \nmeans they must be fully staffed and have the Justices in place, and it \nalso means they should be funded. Those are our jobs.\n  According to our Constitution, the President replaces vacant seats on \nthe Supreme Court. That duty does not end, as I noted, in a \nPresidential year, just as the responsibilities of all Senators in \ntheir States and in their Nation do not end in an election year.\n  President Obama was elected to serve out his entire second term, not \njust the first 3 years. For 332 long days, the President will be the \ndemocratically elected President of the United States--democratically \nelected, as in a democracy, as in how our democracy functions. He has \nan obligation to all Americans to dutifully execute his oath of office.\n  The President has not yet announced a nominee to fill the current \nvacancy on the Court. When he does, it will be the constitutional duty \nof each one of us to consider the nominee on his or her merits and then \nchoose whether to vote yes or no. It is really not that hard. It is \nwhat the kids learn when they are taught social studies and civics when \nthey are in elementary school. The American people who voted for us, as \nwell as those who didn't vote for us, expect us to do the jobs we were \nelected to do, regardless of the timing.\n  A complete refusal to engage in this constitutionally required \nprocess before the President has even announced a nominee is dangerous \nfor our system of governance. It defies the words of the Constitution. \nThis Chamber would be neglecting a key constitutional duty if it \nprevented a well-qualified nominee from serving on the Supreme Court. \nAnd guess what. How do we figure out if someone is well qualified? We \nhave hearings. That is what we have been doing for decades now. We have \nhearings to figure out whether this person is qualified. That is how we \nadvise. That is how we consent. That is how we do our duty under the \nConstitution.\n  It is for that reason that I urge my colleagues to continue in the \nSenate's bipartisan tradition of giving full and fair consideration to \nSupreme Court nominees. We have precedent for the Senate performing \nthis role in the final year of a Presidency. Most recently,\n\n[[Page S942]]\n\nthe Senate confirmed Justice Kennedy, someone who is currently serving \non the Supreme Court, a current member sitting on the Supreme Court, \nsomeone who makes decisions every day. When was he confirmed? He was \nconfirmed in the last year of Ronald Reagan's Presidency. And guess \nwhat. The Senate was controlled by Democrats. So we had the exact \nopposite situation. Now we have a Democratic President and we have a \nSenate that is in the control of Republicans. Back then we had a \nRepublican President and a Senate that was in the control of Democrats. \nPeople say: Well, what does history show us? What do we know? To me, \nthat is the best example of history. And we know what happened: Justice \nKennedy was confirmed, on Ronald Reagan's nomination, by a Democratic \nSenate in an election year unanimously--unanimously.\n  The Senate has taken such action more than a dozen times in our \nNation's history, and there is no reason to abandon that precedent now. \nI am talking about when a Justice position opens up during an election \nyear. We have that precedent, which I think is important. Again, I \nthink the most important precedent, the most important example for \nhistorians, is what I led with: the fact that we have to go back to the \nCivil War to find a time when we left a vacancy on the Supreme Court \nopen for a year. Think about that. Through World War I, through World \nWar II, through huge tumult in this country, we always made sure we had \na fully staffed Supreme Court.\n  It would be unprecedented to deny a Supreme Court nominee fair \nconsideration in the U.S. Senate. In the last 100 years, the Senate has \ntaken action on every Supreme Court nominee regardless of whether the \nnomination was made in a Presidential year. It is now February, which \ngives us plenty of time to consider and confirm a nominee. Let's go to \nthat next.\n  People say: When will we have the time to get that done? I would \nsubmit that we do. We have hundreds of days before us. In fact, the \nSenate has taken an average of only 67 days. Let's make it easier: 2 \nmonths--about 2 months. That is the average since 1975 from the date of \nthe nomination to the confirmation vote--2 months. That means that if \nthe President offers a nomination, say, in the month of March--that \nsounds like a good month to have a nominee--that nominee would receive \na vote in the Senate by Memorial Day. There are our 2 months. And if we \neven wanted to add a little time on, we would certainly do it by the \nFourth of July, which is a very good holiday for those who believe in \nthe Constitution and in the words of the Constitution.\n  Until we confirm a nominee, the Court is left with only eight \nJustices. A split decision will prevent the Supreme Court from making \ncritical decisions and leave lower courts without a precedent to \nfollow. A major responsibility of the Supreme Court is to resolve \ndisagreements among lower courts. A failure of the President or the \nSenate to meet its constitutional obligations would cause the Supreme \nCourt to be unable to fill its constitutional obligations.\n  These Supreme Court Justices aren't elected directly; they have \nlifetime appointments. Their job is to be insulated from elections and \npolitics, and that is why we have these strict and straightforward \nwords in the Constitution that say that the President shall nominate \nsomeone for the job, and they also say that the Senate will advise and \nconsent. We have those words in place in the Constitution, in that \nincredibly important document that guides us in this Chamber every \nsingle day, just for a situation such as this one, just for situations \nsuch as these.\n  In closing, I remind my colleagues of the important work the people \nhave sent us here to do. Yes, we have major disputes every day. That \nhappens every day. We get into arguments about issues. There are \npolitical campaigns going on. But we have always at least followed the \nConstitution. That is what this is about today.\n  As soon as we have a nominee, as soon as the President exercises his \nconstitutional duty and puts someone in place, we should follow the \nConstitution and our longstanding traditions and the history of this \ncountry and uphold that duty. We should diligently consider the \nPresident's nominee to be the next Supreme Court Justice. As members of \nthe Judiciary Committee, we must have the confirmation hearing. We must \ndo our jobs.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I am here to talk about Takata airbags, \nbut I want to say to the Senator from Minnesota that she is so right \non. The Constitution, article II, says that the President ``shall \nnominate'' and the Senate ``shall confirm.'' It doesn't say ``may'' or \n``wish.'' It says ``shall.'' It is a constitutional responsibility of \nour duties.\n  Just do your job, U.S. Senate. Just do the job, and we will see, once \nthe President comes forward with a nominee. Let's see. Are we going to \nhave committee hearings? Let's see if we are going to have open and \nbipartisan discussion on the merits of the nominee that is put forth. \nLet's see if the Constitution is trashed or whether the Constitution is \nupheld in the process put out to us in the third branch of government. \nI thank the Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                             Takata Airbags\n\n  Mr. President, I came here to speak about something else--something \nthat looks very sinister. As a matter of fact, I ask unanimous consent \nto have two items to show to the Senate with regard to the Takata \nairbag crisis.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. It looks kind of sinister, unfortunately, because it is. \nIt is supposed to save lives, not kill. This is an airbag. It obviously \nhas already been inflated. It goes right in the steering wheel, so when \nyou get in an accident, this inflates and fills up with gas within a \nsplit second, and that protects your head and your torso from coming \nforward and being injured.\n  What happens if this malfunctions, and what happens if the very \nmanufacture of it causes it to malfunction under conditions? Let me \nshow you what happens.\n  I said these things look pretty sinister. Indeed, this is pretty \nsinister because this is a fragment that was in the metal casing in one \nof these airbags in Florida that, when it malfunctioned, caused the \nexplosive force of the ammonium nitrate gas. It was so explosive that \nit ripped apart the metal casing, and this part that I am showing came \nflying into the face of the driver, severely injuring the driver. In \nthis case it hit the forehead.\n  I have told the Senate on many occasions that fragments of metal like \nthis have come out just within the Orlando area of my State. They found \na woman in the middle of an intersection where she had a collision, and \nwhen the police arrived, they found out that she was dead. She had bled \nto death. They looked at her neck and it was slashed. The police's \nimmediate response was that this was a homicide. Upon reflection, she \nhad a collision in the intersection that otherwise would have been a \nmajor fender bender, but because of a defective Takata airbag, it sent \na piece of metal like this into her neck and cut her jugular vein.\n  Near Orlando, a firefighter--a big, strapping, 6-foot-4 hunk of a \nman--doesn't have an eye anymore because a piece of metal fragment like \nthis one from a Takata airbag came out when there was nothing more than \na fender bender. When this bag exploded, it sent out a piece of metal. \nIn his case, that firefighter doesn't have the sight in one eye because \nthis piece of metal fragment hit him.\n  Unfortunately, this has happened all over the country. Unfortunately, \nit has happened with a great deal of, shall we say, dragging of feet, \ncoverup, and obfuscation. These airbags are supposed to save lives, but \nwhen they fail, they rupture violently and they send metal fragments \nright at the driver or the passenger.\n  These Takata airbags have such an explosive force. What is behind it? \nWell, our staff on the Commerce Committee has just produced a report \nwhich this Senator is releasing today. It is an update on this report \nwhich found, through a review of recently obtained internal documents \nin the Takata Corporation, that Takata employees routinely manipulated \nsafety testing data. That would be bad enough, but let's see the \nconsequence of this drip, drip, drip approach to now a substantial \nnumber of recalls. There\n\n[[Page S943]]\n\nwere a million vehicles recalled in 1 week, a million more the next, \nand there is no end in sight.\n  A few days ago, there was a Reuters report that said that in addition \nto the already 20-plus million recalls of Takata airbags, an additional \n70 to 90 million Takata airbags may have to be recalled right here in \nthe United States. Can you imagine what that is going to do to all \nthese poor auto dealers? I mean, don't even speak about the person who \nis in the greatest jeopardy, the one who is behind the wheel of a car \nwith an explosive grenade right in front of their face, and the grenade \nmay go off. But can you imagine the poor auto dealers, the Toyotas, the \nHondas?\n  Let me tell you about the last person killed. He was in a Ford F-150 \npickup truck, and it was in South Carolina. By the time people got to \nthe truck after the crash that would not have killed him, he was dead \nbecause of a fragment like this. I wish you could see this fragment. I \nwouldn't want that hitting me with an explosive force that inflates the \nairbag in less than 1 second. That is why the Commerce Committee has \ndecided to jump all over this. We have been doing it for the last 2 \nyears. We had a hearing on this 2 years ago.\n  On the current recall, I said it was in excess of 20 million. It is \nactually 29 million with these defective inflators. That is because \nnine people are dead and dozens are injured. We find out now that in \nall, there may be 120 million airbags that eventually in the United \nStated alone will have to be recalled. If you want a shocking figure, \nthere may be in excess of 260 million airbags recalled worldwide.\n  Knowing of all these problems, it is puzzling that the consent order \nthat the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration signed with \nTakata allows the continued production of ammonium nitrate-based \ninflators indefinitely. Then they said that certain ones had to be \nphased out by 2018. Why isn't the NHTSA taking a more aggressive \napproach? What is going on after all of these inflators, based on what \nwe see with ammonium nitrate, have exploded?\n  The essence of this and of the report we are releasing today as an \naddendum to the previous report is that the current recall may have to \nbe redone. Why? Because auto manufacturers are installing new live \ngrenades into people's cars as replacements for the old live grenades.\n  According to Reuters and the New York Times, there are also internal \ndocuments that show Takata officials were aware of these consistent \nproblems at its manufacturing plants. These reports claim that \nofficials knew of manufacturing issues that could lead to moisture \ncontamination, contaminating the ammonium nitrate wafer inside of the \nairbag inflator. This just adds all the more to the finding of \nevidence.\n  Last June, the oversight and investigations staff of the Commerce \nCommittee released a report on the Takata airbag fiasco showing that \nthe company knew there were serious production and testing issues \ndating back more than one decade. That is why we wanted to release this \nreport today. Through a thorough review of recently obtained internal \ndocuments at Takata, it was discovered that Takata employees \ncontinually manipulated the safety testing done. For example, in this \nreport, in a 2005 memo to the Takata vice president, an engineer at \nTakata explained that ``the integrity of the validation reports . . . \nis in serious question.''\n  That engineer continued: ``These are not trivial changes in that the \ndata clearly in violation of the customer specs is altered to meet the \ncustomer specs.'' The engineer called that ``a clear misrepresentation \nof the facts.''\n  That is what the Takata engineer said to one of the Takata vice \npresidents back in 2005. That was 11 years ago.\n  In a 2006 email, a different engineering manager explained that \ntesting reports were ``cherry picked'' and a Takata employee was \n``schmoozed'' to accept deviations in the data.\n  So was he schmoozed or intimidated? Whatever it was, it was altering \nwhat was the truth. The manager concluded--this is the Takata manager \nin 2006, which was 10 years ago--that ``the plant should have been \nscreaming bloody murder long ago.''\n  Well, if I were a lawyer making a case to a jury, I would rest my \ncase right now. The fact is, we are not lawyers arguing to a jury. As \nSenators, we are here to try to protect the American people. And this \ndata manipulation has continued. Even after the recalls had been \nannounced and the rupturing inflators had caused deaths and injuries, \nthe data manipulation continued.\n  I will give an example. A 2010 presentation explains that an \nexperimental inflator was experiencing a significant safety and weld \nquality issue. According to that presentation, ``[Takata Japan] was \ninformed of these results, but altered them and reported good results \nto Honda.'' Furthermore, even when these issues were raised to senior \nTakata employees, no action was taken.\n  In a Takata director's notes from 2013, he explains that he shared \nhis view that the range of a certain recall might be a ``violation of \nour moral obligation to protect the public.'' Let me repeat that. A \n``violation of our moral obligation to protect the public''--that came \nfrom a Takata director. Wow.\n  The engineer raised these concerns with Takata's senior vice \npresident of quality assurance, but the vice president failed to take \naction to address it.\n  These new documents that we note in this report from the committee \nspeak for themselves. Takata failed to prioritize the safety of its \nproducts, and as a result, nine people are dead and dozens were \ninjured. And even after exploding Takata airbags killed these innocent \npeople, company employees continued to manipulate safety testing data. \nThis is not only inexcusable, it is reprehensible.\n  We have these thousands of automobile dealers around the country who \nhave sold vehicles with the Takata airbags. They cannot sell a new \nvehicle if that vehicle is under recall because of a Takata airbag. \nUnder law, they cannot sell that new vehicle. Also, rental car \ncompanies that have more than 15 cars cannot rent cars if they are \nunder recall. But used car dealers can sell used cars that have a \ndefective Takata airbags in them that is under recall--without fixing \nit.\n  I really feel for our automobile dealers. I really feel for our \nautomobile dealers also because what in the world are they going to do \nwith the customers now screaming ``Replace this airbag'' when, in fact, \nthere are not enough replacement airbags? In fact, because the National \nHighway Transportation Safety Administration has allowed some of these \nreplacements to go in with this ammonium nitrate, this is a horrendous \nsituation.\n  So I come to the floor today--this has been going on for over 2 \nyears. We brought this out in a hearing in the Senate Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation Committee. And today I urge Takata and \nNHTSA to do what should have been done long ago: Stop producing these \nammonium nitrate airbags and get them out of people's vehicles. And by \nthe way, give your automobile dealers some relief. And how about giving \nthe American driving public, which is driving around with one of these \nthings in their face, some consideration and put them first? Hopefully, \nwe will see some more action on this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may \nproceed for 15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          GUANTANAMO DETAINEES\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about President \nObama's plan to move Guantanamo Bay terrorists to the United States. \nHowever, it is not much of a plan. With all due respect, it is more of \na failed attempt to fulfill a campaign promise and, in my view, what he \nbelieves will secure his legacy.\n  Fortunately for us--those who believe that moving dangerous enemy \ncombatants within our communities is dangerous, irresponsible, and an \nillogical idea--the President's plan contains nothing really \nsubstantive. In fact, it fails to recommend an alternative location to \nany current facility at all. As a matter of fact, I call that a win.\n  The plan does not provide any intelligence to substantiate the \nPresident's claims, nor does it even provide a chart or a graph to \nsupport the mathematics on the alleged cost savings, and there is no \nestimate regarding the cost to\n\n[[Page S944]]\n\nlocal and State governments to support such a move. Indeed, the 9-page \nreport is short in every regard.\n  The White House received the Department of Defense's results of their \nsite surveys and other data regarding a potential closing last month. \nAnd this--I am holding up the report here--this is all we have in \nreturn: 9 pages.\n  I know the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, my good \nfriend and colleague, Senator John McCain, is not going to be pleased \nwith the lack of substance or data or the articulation of a real plan. \nThe same goes for Senator Richard Burr, chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee, who at this particular time is going to be introducing \nlegislation of his own to provide intelligence with regard to the \nadministration's lack of intelligence on moving detainees to the United \nStates.\n  The lack of a plan and the inability of this administration to \nprovide an alternative site indicate that none of the sites visited by \nDOD's survey team met the demands necessary to hold detainees and, more \nimportant, keep our community safe. The fact that no site was named and \nno substance on those visits was provided tells me there is no \nalternative to match what we are now doing safely and securely at \nGitmo, period.\n  This so-called plan, as outlined by the President in his speech today \nfrom the White House, skims over four steps to closing Guantanamo Bay.\n  First, it articulates the administration's plan to continue moving \ndetainees designated for transfer by the President's national security \nteam to foreign countries.\n  In some instances, this may have been successful with regard to \nindividuals being rehabilitated, but a third of the time, detainees \ntransferred to third-party host countries have returned to the \nbattlefield. And these are just the ones we know about. This is called \nrecidivism, and the rates are too high for this process to be called \n``secure and responsible,'' as the administration has labeled it.\n  Second, the administration plans to continue its review of the threat \nposed by those detainees who are not currently eligible for transfer \nthrough the Periodic Review Board.\n  This is to provide a new review on the current population of \ndetainees who have been deemed too dangerous to transfer--deemed too \ndangerous to transfer, and yet this President wants to give them a \nsecond shot at getting out. This doesn't make any sense. Terrorists are \nnot criminals. As much as this President would like for you to believe \nthey are, terrorists are not equal to the inmates we have across \nAmerica's prison system. They are fixated on the destruction of \nAmerica. They have no regard for life, not that of their own and \nespecially not the lives of innocent civilians.\n  The report hones in on having a detainee population anywhere from 30 \nto 60. There seems to be an assumption on the part of the President \nthat the review board will determine that half of those deemed too \ndangerous for transfer or release are suddenly safe for transfer or \nrelease. Does the President believe this is possible or does this \nassumption simply serve his own means to create cost savings for his \nplan that can never be realized?\n  The plan also fails to account for the fact that our Nation is still \nmired in the War on Terrorism. We are still fighting in the Middle East \nand worldwide, including the United States of America, to ensure that \nterrorism does not prevail. What about the individuals we detain from \nthis day forward? What about those individuals with critical \ninformation related to the next terrorist threat? How can we operate \nwithout a facility like Guantanamo Bay to hold terrorists we take off \nthe battlefield?\n  Third, the plan attempts to identify individual dispositions, one by \none, for those who remain designated for continued law of war \ndetention, to include Article III, military commissions, or foreign \nprosecutions. What a muddle.\n  In his remarks today, President Obama advocated for trying terrorist \nsuspects in Article III courts. The President named two American \ncitizens--Faisal Shahzad and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev--to articulate his \npoint. Both of those individuals, however, were apprehended in the \nUnited States, not on the battlefield.\n  The intent of the Guantanamo detention facility is to protect the \nAmerican people by removing terrorists from the battlefield. As the \nUnited States faces a growing threat from terrorist organizations, such \nas ISIS, which have tens of thousands of members, bringing those \nterrorists to the United States to stand trial simply cannot be the \nanswer. It is not safe for the American people and irresponsible to our \nnational security.\n  Fourth, the plan states the administration's desire to ``work with \nCongress to lift unnecessary prohibitions in current law.'' That is in \nquotes, ``work with Congress.''\n  Well, there is something that is unique with the President, ``work \nwith Congress to lift unnecessary prohibitions in current law.'' But it \ndoes not anywhere in its nine pages endorse a specific facility to \nhouse Guantanamo detainees; rather, the plan describes a prototype for \na detention facility in the United States--not Kansas, not Colorado, \nnot South Carolina, not anywhere in the United States.\n  The President's long-awaited plan is to work with Congress to \nidentify the most appropriate location as soon as possible, according \nto the summary provided to my office by the Department of Defense. \nQuestion: How could it take 7 years to arrive at the idea to work with \nCongress? What a novel idea, but only for this express purpose. If the \nPresident had a suitable alternative, he would have provided it in this \nplan. If he had a suitable alternative, he would have provided it in \n2009 when we stopped his plan the first time.\n\n  Further, the plan fails to substantiate President Obama's repeated \nclaims that Guantanamo Bay serves as a recruiting tool for jihadists. \nLet me repeat this. The plan fails to substantiate President Obama's \nrepeated claims that Guantanamo Bay serves as a recruiting tool for \njihadists, a rallying point for terrorist attacks, hindering relations \nwith allies, and draining Department of Defense resources. My goodness.\n  I wrote Defense Secretary Ash Carter in November to ask for \nintelligence reports or data to support many of these assertions. I \nasked Secretary Carter if an intelligence assessment has been done in \nconjunction with the site surveys recently conducted by the Department \nof Defense from the safety of our community's standpoint. I asked for \nthe Department's rationale for evaluating Fort Leavenworth, when three \nprevious evaluations have made it abundantly clear it is and continues \nto be an unacceptable alternative. I asked if there were intelligence \nproducts regarding previous site evaluations at Fort Leavenworth.\n  The administration has argued that Guantanamo is a recruiting tool \nfor terrorists. So I logically asked for an intelligence assessment to \nsupport that argument. As a follow on, I asked what assessment had been \ndone to reflect that Guantanamo has increased terrorist recruitment. \nAnd finally, was there any empirical data to support the \nadministration's argument that national security threats will decrease \nif enemy combatants are held in the United States? Common sense will \ntell you that it would increase.\n  Two months later, the response confirmed my assumptions. The \nDepartment of Defense had no intelligence products--none. There were no \nintelligence products, no data to provide to support the President's \nargument that GTMO serves as a recruiting tool and that moving \ndetainees to the mainland would increase security and decrease the \nterrorist threat to the United States.\n  My colleagues, this plan really confirms what many of us already \nknow: There is no safe alternative to GTMO--not in Kansas, not in \nColorado, not in South Carolina. Nowhere on the mainland is there a \nsecure and responsible alternative. If there were, this President would \nnot have failed to articulate it in his plan.\n  Mr. President, a plan that is a legacy speech does not safeguard the \nlives of the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are postcloture on the nomination.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I wish to speak on the nomination of the Food and Drug \nAdministration, Dr. Robert Califf.\n\n[[Page S945]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I believe the FDA needs new leadership, a \nnew focus and a new culture, and Dr. Robert Califf's past involvement \nwith the pharmaceutical industry reflects that he will not be this \nperson. He will not have the impact or leadership capabilities the \nNation needs to stem the tide of the opioid crisis we have all over \nthis country, even in your great State of Oklahoma and my State of West \nVirginia, which has been ravaged by this. I would like to put this in \ncontext for a little bit. He has been there over a year--a good man. I \nam not speaking about his ability, his honesty, his integrity, his \neducation, his background, and all the good work he has done. But he \nhas been there for a year, and for the past 20 years Dr. Califf \nbasically has come from the institutional research side, from \neducation, and with that, his support has come from the pharmaceutical \nindustries, those that are putting opioids on the market. I just feel \nit would be hard, human naturewise, for him to change and rule to keep \nthese products from coming onto the market. So to put this in context, \nthis is not personally about Dr. Califf. This is about the culture he \ncomes from and the year he has been there as the No. 2 man and what has \nhappened during that period of time.\n  Let me go over some things. Over the last decade, the FDA has \napproved new drugs at historically high rates. In 2008, companies \nfiling applications to sell never-before-marketed drugs were denied 66 \npercent of the time. They were denied 66 percent of the time. Yet \nbetween the beginning of 2015 and August of 2015, the FDA rejected only \n3 uses for new chemical entities and approved 25. That is an approval \nrate of 89 percent.\n  Now, tell me how in 7 short years that culture changed to where \nanything and everything coming at us was passed through, when we have \nalready become the most addicted country on Earth. If one looks at new \ndrugs and not the use of drugs, they have rejected only 1 and approved \n23. That is a 96-percent approval rate in 2015. So of the new drugs \nthat came to the market, only 1 was rejected--a 96-percent approval \nrate.\n  In 2008, the FDA's approval of new marketing claims for existing \ndrugs was 56 percent. In the first 8 months of 2015, it was 88 percent. \nThis includes approving OxyContin for children as young as 11. The \nFDA's 2013 approval of Zohydro drew widespread concern. All of us were \noutraged when we heard this new drug came on the market.\n  To put another time period in context, I had worked for 3 years to \ntry to get all opioids from a schedule III to a schedule II so doctors \ncould prescribe only for 30 days. You had to go back and see your \ndoctor. Up until that time, Vicodin and Lortab--the two most widely \nprescribed opioids--were schedule III. That means you could get a 90-\nday prescription and then call in to get it refilled. They were going \nout like M\n  We were able to do that, and no sooner did we get that done--and it \ntook 3 years, when it should have been 3 weeks. Within the same week \nthat all opioids got to us from a schedule III to a schedule II, they \napproved a new drug called Zohydro, which was 10 times more powerful \nthan Vicodin or Lortab--much more powerful. That approval was done \nagainst their advisory committee 11 to 2. That means 13 experts \nevaluated this drug and said: It is not needed, too powerful, don't do \nit. Guess what, they did it anyway.\n  Now they are saying that they are not going to pay attention to the \nadvisory committee. Not only did they say they are not going to pay \nattention to the advisory committee, but we have had the decision on \nOxyContin being given to 11-year-old children; we have had the two new \ndrugs that came out in 2014 after Zohydro and the pushback from \nSenators representing our respective States; they had a new drug called \nTarginiq, which is an extended-release OxyContin product, and Hysingla, \nwhich is an extended-release hydrocodone product.\n  So there were three new decisions made, with two new powerful opioids \ncoming to the market and the decision that OxyContin would be given to \n11-year-olds. That was done without any review from the advisory \ncommittee. They got so much pushback from Zohydro, they said: We are \nnot going down this path again. We will just not have anybody review \nit. We will just go ahead and do it.\n  If you believe that is a culture that will protect the welfare and \nwell-being of our citizens in our States all through this great country \nof ours, then I am sorry because I don't. I am sorry, but that is why I \nhave been so passionate. I have more people dying of legal prescription \ndrug abuse than anything else in the State of West Virginia. More \npeople die. It is ravaging families.\n  I have personal letters I will read, and they will tear your heart \nout with what is happening and how this grips and tears people apart. \nIt tears communities apart. Every law enforcement agency in America \nwill tell you--no matter what town they are in, what county they are \nin, or what State they are in--that over 80 percent and upward of 95 \npercent of all crimes committed are drug related, are some sort of drug \nrelated.\n  There is not one of us right now in this beautiful Senate Chamber \nthat doesn't know somebody in our immediate family or Senate family \nthat hasn't been affected by drugs, either prescription legal drugs or \nillegal drugs. It is awful. It is an epidemic.\n  I believe the FDA must break its cozy relationship with the \npharmaceutical industry and instead start a relationship with the \nmillions of Americans. I have said that I am going to fight against the \nFDA protecting a business plan and hopefully the culture will change, \nand they will start protecting America and the plan of families and \ncitizens of this great country to have a healthy lifestyle.\n\n  It is because of this belief that I am urging my colleagues to vote \nagainst the confirmation of Dr. Robert Califf as the director of the \nFood and Drug Administration. He will still be there and still be a \nvaluable person. He is just not that person with the passion to change \nthe culture in this important agency. We have let this sleeping giant \ngo for far too long.\n  My office has been absolutely flooded, Mr. President, with stories \nfrom West Virginians--but I have received them from all over the \ncountry--who want their voices to be heard. They say: Please use my \nname. I am not ashamed. We have been hiding too long. I have watched \ntoo many people's lives be destroyed. So today I will read letters not \nonly from West Virginians but also people across this great country of \nours that have been impacted by the opioid abuse epidemic.\n  I urge my colleagues to listen to these letters from their States and \nstories from my State about these drugs before confirming Dr. Califf, \nand in all good conscience make that decision tomorrow when we vote. Do \nyou really believe he can bring the changes needed and not just say: \nWell, we have to have somebody there. He is already there. He will do a \ngood job where he is; he is just not going to be able to kick them and \nshake them up and say we are not going down this path any more. There \nare some good people. We have made some recommendations of some good \npeople who would bring the cultural changes that need to be brought.\n  I am going to read first about a young lady from Southern West \nVirginia. Her name is Chelsea. This is her story.\n\n       As a recovering addict, I have watched myself, my friends, \n     and loved ones suffer from this horrible thing we call \n     addiction. As I watch all these people now suffering, I know \n     they had no idea what they were getting themselves into, and \n     neither did I.\n       Whether it be for pain or just simply hanging with the \n     wrong people like I did, we all have one thing in common, we \n     chose to do drugs for the first time.\n\n  Someone made a decision to do drugs for the first time.\n\n       Growing up, I can honestly say I had what most people would \n     call a normal childhood.\n\n  Chelsea comes from an upper socioeconomic family in Southern West \nVirginia. She continues:\n\n       I was raised by two hardworking parents who would and will \n     still do anything for me. I was a gymnast and a cheerleader \n     for most of my life and went to church every Wednesday and \n     Sunday. My dad was even the Mayor of Madison at one point. \n     But even being raised up in a good home did not stop me from \n     doing drugs.\n\n  So this has no socioeconomic bearing. It does not. It is not a \npartisan issue. Whether you are a Democrat or\n\n[[Page S946]]\n\nRepublican, it makes no difference. Rich or poor makes no difference. \nChelsea continues:\n\n       I can still remember the first time I heard about someone \n     getting high. I was in the 6th grade and became friends with \n     a girl whose parents got high themselves. We would walk about \n     the playground and she would talk of these things called \n     ``drugs.'' As she talked day in and day out about how getting \n     high made her feel, it made me start to wonder what this \n     thing called ``getting high'' was really about.\n\n  Now, mind you, I am talking about a 12-year-old girl. She was just 12 \nyears old.\n\n       I can remember thinking how cool I thought it was that her \n     parents had done drugs with her and would party with her.\n\n  So another friend of hers, also 12 years old, had parents who were \ndoing drugs with her and would party with her.\n  Chelsea continues:\n\n       One weekend I went to her house to stay the night and this \n     was the first time I had gotten high. We smoked some pot, \n     drank some alcohol, and I was turned on to my first pill \n     around the age of 12. From this day forward, my life would \n     forever be changed.\n       From the ages twelve to fifteen I partied some on the \n     weekends and sometimes during the week, but as time went on \n     my addiction and tolerance grew more and more. By this time, \n     I was doing more pills because I had access to them. Between \n     stealing Lortabs off my dad, to hanging with that girl so we \n     could get high with her dad, to buying pills off the local \n     drug dealer on the street, I had moved from doing them every \n     now and then to every day.\n       I would stay a lot of weekends at this girl's house just to \n     get high because my parents would never have done that nor \n     did they know I was doing it. By sixteen my life took another \n     turn. My grandmother, who I called Nana, had taken care of \n     me most of my life while my mother worked. She was \n     diagnosed with lung cancer two years prior. In the last \n     days of her life, I would visit her in the hospital and \n     she would tell me how proud she was of me and how I was \n     her little model.\n       I had also met a very special guy by the name of J.R. a few \n     months before this who I spent a lot of time with. On July \n     18, 2003, my Nana passed away. On the day of her wake, J.R. \n     took me out to dinner, and on the way home he asked me to go \n     meet his dad. I explained to him I could not and that my \n     grandma's funeral was the next day.\n       He dropped me off that night, kissed me good-bye, and that \n     was the last time I ever heard from J.R. Twenty minutes after \n     he left me, he wrecked and died. I felt like my heart had \n     been ripped out of my chest.\n       The day of his funeral is the next time I met the love of \n     my life that would soon try to destroy my life. It was called \n     OxyContin. I fell in love immediately with OxyContin. It took \n     all of my cares and worries away, and from that moment on all \n     I wanted to do was be numb.\n       As the years passed, my drug addiction grew worse. I was \n     not only doing pain pills, I was now experimenting with all \n     kinds of other things.\n       I can still remember my senior week in high school. While \n     everyone was excited about going to the beach, I had to make \n     sure I had enough drugs to go and not be sick. I took Roxy's \n     and Oxy's, pretty much anything I could get my hands on, and \n     eight balls of cocaine.\n       By this time in my life I didn't care about anything. It \n     never once had crossed my mind that if I got caught with all \n     of that I could go to jail. I was just worried about my next \n     high.\n       The following months were the same. I was doing anything I \n     could to get my hands on drugs, from pain pills to cocaine to \n     meth. I did not care as long as I was high. I was hanging \n     around with people who were as sick as I was and places that \n     I look back now that I would not even take my dog.\n       At 19 I met a guy who would fuel my drug addiction even \n     more. He was 40 years old and dealt OxyContin. At this point \n     I could not afford my habit, so I did what I had to do. I \n     started seeing my drug dealer.\n       My life soon went from bad to worse. I had OxyContin 80s \n     any time I wanted them, and at the time I thought life can't \n     get any better than this. When you are doing eight to ten \n     OxyContin 80s a day, you will do whatever it takes to get \n     them.\n       At this point I was turned on to heroin. Heroin would have \n     taken my life if it hadn't scared me so much. The high from \n     heroin is so intense that anyone who had done it would have \n     fallen in love. But, actually, it scared the life out of me.\n       As time passed and I wasn't getting high like I wanted to \n     anymore from snorting OxyContin, I decided to start shooting \n     up. That is one thing I never thought I would do is shoot up. \n     I always told myself that people who shot up were the \n     homeless people on the streets, complete and utter trash.\n       Now here I was sticking a needle in my arm to get what I \n     wanted. And to be honest, I thought life was bad before. It \n     just got a whole lot worse. The life I was and the life that \n     I knew was gone, and OxyContin was completely ruling my life \n     now.\n\n  OxyContin is a legal drug made by a legal pharmaceutical that knew \nexactly the effects this would have when they put this on the market \nover 20 years ago.\n  She said:\n\n       What stood before everyone was pure addiction.\n       I had started stealing off of everyone by now and didn't \n     care who I hurt. People's priceless possessions that meant so \n     much to them meant nothing to me. All I'd seen was my next \n     fix. That's all I could see.\n       People were bringing me stolen stuff and I was taking it to \n     the nearest pawn shop or my drug dealer. I had no shame. I \n     had needle marks all up and down my arms, and I would lie to \n     my family about how they got there. It was like I had no \n     conscience, or, better yet, my addiction was my conscience.\n       Eventually I got caught stealing and was charged with 17 \n     different felonies and one misdemeanor. This still did not \n     slow me down even though I was looking at two to 20 years in \n     prison. Nothing scared me more than being sick from the \n     drugs.\n       On September 29, 2008, I was called in for a random drug \n     test and failed because I had shot up OxyContin the day \n     before. At the courthouse they handcuffed me and shackled me \n     and sent me to Southwestern Regional Jail where I did a total \n     of 10 days. As I sat there in that jail cell and cried, I \n     thought a pill could not be worth two to 20 years of my life, \n     and I hit my knees and prayed to God that if He brought me \n     out of that jail cell, that I would never, ever, ever touch \n     drugs again. The Lord answered my prayer and the judge gave \n     me the choice to stay in jail or go to the Life Center of \n     Galax, in Galax, Virginia.\n       I chose to go to rehab. I completed the 30-day program and \n     came back and did Thomas Memorial's intense outpatient \n     program for 6 more weeks. Once I got home I was sentenced to \n     two to 20 years, but they suspended my sentence. I went \n     through drug court and completed it. I was the third person \n     to ever graduate from the Lincoln County Drug Court.\n       I also had to do 14 more days in jail, 6 months of home \n     confinement, and 4 years' probation. I can honestly say that \n     going to jail and rehab saved my life. If I hadn't have been \n     put in jail, I would probably be 6 feet in the ground just \n     like a lot of my friends that I had to bury.\n       All of these things combined gave me something I hold very \n     dear to my heart. My recovery. Recovery has not only given my \n     life back. It has given me a chance to be a daughter, a \n     sister, a wife, and hopefully a mother someday, a productive \n     member of society, a good friend, but most of all, my \n     recovery has given me a chance to be the voice of the sick \n     and suffering addicts who lay in bed at night wondering if \n     there is a way out.\n       I enjoy giving people hope and showing them that treatment \n     does work. I am living proof that if you work the program of \n     recovery, it will work for you. Since that day I had found \n     myself sitting in that jail cell with no hope and my life \n     completely consumed by my addiction, my life has changed for \n     the better. I have graduated with an Associate's Degree in \n     applied science from Southern West Virginia Community \n     Technical College.\n       I went on to get my Bachelor's degree in the arts of \n     psychology from West Virginia State University, and now I am \n     currently working on my Masters of Social Work degree at \n     Concord University, and I will graduate with that degree in \n     May.\n       I have also been able to go to various schools, drug \n     courts, and different places around the state to tell my \n     story of addiction from where I was then to where I am now. I \n     have also had the pleasure of working with a great group of \n     people who are trying to get a sober living home open in \n     Danville, West Virginia called the Hero House.\n\n  I can tell you, she is so passionate about getting this Hero House so \nshe can help other people. Anybody listening who wants to help Chelsea \nin Danville, WV, with the Hero House, please do so or contact my \noffice.\n\n       Now, with all this being said, I don't tell my story to get \n     praise. I tell my story because there is a son, a daughter, a \n     husband, a father, a wife, and many, many other people out \n     there addicted to drugs and they do not see a light at the \n     end of the tunnel.\n       When you are in active addiction, that light is so dim and \n     a lot of times people think they are going to die from this \n     horrible disease. But I am here to show people that you don't \n     have to die. You don't have to let that horrible addiction \n     win. You can step out and take your life back, because I am \n     here to tell you that if you don't, if you don't, your \n     addiction is going to take you to your grave.\n       Drugs do not discriminate. They know no good, no bad, no \n     rich, no poor. There are so many people out there who suffer \n     from this because there is little to no treatment.\n       By the grace of God I was sent to rehab and given a second \n     chance. I still have the horrible reminders every day of the \n     things I did to my family, to my body, and, most of all, to \n     my self-esteem.\n       I have the track marks after being 7 years sober that \n     constantly remind me of the life I once lived. I have a poor \n     self-image because of the men I chose to give myself to just \n     to get a pill, and the damage I did to my family because I \n     had no cares in the world.\n       One day I hope there is enough treatment to help the \n     addicts who want help. People need to be given a second \n     chance and shown there is a better way of life than to do \n     drugs.\n\n\n[[Page S947]]\n\n\n  I have another story called Tami's story, but I know Chelsea. I know \nthis girl. She is impressive. She said: Please tell my story, I want \npeople to know. No one could come from a finer family than I came from. \nNo one can go lower than I have gone, and no one but by the grace of \nGod could be saved like I was.\n  When we hear these stories--and all she is saying is there is no \ntreatment. She was lucky. She found a treatment center. Somehow we have \nto come to grips with this. We have a tax on tobacco because we know it \nis harmful and we have to cure people of the disease. We have a tax on \nalcohol. We have no fee whatsoever on opiates--none--and it is \ndestroying lives like nothing else that has ever happened in this \ncountry. We need to make people conscious of this, and we need to have \nan FDA that is compassionate, but not only that, is committed to the \nchange that needs to be made in our culture.\n  I want to read Tami's story, from West Virginia. That is in the \nnorthern panhandle. Chelsea was way down in the southern part of our \nState of West Virginia.\n\n       We have 2 adult children suffering from substance use \n     disorder.\n       Our son entered the military while in college. He was sent \n     to Iraq right after 9/11, December 27, 2001. He experienced \n     things that he never talked about, celebrated his 21st \n     birthday there, and returned home. He was not a saint when he \n     went to war. He had a juvenile past of drinking. Back then we \n     thought he was a typical teenager acting out. When he \n     returned, he suffered PTSD, as many do, and went to the VA \n     hospital for treatment. He was put on cocktail after cocktail \n     of medications.\n\n  We all know this. We all know that basically these brave men and \nwomen who are willing to risk their lives and sacrifice their lives for \nus--in order to treat their pain, we think, just give them a \nprescription, and they are able to get anything and everything. That is \nwhat they are talking about when he was put on cocktail after cocktail \nof medications--was this his starting point of the spiral into \naddiction?\n\n       I believe his addiction to opioids, benzoids, and \n     amphetamines started then. I know that he spiraled from that \n     point on. He lost his marriage, he didn't see his son, he \n     bounced from drugs to drugs to drugs. He obtained several \n     DUIs, and time after time he walked away, no offer of help, \n     no sentencing. He bounced, married again. She was addicted to \n     heroin. He bounced again, was in and out of our house. \n     Unfortunately, we always gave him a safe place to land.\n\n  She said: ``Unfortunately,''--not fortunately but unfortunately--``we \nalways gave him a safe place to land.''\n\n       The last time I saw him is when I called the police on him. \n     I discovered that him and his girlfriend, with two small \n     children, who had been living in our house for four months \n     were using and selling drugs. I found out he was recently \n     incarcerated for drug traffic and sent to a correctional \n     rehabilitation facility.\n       Our daughter was an athlete all through school. She \n     received injury after injury, and at 18 started seeing \n     specialists for back pain. That was in 2004. They prescribed \n     opiates. I never saw the addiction coming. She lost her best \n     friend since first grade that year to a drunk driving \n     accident. She went to counseling. More prescriptions.\n       She appeared fine, gave birth to a beautiful baby boy, and \n     then because of back pain more pain prescriptions were given. \n     I realized she had a problem when she was pregnant with her \n     second child and was stepped down to Vicodin while pregnant.\n\n  Vicodin while pregnant.\n\n       After his birth, we started her first rehab experience. She \n     returned to the father of her children sober. She relapsed \n     and began snorting heroin.\n       At this time she was living in Ohio and we were unaware of \n     her relapse. We found out when her mother-in-law went to \n     court and took her children. That was one of the worst days \n     of all of our lives. We immediately picked her up, brought \n     her back to West Virginia, and into treatment.\n       Fast forward. Thousands of dollars later on attorneys, \n     doctors, rehab, she returns to Ohio to try to obtain her \n     children. Relapsed. She began shooting heroin and then \n     arrested. We let her sit in jail and picked her up on her \n     release. Charges were dismissed. Back to West Virginia she \n     comes, hospitalized for a week and rehab again.\n       She has now been in recovery for 13 months. She fell in \n     love with a nice, drug-free man, moved to Ohio to try to \n     obtain custody of her children back, and is six months \n     pregnant. One thing I can say is my daughter was always a \n     good mother. Even while on active addiction, she worked and \n     took care of them.\n       As you can tell, both of our children became addicted to \n     prescription drugs first. . .\n\n  And they tell me this is exactly how it starts. It starts at a very \nyoung age. Recreational marijuana, prescription drugs out of your \nparents' medicine cabinet, taking it to school, being the cool kid in \nschool, sharing those drugs, then you begin using them, then you sell \nthem. This is how it starts, and it leads to obtaining street drugs to \nfeed their addiction. So it goes from occasional to recreational to \naddiction to feeding that addiction.\n\n       This is a condensed version of course. As with any family \n     dealing with addiction, it does not show the tears, the hurt, \n     the financial breakdown put on the family; (we are broke).\n\n  Literally and figuratively. She says: I want to thank you for \nlistening.\n  Doctors keep prescribing pills, and they will tell you that they have \nhad very little training in this area. As they go through all of their \nmedical schools and advanced training, they get very little training on \nthe effects these drugs have on human beings and the addiction.\n  We took 1 billion pills off the market when we went from 90 days to \n30 days of Vicodin and Lortab. We took that many pills off the market. \nThat means 30 days.\n  I have people in my office or in their families--and I know the \nPresiding Officer does as well--who will go to the doctor for something \nwhere they may need pain relief for 1 or 2 days. Do you know what they \nget? They automatically get enough pills for 30 days. That is the path \nof least resistance. It is legal, they can do it, and the doctor will \nwrite a 30-day prescription.\n  We are working on a bill that will be coming to the floor. We need to \nmake a lot of changes to that bill, but most importantly, we need to \nmake sure we have an agency in the Federal Government of the United \nStates of America that is fighting to protect every American. And it is \nnot a business plan that we have to adhere to, not at all. These are \ngood companies. They are legal pharmaceutical companies. They do an \nawful lot of good. I challenge every one of them that is listening to \nwhat we are talking about right now to give us pain relief without \naddiction to opioids. Do something. Break through the chemistry or \nsomething. It has to be there. We have been able to solve every other \nepidemic. We have been able to cure epidemics and pandemics, and now we \nhave one that has been ravaging our country for almost 30 years.\n  I have Samantha's story. She says:\n\n       Hello. My name is Samantha Holbrooke.\n\n  She wants you to know her name.\n\n       I am from Fayette County, WV. I am a 28-year-old female. I \n     have been an addict for the past 6 years. This letter is to \n     explain to you how addiction has affected my life. It is also \n     to express my view on drugs and what it is doing to our \n     society.\n       I first started drugs when I was 13 years old. I was a \n     recreational marijuana user. My mother was an alcoholic and a \n     drug addict. My father was not in the home or involved in my \n     life.\n       Unfortunately, that is true for many people around this \n     country.\n       My mother would allow me to drink with her and go to bars. \n     I was often her designated driver, but I was only 13 years \n     old. I got in my first and only bar fight at 13. It was with \n     a 24-year-old woman. She thought I was coming on to her \n     boyfriend. In reality, we were smoking weed, not trying to \n     hook up.\n       When I was 19, my oldest sister and mother introduced me to \n     hydrocodone, Ritalin, Xanax, and Percocet. My sister and \n     mother had no income; I did. By getting me on pills, they \n     were able to get free pills by charging me to get them for \n     them. By the time I was 22, I think I was snorting Oxycodone.\n\n  Oxycodone is made in a single source, which is a powder form that is \ncompressed. They would break it down, crush it, and snort it to get the \nquicker high.\n\n       That became my drug of choice. I eventually got in with a \n     doctor who was pretty much a pill mill.\n\n  We know we have them all over this country.\n\n       He wrote me a prescription for Xanax and Oxycodone. I got \n     even more strung out on those two.\n       As a result of using drugs, I now have memory problems, \n     concentration problems, and the list goes on and on. I lost \n     about 30 pounds. I lost my job. I lost my home. I lost my \n     child. I lost my fiance to suicide. He was drunk when he shot \n     himself in the head. I believe that had he not been drinking, \n     he wouldn't have taken his own life.\n       As a result of these life-changing events, I became \n     severely depressed. I then took the wrong road and began to \n     use drugs intravenously. I started lying and stealing. This \n     led me to gain two felony charges and several other \n     misdemeanors. I went to jail and prison and spent 2\\1/2\\ \n     years locked up. I am now on DRC because I am on parole and \n     had a relapse, which led to several bad decisions, and now I \n     am paying the consequences.\n       I am now in recovery. I am a recovering addict. I joined \n     Narcotics Anonymous and\n\n[[Page S948]]\n\n     Alcoholics Anonymous. The classes and programming in prison \n     helped me to think better. I now analyze a situation before \n     making a decision.\n       This is my story. Prescription drugs and all drugs have \n     ruined a large percentage of the citizens of West Virginia's \n     lives. I am now in full control of my life again, thank the \n     Lord.\n\n  This story is anonymous, but they wanted to share it with us.\n\n       I grew up in a nice home. My grandfather was a pastor. My \n     dad grew up in church. My family went to church every Sunday. \n     We had a nice house. We had nice cars. My mom didn't have to \n     work, and my dad took very good care of us.\n       My dad had surgery, a common surgery to remove several \n     large veins in his legs. This is where his addiction began. \n     This is where he found his unlimited supply of numbness.\n       I was in middle school, and this is when I remember things \n     being different. Things were changing. My dad stayed out with \n     his friends a lot. He wasn't home for dinner anymore. When he \n     was home, he was lying down sleepy and always said silly \n     things. I would stay up late at night until he would get \n     home, only to hear my mom and dad fighting, screaming, and my \n     mom crying. Eventually I hated to hear the garage door open \n     because I didn't want him to come home. Before my dad would \n     take me to school, standing in his business suit with his \n     briefcase, he would scarf down pills out of a little orange \n     bottle. He would tip it back like he was eating a box of \n     Nerds. I didn't know any better. My naive, my innocent mind \n     didn't know what was happening. I couldn't comprehend that a \n     doctor could be his drug dealer!\n\n  They couldn't comprehend that because we have been taught to trust \ndoctors.\n\n       Things got worse. I started finding bottles of liquor and \n     cans of beer hidden, and I passed it off. The 3 empty beers \n     in the back of his company car: Oh, they must be his \n     ``friends''. No one in our family drinks, definitely not my \n     dad.\n\n  I remember whole vacations, weekend trips, and afternoons ruined by \nhis addiction. Mad fits of rage until one day my mom stood up and \ncouldn't take it anymore. My dad got the help he needed, but how did he \nget the help? In hiding, in private--a local rehab facility. He was on \na business trip. Our culture has stigmatized a group of people--a group \nof people who transcend race, status, gender--at the expense of their \nlives.\n  This is a hidden killer. Drug abuse and drug addiction are hidden \nkillers. So many of us have people in our families or close friends who \ndon't want to talk about it. They are ashamed, and so it gets covered \nup and hidden away. As a result, we don't bring people out, let them \nknow the effects, and cure them.\n  She says:\n\n       My dad was hurting. No, not from the wounds on his legs \n     when he had his surgery but from depression and bipolar \n     disorder. These are the roots of his addiction. They go hand \n     in hand. When will we see this? When will we stop seeing \n     addicts as a problem and see them as human beings and \n     hurting?\n\n  For the last 20 to 30 years, I have been in public life, and the \nPresiding Officer has been in public life a good bit. I always thought \nthat anybody who fools with drugs is a criminal and should be put in \njail. We have done that, and it hasn't solved a thing. It has gotten a \nlot worse. We have to rethink this issue. This is not a crime. \nAddiction is basically an illness. It needs to have a cure, and \ntreatment is that cure. We have to face that. Senate Republicans and \nDemocrats are looking at how to fix the sentencing guidelines, and I \nthink it is encouraging and healthy for us to have these discussions.\n  She says:\n\n       Is it a selfish sickness? Of course it is. But how can we \n     help them see the light when we push them aside? Because \n     ``they asked for it?'' Just like a lady with skin cancer \n     ``asked for it'' because she laid in a tanning bed? What if \n     we treated addicts with the same compassion that we treat \n     cancer patients?\n       My father has been clean for almost a decade, and the \n     demons of his addiction still haunt us all. No, we weren't \n     homeless, nor did we have to face a death to be completely \n     broken by this horrible epidemic, but I had a zombie for a \n     father for my adolescence. I missed my childhood, years that \n     we can never get back, memories that will never be erased, \n     all because of a little orange pill bottle chased and hidden \n     with a brown paper bag.\n       Luckily, my story ends with a happy ending. I still have my \n     dad. My story hasn't ended up the way so many do every day, \n     like my two friends who didn't get help in time and passed \n     away.\n\n  I have stories from all over the country, and they are pathetic. I \nhave a couple more I can read from West Virginia. I will go to \ndifferent States.\n  This is Erica's story. She says:\n\n       Hello, My name is Erica and I am an addict. And I say that \n     with great pride as I celebrated 10 years of recovery in \n     November of 2015.\n       I began using drugs here in West Virginia at the ripe age \n     of 13.\n\n  Thirteen seems to be that magic--adolescence. We are coming into \nadolescence. We are willing to experiment. We think we are invincible. \nWe think nothing can harm us.\n\n       Prescription drugs were easily accessible at that age and \n     opened the door to 11 years of anguish, desperation, jails, \n     and dirty needles. I came from a stable, drug- and alcohol-\n     free home, but I was able to gain access to prescription \n     drugs from my peers and my local middle school and high \n     school on a daily basis.\n       As my disease progressed, I dropped out of high school my \n     freshman year and continued to put myself and family through \n     years of pain and suffering. I attempted drug replacement \n     therapy to control my opioid addiction, but that was only a \n     temporary solution, and I eventually returned to drugs.\n       Finally, I found myself in the court system and facing \n     felony drug charges. It was then that I was able to find \n     freedom through a 12-step fellowship.\n       Today I can say I am a cum laude graduate of Marshall \n     University, fully employed, homeowner, wife, and the mother \n     of two wonderful West Virginia boys.\n       I pray my children don't follow the path that, not only \n     myself, but many of my West Virginians fall into. The disease \n     of addiction is progressive and fatal if not treated or \n     prevented.\n\n  Here in West Virginia, we are leading the Nation in drug overdoses. \nAnd where I live in Cabell County, we have had over 900 overdoses in \njust the year of 2015.\n\n       As a mother, I must trust our leaders to make responsible \n     choices to help us seek solutions, gain back our communities, \n     and save our children from following the same deadly path.\n\n  I know the FDA was so proud that they came out with some new \nguidelines, and they said now they are going to start paying attention \nto the advisory committees. They didn't say they would adhere to their \nrecommendations; they would just start paying attention to them. Also, \nthe CDC--the Centers for Disease Control--put out some guidelines of \nhow we should be prescribing, the knowledge we should have, how we \nshould be administering, and what we should be doing to curb this drug \nabuse. And guess which agency fought against that and put it on delay? \nThe FDA.\n  The only thing I ask all of my colleagues to do is to please \nconsider--just send a message with the vote you make tomorrow. It is \nnot about the doctor at all. It is not about the person before us. It \nis about getting an advocate who will make a real change and make sure \nwe fight this war.\n  This story is another anonymous story:\n\n       My brother is in his early 20s and was hired at the local \n     plant that employs the majority of the county. He was injured \n     on the job, saw his doctor, and was prescribed Lortab long \n     term.\n\n  Lortab, as I said before, is a schedule III, 90 days. You can keep \ncalling it in, calling it in, and calling it in.\n\n       As the effects from this started to wane, he was prescribed \n     Xanax, Klonopin, and a variety of other prescription \n     medicines. He then lost his good-paying job but found other \n     work at a lower pay after almost a year of unemployment.\n       This prescription med addiction continued for years, and \n     once laws finally cracked down on prescribing narcotics, it \n     left him unable to get all the medicines he had previously \n     been prescribed. Once it became too expensive to buy them on \n     the street, he turned to heroin.\n       My fun-loving brother who was always at family functions, \n     loved to be around his nieces and nephews, totally \n     disappeared. I suspected that something more serious was \n     going on, but he wouldn't answer calls or texts.\n       In August, I hadn't seen him in several months. We have \n     always been close. This was very unusual. I sent him a novel \n     of a text since he wouldn't take my phone calls confronting \n     him over the rumors that I had heard of his heroin use. He \n     denied it.\n       A few short weeks later, I got a call from my mother that \n     he was transported to the hospital by ambulance but \n     discharged a few hours later for chest pain. He later told us \n     he had gotten a bad batch of heroin and was certain he was \n     dying.\n       He told the EMS he had used that morning, as well as \n     hospital staff. I still to this day don't understand how \n     someone can come in suffering from an overdose and be \n     discharged a few hours later.\n\n  People don't have knowledge. They are not being trained in this \nhorrible epidemic that we have in this country.\n\n       NOTHING was mentioned to him about treatment or rehab and \n     he was treated as a\n\n[[Page S949]]\n\n     lesser person. I was worried before, but after this was in a \n     constant state of fear that I would get a call that my 31-\n     year-old brother was dead.\n       In October, he called me to tell me yes he was a heroin \n     addict, but a new treatment center had opened near his home \n     and he wanted to get clean. He asked if I would go with him, \n     and I said of course yes.\n       His insurance wouldn't cover a dime of this treatment. It \n     would be all out of his pocket at $100 a day plus the cost of \n     meds. For someone working at a $30,000 or less a year job, \n     paying for housing, utilities, food, (he never did receive \n     public assistance)--\n\n  He was too proud for that--\n\n     this cost was more than he could do.\n       Again I told him I would be there and pay for whatever he \n     couldn't. I convinced him he needed more of a support system \n     than just me and he finally told our parents. We were we were \n     raised in church and came from a large religious family. He \n     was so ashamed of what he had become he didn't want the \n     family to know and the majority of them still don't know to \n     this day.\n\n  I am hoping, as this letter was written anonymously, eventually he \nwill share this with the family, maybe preventing other members from \ngoing down this road.\n\n       He will tell them when he is ready. My mom and I went with \n     him to his first appointment at the suboxyne clinic, and one \n     of us has been at every appointment since. It is wonderful--\n     he has a session with a psychiatrist at every visit.\n       It's more than prescribing meds. They are doing the \n     counseling to make sure their patients get clean. I am proud \n     to say that after only four months, not only is he clean but \n     he has weaned off the suboxyne.\n       He still goes for counseling and has the nurse's cell that \n     he can call 24 hours a day if he's having a hard day. In the \n     future he wants to tell his story and help others facing the \n     same crisis.\n\n  Madam President, I have been reading stories of people addicted all \nover the State of West Virginia. I have stories from your State also, \nMadam President. I would like to read that for you.\n  This is in New Hampshire--Sandown, NH. This is Kathleen's story. I am \nsure she has sent you the same copy she sent me. She wants her name to \nbe known.\n\n       My name is Kathleen Stephens. I am a 56 year old RN, BSN, \n     from Sandown, NH. I am currently the Director of Clinical \n     Service at a nationwide hospice company. My story is much \n     like thousands of others out there, pretty average, fairly \n     normal. I have two children; a 33-year-old son who graduated \n     with a degree in Mathematics from Boston University and a 31-\n     year-old daughter who graduated with a psychology degree from \n     Assumption College. I myself have a Bachelor of Science and \n     Nursing degree and my children's father a Bachelor's degree \n     in business from Wharton School of Business in PA. I give you \n     this detailed background for to you see that we are a well \n     educated and successful family. We are a white, mid to upper \n     middle class who have always lived in a beautiful \n     neighborhood surrounded by loving families whose children \n     played outside, joined peewee soccer, little league, \n     softball, basketball and girl scouts to name but a few. We \n     were the home in the neighborhood where all the children \n     loved to play. We took our children to drive in movies, \n     camping, the beach, museums and always visited their \n     grandparents. We were normal, that's all, or what we \n     perceived was normal.\n       When speaking with our children now, they both recount \n     wonderful childhoods and deem themselves ``lucky.'' Our house \n     was filled with love. I hugged my kids all the time, never \n     hesitated to demonstrate to or tell them how much I loved \n     them. They had grandparents who were always around, who also \n     demonstrated love for them. About 5 years ago, my daughter, \n     and her boyfriend, an Intern at Tufts Medical School decided, \n     after being together for 2 years that they would move to \n     Sacramento. I was devastated inside but encouraged my \n     daughter to follow her heart. Over the subsequent years, our \n     communications went from daily to weekly to scattered. Each \n     conversation seemed more distant than the last. We saw her an \n     average of twice a year; most significantly, when we paid her \n     expenses to come home for Christmas. Her boyfriend never \n     came; he distanced himself from us almost immediately.\n       I'm sure at this point you know the story. About 18 months \n     ago I finally confronted my daughter asking what was wrong, \n     seeing her go from a loving daughter to a distant person I no \n     longer knew. Over the previous few years, she turned into a \n     virtual stranger. I told her I loved her no matter what and \n     that I would be there for her. At that time she denied any \n     issue. A few weeks later she was in the hospital and called \n     me. Apparently, she had hit bottom. She confided that she was \n     a heroin addict. I was more than shocked. She had been in a \n     substance free dorm in college, hated drinking, drugs and was \n     pretty straight laced overall. I kept myself in check saying \n     that no matter what I would support her, asked her to come \n     home so we could help her. She confided that it started with \n     a prescription for opioids that her boyfriend had shared with \n     her. He was given one for back pain years before, got hooked \n     and decided she might just like it.\n       So, amazingly she did come home, but she went back a few \n     months later. She then returned to get clean again and went \n     back a few months later. She overdosed multiple times, of \n     which I knew nothing until recently. Her boyfriend gave her \n     IV heroin while she was in the hospital being treated for \n     pneumonia to keep her habit going. He was the one, I found \n     out later, that he shot her up because she hated doing it. He \n     had developed a hold on her that was a bond of heroin high. I \n     knew the drug had gotten her when, due to the stress of \n     everything happening, I ended up in the hospital ruling out a \n     heart attack. She drove me there, dropped me off and went to \n     get high (I found out later). I ended up being fine, stress \n     of course, and she ended up going back home yet again. She \n     stayed clean after going into a rehab, which kicked her out \n     after 8 days because her insurance was declined. She then \n     attended NA--\n\n  Narcotics Anonymous--\n\n     meetings almost daily and got a job that she loved. In the \n     meantime, her boyfriend was found out through a ``random'' \n     drug test and suspended. She was clean for 4 months, the \n     happiest four months of my life. We spoke every few days, or \n     texted. Her voice was truly hers again . . . her laughter, \n     her expressions, her humor. I felt she was finally back with \n     us. She had left her boyfriend and went into a sober living \n     home. Life was good and I was so grateful to have my \n     daughter, my best friend, back.\n       About 3 months into her sobriety she decided to reach out \n     and try to get her boyfriend sober as well, the beginning of \n     the end. At exactly month 4 she went to his house and he had \n     a ``surprise'' for her. She was new in her sobriety, just \n     once she said, and she fell back down the rabbit hole. I knew \n     when she didn't return my calls or texts that it was bad. But \n     finally she responded; she was back into it again, but she'd \n     get out she promised.\n       The next 8 months were a few weeks clean then back into \n     drugs again. I did not send her money. Honestly, she never \n     asked. She knew I'd never support her habit. Around \n     Thanksgiving 2015 she had had it. She called me and said she \n     wanted to get back into rehab and leave her boyfriend \n     permanently. Her life was no longer worth living. Weeks of \n     trying to get her into rehab went unsuccessfully when we \n     finally found Clean and Sober in Sacramento. At that point \n     she was clean two weeks, had slowly packed up or sold her \n     belongings and was ready for the break. But she had to sneak \n     out to get away from her very controlling, manipulative \n     partner; and she did.\n       The happy part: She is today 60 days sober. She has a new \n     job (She had been fired from the other one), which she loves. \n     She blocked her boyfriend from her phone, her email and her \n     facebook. She is the daughter, once again, that I know and \n     love, but I love her regardless of the disease of addiction. \n     Love the addict, hate the disease. And for right now I thank \n     God, pray alot, and take it one day at a time.\n\n  I have another one here I want to share with you. The thing I wanted \nto share, Madam President, is this: My State and your State have \nprobably been hit as hard as any two States in the country. We have \npeople coming to us all the time. We are fighting every way we can. We \nare introducing pieces of legislation. We are not worrying about who is \nRepublican or Democrat. How can we help Americans--the beautiful people \nin New Hampshire, the wonderful people in West Virginia, who are facing \nmore deaths, more disease, more destruction to the family?\n  I want to share with you that when I first got elected--Senator Byrd \nhad died in 2010. I was Governor of the State of West Virginia. I had \nto make a decision. I thought maybe I could come to Washington and help \nwith the experiences I had and what I had seen in my State and times. \nWe had challenges.\n  After I was elected to the Senate, I had gone back to Oceana, WV. At \nthat time it had been called ``Oxyana'' because drug use was so rampant \nin this beautiful town. I remembered this town because when I was a \nfreshman in college, my roommate was from this town. It was the most \nbeautiful town I had been in. They had everything. What a privilege it \nwould have been to grow up in this beautiful town, but I could see many \nyears later it was not the town I knew or remembered in my mind. I went \nto the middle school. These were all children in fifth to eighth grade. \nI tried to give pep talks. I wanted to get them involved and tell them \nhow good they could be, how much we are counting on them, what they \nneed to get a good education and contribute something back to society, \nand how fortunate and lucky they are to be in this little town.\n  After I finished speaking--they were attentive and cooperative--there \nwas a group of them. They asked: Can we talk to you privately? I will \nnever forget this. These were 12- and 13-year-old\n\n[[Page S950]]\n\nboys and girls. There had to be six or seven of them. I went in the \nback room and sat at a table. They started talking and telling me their \nstories. These were stories they had watched and were telling me. This \nwas the first time I had ever heard from a child up close and personal \nwho said: My dad worked at the mines. He had a back problem. He got \nhurt. They kept giving him pills. We lost our house. Mom and dad were \nfighting. They got divorced. We lost everything. I've got nothing now. \nMy grandparents were watching me while I was trying to take care of us. \nMy dad is an addict.\n  I heard these stories from these five kids. They were all pleading.\n  Now fast forward to the year 2015. I go back to the same school. \nThese kids that were 12 years old are now seniors in high school. The \nsame group wants to talk to me. They had lived a clean life, but I \nthink about what they have gone through and what they have seen. Then I \nsit down with another group of 12- and 13-year-olds from the same area. \nThey are telling me stories about how they are watching their lives \nbefore them when they watch a boyfriend or a stepfather because the \nfamily had broken apart, the mother remarried or whatever, and the \nperson that she is with is a drug addict. This little child watches her \nmother get shot up and killed because of the drugs the boyfriend shoots \ninto the mother. Can you imagine a 12- or 13-year-old having to live \nwith this and see this happen in their home?\n  What we are asking is simply for the Food and Drug Administration to \nchange, to be the watchdog to help us. They are supposed to protect us. \nThey don't say: I did my job. The pharmaceutical company told me they \nmade this drug, and this is the way it was made. This is what it was \nsupposed to do. We checked it out. Everything is fine; leave it on the \nmarket.\n  You are not looking at the welfare of the people. You know what it \ndoes. You know it is addictive. We have no treatment centers. We are \ndoing nothing to treat this. We are not challenging these \npharmaceutical companies who are good companies. They do a lot of good \nand put a lot of products out there that are very good, but they are \nbringing these opiates on the market quicker than ever before, more \npowerful than ever before, and they know what is going to happen.\n  I am challenging all of them. I think the FDA should challenge them. \nWe are not going to approve more opiates. We are not going to let you \nbring on the market stronger opiates that we know are addictive and \nwill ruin people's lives. If they will do that and challenge these \ncompanies to come out with new research and development that can \nscientifically give us relief needed for people who have chronic pain \nwithout making them addicts who lose their lives--we should be able to \ndo that in this great country. I am going to read you a story from \nKentucky, my next door neighbor, the majority leader's home--Kentucky \nand West Virginia. This is Emily from Louisville, KY.\n\n       My name is Emily Walden. I am a mother who lost my 21-year-\n     old son to a drug overdose in 2012. My son TJ came from a \n     good family, was a member of the Kentucky National Guard and \n     the most respectful young man you could have ever met. TJ \n     made an initial poor decision that led to an addiction to the \n     drug Opana; he had unlimited access to this drug during that \n     time. TJ did not want to die from this. He tried very hard to \n     overcome his addiction and I tried very hard to save his \n     life. I started researching the drug Opana about five years \n     ago and would like to share with you what I have learned that \n     illustrates the need for changes to our FDA policies and \n     approval processes for all opioid drugs.\n       The drug Opana contains the opioid Oxymorphone which was \n     removed from the market in 1979 due to the overdose deaths \n     and addiction this drug was causing across our country.\n       In 2002, the FDA started holding IMMPACT meetings every \n     year allowing pharmaceutical companies to pay money to be \n     included in discussions and changes to clinical trials, \n     design.\n       We call that pay to play--the impact it has because they \n     are able to go to these types of settings and get absolute \n     front row seats with the people they are trying to persuade \n     to take another look at these drugs that might have been \n     taken off the market because they were deemed too dangerous. \n     This is allowed to go on. It has been going on for far too \n     long, and the FDA is part of it. This is part of the change \n     that needs to be made and made immediately.\n       Endo Pharmaceuticals, the manufacturer of Opana, attended \n     each one of these ``pay-to-play'' meetings.\n       In 2003, Endo Pharmaceuticals brought the drug Opana to the \n     FDA for approval and was denied due to the overdoses that \n     occurred during the clinical trials.\n       In 2006, Endo Pharmaceuticals again brought the drug Opana \n     to the FDA for approval but this time using new clinical \n     trial that applied a modified process, called ``Enriched \n     Enrollment,'' which removed patients with preexisting opiate \n     sensitivities from the trial. The Enriched Enrollment process \n     skews results and seriously underestimates risks associated \n     with the proposed drug involved in the clinical trial. In \n     addition, the FDA ignored their own review guidance by \n     bypassing their advisory committee and approved Opana for \n     moderate to severe pain.\n       At the time Opana was approved, our country was already \n     experiencing an explosion of overdose deaths and addiction \n     from the overprescribing and misrepresentation of the safety \n     of opiates. In addition to causing thousands of deaths and \n     addiction, the approved use of Opana has now been directly \n     implicated in an outbreak of Hepatitis C and HIV cases in the \n     State of Indiana.\n       The FDA has continued to use Enriched Enrollment--\n\n  Or pay to play--\n\n     to approve new opiates and override or bypass altogether \n     their advisory committee for new opiate approvals and for new \n     uses of opiates further contributing to the overdose deaths \n     and addiction. These process changes must stop.\n       The year after my son died I traveled to Washington DC for \n     the first time in my life and was very fortunate to be able \n     to meet with the then Senate Minority Leader--\n\n  Now Senate majority leader--\n\n     Senator McConnell, the next year I had nine meetings which \n     included a meeting with then acting Director Botticelli of \n     ONDCP, DEA Administrator Michelle Leonhart and seven meetings \n     with Senator's staff. In 2015 I had thirteen meetings \n     scheduled. I am not going away! We need change to curb this \n     horrible epidemic that started with prescribed opiates and \n     the mistakes that were made need to be corrected.\n       How many people have to die? How many more people have to \n     become addicted? The FDA is sending the wrong message to \n     physicians by continuing to approve opioids during the worst \n     drug epidemic our country has ever faced.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). The Senator's postcloture time \nhas expired.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I ask unanimous consent to continue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Thank you, Madam President.\n\n       The FDA is supposed to be protecting public health and yet \n     over 200,000 people have died and they have failed to put \n     appropriate restrictions on these dangerous drugs to prevent \n     overdose deaths. I want to know why there is one death from \n     something such as ecoli and every head of lettuce is pulled \n     from the shelves in ten different states but opioids have \n     killed thousands of people and they are considered safe and \n     effective? How can that be?\n       When is the FDA going to put human life before the \n     paychecks of Big Pharma? What will it take? A million deaths? \n     We need an FDA commissioner that will protect the citizens of \n     this country that is willing to take the overall best \n     interest of public safety into consideration and not allow \n     the pharmaceutical companies to have him in their back \n     pockets. My son TJ had a lifelong dream of joining the \n     military and fighting for his country. He would have given \n     his life to protect and serve. He was one of the most \n     patriotic young men and his country failed him. Please do the \n     right thing. Please do not let one more mother get a knock on \n     her door saying their child is gone and that they will never \n     [ever] come home [again]. There is no greater pain than \n     burying your child! My son, my precious child with the most \n     beautiful blue eyes, caring and loving heart, died in part by \n     the greed of big Pharma and--\n\n  Most importantly--\n\n     the carelessness of the FDA. It is time for change!\n\n  Another story from Kentucky. This is in Northern Kentucky and this is \nKimberly's story.\n\n       My name is Kimberly Wright. I am a [mother from Northern \n     Kentucky] who works in the trenches to save the lives of \n     people in my Community. NKY was hit by a pill epidemic around \n     2000. That pill Epidemic has now turned into a Heroin \n     Epidemic. Since 2013 the death toll continues to climb. In \n     2015 we have had 1,168 overdose reverses. We still await the \n     number of deaths. Our entire system is on the verge of \n     collapse--our Courts, Police, Children's Services, Jails. Our \n     jails currently have 99% Heroin and Pill cases housed in the \n     jails. Our Treatment system is seriously strained with not 1 \n     new bed added in the last 10 years since this epidemic \n     started. We are in a War in [Northern Kentucky]. Every day we \n     wait to see how many died that day. We have people getting in \n     their cars driving high on pills and Heroin wrecking into \n     innocent people and killing them. This is the United States \n     of America and this is a shame. We allow the FDA and Big \n     Pharma to profit off the deaths of an entire generation of \n     young people. We are in effect losing 2 jumbo jets full of \n     kids every day\n\n[[Page S951]]\n\n     in America due to Pills and Heroin. We need help. We are \n     begging for help to stop this madness. Our American families \n     are losing our children at an alarming rate to \n     overprescribing Drs and Big Pharma. We beg you, please help \n     us stop this.\n       I lost my sister Alicia Cook on October 26, 2010, to an \n     overdose. Alicia was a nurse with 2 young daughters. This \n     Epidemic has no boundaries and it's in every community in the \n     Country. Northern Kentucky has the highest rates of HEPC, \n     surpassing the National Level, due to heroin and pills being \n     injected. We have a high rate of homeless children due to \n     their parents being dead or drug addicted with no end in \n     sight. We have 52% of grandparents raising their \n     grandchildren due to death and addiction. This is a nightmare \n     for parents. When our children were born we could have never \n     imagined this would be our life. You don't sleep at night \n     from the anxiety of wondering if you are the next parent to \n     get that call that your child has overdosed. It's like being \n     in a constant panic attack. It's not normal to grieve the \n     loss of a child who is alive, for they are truly lost. I \n     [know lots of] parents who have lost their child and I can't \n     imagine their pain and grief. I grieve for my addicted 26-\n     year-old daughter who is in the fight of her life [because \n     of] her Addiction. I watch her destroying herself every day. \n     I don't want to join the mothers who have lost their child to \n     this Epidemic. I know how I suffer now and I just can't go \n     there. I will continue to fight for my community. Will you \n     [please] join me?\n\n  That is Arlene's story.\n  Indiana is one of the States that has been hit so hard also. This is \nDanielle's story from Southern Indiana.\n\n       My name is Danielle McCowan. I live in southern Indiana and \n     work as a server. About 2 and a half years ago a customer by \n     the name of Josh Harvey left me his number. At the time he \n     told me he was living in Chicago for school. Little did I \n     know he was in rehab there. Granted, I didn't know about his \n     addiction for over a year because we hadn't stayed in \n     constant contact. Over a year or so ago I found out about his \n     heroin addiction. He still told me little about it. I do know \n     it started out with prescription pills and later went to \n     heroin when the pills became harder to get. He served a month \n     in jail in Michigan for the entire month of this past July \n     over a heroin related charge. He came home immediately after \n     and overdosed that same weekend. Luckily, his dad saved him \n     that time. Now he got enrolled in college and was going to an \n     outpatient program doing better. Or so we all thought. School \n     let out for break and I guess it all went downhill. He came \n     to me on November the 4th telling me he had used a couple of \n     times and wanted my advice. I suggested an in-patient \n     program. He went to Wellstone after he left my house. He sat \n     for several hours and finally was given a room. I went and \n     checked on him 2 different times while he waited to make sure \n     he was there. Thursday I didn't receive any calls. Friday \n     nothing either. Then Saturday morning, the 7th of November, \n     his mother called me to break my heart. He had passed away \n     that Friday, the 6th, over in Louisville and didn't know who \n     to contact until that Saturday morning, I guess. He had \n     checked himself out of Wellstone, broke into his house, took \n     his Xbox which he later either pawned or traded for heroin. \n     Never in a million years did I think I'd become close to \n     anybody addicted to heroin. It doesn't discriminate. It can \n     get ahold of any and everybody. Never in my life have I been \n     so depressed or heartbroken. All I want is his story shared. \n     He was my happy ending gone away too soon.\n\n  They continue. They continue on, these stories, the heartaches and \nthe lives destroyed, lives changed. Few too many lives are saved.\n  Massachusetts. As the Presiding Officer knows, Senator Markey has \nbeen working with me very closely and all of us on this horrible \nepidemic that we have. This is Sara's story. She is from Amherst, MA.\n\n       My nuclear family is middle class or the working poor, but \n     it is blended in that I was raised by my mother and step-dad, \n     but my bio father's side of the family would be considered \n     well-off. Heroin first came to my radar after my brother \n     Donny became addicted to pain pills after surgery, and heroin \n     followed suit after RX's stopped. Then it seemed like it was \n     everywhere around me: my nephew, my niece. Then we lost my \n     cousin Cory, who passed in a sober house for his addiction to \n     alcohol, along with a needle and an empty bag next to him. \n     Cory is an example of a young man institutionalized by \n     multiple incarcerations and just when he would try to lift \n     himself up, in he would go again. He was trying to get clean \n     for his girlfriend and unborn child when he passed away, and \n     he was happy, thinking he was getting better. Living with \n     someone close who struggles and then multiply that by two, \n     and adolescence, young adulthood mixed in, and you have my \n     descent as an empathetic aunt who felt powerless to change \n     anything.\n       Then the bottom dropped out. My cousin, John Ahern, passed \n     at the end of August after a long period of recovery alone in \n     the woods. It didn't matter he came from privilege or was the \n     nicest person I had every known in my life for so long. He \n     leaves behind three loving sons. They both couldn't access \n     the help they needed at various stages, including recovery, \n     and died alone.\n       It is my mission to stand up for them and the young people \n     like my niece who began her struggle at 14, and now \n     approaching 18 has some clean time. There are no support \n     programs in my community for this age group, and especially \n     for non-White young people like my niece and nephew. They are \n     both of Latino descent. Please do something.\n\n  People are begging us everywhere in this country to help them, and \nbasically it starts with treating this as an illness and not as a \ncrime. It starts also with having clinics, having basic places where we \ncan serve them and help them get clean. They cannot do it by \nthemselves, and they are the first to tell you. The stories I am \nreading here exemplify that so well.\n  I have a Florida story here, and Florida has also been ravaged. \nFlorida was a problem that we had in West Virginia because of the pill \nmills there. People would take the bus down or they could take a cheap \nflight down to Florida, buy all the pills they could and come back. \nFlorida has been very helpful in the last years trying to stop the pill \nepidemic.\n  This is Janet from Fort Lauderdale.\n\n       Dear Senator Manchin. I appreciate you taking the time to \n     stop the appointment of Dr. Califf from becoming the FDA \n     commissioner. I founded STOPPnow--Stop the Organized Pill \n     Pushers now--due to all the drug-addicted babies I was caring \n     for as a neonatal intensive care nurse at a children's \n     hospital in Broward County, FL. We started holding protests \n     in front of the 150 pill mills that were in Broward County \n     alone. Many parents came out to protest with us. Parents from \n     all over the country contacted us as well. Too many parents \n     are crying themselves to sleep over the loss of their child.\n       At first, there were no consequences for either the clinic \n     owner or the doctor. Then they started arresting the doctors \n     for money laundering. Our State's attorney has called the \n     doctors drug dealers in white coats. The Board of Medicine is \n     not protecting the public by allowing high-prescribing \n     doctors to keep their license. Therefore, the plight of the \n     drug-addicted babies and the devastation to the families \n     continues to rise. When one clinic owner was arrested, he was \n     earning $150,000 a day.\n\n  I repeat, $150,000 a day.\n\n       Not one doctor in that clinic to date has lost his license \n     or his practice.\n       We only have the judicial system helping to alleviate this \n     in Florida. Doctors are now being charged with first-degree \n     murder. It would be kinder for a doctor to lose his license \n     than to sit in a courtroom at their own murder trial.\n       We have been unsuccessful in our efforts for lawmakers to \n     mandate that prescribers use the prescription drug monitoring \n     program in Florida. Yet in this environment, there is a bill \n     passing through the committees allowing nurse practitioners \n     and physician assistants to prescribe narcotics without a \n     doctor signing off on the order. I would support this bill if \n     they included the mandate. And, of course, the FDA approved \n     that children as young as 11 years old can be prescribed \n     OxyContin. We definitely need an investigation.\n\n  Madam President, as you can see, these are problems that we have all \nover the country. This is not just your State and not just my State. I \nknow it is hard. They say we need someone in there, so let's just go \nahead and confirm Dr. Califf. Dr. Califf is an honorable man. He is \nstill there. He is going to be there. He has been there for 1 year. In \nthe 1 year that he has been there, we have basically put more opiate \ndrugs on the market without even going through a clinical overview. If \nthat change were going to come, it would have come by now. I am sure he \ncould have had input, and I would hope that he would.\n  Dr. Califf has called a lot of our colleagues and said that these \nchanges will be coming. This Senator will tell you the changes they \nrecommended when they said they were going to make changes. They said: \nWe are going to make sure that we are going to start listening to our \nstaff and people who are reviewing these drugs.\n  They are going to listen to them, but there is no mandate that they \nwill have to follow.\n  This Senator has a piece of legislation that the Presiding Officer \ncoauthored, and I appreciate that very much. Basically what we are \nsaying is this: When you have your advisory committee--and every drug \nmust go through an advisory committee's opinion, and if they recommend \nas they did with Zohydro to not let it go on the market, that cannot be \nbypassed, neglected, or pushed aside. Our bill would basically state \nthat they must bring it to the people's representatives in Congress and \nstate why it is so very important for them to bring this new high-\npowered drug to the market--as if we don't have enough.\n  The United States has 5 percent of the world's population but \nconsumes 80\n\n[[Page S952]]\n\npercent of these addictive opiate drugs. Something is wrong. Something \nmust change.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for allowing me to be able to read the \nletters of people who have been affected by this all over this great \ncountry in all of our States. I know we feel the pain, and we are going \nto try to make these changes and make sure this agency will do what it \nis supposed to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Remembering Justice Antonin Scalia\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, first of all, I want to take a moment \nto honor the life and service of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.\n  Justice Scalia was a dedicated public servant who gave so many years \nto our courts and our country. He and I didn't agree on every issue, \nbut his intellect, passion, and commitment were unquestionable. I know \nhe will be missed, and the thoughts and prayers of Washington State \nfamilies go out to his family.\n\n\n                   Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Madam President, people across the country are now looking at what is \nhappening here in Congress, and they are frustrated. They look at the \nmany challenges we face as a Nation, and they want Democrats and \nRepublicans to work together to tackle them to make sure our government \nis functioning and that it is working for all of our families, not just \nthe wealthy and few.\n  Madam President, I share that frustration. We have been able to get \nthings done when Democrats and Republicans work together to break \nthrough the gridlock. That shouldn't end just because it is an election \nyear. It certainly should not end when it comes to one of our most \nimportant roles here in the Senate, working with the President to \nevaluate and confirm judges for the highest court in our land.\n  The Supreme Court plays such an important role in protecting the \nrights, liberties, and responsibilities of all Americans. Over the \nyears the Court has made decisions that have moved our country in the \nright direction, and it has made decisions that have set us back. When \nthe Court can do its work, it offers certainty to people across the \ncountry when it comes to their rights as workers or as patients or as \nconsumers or as women or as citizens. At its best, it helps our \njudicial system rise above politics, above partisanship, and above the \nspats and sniping of the moment. In order to do that, the Court must \nhave a full bench. It cannot have vacancies leading to potential \ndeadlocks at every turn.\n  That is why I was so disappointed that hours after Justice Scalia \npassed away, Republican leaders jumped out of the gate to say they \nwould not allow the vacancy to be filled while President Obama was \nstill in office. Right away--before the Nation had a chance to take in \nand mourn the loss of a Supreme Court Justice, a man who seriously \nbelieved in the Constitution--Republican leaders injected politics and \npartisanship into a process that should be about our obligations as \nAmericans.\n  The Constitution is very clear. Let me take a moment to read from it \ndirectly.\n  In article II, which clearly defines the powers of the President, \nsection 2 states that ``he shall nominate and by and with the Advice \nand Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public \nMinisters and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court and all other \nOfficers of the United States.''\n  Madam President, this could not be more explicit. The President \n``shall nominate'' and shall appoint with ``the Advice and Consent of \nthe Senate''--not shall nominate in the first 3 years, not shall \nnominate unless the Senate leadership wants to keep the seat open for a \nwhile. The President ``shall nominate.'' That is his responsibility.\n  Then it is our responsibility in the Senate to consider, advise, and \nultimately help make sure that the vacancy is filled with a qualified \nperson. Of course, the Senate has the right to weigh in with our advice \nand consent. It is our job to vet nominees sent to us by the President, \nto make sure they are qualified for the job, and to determine if they \nmeet the basic standards of honesty, ethics, qualifications, and \nfairness. Personally, this Senator will want to evaluate if they will \nbe independent, evenhanded in deciding cases, and if they will uphold \nour rights and liberties, including the critical right to privacy.\n  Republican leaders are not objecting to a person; they are objecting \nto this President being allowed to do his job. That is not advice and \nconsent; it is politicize and obstruct.\n  Republicans say there is a precedent to stall on Supreme Court \nnominations in the last year of a President's term. That is not true. \nPresident Reagan had Justice Kennedy confirmed with a unanimous vote in \na Democratic Senate in his last year in office.\n  Since 1975, the average number of days from nomination to final \nSenate vote is about 70 days. So this kind of obstruction and \npartisanship is absolutely wrong. People across the country will not \nstand for it, and I hope our Republican leaders will back down and do \nthe right thing because evaluating and confirming Supreme Court \nJustices is one of the most important roles we have in the U.S. Senate.\n  In fact, it is this issue that actually pushed me to run for the \nSenate in the first place. Back in 1991 I was a State senator, a former \nschool board member, a mom. Like so many people at that time, I watched \nthe Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings. For days I watched in \nfrustration.\n  I couldn't believe this nominee wasn't pushed on the issues that I \nand so many others thought were so important to our country. I didn't \nfeel the Members on that committee represented the full spectrum of \nperspectives, and I decided then and there to run for the U.S. Senate \nto give Washington State families a voice.\n  Now, as a U.S. Senator, I want my questions answered. I want to make \nsure my constituents have a seat at the table and I get to push \nnominees for the highest Court in the land on the issues I care about \nmost, but I can't do that if Republicans play election-year politics \nand don't even allow us to have that debate. The American people will \nnot have a voice, the Court will be dysfunctional for a year longer, \nand Republicans will have politicized a process that should be above \nthis sort of petty partisanship.\n  Many Republicans may not want to hear this, but Barack Obama is still \nPresident Obama for almost a full year more. This Senator is hopeful \nthat Republicans will step back from this very dangerous and very \npartisan path they are on and work with us to consider and confirm a \nnominee in a reasonable timeframe.\n  Families across the country deserve to have a functioning Supreme \nCourt and a Congress that works well enough to allow this to happen.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nup to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here now for the 128th time to \nurge that we wake up to the ugly changes that carbon pollution is \nwreaking on our climate. It is happening all around us, and it is \nhappening right now, not in some far-off future.\n  As humans we are terrestrial beings. We live on the land. So \nnaturally we pay more attention to the experience where we live--things \nsuch as increasing average temperatures on the land and changes in \nextreme weather when it hits the land. We don't so much pay attention \nto what is happening in our warming and acidifying oceans.\n  The oceans are a big deal in climate change. For decades the oceans \nhave absorbed more than 90 percent of the excess heat trapped in the \natmosphere by greenhouse gas emissions. Of all the different places the \nexcess heat goes, 93 percent is into the oceans. What we see in the \natmosphere--the temperature changes we have already measured, the\n\n[[Page S953]]\n\nchanges we are seeing in our habitat and what is happening to the \nwestern forest--all of that is less than the remaining 7 percent.\n  A study published in the journal Nature Climate Change found that the \noceans have absorbed as much energy just since 1997 as they had in the \npreceding 130 years--as much in 20 years, less than 20 years, as they \nhad in the preceding 130 years.\n  According to an Associated Press write-up of the study's findings, \n``Since 1997, Earth's oceans have absorbed man-made heat energy \nequivalent to a Hiroshima-style bomb being exploded every second for 75 \nstraight years.'' That is the energy load of heat that has gone into \nour oceans--a Hiroshima-style bomb exploded every second for 75 \nstraight years. What does all that excess energy mean for the oceans? \nIt means that sea levels are rising, in part due to melting glaciers \nbut also because of expanding ocean water. It is basic physics, \nexplained by the principle of thermal expansion. When the ocean warms, \nit expands. It can't go down, so it comes up along our shores.\n  We have measured sea level rise in Rhode Island since 1930. Since \nthen, the water level is up nearly 10 inches at the tide gauge at Naval \nStation Newport, and rates of sea level rise are on the increase \nworldwide. Since 1993, global sea level has risen at a rate \napproximately double the average rate observed through the 20th \ncentury. It is accelerating.\n  Current forecasts confirm that if we do nothing to curb greenhouse \ngas emissions over the next decades, the oceans could rise as much as 3 \nor 4 feet by 2100. Our State coastal management agency predicts that we \ncould see as much as 7 feet of sea level rise in the Ocean State, in \nRhode Island, by the end of the century. I hope my colleagues \nunderstand that when I come to do this, I am deadly serious about \nthings that are predicted to happen in my State.\n  This week, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences \nreported that global sea levels are rising at their fastest rate in \nnearly 3,000 years. That study also estimates that about half of the \n20th century sea level rise would not have occurred without global \nwarming.\n  The lead author, Dr. Robert Kopp, an earth scientist at Rutgers \nUniversity, explained in the New York Times:\n\n       Physics tells us that sea-level change and temperature \n     change should go hand-in-hand. This new geological record \n     confirms it.\n\n  Sea level rise matters to my constituents and to all coastal \ncommunities. A related study, led by Dr. Robert Strauss, found that \napproximately three-quarters of the tidal flood days now occurring in \ntowns along the east coast are a result of the rise in sea level caused \nby human emissions. For example, looking at tide gauge data, 32 flood \ndays were recorded in the decade from 1955 to 1964 at Annapolis, MD, \nand 34 flood days were recorded in that same period for Charleston, SC. \nIn one decade, there were 32 flood days in Annapolis and 34 flood days \nin Charleston. Scroll forward to the decade 2005 to 2014, and the \nnumber of flood days in Annapolis jumps to 394 from 32--in one decade--\nand 219 flood days were recorded in Charleston.\n  Sea level rise brings coastal erosion, and it brings saltwater \ninundation of coastal marshes and habitats. It amplifies the effects of \nstorm surge and flooding as storms ride ashore on higher seas. It \nchanges flood zones and affects flood insurance for homeowners. These \nare real problems, and they are serious problems.\n  Dr. Strauss explains in a New York Times article this week:\n\n       It's not the tide. It's not the wind. It's us.\n\n  The main culprit is carbon dioxide building up in the atmosphere, \nwhich again in 2015 reached new record levels. To put a little context \non this, for as long as human beings have inhabited planet Earth, we \nhave existed safely in a range between 170 and 300 parts per million of \ncarbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Unfortunately, we broke beyond 300 \nparts per million early last century, and we haven't looked back. We \nhave now exceeded 400 parts per million.\n  Among its harms, this excess carbon dioxide has a particularly \ndamaging chemical effect on our oceans. Oceans, in addition to \nabsorbing 90 percent of the heat, I pointed out, are absorbing about 30 \npercent of the carbon dioxide--it goes right into the oceans--roughly \n600 gigatons since preindustrial times. As all that carbon is absorbed \ninto the oceans, it changes the oceans' chemistry. It makes the oceans \nmore acidic. The chemical reaction is simple, but the effects on the \nocean are serious.\n  This chart shows ocean pH--or acidity--over the past 25 million \nyears, and we can see some variation across those millions of years. \nThis is what is projected for the next 100 years: pH drops equals \nacidity rises.\n  According to a research article published in the journal Nature \nGeoscience, the rate of change in ocean acidity is already faster than \nat any time recorded in the past 50 million years. Scientists go back \nand they can see this in the geologic record. We have broken every \nrecord for 50 million years--millions of years before human beings were \never on the planet.\n  This all may sound esoteric, but it has real hometown consequences \nfor Rhode Island, where coastal life defines our heritage, our culture, \nand our economy. Fishing is big business in my State. Rhode Island's \nannual farmed oyster production, for instance, is valued at over $5 \nmillion. But carbon pollution is changing the very chemistry in which \nthose oysters must survive.\n  Research on the effects of ocean acidification on shellfish and other \nmarine life can barely keep up with a rapidly acidifying ocean--another \nreason we need more money for research. Change is coming at us faster. \nWe have to speed up the pace of research to understand it. But what we \ndo know is that shellfish, such as mussels, clams, and oysters, make \ntheir shells from calcium carbonate, and calcium carbonate dissolves in \nacidified seawater.\n  Here is how Bob Rheault, executive director of the East Coast \nShellfish Growers Association, put it:\n\n       The only thing we know for sure is that the larvae, in that \n     first 48-hour period before they start feeding, are \n     tremendously susceptible to dissolution. Their energy budget \n     goes negative because they haven't started to feed yet, and \n     if they haven't got enough energy in that egg and they're \n     starting to dissolve, then it takes extra energy to lay down \n     shell, and they sometimes don't make it.\n\n  Here we see normal, healthy oyster larvae in those first few crucial \ndays of development, compared to larvae growing in more acidic ocean \nwater.\n  NOAA scientists have projected that the world's oceans and coastal \nestuaries will become 150 percent more acidic by 2100. This could mean \ndisaster for shellfish--a $1 billion industry around the country. U.S. \nshellfish production is currently expected to see a 10- to 25-percent \nreduction in the next five decades, according to the Woods Hole \nOceanographic Institute. Again, pardon me for being serious about this, \nbut it is currently predicted that a major industry in my State is \ngoing to be knocked down 10 to 25 percent because we are making our \noceans acidic with carbon pollution.\n  A study published last year found that Rhode Island's shellfish \npopulations are especially vulnerable. Mark Gibson is the deputy chief \nof marine fisheries at the Rhode Island Department of Environmental \nManagement, and he calls ocean acidification a ``significant threat'' \nto local fisheries. I don't know how many Senators are expected to \nforget or ignore a significant threat to an industry in their home \nState because it is inconvenient for lobbyists and for the fossil fuel \nindustry, but I don't think that is a fair thing to ask of me.\n  But acidification is not the only problem for fishermen. In a 2015 \nsurvey from the Center for American Progress, 40 percent of fishermen \nin the Northeast reported catching new fish species they don't usually \nsee in the waters they fish. Rhode Islanders are starting to catch \ntarpon and grouper, usually tropical fish; our valuable winter flounder \nfishery is virtually gone; and our lobstermen have to go farther and \nfarther out to sea to find cooler waters where they can catch their \nlobsters.\n  Among the fishermen surveyed, 80 percent of those who noticed \n``warmer water temperatures'' attribute it to climate change. This is \nnew. When I first got to the Senate, if I went down to Galilee--Rhode \nIsland's largest fishing port--and tried to talk to the fishermen there \nabout climate change or ocean acidification, I was lucky if they didn't \nthrow me off the pier. They didn't want to hear about it. But then it \nstarted to hit home. Now fishermen\n\n[[Page S954]]\n\ncome to me and say: Sheldon, it is getting weird out there. Sheldon, \nthis is not my grandfather's ocean any longer. These are men who fished \nwith their grandfathers, who fished with their fathers, and who now \nhave their own boats. They know these waters, and when they say that \nthe ocean has changed and it is getting weird out there, we should \nlisten. They are on the water every day, and they see these changes \nhappen before their very eyes.\n  I hope my Republican colleagues are like those fishermen. I am sure \nsome of them probably want to throw me off a pier for all these talks, \nbut mostly they probably just don't want to hear about climate change. \nBut what I am hoping is that soon they will hear it from the fishermen \nin their own States, or their farmers or their foresters, and that they \nwill hear it from their State health officials, their State emergency \nofficials, their own State universities, and they will listen. When \nthey do, they will realize the fossil fuel industry has been \nduplicitous with them and has been leading them away from their own \nState's best interests. They will learn that the fossil fuel industry \nlobbyists are false friends as well as greedy ones.\n  We have a clear scientific understanding of the problem. Yet \nrelentless fossil fuel opposition prevents us from moving toward a \nsolution. It is a disgrace, frankly.\n  It is time to pay attention to reality, to the evidence, to what our \nfarmers and foresters, and, yes, our fishermen are telling us. It is \ntime to shut off the toxic polluter-paid politics that cloud this issue \nand give Washington a dirty name. It is time, indeed, to wake up.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Tribute To Alee Lockman\n\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I rise to recognize Alee Lockman.\n  Alee Lockman is the pride of Brockton, MT. In fact, Alee grew up on \nher family's wheat farm 10 miles north of Brockton in eastern Montana. \nAlee is also the pride of Froid High School, a classic high school in \nMontana. She was the valedictorian of a graduating class size of six. \nAlee graduated from Froid High School and went on to Harvard and \ngraduated in 2010.\n  Alee Lockman also served as my communications director for the past 3 \nyears. She came back to Washington when I was elected to the House and \nserved on my team there. She worked on my campaign staff as well when \nwe ran for the U.S. Senate. And thanks to Alee's tireless work and \nstrong work ethic, we were able to win that race, and she came over to \nthe Senate side and served as my communications director there for the \npast year-plus.\n  She played an absolutely invaluable role in my office. She is a \nbrilliant, creative thinker who has a talent unparalleled.\n  I will never forget our road trips across Montana. There were times \nwhen we would spend countless hours in a small, little compact car--I \nam used to driving my big Ford pickup--that we would rent and literally \ndrive thousands of miles across Montana and visit all the small towns.\n  Nobody was a greater advocate for rural Montana issues--somebody who \nlived it and breathed it her entire life--than Alee Lockman. In fact, \none of the best nights of the month was our monthly tele-townhall \nmeeting, where tens of thousands of Montanans would know Alee's voice \nbecause she would always introduce me. I always took pride in \nannouncing: ``You just heard from Alee Lockman from Brockton, MT.''\n  I could always count on her to provide wisdom and much needed \ninsight, particularly when it came to my prolific social media feeds. \nSometimes Alee would place guardrails around what I probably should or \nshould not be saying.\n  We are going to miss Alee Lockman. Alee has gone on to pursue a \ngreat, new opportunity, which I am very excited about for her, and I \nwish her the very best.\n  I wish to thank Alee Lockman for her service to the people of \nMontana, to this Nation, and to this institution.\n  You are going to be missed, Alee, and we wish you the best of luck in \nyour future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/23/senate-section/article/S954-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DAINES.

Mr. President, today I wish to discuss S. 483, the \nEnsuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act, which the \nJudiciary Committee reported out by voice vote right before we went \ninto recess. At the outset, I would like to thank Senator Whitehouse \nfor his important work on this bill. He and his staff have been crucial \npartners in helping to move this legislation forward.\n  S. 483 will bring much-needed clarity to several key provisions of \nthe Controlled Substances Act. In particular, it will better delineate \nthe standards a company must satisfy in order to obtain a Controlled \nSubstances Act registration and the circumstances under which a \nregistration may be suspended without an adjudicative proceeding.\n  To elaborate briefly on this second point, under the terms of the \nControlled Substances Act, the Attorney General may suspend a \nregistration to manufacture or distribute controlled substances without \ncourt process if she determines there is an imminent danger to the \npublic health and safety, but the Controlled Substances Act does not \ndefine what constitutes an imminent danger. S. 483 clarifies the \nAttorney General's authority under this provision by specifying that \nimminent danger means that, ``due to failure of the registrant to \nmaintain effective controls against diversion or otherwise comply with \nthe obligations of a registrant under this title or title III, there is \na substantial likelihood of an immediate threat that death, serious \nbodily harm, or abuse of a controlled substance will occur in the \nabsence of an immediate suspension of the registration.''\n  It is the intent of the bill authors that the phrase ``substantial \nlikelihood of an immediate threat that death, serious bodily harm, or \nabuse of a controlled substance will occur'' include situations where \nevidence of diversion indicates there is a substantial likelihood that \nabuse of a controlled substance will occur--that is it is the intent of \nthe authors that this language authorize the Attorney General to issue \nan immediate suspension order in cases where evidence of diversion \npoints to a substantial likelihood of abuse, provided the other \nconditions for issuing such an order are met.\n  In addition to these important clarifications, S. 483 will also \nfacilitate greater collaboration between registrants and relevant \nFederal actors in combatting prescription drug abuse. In particular, \nthe bill provides a mechanism for companies who inadvertently violate \nthe Controlled Substances Act to submit a corrective action plan to \nremediate the violation before their registration is suspended and the \nsupply of drugs to patients is interrupted. This provision will \nencourage greater self-reporting of violations and promote joint \nefforts between government and private actors to stem the tide of \nprescription drug abuse. It will also help ensure that supply chains \nremain intact for legitimate uses such as the alleviation of pain and \nillness.\n  S. 483 takes a balanced approach to the problem of prescription drug \nabuse. It clarifies and further defines the Attorney General's \nenforcement powers while seeking to avoid situations that may lead to \nan interruption in the supply of medicine to suffering patients. It \nreflects a measured, carefully negotiated compromise between \nstakeholders and law enforcement that will enable both to work together \nmore effectively. I thank Senator Whitehouse again for his work on this \nbill and urge my colleagues to give it their strong support.\n\n[[Page S955]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/23/senate-section/article/S955-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP.

Mr. President, we have witnessed in this administration \nExecutive overreach with increasing boldness. One manifestation of \nExecutive overreach is the shocking indifference with which \ndepartmental agencies spurn the congressionally mandated rulemaking \nprocesses in favor of regulating under the guise of ``guidance \ndocuments.'' Guidance documents in their proper form advise the public \nof their obligations under existing law and, therefore, merely \ninterpret the law without imposing any additional obligation. Agencies \nare quick to echo that guidance documents do not have the force and \neffect of law; yet governmentwide, agencies increasingly have used \nguidance as an end-run around the rulemaking process in violation of \nFederal law.\n  The Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights is such an \noffender. Their guidance documents, including Dear Colleague letters on \nharassment and bullying, issued October 23, 2010, and sexual violence, \nissued April 4, 2011, purport to merely interpret title IX of the \nEducation Amendments of 1972, yet advance troublesome policies not \ncontemplated by the text of title IX or its implementing regulations.\n  I appreciate the fact that these guidance documents predated Mr. \nKing's service at the Department of Education, and I do not assert that \nhe had any role in developing or issuing the letters. However, in a \nletter dated January 7, 2016, I asked him to clarify his role as Acting \nSecretary, in no uncertain terms, that the policies expounded in the \n2010 and 2011 letters not required by the terms of title IX cannot be \ngrounds for any adverse action.\n  To my disappointment, his response failed to do so. Mr. King should \ncommit to use the office of the Secretary to rein in the regulatory \nabuses within the Department of Education and encourage his Cabinet \ncounterparts to do the same. Until such time as such commitments are \nmade, I intend to object to his nomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/23/senate-section/article/S955-3", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to offer a few words remembering \nAssociate Justice Antonin Scalia of the Supreme Court. America has lost \na legal giant and tireless defender of the Constitution. Justice Scalia \ndedicated his life to his country and the rule of law. His passing is a \nsignificant loss for the Court and the United States.\n  Few Associate Justices of the Supreme Court capture the attention of \nboth lawyers and non-lawyers like Justice Scalia has throughout his \ncareer. Antonin Scalia used wit, humor, and colorful writing to \ncaptivate Americans in his judicial opinions and educational talks. \nJustice Scalia also felt strongly about protecting the rights of the \nindividual and did so in monumental opinions interpreting the First, \nSecond, Fourth, and Sixth Amendments. In the immediate days following \nhis passing, I received substantial correspondence from Wyoming \nresidents praising his work for upholding the Constitution and \ndefending individual liberties.\n  A number of my colleagues have already mentioned how Justice Scalia \nwould always put the Constitution first, even if it conflicted with his \npersonal views. This was the case when Justice Scalia voted to uphold \nthe right of protesters to burn the American flag--even though he \nstrongly disagreed with flag desecration.\n  When it comes to privacy, Justice Scalia established himself as a \nleading champion of the Fourth Amendment, particularly when it comes to \nprivacy in one's home or car.\n  Justice Scalia also authored a landmark majority opinion upholding \ngun rights under the Second Amendment which reiterated the \nconstitutional right of an individual to keep and bear arms in the \nDistrict of Columbia, a right which was later incorporated to all \nStates.\n  Justice Scalia also fought ardently for religious freedoms under the \nEstablishment Clause and joined others in upholding freedom of \nassociation under the First Amendment.\n  From his earliest days on the Supreme Court, Scalia approached the \nConstitution and statutes passed by Congress as a textualist. He \nprotected the vertical separation of power in our federalist system \nwhich keeps decisions closer to the people and fought for the \nseparation of powers amongst the three branches of Federal Government.\n  Most recently, Justice Scalia challenged Executive overreach in the \nunanimous decision of the Supreme Court invalidating President Obama's \nunconstitutional recess appointments to the National Labor Relations \nBoard and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n  Finally, Justice Scalia's writings, judicial philosophy, and lectures \nhave influenced future generations of lawyers and jurists. Whether, \nduring oral argument, asking if the government can ``make people buy \nbroccoli'' or referencing Cole Porter lyrics in opinions, Scalia used \nwords to rebut, challenge, and persuade.\n  Justice Scalia's legacy and legal precedents will stand the test of \ntime, and our Nation owes him a debt of gratitude for his service. My \nwife, Diana, and I send our prayers and condolences to the Scalia \nfamily.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/23/senate-section/article/S955-4", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S955-S956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS FOUNDATION AND 45TH \n             ANNIVERSARY OF THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS\n\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the 40th anniversary \nof the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, Incorporated, CBCF. It is \nfitting that during the month we celebrate Black history, we \ncommemorate the decades of service CBCF has rendered to the Nation by \nadvancing policy issues that impact the global Black community.\n  Black History Month is an ideal time to reflect on the ways the law \nhas shaped the African-American experience. Our Nation has come a long \nway since the time when schools were segregated by law. No longer does \nthe law bar African Americans from the voting booth. Today we have \nAfrican-American Members of Congress who help craft the law; Yet the \nimportant work of civil rights remains unfinished.\n  Since 1976, CBCF has been a critical partner with Congress in the \nfight for equal rights. As a nonpartisan nonprofit institute dedicated \nto eliminating racial disparities, CBCF has served as an inspiration to \nnot just African Americans, but to people across the globe. However, \nits legacy and impact have been far from symbolic.\n  From helping to make the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., a \nFederal holiday, to rebuilding communities impacted by Hurricane \nKatrina, to working on major legislation like the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, to building a virtual library project to shed \na spotlight on the work of Black-elected officials, CBCF has stood \nalongside African-American elected leaders on some of the most critical \npolicy issues of our time.\n  As we move in 2016, the work of CBCF is more important than ever. \nToday people of color face disparities in the areas of criminal justice \nreform, voting rights, and economic development both at home and \nabroad. Its founders--Nira Hardon Long, Albert Nellum, and \nCongresswoman Yvonne Burke--envisioned CBCF as an important contributor \nin the quest for racial equality.\n  The need remains. The vision lives on. And we have more work to do. I \nam confident CBCF will continue to serve our country admirably and \nprotect African Americans vigorously. I salute CBCF for their service \nand celebrate their 40th anniversary.\n  This year also marks the 45th anniversary of the founding of the \nCongressional Black Caucus, CBC. I express my appreciation to the 13 \nfounding members of the CBC in 1971 and the 17 members of the CBC class \nof 1976 for paving the way for African-American Members of Congress, \nlike me, to follow in their\n\n[[Page S956]]\n\nfootsteps. Their dedication to ensuring America fulfills the promise of \nequal justice for all serves as a constant inspiration. I stand on the \nshoulders of giants in CBC, and I salute their sacrifice.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/23/senate-section/article/S956-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         VERMONT ESSAY CONTEST\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I would like to extend my sincere \nthanks for the continued involvement of Vermont high school teachers \nand principals in my annual State of the Union essay contest. This \nyear, 799 Vermont students from 39 high schools wrote essays detailing \nwhat they thought were the most important issues facing our country. We \ncould not have achieved this level of participation without the help of \nengaged educators throughout the State.\n  Each and every day, teachers encourage students to think critically \nand develop their own ideas. I appreciate that so many teachers have \nused the essay contest to challenge their students to share what they \nconsider to be priorities for the United States. This year's \nsubmissions were some of the most thoughtful to date, and I have no \ndoubt that is because of the encouragement of engaged teachers from \nacross the State.\n  The success of this essay contest also depends on a dedicated team of \nvolunteer judges, all of whom are also high school teachers. This year, \nwe asked our five judges--some of whom have served for many years--to \nread more essays in less time, and we greatly appreciate the serious \nconsideration and commitment they brought to the task. I would like to \ntake a moment to recognize this year's judges: Bradley Archer, \nWoodstock Union High School; Jason Gorczyk, Milton High School; Krista \nHuling, South Burlington High School; Roberta ``Cookie'' Steponaitis, \nVergennes Union High School; and Terri Vest, Twinfield Union School.\n  I would also like to enter into the Record the names of the 39 high \nschools that participated this year:\n  Arlington Memorial High School, Bellows Falls Union High School, \nBellows Free Academy--Fairfax, Blue Mountain High School, Burlington \nHigh School, Burlington Technical Center, Burr & Burton Academy, Canaan \nMemorial High School, Champlain Valley Union High School, Colchester \nHigh School, Enosburg Falls High School, Green Mountain Technology and \nCareer Center, Hanover High School, Hartford High School, Harwood Union \nHigh School, Leland and Gray Union High School, Mill River Union High \nSchool, Milton High School, Missisquoi Valley Union High School, Mount \nMansfield Union High School, Mt.

Vermont Commons School and \nMissisquoi Valley Union High School had more than 25 participants. \nGreen Mountain Technology and Career Center and South Burlington High \nSchool both had more than 50 students write essays. Mount Abraham Union \nHigh School had more than 100 members of their freshmen class write \nessays.

A bill to provide for conservation, enhanced recreation \nopportunities, and development of renewable energy in the California \nDesert Conservation Area, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the \nCalifornia Desert Conservation and Recreation Act.\n  In February of 2015, I, along with Sen. Boxer, introduced a bill \nunder the same name. That bill from 2015 included a number of \nconservation and recreation provisions that the President could not \ninclude in his recent designation of three national monuments.\n  The President's designation this past month of those new national \nmonuments--Mojave Trails, Sand to Snow, and Castle Mountain--was a \nmajor milestone in our efforts to protect the desert. But, due to \nlimitations under the Antiquities Act, the President's executive action \nleft out several key parts of our desert bill from 2015. These \nremaining provisions were vital to many of the groups and organizations \nthat came together to support our bill in 2015.\n  I made a commitment to those groups to enact the entire bill, not \njust parts of the bill. And I intend to fulfill that promise. The \nremaining provisions included in today's legislation do the following: \nenhance recreational opportunities by establishing 142,000 acres of \npermanent Off-Highway Vehicle recreation areas; further expand \nwilderness areas in the desert, by designating five additional \nwilderness areas that cover 230,000 acres of land near Fort Irwin; \nensure clean and free-flowing rivers, through the designation of 77 \nmiles of rivers as Wild and Scenic Rivers; add to our national parks, \nby expanding Death Valley National Park Wilderness by 39,000 acres and \nJoshua Tree National Park by 4,500 acres; expand National Scenic Areas, \nby adding 18,610 acres to the Alabama Hills National Scenic Area in \nInyo County; protect important cultural resources, by requiring the \nDepartment of the Interior to protect petroglyphs and other cultural \nresources in San Bernardino and Imperial County; and, facilitate \nrenewable energy development in a way that protects delicate habitat.\n  I want to be very clear: I intend to continue to work with my \ncolleagues in the Senate and House to advance this important bill and \nthe wilderness protections, national park additions, recreation area \ndesignations and other renewable energy provisions that were not \nimplemented through the Antiquities Act.\n  This legislation balances the many competing uses for public lands \nacross the California desert: It protects fragile ecosystems and \nsignificant cultural resources, provides for increased recreational \nopportunities, and encourages sensible renewable energy development. \nThis current bill includes all of the carefully negotiated provisions \nfrom the bill I introduced in February, minus the three monuments.\n  This bill reflects our attempt to achieve consensus among the \ncompeting uses of desert land and the many stakeholders involved, \nincluding environmental groups, State and local governments, the off-\nroad community, cattle ranchers, mining interests, the Defense \nDepartment, energy companies, California's public utility companies, \nand many others.\n  As a result of the general public's robust participation, we have put \ntogether a bipartisan proposal that charts a commonsense path forward \nfor the California desert. We made a commitment to these stakeholders \nto enact these commonsense solutions, and I intend to follow through on \nthat promise.\n  I want to highlight some of the key provisions of this legislation:\n  By designating five new wilderness areas, this bill protects fragile \ndesert ecosystems across 230,000 acres of wilderness near Fort Irwin. \nThis includes 88,000 acres of Avawatz Mountains, 8,000-acre Great Falls \nBasin Wilderness, the 80,000-acre Soda Mountains Wilderness, and the \n32,500-acre Death Valley Wilderness.\n  These proposed wilderness areas have something for everyone: Desert \nsolitude; abundant hiking options and rock climbing routes; and \nhorseback riding and hunting for those that wish to experience a truly \nremarkable backcountry experience.\n  This bill is more than just wilderness, however. It also designates \nfour new wild and scenic rivers, totaling 77 miles in length. These \nrivers and creeks are important, and rare, riparian areas in the heart \nof the arid desert. This designation will ensure that those rivers and \ncreeks remain clean and free-flowing and that their immediate \nenvironments are preserved. These beautiful waterways are Deep Creek \nand the Whitewater River in and near the San Bernardino National \nForest, as well as the Amargosa River and Surprise Canyon Creek near \nDeath Valley National Park.\n  Conserving pristine desert land such as this is most definitely in \nthe interests of our country. The California desert is a very special \nplace and it deserves to stay that way.\n  The legislation also provides permanent protection for five existing \nOff-Highway Vehicle Areas covering approximately 142,000 acres.\n  The bill also releases 126,000 acres of land from their existing \nwilderness study area designation in response to requests from local \ngovernment and recreation users. This will allow the land to be made \navailable for other purposes, including recreational off-highway \nvehicle use on designated routes. Although the President's recent \nexecutive action could not include these permanent protections, off-\nroaders are a vital part of the coalition we put together. They deserve \ncertainty about their future enjoyment of the land, just as \nconservationists now have certainty as a result of the monument \ndesignations. With this bill introduction, I renew my pledge to work \nclosely with the off-road community.\n  We must also take into account another use of the desert land: \nrenewable energy. And I believe that we can accomplish the twin aims of \nhonoring our commitment to conservation and fulfilling California's \npledge to develop a clean energy portfolio. Balancing conservation, \ndevelopment and other uses is possible, we just need to come up with \nthe right solutions. Thankfully, some of these compromises are already \nin place.\n\n[[Page S962]]\n\n  By April 2009, solar and wind companies had proposed 28 projects to \nbe included in the Mojave Trails National Monument, including sites on \nformer Catellus lands intended for permanent conservation. I visited \nsome of those sites at the time, including one particularly beautiful \narea known as the Broadwell Valley, where thousands of acres of \npristine lands were proposed for development. Seeing it first hand, I \nquickly came to the conclusion that those lands were simply not the \nright place for renewable energy development.\n  Since then, 26 of the 28 applications have been withdrawn. Let me \nexplain why this happened. First, the Energy and Interior Departments \ndeveloped new solar energy zones. These zones allow projects to be \ndeveloped on lands least likely to harm plant and wildlife species, and \nallow projects to be completed faster and with fewer conflicts. This is \na smart compromise. Second, California has worked closely with Federal \nagencies to develop the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan. This \nblueprint will help identify pristine lands that warrant protection and \ndirect energy projects elsewhere. This is a fair balancing of \npriorities, and I think it provides a clear path forward.\n  The bill I am introducing also takes additional action to help \npromote responsible renewable energy development through state land \nexchanges. There are currently about 370,000 acres of isolated parcels \nof state lands spread across the California desert. These state-owned \nlands are largely unusable, due to their location inside Federal \nnational parks, wilderness, monuments, and conservation areas. The bill \naddresses this problem by requiring the Department of the Interior to \ndevelop and implement a plan with the state to exchange these state \nlands for other BLM or General Services Administration owned property \nin the next ten years. By swapping state land that is often surrounded \nby wilderness and national parks for other federal land, these \nexchanges will provide California with sites for renewable energy \nproduction, recreation or other uses.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues in both the House and the Senate to \ntake a hard look at this legislation. We have made great strides in the \npast twenty years to strike the right balance between desert \nconservation, recreational uses, and the development of our natural \nresources. I believe this legislation continues in that fine tradition. \nBuilt on a foundation of consensus and compromise, this legislation \nfulfills our promise to the next generation that they will have the \nsame opportunities to indulge in the best the California desert has to \noffer.\n  I am hopeful this Congress will take this legislation up and move it \nforward. It's the right thing to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/23/senate-section/article/S962-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3307.
