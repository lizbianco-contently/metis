Mr. President, Republicans and Democrats have long \nagreed that the No Child Left Behind law is broken and needs to be \nfixed, but the Senate didn't do anything about it for 7 long years, \nmissing its deadlines repeatedly.\n  The new majority in Congress thought it was time to change that \ndynamic. We thought it was time for bipartisan action instead. That is \nwhy we are taking up the Every Child Achieves Act today. It is \nbipartisan legislation drafted by a Republican former Education \nSecretary, Senator Alexander, and a Democratic former preschool \nteacher, Senator Murray. It passed through committee with the support \nof every single Democrat and every single Republican.\n  Just think about it. From third rail to unanimous bipartisan support, \nnow that is an impressive achievement. It shows how a functioning \ncommittee process and a functioning Senate can, with hard work from \nSenators such as Alexander and Murray, break through the gridlock. It \nis another encouraging sign for Americans who like what they are seeing \nfrom a new Congress that is back to work and back on their side.\n  The American people know education is an issue that touches almost \nevery single person in our country. They know how critical it is to our \nchildren's future and many are upset with an education system in \ndesperate need of reform.\n  Although No Child Left Behind was well intentioned and laid the \nground work for important reform to our education system, it is now \nclear that some of its requirements have become unachievable. For \ninstance, basically every school is now considered failing under the \nlaw, and because the law has become so broken, the administration has \nfound ways to effectively dictate education policy from the executive \nbranch. That is not the right approach for our kids. The White House \nshouldn't be trying to run your local school board.\n  The Every Child Achieves Act would put an end to that kind of control \nfrom thousands of miles away. It would do so by eliminating onerous \nFederal mandates and reining in the power of the executive branch so \nStates cannot be coerced into adopting measures such as Common Core.\n  Instead of more Federal control, the bipartisan Every Child Achieves \nAct aims to empower teachers, parents, and students to improve \neducation where they live. It would restore responsibility and \naccountability to States and local school districts. It would give them \nincreased flexibility to design and implement their own education \nstandards and programs. This bipartisan bill would also allow States to \ndevelop their own accountability models to include other measures \nbeyond testing to determine student achievement and school quality and \nto determine the best ways to turn around underperforming schools.\n  Nothing out of Washington could ever solve all of our education \nchallenges overnight, but the Every Child Achieves Act takes positive \nsteps forward. It recognizes that your local school board shouldn't, in \neffect, be run from hundreds or even thousands of miles away. It \nrecognizes that States and parents are going to know far more about the \nneeds of their schools and their students than some detached bureaucrat \nin Washington. There are ideas both parties should support and, in \nfact, there are ideas both parties just did support unanimously in \ncommittee.\n  If Senators have changes they would like to see in the bill, now is \nthe time for colleagues to work with the bill managers to get their \namendments moving. We already have several lined up.\n  This is a good debate for the country, so let's continue working \ncooperatively across the aisle to empower States and parents, instead \nof Federal bureaucrats, to enact the education policies that actually \nwork for their students.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/08/senate-section/article/S4805-6", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4805-S4806]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, one of the legendary Senators who recently \nretired from the Senate after many years in the House and the Senate, \nTom Harkin, if he were here, would be on the floor taking issue with \nwhat the Republican leader just said.\n  Tom Harkin tried very hard to have a reauthorization of the \nelementary and secondary education bill. Why didn't he get it? Because \nRepublicans blocked us from doing it. So it is nice that my friend the \nRepublican leader comes and talks about all the great things being done \nin Congress now, but the fact is it could have been done many years ago \nhad we had a little bit of cooperation from the Republicans.\n  The new Republican majority has ignored upcoming deadlines and \nneglected to address urgent problems facing our great country. I am \nsaying that--and that is just an understatement. Instead, they have \ngoverned through a series of last-minute, manufactured crises that \nincrease uncertainty and impose unnecessary and wasteful costs on our \ncountry. In just a few minutes, we are going to debate the education \nmatter, as we should.\n  But as important as that is, it is extremely important we don't take \nour eye off the prize. And what is that? Because in just a few months, \nthe government is going to run out of money. Unless we can reach a \nbipartisan budget agreement, our Nation will be faced with yet another \nridiculous and damaging government shutdown.\n  Now, my Republican colleagues understand what I just said because \nthey are the ones who created the last government shutdown. It was a \ncrushing blow to our economy. Sadly, the only reason we were able to \nreopen the government is because Democrats voted almost unanimously to \nreopen the government. Sadly, to just take one example, well over half \nof the Republicans, about two-thirds of the Republicans in the House, \nvoted to keep the government closed. How about that.\n  So another government shutdown would be unacceptable. But remember, \nit has been done before--with joy--by my Republican colleagues. \nSequestration is another thing they seem to like.\n  So having had that as a historical background, we ought to be able to \nget together, compromise, and reach a bipartisan solution for our \ncountry in a timely, responsible way. You would think so.\n  As happened here before we left for the July 4th recess, there was an \neffort made to move to the Defense appropriations bill, and that was \nstopped because we believe that what we need to fund more than defense \nis we need to fund the whole government. We stand ready to work with \nRepublicans to reach a bipartisan solution. Unfortunately, it seems as \nif Republican leadership shows no interest in compromise. Democrats \nhave urged them to come to the table now, and they have refused.\n  Unless we act now, we will be faced with another Republican-imposed \ncrisis at the end of this fiscal year. This should be avoided, and it \ncan be avoided. Don't just take my word for it. There are Republicans \nin the House who believe the time for games and brinkmanship should be \nover. The New York Times today reports that high-ranking Republicans in \nthe House are calling for negotiations again now:\n\n       Senior House Appropriations Committee members, including \n     the panel's chairman, Representative Harold Rogers of \n     Kentucky, have already told Republican leaders that the time \n     to negotiate a way out of the impasse is now, not in the \n     shadow of a papal visit or a government shutdown on October \n     1.\n\n  There is also in this same article, in the last paragraph, something \nthat is quite important.\n\n       ``The reality is we still live in a divided government,'' \n     Mr. Cole said.\n\n  He is one of the senior Members of the House Republican caucus.\n\n       ``It's not as if the Democrats can be shut out. . . .''\n\n  And we proved that with a vote on the Democratic response to the \nefforts to move to Defense appropriations. Continuing:\n\n       ``It's not as if the Democrats can be shut out, but they \n     can't dictate to us any more than we can dictate to them. \n     It's time to sit down and see if we can make a deal.''\n\n  We can reach a deal.\n  So I urge Republicans to follow the leadership of Chairman Rogers and \nlong-time Representative Cole and work to get this process going now. \nLet's not wait yet another week. Certainly we shouldn't wait any \nlonger. Let's move forward. Let's not wait until the last minute. Let's \nnot risk another shutdown. Let's sit down and talk to each other and \nreach a bipartisan budget agreement on behalf of the American people. \nThe President and his people would be happy to be engaged any time on \nthis.\n  I certainly hope we can move forward and not have another repeat of \nwhat the Republicans did to this country just a short time ago and \nclose it down.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/08/senate-section/article/S4806-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4806]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, as the Democratic leader leaves the \nfloor, I thank him again for his cooperation and that of Senator Murray \nof Washington in creating an environment in which we can move ahead on \nthis bill. I greatly appreciate that and so do other Senators. That is \ndemonstrated with the fact that we have had dozens of Senators who have \ncome forward with amendments. Dozens of amendments have been agreed to, \nand Senator Murray and I will be recommending to the full Senate that \nwe adopt those amendments soon.\n  I wish to take a moment to reflect on what we are doing in the Senate \ntoday. We spent a lot of time on national defense issues. The \ndistinguished Senator who is presiding today is a member of our \nIntelligence Committee. He hears a great deal about ISIS, Iran, and the \nnuclear deal we might have and about what is going on in Syria and \nLebanon, and we want to do our best to be strong militarily so we can \ndefend ourselves in the world. We also want to be strong at home. We \nwant to make sure we have a strong country.\n  Almost all of us agree that the single most important thing we can do \nto ensure our future is to make sure our children and our adults \ncontinue to develop their educational skills, that they learn what they \nneed to know and be able to do.\n  I know in my home State of Tennessee we are trying to compete with \nthe whole world. We are making cars, guns, trucks, all sorts of \ncomputers, and all sorts of manufactured goods that we sell not only in \nthe United States, but we sell them around the world. You walk into the \nNissan plant in Tennessee, which has 7,000 or 8,000 employees today, it \nis the largest auto plant in North America, the most efficient, and \nvery important to our State. It has helped to raise our family incomes \nmore than almost anything that\n\n[[Page S4807]]\n\nhas happened there. But 30 or 40 years ago, it would have had 20,000 or \n25,000 employees; now it has 7,000 or 8,000. Every one of those \nemployees has to have considerable skills. They have to learn \nstatistics and algebra and to speak English well. They have to learn to \nwork with one another. In other words, they have to do well in schools, \nand they have to do well in postsecondary education, which is a \nseparate discussion.\n\n  So we are talking today on the Senate floor--and the House is talking \ntomorrow--about what we can do as the Congress to create an environment \nin which our children can succeed in schools. That is not always on the \nfront pages in Washington, DC, but I can guarantee it is on the front \npages at home. It is on the front pages in the rural areas of New \nMexico, Indiana, and in the cities of New York and Tennessee because \nparents care about it, students care about it, and it is about our \nfuture.\n  The Federal Government has a limited role in elementary and secondary \neducation. The bill we are debating today is called the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act. It funds only about 4 percent of what the \nNation spends on kindergarten through 12th grade. The Federal \nGovernment funds another 4 or 5 percent through different programs, but \nStates and local governments fund about 90 percent of what goes on in \nthe schools.\n  Not only is most of the funding action local, but so is most of the \nreal work--most of the real work. We have 100,000 public schools. We \nhave 50 million children in those schools and 3.5 million teachers. No \none is wise enough to know what to do about helping a third grader \nlearn in a native village in Alaska, in the mountains of Tennessee, and \nin the center of Harlem at the same time. The ones who are closest to \nthe children have the most chance to make a difference. Now, does that \nmean we have nothing to do here about it? No, I don't think it does. I \nthink education is a national concern. But that doesn't mean it has to \nbe a Federal concern run from Washington and the U.S. Department of \nEducation.\n  The first President Bush, in 1989, called all the Governors together \nand established national education goals in math, science, English, \nhistory, and geography. But he didn't pass a law about that. He just \ncreated a consensus about that, and then he led the country in that \ndirection, first through America 2000, which works State by State and \ncommunity by community toward those goals. That was in the early 1990s.\n  That was when we worked together to create higher standards for \nStates. If you are going to have goals, you have to have standards. \nWhere do you get those? Well, Governors worked together to create \nthem--voluntary national standards. Then tests were developed to see \nhow you were doing on the standards--voluntary tests. Then came more \nchoices for parents and then more charter schools, which are public \nschools in which teachers have more freedom to serve the needs of \nchildren presented to them and parents have the opportunity to choose \nthose. Those were the directions the States were going. The States were \ngoing in the direction of better teaching, higher standards, and real \naccountability.\n  Mainly because of the advantage of age, I happened to have been in \nthe middle of all that. I was Governor when ``A Nation at Risk'' came \nout in 1983 and Terrel Bell, President Reagan's Secretary of Education, \nsaid if a foreign country had done to our schools what we had done, we \nwould consider it an act of war. So Governors went to work on that.\n  In the mid-1980s, Governors worked together for a whole year to try \nto get better results, and then throughout the 1990s and then on into \nthe last 10 or 15 years. Now, what has been different about the last 10 \nor 15 years is that the Federal Government has gotten more involved. In \n2001, there was No Child Left Behind. The major contribution of No \nChild Left Behind was to say that we would like to know how the \nchildren are doing--all 50 million of them. So they each were to take a \ntest, two in each year--third grade through the eighth grade, for \nexample, and then again in high school--in reading and math, and then \nthey would take three science tests. Through their career, there were \n17 tests.\n  The testimony before our education committee says those tests should \ntake about 2 hours each. It is not a lot of time. That should be \npublicly reported, and then you disaggregate those tests by various \ngroups so we can see if we are leaving children behind. Are we leaving \nthe African-American kids behind? Are we leaving the White mountain \nkids behind? That is information that we need to know as a society.\n  The bipartisan legislation we are debating on the floor keeps those \ntests because we need to know those measures of achievement. But what \nour legislation does that is different is it says we are going to do \nsomething different about what we do about the results of those tests. \nWe are going to restore that responsibility to the States, the \nclassroom teachers, the school boards, and to the parents. That is \nwhere that belongs, and that has produced a remarkable consensus.\n  Newsweek magazine said this week that No Child Left Behind is the \neducation law that everybody wants to fix--a remarkable consensus about \nthat. And that is true. We hear it from everyone. But what is even more \nremarkable is that there is also a consensus about how to fix it. That \nemerged during our hearings this year, as Senator Murray, the Senator \nfrom Washington and the senior Democrat on our Senate committee that \ndeals with education, looked at the last two Congresses--as I did--and \nshe said: Well, you know, we haven't done so well. We have broken down \nthe parts and differences. So why don't you and I write a bill--Senator \nMurray and I--and present it to our committee for consideration.\n  So we did that--a bipartisan bill. Now, our committee is not just any \nold committee, as the majority leader has said. It has on it some of \nthe most liberal Democrats and some of the most conservative \nRepublicans. So you would think we would have a hard time getting \ntogether, but we did pretty well. We listened to each other, and we \nadjusted our views. We considered a lot of amendments, and we adopted \n29. When it came time to decide if we had done well enough to bring it \nto the floor, the vote was unanimous. Every single Senator voted for \nthat.\n  So we are in a situation today where we have a chance to succeed. The \nHouse of Representatives, apparently, will vote tomorrow on No Child \nLeft Behind--on their version of the bill. If things continue to \nproceed as they are today, we should finish our work next week. Senator \nMurray and I have stayed in touch with President Obama and Secretary \nDuncan, and we know that, in the end, if we get a result, we will need \nto have a Presidential signature. We want a result. We are not here to \nmake a political statement. The lives of the children and the future of \nour country are too important for that. We are not here to play games. \nWe can do that in other places. We are here to get a result and help \nmove our country forward and do it together.\n  I see Senator Murray is here. So I will conclude my remarks and give \nher a chance to say whatever she might like to say. I will conclude \nwith these thoughts. One of the questions we hear is: Are the States \nreally prepared to accept this much responsibility?\n  Now, to a former Governor, such as I am, that is a strange question. \nI look up at Washington when I am home and I say: Are you prepared to \naccept all of this? I trust us. I trust the State much more than \nWashington. But it is a legitimate question. I would answer that, No. \n1, States are better prepared today than they were 15 years ago.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an op-ed from \nthe Washington Post from last weekend written by Anne Holton, the \nSecretary of Education of Virginia.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, July 3, 2015]\n\n      Revising--Not Eliminating--Tests To Make Va. Schools Better\n\n                            (By Anne Holton)\n\n       As the 12-year-old daughter of then-Gov. Linwood Holton \n     Jr., I helped integrate our formerly racially divided public \n     schools here in Virginia. I have spent much of my working \n     life focused on children and families at the margin, with \n     full appreciation of the crucial role education can and must \n     play in helping young people escape poverty and become \n     successful adults.\n       As Virginia's education secretary, I oversee one of the \n     strongest public education systems in the nation. Our \n     graduation rates are\n\n[[Page S4808]]\n\n     well above average, and we outperform most other states on \n     the Nation's Report Card. A significant factor in our success \n     has been the Standards of Learning (SOL) accountability \n     system Virginia implemented in the 1990s. The rest of the \n     nation followed in Virginia's footsteps when No Child Left \n     Behind was signed into law in 2001. Virginia led again when \n     we moved several years ago from assessing for minimum \n     competency to our current college- and career-readiness \n     standards, complete with rigorous, high-stakes testing.\n       Our successes have come with challenges. Parents, educators \n     and students resoundingly tell us that our kids are over-\n     tested and over-stressed. Eight- and 10-year-olds suffer \n     through multi-hour tests that measure their endurance more \n     than their learning. Barely verbal special education students \n     whose individualized education plans are focused on \n     independent living skills are instead drilled incessantly on \n     a handful of facts for a modified SOL exam. Teachers are \n     teaching to the tests. Students' and teachers' love of \n     learning and teaching are sapped.\n       Most troublesome, Virginia's persistent achievement gaps \n     for low-income students have barely budged. We have done a \n     good job of identifying challenges but have been less \n     successful in addressing them. An unintended consequence of \n     our high-stakes approach is that it is now even harder to \n     recruit and retain strong educators in our high-poverty \n     communities. Many of the best opt instead for schools where \n     demographics guarantee better test scores; too often fine \n     teachers leave the profession.\n       In Virginia, we are ready to lead the nation again. Last \n     year, Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) and our General Assembly took \n     bipartisan action to reform the SOLs. We eliminated five end-\n     of-course tests and created an SOL Innovation Committee to \n     recommend further changes. This year--again with strong \n     bipartisan support--we are moving to credit progress and \n     growth more when we evaluate our schools.\n       The parents, educators, school board members, legislators \n     and business leaders on the Innovation Committee are looking \n     more broadly at what our graduates need for success as \n     citizens and workers in the 21st century and at how we can \n     best guide our schools toward those outcomes. Business \n     leaders tell us they need students with skills such as oral \n     communication, teamwork and problem-solving as much as \n     substantive knowledge. As we work to grow and diversify our \n     economy, our Innovation Committee is looking at how our \n     schools can better meet those needs.\n       This approach will probably generate even bolder proposals. \n     Strong accountability will continue to be a hallmark of our \n     system, but we have faith that, as has been said, \n     ``Responsibility and delight can coexist.''\n       Students need congressional leaders to follow Virginia's \n     example of bipartisanship to enact common-sense changes to \n     federal education laws now. Those changes should focus on \n     enabling local and state educators to prepare every child for \n     success as adults and inspire and encourage states. But they \n     also should leave us sufficient flexibility to improve our \n     accountability systems, reintroduce creativity into the \n     classroom and better address persistent achievement gaps.\n       Thankfully, leaders on Capitol Hill are also hearing calls \n     for reform. Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Patty Murray \n     (D-Wash.) have co-sponsored legislation to reauthorize No \n     Child Left Behind. Republicans and Democrats on the Senate \n     Education Committee voted--unanimously--to send it to the \n     full Senate for consideration; it is expected to be taken up \n     soon. The same spirit of bipartisanship was demonstrated in \n     the House recently when Reps. Bobby Scott (D-Va.) and Richard \n     Hanna (R-N.Y.) introduced legislation to improve early \n     learning. I encourage every member of Congress to set aside \n     partisan concerns, find commonalities and take action this \n     year to fix No Child Left Behind so that we can move all our \n     children forward on the road to success.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Ms. Holton started out in a very prominent Republican \nfamily in Virginia, and she ended up in a very prominent Democratic \nfamily in Virginia. But as she points out in her remarks, their work in \neducation is bipartisan. She makes the point about how much progress \nVirginia has made in terms of goals, standards, accountability, and \ntesting. It is very impressive, and most States can say the same.\n  What has happened in the last 15 years is that Governors, school \nleaders, educators, and parents have worked together and created \nstandards, tests, and now accountability systems. In other words, what \ndo you do if things aren't working out the way they should?\n  Second, we have seen the limits of the Federal Government trying to \ndo it. I think President George W. Bush and President Obama deserve \ncredit for looking at our Nation and seeing this is an urgent problem \nand wanting to do more from here. That is an understandable impulse. \nBut there are limits to what you can do from here. We have seen that in \nthe backlash to common core--the academic standard which was \nincentivized or mandated from Washington. We have seen that in the \nbacklash to teacher evaluation defined in Washington.\n  The truth is that too much Washington involvement in setting \nstandards in States and evaluating teachers in cities sets back teacher \nevaluation and higher standards, which to me are the holy grail of K-\nthrough-12 education. The path to higher standards, the path to better \nteaching, the path to real accountability is not through Washington, \nDC. It is through the States.\n  We can create an environment, we can make sure there is not \ndiscrimination, and we can send some money that will help low-income \nchildren. All those things we can do. But then we need to show some \nhumility and recognize, as Carol Burris, Principal of the Year from New \nYork, said: Moms and pops, teachers, and school board members cherish \ntheir children in their own communities, and you don't really get that \nmuch wiser and smarter by flying to Washington and passing a law.\n  So this bill shows that humility. It shows a consensus. It is a good \nexample of how the Senate can work together on an important issue. As I \nsaid, I am grateful to the majority leader for putting it on the floor. \nHe had many choices, but he saw the importance of it. I am grateful to \nthe Democratic leader for some work he has done behind the scenes to \nmake it easier for us to succeed. I thank Senator Reid for that. And I \nam especially grateful to Senator Murray for caring about children and \nher prestigious leadership on this.\n  We are moving well on amendments. I would encourage any Senator with \nanother amendment to come to the floor quickly and let us know about \nit, because other Senators have--and Senator Murray and I have agreed \non--a large number of amendments already that we are going to recommend \nthe Senate adopt by consent. We will have a vote probably around noon. \nWe will vote again this afternoon and again tomorrow morning. We want \nto finish as quickly as possible.\n  Hopefully, the House will succeed, and we will put our bills together \nand present the President with a bill he can sign, and we will fix No \nChild Left Behind, which is the bill Newsweek magazine said is the \neducation law that everybody wants to fix.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, again, I really want to thank my \ncolleague, the senior Senator from Tennessee, for working with me on \nthis bipartisan bill. Senator Alexander and I are both committed to \nfixing the current law known as No Child Left Behind.\n  I am glad we are having this very important debate on the Senate \nFloor. Nearly everyone agrees that No Child Left Behind is badly \nbroken. As I have traveled around my home State of Washington over the \npast decade, I have heard from so many of my constituents--from \nteachers in the classroom to moms in the grocery store to tech company \nCEOs--that we have to fix this law.\n  Our bipartisan bill, the Every Child Achieves Act, is a good step in \nthe right direction. It gives our States more flexibility while also \nincluding Federal guardrails to make sure all students do have access \nto a quality public education. I am looking forward to improving and \nstrengthening this bill throughout the process on the Senate floor and \nbeyond. I am going to continue working on helping our struggling \nschools get the resources they need, and I will be focused on making \nsure all our kids, especially our most vulnerable students, are able to \nlearn and grow and thrive in the classroom.\n  This bill could not be more important for students across the \ncountry, and it is critical for the future of our Nation. When all \nstudents have the chance to learn, we strengthen our future workforce, \nour country grows stronger, and we empower the next generation of \nAmericans to lead the world. So I am looking forward to getting to work \nand hopefully moving forward on fixing No Child Left Behind and making \nsure all of our students can learn regardless of where they live or how \nthey learn or how much money their parents earn.\n  I join with Senator Alexander in encouraging our colleagues to file \ntheir amendments so that we can continue making progress on this very \nimportant piece of legislation.\n\n[[Page S4809]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Hirono-Heller amendment No. 2109, which deals with Asian \nAmerican and Pacific Islander, or AAPI, student data.\n  AAPIs are the fastest growing population in the United States, but it \nis important to highlight that we are not all the same. I know this \nfrom my personal experience.\n  Just a few months ago, I attended the White House state dinner for \nJapanese Prime Minister Abe. The next day, there was a nice photo in \nthe Washington Post with a caption that said, ``Senator Mazie Hirono \nand her guest''--except it wasn't me. It was actually my good friend \nCongresswoman Doris Matsui of California.\n  In my time in Congress, I have often been mistaken for other AAPI \nmembers. Just a few months ago, during the budget debate, when I was on \nthe floor of the Senate, C-SPAN identified me as Senator Daniel K. \nInouye. I have been mistaken for Judy Chu, who is Chinese, and others. \nI may be the only AAPI in the Senate right now, but we are not all the \nsame. We come from different places and have vastly different \nbackgrounds that make us who we are today.\n  The same is true in education. Our current law and the Every Child \nAchieves Act use the broad ``Asian Americans/Pacific Islander'' \ncategory to cover all AAPIs. This AAPI group includes Chinese, \nJapanese, Vietnamese, Asian Indian, Filipino, Korean, Native Hawaiian, \nSamoan, and others.\n  When we look at averages, the AAPI group does very well overall, but \nin fact there is a model minority myth. The current AAPI category hides \nbig achievement gaps between subgroups. For example, 72 percent of \nAsian Indian adults have a bachelor's degree or higher, but only 26 \npercent of Vietnamese adults do, and only 14 percent of Hmong adults \ndo. This adult data comes from the 2010 census. But we don't have data \non how AAPI children are doing.\n  The Hirono-Heller amendment is simple. Today, we already have public \nreport cards on how students in different groups are doing. Parents can \nlook up a school district online and see what percentage of its White \nor Hispanic students are scoring well in reading or math. With our \namendment, districts with large populations of AAPI students will \nsimply add a piece onto their report cards to show how AAPI subgroups \nare doing. Our amendment uses the same 11 categories as the census. \nParents are familiar with it because they filled out the census \ninformation just a few years ago.\n  The Hirono-Heller amendment is a bipartisan compromise. Our amendment \nwould only apply to large school districts with over 1,000 AAPI \nstudents. Let me be clear--not districts with 1,000 students total but \ndistricts with 1,000 AAPI students. Currently, that is only about 400 \nschool districts out of more than 16,000 school districts nationwide. \nLess than 3 percent of school districts would have to do anything at \nall. These districts should want to know how their students are doing \nso they can help all students succeed.\n  Currently, the following States would not be affected at all by our \namendment: Delaware, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, New Hampshire, North \nDakota, South Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming.\n  I have heard concerns that adding this AAPI data would be overly \nburdensome. The bill we are considering today already adds new \nreporting on military-connected student achievement. Districts can \nupdate their data systems to add checkboxes for military-connected \nchildren and AAPI children at the same time. This is not overly \nburdensome. Just as we are adding a new field to cover military-\nconnected students, adding new fields that include AAPI subgroups will \nbe just upgrading the software schools use.\n  In fact, the Hawaii Department of Education, DOE, is a national \nleader in using AAPI data. Hawaii DOE collects AAPI data on student \nregistration forms. They easily put the data in their computer systems, \nwhich all staff can access. Having AAPI subgroup data is helpful for \nHawaii's school administrators and policymakers, who analyze \nachievement gaps in college and career readiness, set statewide \nstrategy, and then hire staff and target extra help to the highest need \nstudents. Hawaii DOE also shares the data with the University of Hawaii \nsystem to collaborate on student outcomes, such as credit completion \nand reducing remedial ed.\n  Principals who learn that a certain AAPI subgroup is doing poorly in \ntheir own school can choose to hire more staff for outreach to that \ncommunity or can partner with community groups on afterschool programs, \net cetera. Teachers can spend more time on parent outreach to help \nhigh-need students in their classroom. That is why the Hirono-Heller \namendment has the support of the National Association of Elementary \nSchool Principals, the National Association of Secondary School \nPrincipals, and the National Education Association.\n  Districts in North Carolina, California, Washington, and others are \ndoing similar work. Other districts around the country can make the \nappropriate changes to their systems. There are automatic software \nupdates for student data systems that can add new data fields.\n  It is important to share the data publicly. Community groups can \nhighlight best practices among schools that serve their students well \nand encourage other schools to improve. Parents deserve to have this \ndata, too.\n  In the coming days, we will be discussing traditional public schools, \npublic charter schools, and private schools. No matter where you stand \non these issues, parents deserve to know how their schools are serving \nthe needs of their kids so they can best help their children succeed.\n  Our amendment is endorsed also by school choice advocates such as the \nNational Association of Public Charter Schools.\n  Just like current law in the broader ESEA bill we are discussing, \nthere is no reporting if a subgroup is too small to maintain student \nprivacy.\n  Our amendment was carefully crafted with the support of the National \nCoalition of Asians and Pacific Americans, the Mexican American Legal \nDefense and Education Fund, National Council of La Raza, the NAACP, and \nover 100 other civil rights, educators, and women's groups and the \ndisability community. They worked together very closely on the language \nand agreed that data disaggregation for AAPI subgroups is a top \npriority.\n  AAPI groups across the country are making their choices heard by \nposting photos of why they are more than just a large Asian \npopulation. They are posting these pictures on Tumbler, Twitter, and \nFacebook. In fact, I saw one of those postings where students were \nholding up placards that say: I am AAPI, but I am also Japanese. I am \nAAPI, but I am also Korean.\n\n  Join them at hashtag ``All Students Count.''\n  I thank Senator Heller and his staff for their support and hard work \non this bipartisan compromise bill. I also thank Senator Reid of \nNevada, Senator Baldwin, Senator Boxer, Senator Cantwell, Senator \nCasey, Senator Feinstein, Senator Franken, Senator Markey, and Senator \nSchatz for cosponsoring my stand-alone bill, the All Students Count \nAct, which goes further than this amendment we will be voting on today.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment because, in fact, all \nstudents count.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nuntil 12 noon be equally divided between the two managers or their \ndesignees; further, that at 12 noon, the Senate vote on the following \namendments, with no second-degree amendments in order to any of the \namendments prior to the votes: Reed amendment No. 2085 on school \nlibraries; Warner amendment No. 2086 on fiscal support teams; and \nRounds amendment No. 2078 on education in Indian Country study.\n\n[[Page S4810]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. For the information of all Senators, we expect to need \na rollcall vote on the Reed amendment, and the Warner and Rounds \namendments will be adopted by voice vote.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Nuclear Agreement With Iran\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, the deadline for negotiators to strike a \ndeal with Iran on its illicit nuclear program has been extended yet \nagain. The deadline was June 30. It was postponed until Tuesday, and \nthat was put off again for a few more days.\n  According to the Wall Street Journal, the chief negotiator said:\n\n       We are continuing to negotiate for the next couple of days. \n     That does not mean we are extending our deadlines, we are \n     interpreting [the deadline] in a flexible way.\n\n  What does that mean? You either have a deadline or you don't have a \ndeadline.\n  By the end of the week, the White House could announce that it has \nstruck a deal or it could say once again it needs more time. If there \nis a deal, Congress will need to look very closely and carefully at \nwhat it actually says.\n  There are some important things that I will be looking for in any \nagreement that is struck. First and foremost, any deal is going to have \nto dismantle Iran's nuclear weapons program. It is going to have to \nprevent Iran from ever developing a path to a nuclear weapon. It is \ngoing to have to ensure that Iran completely discloses its past work on \nnuclear weapons. Iran is also going to have to submit to an inspection \nand verification regime that is both extensive and long term--not just \ninspections when the Iranians want it, when they allow it, or where \nthey say it can occur. That is the only way we can really confirm that \nIran's promises are more than empty words.\n  America and other countries should not suspend sanctions until all of \nthese conditions are met. So far, I have not seen much to indicate that \nour negotiators understand how important these goals are.\n  There appear to be a lot of questions that have not been resolved and \na lot of foot-dragging by Iran to try to get additional concessions.\n  On Sunday, Secretary of State John Kerry said: ``We're aiming to try \nto finish this in the timeframe that we've set out.'' Well, that \ntimeframe was 7 months ago, in November of last year. The Obama \nadministration said it had reached what it called an interim agreement \nin November of 2013, and it said that it had a deadline of 1 year to \nreach a final agreement. That would have been November of 2014. When \nNovember 2014 came along, Iran got 6 more months to bully this \nadministration into giving up even more ground.\n  The deadline has been pushed back time and time again. According to \nnews reports today, it may be pushed back even further.\n  The Obama administration started negotiating with Iran more than 5 \nyears ago. In 2009, President Obama said that we ``will not continue to \nnegotiate indefinitely'' with Iran specifically. Secretary of State \nHillary Clinton said that same year that the window of opportunity for \nIran would ``not remain open indefinitely.'' I would love to know what \ntheir definition of the word ``indefinitely'' is.\n  I think these missed deadlines are embarrassing for the Obama \nadministration. The administration's willingness to keep extending the \ntalks make it look desperate. You know what. The Iranians know it. That \nis a big problem.\n  Iran is now demanding that the arms embargo be lifted as part of the \nnegotiations. This recent last-minute demand shows that Iran knows how \ndesperately eager President Obama is for a deal, any deal. This issue \nwas supposed to have been settled already. In April, the White House \nsaid that ``important restrictions on conventional arms and ballistic \nmissiles'' will be a part of any final agreement. Now Iran is seeing \nthat the President and Secretary Kerry are desperate for an agreement \nto build their legacy, so it is bringing up the arms embargo again.\n  According to news reports, our negotiators have been willing to make \na lot of concessions to get any deal. There was an article recently in \nthe Washington Post about the negotiations. The headline was ``In final \nhours, Kerry says Iran talks can go either way.'' The article said that \nnegotiators have ``a general feeling that they have come too far to \nfail.''\n  I want to be clear. Walking away from these negotiations without a \ndeal is not a failure. Failure would be signing a bad deal. Failure \nwould be lifting sanctions before Iran has shown that it has begun \ndismantling its nuclear program. Failure would be a deal that does not \nautomatically reinstate sanctions if it turns out Iran is not complying \nwith the deal. Failure would be a deal that allows any money Iran gets \nfrom sanctions relief to end up continuing to support terrorism, which \nIran does. Failure would be a world that is a much more dangerous place \nfor all of us.\n  So far it seems as if this administration is willing to make a deal \nat any cost. We have seen one point after another where the \nadministration has apparently agreed to give the Iranians exactly \nwhatever they want. The negotiations went from initially being about \nstopping Iran's nuclear program to now being an attempt to delay or to \nmanage Iran's nuclear program.\n  Even before the June 30 deadline passed, Senator Menendez said: ``For \nme, the trend lines of the Iran talks are deeply worrying; our red \nlines have turned into green lights.''\n  That is from a Democratic Senator. It was that kind of concern that \nled Congress--this Senate--to pass a law in May saying that Congress \nwould be able to review any deal with Iran before the Obama \nadministration could lift sanctions. Remember, the Obama administration \nfought that law--a law with a bipartisan, veto-proof majority in this \nbody. The President didn't want Congress or the American people to have \nany say at all. Actually, the White House said they were planning to go \ndirectly to the Security Council of the United Nations before going to \nthe elected representatives of the people of the United States.\n  Any deal with Iran on its nuclear program would have a huge effect on \nour security, and the American people do get a say. If somehow the \nadministration manages to strike a deal and it sends over all the \nnecessary materials, Congress--if it is done today--will get 30 days to \nreview it. That is time we can use to make sure it really is in our \ncountry's best interest. If the administration can't get us the full \ntext of an agreement before this Friday, the timeline jumps up to 60 \ndays to review it. That is what we said in the law we passed in a \nbipartisan way this spring.\n  If our negotiators can reach a deal with Iran, whenever that happens, \nCongress will use the time to look very closely at every word. If our \nnegotiators can reach a deal with Iran, whenever that happens, Congress \nwill make sure that we look at every word and know what is in it. The \ngoal--the entire reason we are having these negotiations--is not just \nto get Iran to say yes to something; the goal initially was and should \nremain to stop Iran's illicit nuclear program.\n  If the Obama administration allows Iran to continue with that \nprogram, the world will be less safe, less stable, and less secure. Any \nagreement our negotiators come up with must be accountable, must be \nenforceable, and must be verifiable. If that is not the case, then it \nis a bad deal, and the Obama administration must not strike a bad deal \nwith Iran. This Nation and the world cannot afford that, and Congress \ncannot allow it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call be \nequally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S4811]]\n\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, we are here today to consider the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, the bill that has been known \nfor years as No Child Left Behind. It is a bill the Congress was \nsupposed to reauthorize more than 7 years ago.\n  When school kids come to visit me in my office here, I often ask \nthem: What would happen if you showed up and were told that your \nhomework was 7 or 8 years late? That is how long it has taken us to get \nto this place.\n  As the Presiding Officer may know, before I came to the Senate, I had \nthe honor of being the superintendent of the Denver Public Schools \ndistrict, which now has 95,000 children in it, 67 percent of whom \nqualify for free and reduced lunch.\n  I should note that we got some sad news in the last month or two. For \nthe first time in our country's history--for the first time in the \nhistory of the United States--over half of the children attending \npublic schools in our country qualify for free and reduced lunch. That \nis due to two decades of stagnant middle-class family incomes and the \neffect of the worst recession since the Great Depression.\n  What people in Washington need to understand is that when it comes to \neducation in this country right now, our kids don't have a fair fight, \nespecially our kids living in poverty. If you were born poor in the \nUnited States of America, you will have heard 30 million fewer words \nthan your more affluent peers when you show up for kindergarten. Ask \nany kindergarten teacher in the country whether that makes a \ndifference, and they will tell you it does.\n  What are we doing as a country to fill that gap? Not much. By the \ntime kids get to elementary school--their early years--only one out of \nfive is reading proficiently of the kids who were born poor and 20 \npercent are reading at grade level. Ask any middle or high school \nteacher whether that is going to make a difference when that child gets \nto middle school or high school.\n  Where does it end in the land of opportunity for kids who are born \ninto poverty in this country? If you are born poor in the United States \nof America, your chances of getting a college degree, or the equivalent \nof a college degree, is 9 in 100, which means--in this global economy \nof ours--that every year becomes less and less forgiving to people who \nhave less of an education. And 91 out of 100 of our kids are going to \nbe constrained to the margin of the economy and the margin of the \ndemocracy from the very outset.\n  There are 100 desks in this room. There are 100 chairs in this room. \nIf we weren't the Senate but instead kids born into poverty in this \ncountry, not even those three rows of desks over there in that corner \nwould represent people graduating from college. Everybody else in this \nroom would not have the benefit of a college degree. We would never \naccept those odds for our own children. The people in the Senate would \nnever ever accept those odds for our own children. If our kids faced \nthe odds of showing up to kindergarten having heard 30 million fewer \nwords than their peers and if you knew it was assured that your child \nhad a 20-percent chance of reading at grade level when they got to \nelementary school, I guarantee you would leave this place. You would \nleave the Senate, and you would go home and address the problem.\n  But when it comes to public education--especially when it comes to \nour kids who are living in poverty in this country--we stop treating \nthem as if they were our kids. We are treating them as if they were \nsomeone else's kids. We are leaving it to luck as to whether a kid can \nfill that 30-million-word gap.\n  I am sure the Presiding Officer knows this. There are entire cities \nin this country and rural areas in this country where school choice \nwould be meaningless because there is not a good school to choose from. \nThere is not a school in the neighborhood or in the city that anybody \nin this body would send their kid to. That is where we are.\n  Over the last decade or so, we made progress in many places across \nthe country. The Denver Public Schools is one of those places. It is \nthe fastest growing urban school district in the United States.\n  In 2005, the kids who attended Denver Public Schools were dead last \nin terms of student growth compared to any school district of any size \nin the State of Colorado. For the last 3 years Denver Public Schools \nhas led the State in terms of its student growth, both for kids who \nreceive free and reduced lunch and kids who do not receive free and \nreduced lunch. Thirty percent more kids graduated and went to college \nthis year than in 2005.\n  Now, I am the first to say that we have a long, long way to go in \nDenver to make sure that the ZIP Code you are born into doesn't \ndetermine the educational outcome you get, but we are making \nsubstantial progress. And I say that if we could say as a country that \nevery single urban school district since 2005 showed a 30-percent \nincrease in kids going to college, we would be feeling a lot better \nabout where we are headed.\n\n  There is a lot of debate in this body about what tax policy ought to \nbe and whether we ought to think about redistributing wealth and who \nshould pay what share of taxes. Some people view it as everything ought \nto be decided out there by the market. I understand that point of view. \nBut if that is your point of view, you better be doing everything you \ncan to be sure that every single kid in the country has an excellent \nshot at an education, because if you don't, then you are basically \nsaying, if you have the bad luck to be born to a poor family in this \ncountry, you are on your own. You are on your own, and you have a 9-in-\n100 chance of getting a degree that is actually going to allow you to \ncompete in the global economy.\n  One thing I know about kids who are born in this country, they don't \nget to pick who their parents are. They don't get to decide whether \nthey are born into a ZIP Code that is going to fill that 30-million-\nword gap by the time they get to kindergarten or that is going to give \nthem excellent school choices or that will allow them to go to college.\n  Today, while we are not talking about higher education, this is very \nmuch a part of this K-12 conundrum because college has become harder \nand harder to afford, even at a time when it is much more important for \npeople to succeed.\n  I saw some data the other day that said that for the average cost of \ntuition in this country, the average cost of college, a family in the \nbottom quartile of income earners, after you account for student loans, \ngrants, and student aid, would have to consume 85 percent of their \nincome to afford 1 year of college; whereas, if you are in the top \nquartile, it will cost you 15 percent of your income. Is that fair? It \ndidn't used to be this way. In the 1970s, it wasn't this way. In the \n1970s, a Pell grant covered 76 percent of what it cost to go to the \naverage college in this country. We are rolling up the carpet on the \nnext generation of Americans, and I don't think it is fair. I don't \nthink it is right.\n  We should be having a debate about the size and scope of government. \nI believe that. We should have that debate. But as we are having that \ndebate, we should keep in mind that we have an obligation to fulfill to \nhonor the obligation our parents and grandparents fulfilled for us, \nwhich is to make sure that if you were willing to work hard, if you \nwere willing to study hard, that college was going to be something that \nwas attainable and it wasn't going to strangle you in debt.\n  Too many families across Colorado are facing this challenge, and the \nsaddest thing I hear in my town is when somebody comes and says: We \ncan't afford to send our kids to the best college they got into. What a \nwaste that is--what a waste for that student, what a waste for our \nsociety. So there is more for us to do on college affordability.\n  But today we are talking about the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct. I think we actually make substantial progress in this bill. I want \nto say how pleased I am with the leadership of Chairman Alexander and \nthe ranking member Patty Murray. They have done an exceptional job of \nmanaging this bill through our committee.\n  We have a very diverse committee. We have the junior Senator from\n\n[[Page S4812]]\n\nVermont on the committee and we have the junior Senator from Kentucky \non the committee, and because of Chairman Alexander's leadership and \nthe work and leadership of the ranking member Senator Murray, the bill \nactually passed out of the committee unanimously. Imagine that--around \nthis place, where we can't even agree on how to publish a report or \nwhat time we should come to work, we have a committee in the U.S. \nCongress where Republicans and Democrats unanimously agreed on a bill. \nLet me tell you, it wasn't easy. If it were easy, we would have done it \non time. We would have done it 8 years ago when we were supposed to do \nit--when our homework was due--but I suppose it is better late than \nnever, and I am very pleased with the product.\n  There is more I would like to add, but I think--I know the teachers, \nprincipals, and school leaders across Colorado need us to fix No Child \nLeft Behind, and I hope we can finally get it done this time.\n  This bill is a good starting point. It eliminates NCLB's one-size-\nfits-all approach to education, which we know will not work, and it re-\nempowers those who are closest to our kids to make the decisions that \nneed to be made for their benefit. This bill includes many key \nelements. Importantly, it includes the requirement for annual \nassessment. I know testing is not popular. I have three kids in the \nDenver Public Schools. My three daughters go to those schools. I get an \nannual report on what the testing looks like. I believe we are \novertesting our kids, but I don't think that is because of the Federal \nrequirement.\n  I see the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Does the Senator want to speak?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Just listening.\n  Mr. BENNET. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n  I think there is a lot we can do to streamline those tests, but it is \nnot the Federal requirement that is causing it, it is the way the \nFederal requirement works with State assessments and district \nassessments, and we have to do a better job. I also think we ought to \nthink differently about the testing we are doing for teaching and \nlearning, which needs to be continuous, ongoing, and inform a teacher's \ninstruction and inform the principal's leadership at the school.\n  The testing that is done for accountability should be a lot less. We \nheard testimony from the superintendent of the Denver Public Schools, \nTom Boasberg, who told us he thought that for accountability purposes, \nprobably all we need is 4 hours a year in reading and math. I know the \nBennet girls would settle for that. They would agree with that. They \nwould do that deal. But until somebody comes up with a better way of \nmeasuring where kids are, we need the annual assessments. We have to \nhave them because it is the only way you can show growth.\n  When No Child Left Behind started, it asked and answered a completely \nirrelevant question--a question that was so frustrating to the teachers \nI knew in the Denver Public Schools and to our principals. It asked: \nHow did this year's fourth graders do compared to last year's fourth \ngraders? This is a completely irrelevant question.\n  Today, because of the work that has been done in Colorado leading the \nway, States all over the country now measure the growth of kids. What \nwe ask is, How did this year's sixth graders do compared to how they \ndid as fifth graders, compared to how they did as fourth graders, and \ncompared to everybody else in the State who has a statistically similar \ntest history? Why is that important? Because it allows you to establish \ngrowth or show growth. Then one can actually evaluate how well a school \nis doing, because it used to be in No Child Left Behind, under adequate \nyearly progress--which asked that long question of how did this year's \nfourth graders do compared to last year's fourth graders--it used to be \nwe measured what was called status: How proficient were the kids, how \nlucky were those kids. You might have a school where kids were \nproficient but were actually losing ground in terms of academic \nproficiency, and we were rewarding those schools. We were calling those \nschools blue ribbon schools. There were also schools in poorer parts of \ntown where teachers were killing themselves, students were killing \nthemselves, and they weren't proficient because they started so far \nbehind, but they were getting more than a grade level or two grade \nlevels of increased proficiency during the course of the year. Do you \nknow what those schools were called under No Child Left Behind? Those \nschools were called failing schools. We called those teachers failing \nteachers. We called those students failing students, those who were \nachieving 2 years of growth. Their more affluent peers might have been \nlosing ground, and we were saying they were winners. We have moved past \nthat. This bill now acknowledges that. I wish this bill required \ngrowth--which it doesn't--but I believe States and districts will use \ngrowth to measure data.\n  The bill also continues to require that States and districts \ndisaggregate data so we can actually understand where kids are. That is \nreally important. Before No Child Left Behind existed, we had \nabsolutely no idea. Now we know. The hard truth is that kids of color \nin this country aren't doing nearly as well as Anglo kids in this \ncountry. Kids living in poverty aren't doing nearly as well as their \nmiddle-class or more affluent peers. We need to do better.\n  I run into people periodically who say to me that you can't fix it \nunless you fix poverty. You can't fix the education system unless you \nfix poverty. Don't tell kids in my city who are living in poverty that \nthat is true. Outside of every one of our schools it says ``school.'' \nIt doesn't say ``orphanage.'' It says ``school.'' We need to make sure \nevery one of those schools is delivering for every kid in our \ncommunity, no matter where they come from. Otherwise, what is left of \nus? What is left of this land of opportunity?\n  Before No Child Left Behind existed, we had an impression, a vague \nsense of the inequities in our educational system. Now we understand \nhow deep they are, how rooted they are, and we have to continue to \nbuild on the successes we have seen in high-quality schools working in \npoor neighborhoods that have actually delivered for kids all over the \ncountry.\n  This new bill--and I see the Senator from Texas is here and I will \nyield to him as soon as he is ready.\n  The new version of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nimportantly empowers States to design their accountability systems, \ngiving them more flexibility while ensuring that essential information \nis included. I think that is an important recognition, led by Chairman \nAlexander, that there was a real overreach in No Child Left Behind.\n  As a former school superintendent, I can say I used to wonder all the \ntime why Washington was so mean to our teachers and to our kids. What I \nhave realized since coming here is that it is not that everybody here \nis mean. They mean well. But this place is the farthest place in the \nuniverse--I mean that literally, I don't mean that figuratively--this \nis the farthest place in the universe from a classroom in the Denver \nPublic Schools or a classroom anywhere in this country, and I think No \nChild Left Behind in many ways was an overreach. The last thing I want \nto be told as a superintendent is how to do my work in Denver. I want \nto insist that we do the work. I want to insist that children all over \nthis country have a chance, no matter what State they are born into, no \nmatter what neighborhood they are born into, but I don't want people \nhere telling people how to do that work. There is a distinction.\n  I have more to say about this, but I see my friend from Texas is \nhere, so I will yield to him. Before I do, I just congratulate the \nchairman of the committee who is here on the floor, Senator Alexander \nfrom Tennessee, for his extraordinary leadership on this bill.\n  Again, I remind my colleagues who are listening to this, what a \nrare--rare--occurrence this is. This is a bill that passed unanimously \nout of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, and that \nwould not have happened without the leadership of Senator Lamar \nAlexander and Senator Murray, the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Colorado for his \ngraciousness. I come to the floor to speak about this important topic \nof early elementary education.\n\n[[Page S4813]]\n\n  I recall that when President George W. Bush was Governor of Texas--of \ncourse, education was one of his biggest priorities both at the State \nand the national level when he became President. He had an interesting \nobservation. He said the more you talk about education, the more people \nrealize you actually care about it. So I actually think it is important \nto talk about it, that we think our way through this legislation and \nfigure out what we can do to equip our children who are increasingly in \na competitive environment, not only locally in our States and Nation \nbut globally.\n  One of the real joys of the job of a U.S. Senator is getting to visit \nwith students in our State, and I did so last week when I was back \nhome. I met with a group of middle-school students in Amarillo, way up \nin the Texas Panhandle, at the tail end of a camp teaching students \nvaluable skills in science, technology, engineering, and math, the so-\ncalled STEM fields. I was very impressed with what I saw. First of all, \nthe instructors found out how to make this fun, which is an important \nelement in this education because some of this stuff can be pretty dry \nand boring, if my memory serves me correctly. They were literally \nbuilding robots, and then they presented their final projects to \nparents and teachers in a friendly competition. Needless to say, I wish \nI had that kind of instruction. Maybe I wouldn't have veered into the \nlegal profession. I would have done something more productive in a \nfield of science. I am saying that with a tongue planted firmly in \ncheek, of course. But I wish I had instructors who would have inspired \nme to learn more about those important topics by using these sorts of \ntools.\n  I also previously visited, for example, United High School in Laredo, \nwhere I was able to meet with high school students who were taking part \nin a first-of-its-kind program that teaches curriculum specific to the \noil and gas industry in the region. Why is that? Well, because the \nshale plays in Texas are the source--the reservoirs really--this huge \nvolume of oil and natural gas is being produced from. Lo and behold, it \nis not just producing income for the people who are drilling those \nwells and completing them, it is creating a lot of jobs. What these \nstudents and the school districts, such as United High School in \nLaredo, have discovered is that this is really an opportunity for these \nstudents in high school to begin to learn some of the basics of \npetroleum engineering and other things that will prepare them for good, \nwell-paying jobs later in life.\n  This program included internships, training, and dual-credit courses \nat a local community college. These students were going to high school, \nbut they were actually getting college credit at the same time at the \nlocal community college. Of course, they were getting real-world skills \nthat they need to succeed in a burgeoning industry once they graduate. \nImportantly, graduates from the program will have, as I said, access to \nhigh-paying, good jobs right out of high school, which, unfortunately, \nthe history has been in Laredo, TX, in South Texas, that that hasn't \nalways been the case.\n  So this is a very hopeful development, thanks to the innovation in \nthe oil and gas industry and thanks to the foresight and the genius, \nreally, of the local school district there in Laredo, TX.\n  This is a great example of how local communities and the economy can \nwork to shape education and provide a win-win opportunity for students, \nlocal industries, and the greater community. United High School was \nable to create this program because it had the freedom and flexibility \nto develop its own curriculum with tailored input from local leaders, \nteachers, parents, and industry leaders--the people who create jobs and \nwho are looking for people with discrete skills that they would then \nbring to the table to provide the workforce they need.\n  This groundbreaking program in Laredo was not thought up here in \nWashington, DC. It is a product of local ingenuity and a community \nresponse to the educational needs specific to its students. I think \nthis type of mindset is very important in education because, as we have \nlearned over the years, the bureaucracy in Washington can't tailor \nprograms that will suit the needs of children in a wide variety of \nschool districts across our States and across the country--not in \nLaredo, not in Amarillo, and not anywhere else in the country.\n  That is why I am happy this week that the Senate is considering \nlegislation that will help return a large measure of the responsibility \nfor our children's education to those closest to them--their parents, \ntheir teachers, the local school boards--and not so much the Federal \nGovernment. The Federal Government does have an interest and we as \nAmericans all have an interest in being able to compete in a global \nenvironment and in high standards, those that will cause our students \nto strive to attain skills that they can use to compete anywhere in the \nworld. But in terms of its actual implementation, I am pleased that \nthis legislation will push more of those decisions out of Washington \nand back home to local school districts and parents.\n  This legislation is, of course, called the Every Child Achieves Act. \nIt provides a roadmap to ensure that our children receive and retain a \nquality education. By giving the responsibility for actually \nimplementing programs that will help students achieve these high \nstandards--it will give each State and the districts the flexibility \nthey need to design and implement their education programs and systems.\n  This is really sort of another application of what Louis Brandeis \ncalled the ``laboratories of democracy'' when he was referring to the \nState government. I think he was referring to that important principle \nof our Constitution known as federalism, as ensconced in the 10th \namendment in particular.\n  There is an irreplaceable role that the Federal Government plays in \nsome aspects of our life. National security is perhaps the preeminent \none. But there is a lot of benefit to getting some experiments at the \nState level, and then we can learn without imposing a one-size-fits-all \napproach from Washington, DC. What works best? Then we can then learn \nand be informed by those practices in a way that improves the result. I \nam thinking of criminal justice reform as another example in my State, \nwhere we were an early participant in prison reform, which now has \nformed some of the basis for bipartisan legislation that we are \nconsidering here in the Senate.\n  Because of the successful laboratory experiments back in Texas and \nRhode Island and other States, we are now taking those best practices \nand those results and figuring out how we apply those to the benefit of \nother parts of the country.\n  Under this legislation, States such as Texas can decide how to use \nfederally mandated test results to assess performance of students, \nschools, and teachers. This gives the States much needed relief from \npressure to teach to the test--something I hear over and over again \nback home, that teachers are finding that rather than a program where \nthey teach STEM subjects using robots and inspire young, creative minds \nto engage and learn the science they need in order to play these sorts \nof games in a competition with robots, teachers are finding themselves \nin a position of teaching to the test in sort of a mind-numbing process \nthat nobody would find particularly inspiring. So this takes some \npressure from that teach-to-the-test mentality and also gives States \nadditional freedom to provide students with a well-rounded education.\n  Put simply, with this legislation, States can decide for themselves \nwhat standards they need to adopt, and, importantly, this legislation \nlimits the power of the Secretary of Education to ensure that the \nFederal Government cannot dictate, direct, or control State curriculum \nor standards.\n  How insulting is it to have the States come on bended knee to the \nSecretary of Education and ask: Will you please let us have a waiver so \nwe can try this creative or innovative way of delivering an education \nto our students back home? How insulting is that and how contrary to \nthe original scheme of our government as created by our Founders.\n  So this bill, which was unanimously passed out of committee--and I \ncongratulate the chairman, Senator Alexander, and the ranking member, \nSenator Murray, and all members of the Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee for voting out this bill unanimously. This is a \ngreat bipartisan\n\n[[Page S4814]]\n\nprocess which has produced a very good product. It is also just one of \nmore than 150 bills reported out of Senate committees so far this \nyear--another sign that the Senate is back to work for the American \npeople.\n  I look forward to continuing the great progress we have made in this \nSenate by getting real education reform passed soon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2085\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to urge all of my \ncolleagues to support the Reed-Cochran amendment to encourage States \nand school districts to integrate school library programs into their \nplans for improving student academic achievement.\n  I would first like to thank Senator Cochran for his longstanding \npartnership in supporting school libraries. He has been a steadfast \nchampion for ensuring that students have access to these vital \nresources.\n  Fifty years ago, when President Lyndon Johnson urged Congress to \nenact what would become the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, he \nspecifically called for an investment in school libraries, saying that \nschool libraries were simply ``limping along'' and insisting that we do \nbetter. Sadly, this ``limping along'' is still true for too many \ncommunities in our United States.\n  This spring, the Washington Post ran articles on the inequitable \naccess to school libraries in public schools in our Nation's Capital, \nreporting that one school library in a wealthy part of town had 28,000 \nbooks in a library that spanned two floors, while 12 miles away, in a \nschool in a poorer part of the town, the school library had only 300 \nbooks along two walls. If that is not a stark example of one of the \nthings we hope we can fix through this act, I cannot think of anything \nmore direct and to the point.\n  Recently, noted author James Patterson made a pledge to help school \nlibraries. More than 28,000 applications came in.\n  One librarian reported that school libraries in her State had not \nreceived any funding for three-quarters of a decade and that their \ncollections and equipment were out of date and in disrepair. I suspect \nshe is not alone in making such a report. We see this neglect despite \nthe fact that evidence shows that effective school library programs, \nstaffed by a certified school librarian, have a positive impact on \nstudent achievement.\n  While I would like to see a much more robust school library-focused \ninitiative included in the reauthorization, along the lines of the bill \nI introduced with Senator Cochran, I am very pleased that the \nunderlying bill includes an authorization for competitive grants to \nhelp high-need school districts strengthen and enhance effective \nlibrary programs. However, we need to do more to encourage States and \nschool districts to integrate school library programs into their \noverall instructional programs.\n  Effective school library programs are essential supports to \neducational success. If you understand how to use the library in \nschool, that is not a skill that goes away; in fact, it will be a skill \nfor the rest of your life that you will use time and time again, not \nonly for your pleasure but for your progress and the progress of your \nfamily. Knowing how to find and use information is an essential skill \nfor college, careers, and life in general. A good school library, \nstaffed by a trained school librarian, is where students develop and \nhone those skills.\n  The Reed-Cochran amendment will encourage States and school districts \nto ensure that students have access to effective school library \nprograms.\n  Once again, I thank my colleague, Senator Cochran.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this bipartisan amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2078\n\n  Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on my amendment to \nthe Every Child Achieves Act, which is amendment No. 2078. I would like \nto thank Senator Udall for joining me in supporting this important \namendment.\n  Since my time working in the South Dakota State Legislature and also \nas Governor of South Dakota, education in Indian Country has faced \nincredible obstacles, especially in rural and high-poverty areas. This \nis true not only in my State but across the entire Nation. Because of \nthese barriers, 10 out of 13 Bureau of Indian Education high schools in \nSouth Dakota have graduation rates below 67 percent, and 6 of those \nschools have graduation rates at or below 40 percent. Meanwhile, the \nnational high school graduation rate is 80 percent. These graduation \nrates must be changed, and my amendment will help lay a foundation to \nfix the systemic problems Indian Country faces.\n  To address these concerns as well as other States' concerns, an \nanalysis needs to be conducted to more closely examine these \neducational downfalls. So today we are proposing an amendment to the \nEvery Child Achieves Act that would direct the Departments of Interior \nand Education to both study and create strategies to address these \nchallenges. This amendment is being supported by the National Indian \nEducation Association, the Great Plains Tribal Chairman's Association, \nand the National Education Association.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, amendment No. 2078 will \nhave no impact on Federal spending.\n  This amendment would require the Departments of Interior and \nEducation to conduct a study in rural and poverty-stricken areas of \nIndian Country in order to identify Federal barriers that restrict \ntribes from implementing commonsense regional policies instead of a \none-size-fits-all policy directed from Washington. It requires that \nthey identify recruitment and retention options for teachers and school \nadministrators and identify the limitations in the funding source and \nflexibility for schools that receive these funds. It would study and \nprovide a strategy on how to increase high school graduation rates.\n  It is critical that we identify the limitations and barriers which \ntribal schools face and lay out a strategy to fix those problems. I \nhope my colleagues will join Senator Udall and me in supporting this \nstraightforward amendment to help our students in Indian Country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, while we wait on another colleague, I \nthought I would talk about another aspect of this bill that I think is \nvery important.\n  For the first time in this country's history, finally, the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act is going to require districts to report \nactual per-pupil expenditures, which will shed light on extraordinary \nfunding inequities in this country.\n  We are one of three countries in the OECD, because of the way we fund \nour public schools in the United States, that actually spends more \nmoney on more affluent kids than we do on kids living in poverty. That \nis not well understood, but that is a fact. That is the truth.\n  We need to be concerned with closing the achievement gap in the \nUnited States, because if we look at the academic outcomes for kids in \nthis country and extrapolate those outcomes against the changing \ndemographics in the United States, we are not going to like what we see \nin the middle of the 21st century if we don't make these changes. One \nwould think, if anything, that we would be spending more money on kids \nliving in poverty, coming from disadvantaged backgrounds than we do on \nkids coming from advantaged backgrounds. But we do the opposite in the \nUnited States, and the Congress, for decades, has looked the other way.\n  I believe we need to close this loophole. It is called the \ncomparability loophole. We don't do that in this legislation, but at \nleast the requirement where we move to reporting based on actual rather \nthan average expenditures is an important step in the right direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S4815]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it is my understanding the Senate is \nstill considering remarks with respect to the education legislation \nthat is pending before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2085\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am coming at this issue from a unique \nperspective. Both of my parents were schoolteachers. As I was growing \nup in Mississippi, my father was county superintendent of education of \nthe largest public school system in Mississippi for several years. My \nmother was a mathematics educator, teacher. They had both earned \ngraduate degrees as well as undergraduate degrees from colleges and \nuniversities in our State of Mississippi. My brother and I had the good \nfortune of growing up in this environment of learning and reading.\n  So I have to confess I am biased in support of legislation that helps \nto strengthen the capability of our Nation's teachers and school \nadministrators in providing opportunities for not only reading but \ncomplex learning at early ages, which would have been surprising to \nthose of that generation to look around and observe the great strides \nwe are making in education throughout America.\n  Growing up with this perspective and my appreciation of the \nimportance of good teachers in our schools makes me understand perhaps \nmore than most the importance that education serves in the lives of \nstudents, their teachers, and their communities where they grow up.\n  When I was a student, I went to the library to check out a book. Now, \nthere are all kinds of ways to get in touch with the written words. \nToday, our school librarians are more often specialists with education \nand specific training that help students learn how to access \neducational material in every manner in which education is available in \nan increasingly digital society. Children who know how to read and are \ncomfortable using information technology are more likely to grow up \nwith a capacity to learn throughout their lifetimes.\n  The amendment I have offered with my good friend, the senior Senator \nfrom Rhode Island, seeks to help equip school librarians to do an even \nbetter job. Our amendment would allow schools throughout the country to \nuse Federal funds in the way they see fit to strengthen their \nlibraries. My hope is that the use of these additional funds will \nimprove education and literacy among children throughout America.\n  It is my understanding the bill managers support this amendment. I \nappreciate very much not only the good assistance and friendship of \nSenator Reed but his help specifically with this legislation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I come here today to speak about the \nbill pending before us, the Every Child Achieves Act. This is the \nsuccessor to the No Child Left Behind Act, which is the successor to \nthe reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  Fifty years ago, in 1965, as part of Lyndon Johnson's wanting to end \npoverty in the United States of America and to lift people up, he asked \nCongress to pass the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. It was the \nfirst legislative act where the Federal Government was involved in \neducation. Up until that time, education was thought of as the purview \nof the States and local districts. President Johnson agreed with that, \nas did the Congress, but at the same time they knew there were children \nliving in the abysmal situation of poverty, and at a time of national \nprosperity he wanted to lift those children up.\n  Great legislation passed during the next 50 years ago, such as Head \nStart, which continues to be a hallmark of early intervention to help \nour children. Of course, programs such as Medicare were also passed at \nthat time. But it was the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and \nparticularly title I, that would bring additional Federal resources to \nour local communities. Again, this was focused on helping poor children \nclose the achievement gap and giving them the ability to fully \nparticipate in our society.\n  Well, that bill went on until 2001, when President Bush said he \nwanted to make sure that children were out of poverty. President George \nBush said: I am a compassionate conservative. I am concerned about the \nsoft bigotry of low expectations of poor children, particularly poor \nchildren of color, and we have to do something about it. That brought \nabout the experiments that occurred in the States relating to metrics \nand so on for highly qualified teachers, using words such as \n``evidence-based,'' and we passed No Child Left Behind.\n  What happened, though, instead of helping poor children--we had many \nsuccesses. We did face the fact that we did have low expectations. \nThere was a soft bigotry. We agreed with the wonderful comments of \nSecretary Condoleezza Rice that were spoken at the Republican National \nConvention when she said that education is the civil rights issue of \nthis time.\n  Now, what do we have here? We have a bipartisan effort led by \nSenators Alexander and Murray to come up with yet one more reform of \nthis historic legislative framework. I support their efforts. I want to \nsalute their efforts. What they were able to do in this bill was to \nfocus again on helping poor children achieve and supporting State and \nlocal governments not with intervention but with assistance in order to \nhelp.\n  We do know that one of the legacies of having metrics was that we so \nregulated our teachers to make teaching almost inflexible, and we \nstarted to race for the tests instead of racing for the top. I believe \nthe efforts of Senators Alexander and Murray deal with the mistakes of \nNo Child Left Behind and move ahead to close that achievement gap.\n  I support the general framework of this legislation. I am proud of \nthe additions I have made to this bill, one of which was to really make \nsure there were allowable uses for something called wraparound or \nintegrated services. While we insisted there be highly qualified \nteachers in the classroom, the teachers cannot deal with poverty. They \ncannot deal with the fact that 30 percent of our children who come to \nschool every day are homeless. They have no home. The school is their \neducational home. They need a social worker. They need a school nurse. \nThe mental health challenges of many of our children are astounding. So \nwe were able to add that in.\n\n  The other thing is we were overlooking a national treasure. I was a \nbig supporter of something called the Javits bill. Senator Javits of \nNew York many years ago realized we had an overlooked treasure in our \ncommunities, and it was the gifted and talented children, children who \nare of exceptional educational capacity.\n  Again, coming back to the words of George Bush, there is that soft \nbigotry of low expectations. We often come with a latent bias that we \ndon't believe poor children are smart. We don't believe--many times \nbecause of latent bias or overt bias--that they are capable of \nachieving. What I moved in this bill was, under title II, once again, \nacknowledgment that in poor schools with poor children, there are \ngifted and talented kids, many of whom have been identified by \noutstanding programs--in my own State, the Johns Hopkins school for \ngifted and talented children. We were able to put that in the bill.\n  I look forward to moving this bill forward because I believe we \nsupport our teachers, we once again deal with low-performing schools, \nand at the same time we provide administrative and local flexibility so \nthat we minimize national mandates and maximize local achievement.\n  I salute Senators Murray and Alexander. I know there are some \namendments which will be pending, such as Burr to title I, which I will \noppose because every county in my State loses money and will lose up to \n$40 million.\n  I note that the hour of noon is arriving and that a vote will soon be \nunderway. I look forward to supporting the bill, provided that the Burr \namendment is not included.\n  I salute Senator Alexander for his leadership and for encouraging \nbipartisan participation. I thank Senator\n\n[[Page S4816]]\n\nMurray for her leadership and for including so many of these important \nreforms in our bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland for \nher remarks, her contributions to our committee, her bipartisan \nleadership, and her effective leadership both in higher education and \nin elementary and secondary education.\n  I enjoyed listening to the remarks of the Senator from Colorado, the \nformer Denver school superintendant, who has added so much to our \ncommittee.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Mississippi for his contribution to \nthe amendment on which we are about to vote.\n  We will have one rollcall vote on the Reed-Cochran amendment, and \nthen we will have two votes following that, which will be voice votes.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 2085\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse).

The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ndistinguished Senator from the State of Ohio, Mr. Brown, be recognized \nat the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Tragedy in South Carolina\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, before I make my remarks, I would like to \ncommend the Presiding Officer and Senator Graham and the people of the \ngreat State of South Carolina on the way they have handled the terrible \ntragedy that took place in their State.\n  I know time and again we have all heard on the floor of the Senate \nand in conversations we have had in private the amazing mercy and grace \nshown by the families of the victims of the terrible tragedy that took \nplace, but equally as well the great way in which the elected officials \nin the State of South Carolina, led by the Presiding Officer and \nSenator Graham, have caused a terrible event to be a learning \nexperience for all of America and an example for the way in which \ntragedy should be dealt with. I want the Presiding Officer to know how \nmuch I personally appreciate it, but I know I speak on behalf of all of \nthe people of Georgia as well.\n  Mr. President, I will speak briefly about two subjects.\n  Mr. President, I am one of the two people left in the Congress who \nhad something to do with No Child Left Behind. The other one is John \nBoehner, the Speaker of the House. I will never forget that night in \n2001, in the basement of the Capitol, after the conference committee \nfinally came to an agreement on No Child Left Behind--us talking about \nhow proud we were of what we had done but more how we knew that if we \ndid not get it fixed by the end of the sixth year, it would go from \nbeing a positive change in education to a negative.\n  It is now 13 years later. We have gone 7 years without a \nreauthorization. What became a good goal of meeting adequate yearly \nprogress, setting standards for schools, and remediating schools that \nwere in trouble has become a bill where 80 percent of the school \nsystems in America have to ask for waivers to even operate. It is a \nbill that no longer is doing what it was intended to do for the \neducation of our children.\n  I commend Senator Alexander and Senator Murray for the unbelievably \ngood work they have done to bring the new reform of the ESEA to the \nfloor of the Senate today. I participated in all the hearings, as did \nthe Presiding Officer. The Presiding Officer knows what I know: that we \nbrought about compromise and common sense. We created a bill that is \ngood for children, good for educators, and good for America.\n  First and foremost, it gets us out of the national school board \nbusiness, which is Chairman Alexander's favorite statement for the \nDepartment of Education.\n  People forget that the U.S. Department of Education is not mentioned \nanywhere in the Constitution of the United States. It is mentioned in \ntwo places. One is in title I in the Civil Rights Act of the 1960s when \nwe provided funds for free and reduced-price lunches for poor students \nto give them a leg up and second in 1978 when, in the Carter \nadministration, we passed what was known as Public Law 94-192, which \ncreated special needs children benefits or what is known as the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Act. Those are the only two places in \nstatute that the Federal Government has a role. Senator Murray and \nSenator Alexander have seen to it that we recognize that fact.\n  We enhance education where we are supposed to, but we turn it back \nover to the States, where it belongs and where it should be.\n  Secondly, one of the big buzzwords in bad brand labels that have \ntaken place in education is Common Core. Common Core is a lot of things \nto a lot of people, but most importantly for many people it is a \nFederal mandate of standards, it is a homogenization of standards, and \nit is a mandate the American people do not like.\n  This bill ensures there will be no Common Core mandate by the Federal \nGovernment to the States and ensures local control of curriculum from \nbeginning to end.\n\n[[Page S4817]]\n\n  Then, as I said a minute ago, to ensure that it gives local control, \nit does away with the waiver business and puts all local school boards \nand State boards of education in control of their education.\n  On the question of testing, it does away with federally mandated \ntests and says to systems: You develop the test and the assessment \nmechanism yourself. We just want you to have standards that are made \ngood for students to improve and grow their education. But we want to \nmake sure that every student has the access they can to be tested well \nand improve. For example, we have done some creative things in this \nbill, such as give assisted technology funding capability out of title \nI to handicapped children in title I qualifications so they can use \nassisted technology to take exams they otherwise could not take. A \nstudent with cerebral palsy, Duchenne, or many other diseases does not \nhave the coordination ability to take a paper-and-pencil test; yet they \ncan be bright, they can be a genius. Because of technology that has \nbeen developed in America, assisted technology can allow them to take \nthat exam given the disabilities they have. It is only appropriate we \nauthorize the use of title I funds to do that.\n  Most importantly, though, we keep the parent in control of their \nchild's life by giving them the permission to opt out of any State test \nthat is mandated where the State allows an opt out, which means the \nparent is in control of the testing, the State is in control of the \nassessment and the type of model that takes place, and the Federal \nGovernment is saying to the local schools and State boards of \neducation: You take our children to the next level. We will assist you, \nbut we are not going to govern you, we are not going to ruin you.\n  I commend Senator Alexander and Senator Murray for bringing together \na bipartisan approach to education reform that works. I thank the \nAmerican Federation of Teachers, the national association of educators, \nthe National Association of School Superintendents, and the National \nGovernors Association. Every vested organization in education in the \nUnited States of America has endorsed this bill. They have because they \nknow it is time for education to be enhanced and improved from the \nlocal level up. They know the benefits that may have come from No Child \nLeft Behind have long since passed. We are now disaggregating, we are \nnow measuring, and we are doing all the things we should have been \ndoing all along. Let's take what is a good platform and make it even \nbetter to ensure that every child learns, every child progresses, and \nevery child succeeds.\n\n\n                             Military Cuts\n\n  Mr. President, I want to make note of the announcement today by the \nDepartment of Defense on the dramatic cuts to our military--40,000 \npeople over the next 2 years.\n  Mr. President, I am a pretty easygoing guy, but I am really angry. I \nam really mad. I know it is ironic to me--and it is one of the reasons \nI put a hold today on an appointment--but it is ironic, on the day we \nall learn by reading the newspaper, not by being advised by the \nDepartment of Defense, that we are going to lose 40,000 soldiers over \nthe next 2 years--Georgia is going to lose 4,350 soldiers over the next \n2 years. Nobody did the courtesy of calling us. But on the day when \nthey did not call us, they also send up for confirmation a legislative \naffairs official for the U.S. Department of Defense in the \nadministration.\n  I have a hold on that person for one simple reason: I want to meet \nwith them and to see to it that if they in fact do get in control of \ncongressional liaison and congressional affairs, they make sure we are \nthe first to find out, not the last to find out.\n  Our military is critically important to my State, as it is to the \nPresiding Officer's State. It is important that we know what the \ngovernment's plans are, and it is important that we have a chance to \nhave a say. I know the President does not like to use the legislative \nbody very much. He would rather regulate and do Executive orders. But \nwhen you talk about our military and you talk about the investment in \nour military, every Member of this Senate, every Member of the House--\nall of us ought to be together with all our oars in the water rowing in \nthe same direction, not in misdirection.\n  I want to make one note here. It is also ironic that last week the \nPresident for the first time went to the Pentagon to talk about the \nstrategy in the Middle East, particularly with regard to ISIL. It took \n18 months to go talk about a situation that has grown from being an \nirritant to a crisis. When we left Iraq and left all the equipment that \nwe had there and left the Iraqis to fend for themselves, we created a \nvacuum. And what happened? In came ISIL. And now they are in 16 \ncountries in the Levant and in the Middle East right now. We created a \nvacuum that they filled and are continuing to fill, and we are talking \nabout reducing our manpower over the next 2 years to a point that we no \nlonger can confront an enemy on two fronts; we are going to have a \ntough time doing it on one.\n  A vulnerable and a weak American defense and military allow and \nencourage people who might have nefarious goals and dreams to take \nadvantage of America's weakness. We should be very careful about \ndiminishing our resources and our military to levels that are not in \nthe best interest of the American people or their security.\n  I want to ask the administration to be sure to give us information in \nadvance rather than after the fact, to include us wherever possible in \nthe decision, and to see to it that the Congress is once again a \npartner with the Commander in Chief and to see to it that we confront \nour enemies and have the manpower and the troops to do it.\n  I, for one, have thought for a long time that we should be doing more \nto confront ISIL in the Middle East. I think that is being borne out \nevery day. Hopefully the President is coming to that realization as \nwell. But whatever we do, we should not be telling the world we have \nproblems but we are going to cut some more.\n  It is time we made an investment in the security and peace of our \ncountry and our military, and it is time we worked together--the \nPresident and Congress alike--to do what is right for America, its \ndefense and its freedom and its liberty, which we just celebrated over \nthe past weekend on July the 4th.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time and defer to the \nSenator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I always appreciate the words of Senator \nIsakson, who was the cochair of the Ethics Committee, where I served \nwith him, and now on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, and I appreciate \nhis work and Senator Blumenthal's work on one of the most important \ncommittees in this Senate.\n  Mr. President, about a year and a half ago, on a cold January morning \nin Cleveland, where I live, at a Martin Luther King breakfast, I heard \na speaker say: Your life expectancy is connected to your ZIP Code. \nThink about that. Whether you grow up in Columbus or Canton or \nAppalachia, whether you grow up in a city or a prosperous suburb or a \nlow-income suburb or a small town or a rural area, so often your ZIP \nCode determines whether you have access to quality health care, to good \neducation, to good jobs, and to the social support necessary to \nsucceed. That is particularly true when it comes to education.\n  The quality of our children's education should not be determined by \ntheir ZIP Code. Too often that is the case. Teachers and schools in far \ntoo many cases lack the resources necessary to ensure students can grow \nand succeed.\n  Achievement gaps persist between economically disadvantaged students \nand their more advantaged peers. These gaps persist between Black \nstudents and White students, Latino students and White students. They \npersist between native and non-native English language speakers. They \npersist between students with disabilities and those without.\n  These achievement gaps inevitably, predictably almost always lead to \nopportunity gaps. We know education is the surest path to success--we \nsay that around here ad nauseam--regardless of where you come from. \nThat is why closing these gaps is vital to ensure children--all \nchildren--have the opportunity to succeed.\n  These achievement gaps are not caused by failings in our students. \nThey are usually not caused by failings\n\n[[Page S4818]]\n\nwith our teachers. They are the result of policies that leave schools \nwith massive resource gaps.\n  The U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights conducted a \ncomprehensive survey of schools across the Nation.\n  Some of the results they found were appalling. Black, Latino, Native \nAmerican, Native Alaskan students, as well as first-time English \nlearners attend schools with much higher concentrations of \ninexperienced teachers. One in five high schools in this country lacks \na school counselor. Around 20 percent of high schools do not offer more \nthan one of the typical core courses for high school math and science, \nsuch as algebra I and II, geometry, biology, and chemistry.\n  We cannot call our country ``the land of opportunity'' while we \nfail--we, policymakers, communities, leaders, activists--while we fail \nto provide too many of our children with well-equipped schools.\n  The bipartisan opportunity dashboard of core resources amendment will \nhelp us close these gaps. It will strengthen transparency provisions in \nthe Every Child Achieves Act so parents and taxpayers know how schools \nare performing on key measures of success--measures such as contact \nwith effective teachers, access to advanced coursework, and \navailability of career and technical opportunities and counseling. It \nwill ensure that States hold schools accountable when inequities exist.\n  Reporting is an important and helpful tool but surely not enough. If \nthis new data shows persistent disparities, States and school districts \nneed to take action. This amendment requires States to develop a plan \nto ensure that resources reach districts that are most in need. States \nwill have flexibility to design these plans in a way that works for \nlocal communities. The amendment does not tell States how to address \ninequities; it just requires States to identify those disparities and \nwork with communities to fix them in whatever way works for those \ncommunities in that State.\n  We must move beyond simply using test scores when we assess our \nschools. Tests are an important benchmark of success, but they are by \nno means the only one. To succeed in life and in school, students need \naccess to dedicated literacy programs, to music and the arts, to \nadvanced classes, to college and career counseling. We need to measure \naccess to all of these opportunities, not only math and reading scores. \nImproving access to core resources will not close the achievement gap \novernight, but it puts us on the right track.\n  Our amendment has the support of teachers and civil rights \norganizations. I want to thank Senators Reed, Kirk, and Baldwin for \ntheir bipartisan help and support in getting this amendment to this \nplace.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment to ensure that all \nchildren, regardless of their ZIP Code, have access to the core \nresources needed for a quality education.\n  Unfortunately, instead of strengthening our public education system, \nsome of my colleagues want to, as we say around here, ``voucherize'' \nthe public school system, privatize, spend resources elsewhere \nprimarily. We have seen how so many of our public schools serving \nvulnerable populations are already in dire need of resources, yet \nvouchers would divert more of these resources away from public schools, \nreroute those resources to for-profit schools, in some cases, that \nsimply are not accountable to the public.\n  Vouchers do not provide a real choice for the majority of \nstudents. They may cover some--but usually not all--of the tuition of \nprivate schools, meaning the students who need help the most often get \nlittle choice at all. Study after study shows that private school \nvouchers don't improve student achievement. My State, by some rankings, \nis the next to worst--next to last in the country--in the quality of \ncharter schools and the accountability of charter schools, in large \npart because there is a huge network of for-profit charter private \nschools in our State that simply have not served students that well.\n\n  That is why I urge my colleagues to vote against any proposal to \nvoucherize our schools. Instead, we need to strengthen our public \nschool system, which educates the vast majority of our children. That \nis why schools across the country, especially those with high \nconcentrations of poverty, need more funding--not less. For 50 years, \nthe Federal Government has helped level the playing field for students \nby directing funds to schools in areas that lack resources. \nUnfortunately, some of my colleagues are trying to dismantle this \nsystem by taking away funding from high-priority schools to more \naffluent schools, a bit of a reverse Robin Hood.\n  They call this proposal portability. But no matter what you call it \nand why you call it that, taking funding away from the schools that \nneed it most and sending it to the schools that need it least is wrong. \nI will urge my colleagues to oppose this effort. In our country, all \nstudents should have access to a high-quality education, regardless of \nhow much money their parents make, regardless of how much education \ntheir parents have, regardless of what ZIP Code they live in. We must \ninvest Federal resources in schools and districts that need the most \nand where they can make the most difference.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I do want to compliment the HELP Committee \nand Senator Alexander, who chairs that committee, for the great work \nthey have done in bringing the Every Child Achieves Act legislation to \nthe floor of the Senate. This is long overdue. Anybody who meets with \nschool administrators, teacher groups, parents or school boards \nrealizes that people for a long time have been looking for us to \nreauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and to make \nreforms that are important and that will return control and power to \nschool districts, to parents, to teachers, and to administrators, \nrather than having it here centralized in Washington, DC.\n  So I am pleased that we can have this debate. I am encouraged by the \ndiscussion that has already been held and by the willingness of both \nsides to work together to allow amendments to be considered. This is an \nimportant issue--how we educate our children, equipping them, preparing \nthem for the challenges that will be ahead of them. There is no more \nimportant task that we have. So to the degree that this legislation \nmakes it more possible for our kids to learn at the very fastest rate \npossible, this is something that this Senate ought to be focused on.\n  I am hopeful that we will be able to get through the amendment \nprocess and be able to move this bill across the floor of the Senate \nand to the House, and hopefully, eventually, to the President's desk. \nBut I think it is also an example of what happens when you get people \nwho are willing to open the Senate process up and allow legislation to \nbe considered.\n\n\n                         Republican-Led Senate\n\n  The Senate has now been under Republican control for a full 6 months. \nThose months have been some of the most productive that the Senate has \nseen in a long time. So far this year, the Republican-led Senate has \npassed more than 45 bipartisan bills, 22 of which have been signed into \nlaw by the President. Committees have been hard at work and have \nreported out more than 150 bills for floor consideration by the full \nSenate. In May, the Senate passed the first 10-year balanced budget \nresolution in over a decade--over a decade.\n  One reason the Senate has been so productive is because the \nRepublican majority has been committed to ensuring that all Senators, \nwhatever their party, have the opportunity to have their voices heard. \nUnder Democratic leadership, not only Republicans but many rank-and-\nfile Democrats were shut out of the legislative process in the Senate. \nAs an example of that, the Democratic leadership allowed just 15 \namendment rollcall votes in all of 2014--an entire year. That is barely \nmore than one amendment vote per month here in the Senate.\n  Republicans, by contrast, had allowed 15 amendment rollcall votes by \nthe time we had been in charge here for merely 3 weeks. In all, \nRepublicans have allowed more than 136 amendment rollcall votes so far \nin 2015. That is not only more amendment rollcall votes than in all of \nlast year, but it is more amendment rollcall votes than the Senate took \nin 2013 and 2014 combined. We still have 6 months to go in 2015.\n\n[[Page S4819]]\n\n                      Nuclear Agreement With Iran\n\n  Mr. President, one of the most important bipartisan bills the Senate \nhas passed this year is the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. This \nlegislation, which was signed into law in May by the President, ensures \nthat the American people, through their representatives in Congress, \nwill have a voice in any final agreement with Iran. Specifically, the \nlaw requires the President to submit any agreement with Iran to \nCongress for review and prevents him from waiving sanctions on Iran \nuntil the congressional review period is complete.\n  The bill also requires the President to evaluate Iran's compliance \nevery 90 days. I am particularly glad that this legislation is in place \nbecause the negotiation process so far has given cause for deep \nconcern. The primary purpose of any deal with Iran is to prevent Iran \nfrom acquiring a nuclear weapon. But the interim agreement the \nPresident unveiled in April casts serious doubt on the administration's \ndetermination to achieve that goal. The framework does not shut down a \nsingle nuclear facility in Iran. It does not destroy any single \ncentrifuge in Iran. It does not stop research and development on Iran's \ncentrifuges. It allows Iran to keep a substantial part of its existing \nstockpile of enriched uranium.\n  It is not surprising that Members of both parties are concerned about \nthis agreement. Again and again during the process, Secretary Kerry and \nthe President have seemed to forget that the goal of negotiations is \nnot a deal for its own sake but a deal that will actually stop Iran \nfrom developing a nuclear weapon. Administration negotiators have \nrepeatedly sacrificed American priorities for the sake of getting an \nagreement.\n  In the process, they have created a very real risk that the deal that \nfinally emerges will be too weak to achieve its goal. A Washington Post \neditorial this week declared that any agreement with Iran that emerges \nfrom the current talks ``will be, at best, an unsatisfying and risky \ncompromise.'' That is from the Washington Post. The editorial board \ncontinues by saying:\n\n       Iran's emergence as a threshold nuclear power, with the \n     ability to produce a weapon quickly, will not be prevented; \n     it will be postponed by 10 to 15 years. In exchange, Tehran \n     will reap hundreds of billions of dollars in sanctions relief \n     it can use to revive its economy and fund the wars it is \n     waging around the Middle East.\n\n  Again, that is a quote from the editorial in the Washington Post from \nyesterday. When Iran recently failed to comply with the provision of \nthe interim nuclear agreement currently in place, the Obama \nadministration, in the words of the Post editorial, ``chose to quietly \naccept it'' and even ``rush to Iran's defense.''\n  Again that is the quote from the Washington Post editorial. This is \nan example of what the Post aptly describes as ``a White House \nproclivity to respond to questions about Iran's performance by \nattacking those who raise them.''\n  Well that is a deeply troubling response on the part of the White \nHouse, and it raises doubts about the President's commitment to \nachieving an agreement that will shut down Iran's nuclear program. The \nstakes could not be higher on this agreement. At issue is whether a \ntyrannical, oppressive regime that backs terrorists, has killed \nAmerican soldiers, and has announced its intention of wiping Israel off \nthe map will get access to the most apocalyptic weapons known to man.\n  Even as negotiations continue, Iran continues to advance its nuclear \nprogram. If Iran continues its research and development into more \nadvanced centrifuges, the breakout period--the time needed to produce \nenough nuclear material for a bomb--could be weeks--weeks instead of \nmonths or years. If we fail to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear \nweapon, we will not only be facing a nuclear-armed Iran; we will be \nfacing a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. That is what is at \nstake. Every Member of Congress obviously would like to see the \nPresident successfully conclude a deal to prevent Iran from developing \na nuclear weapon. But the President needs to remember that a deal is \nonly acceptable if it achieves that goal. We have heard the President \nsay that he will walk away from a bad deal. But each time we reach a \ndeadline, that deadline is extended.\n  As negotiations continue, it is essential that negotiators push for a \nstrong final deal that includes rigorous inspection of Iranian sites \nand full disclosure of all Iranian weapons research to date. If the \nadministration cannot secure a sufficiently strong deal, then it should \nstep back from the negotiation table and reimpose the sanctions that \nwere so successful in driving Iran to the table in the first place. No \ndeal is better than a bad deal that will strengthen Iran's position in \nthe Middle East and pave the way for the development of a nuclear \nweapon.\n  For a deal to be acceptable to the American people, it must be \nverifiable, it must be enforceable, and it must be accountable. It also \nneeds to promote stability and security in the Middle East and around \nthe world. Any deal that does not reach that threshold is a bad deal. I \nhope the President will listen to the American people and reject any \nagreement that falls short of that goal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, today I am offering an amendment to the \nEvery Child Achieves Act that would allow $2,100 Federal scholarships \nto follow 11 million low-income children to any public or private \naccredited school of their parents' choice. This is a real answer to \ninequality in America, giving more children more opportunity to attend \na better school.\n  The Scholarships for Kids Act will cost $24 billion a year, paid for \nby redirecting 41 percent of the dollars now directly spent on Federal \nK-through-12 education programs. Often those dollars are diverted to \nwealthier schools. Scholarships for Kids would benefit only children of \nfamilies that fit the Federal definition of poverty, which is about \none-fifth of all school children--about 11 million a year.\n  Allowing Federal dollars to follow students has been a successful \nstrategy in American education for over 70 years. Last year, $31 \nbillion in Federal Pell grants, and $100 billion in loans followed \nstudents to public and private colleges. Since the GI bill began in \n1944, these vouchers have helped create a marketplace of 6,000 \nautonomous higher education institutions, the best system of higher \neducation in the world.\n  Our elementary and secondary education system is not performing as if \nit were the best in the world. U.S. 15-year-olds rank 28th in science \nand 36th in math. I believe one reason for this is that while more than \n93 percent of Federal dollars spent for a higher education follows \nstudents to colleges of their choice, Federal dollars do not \nautomatically follow K-through-12th-grade students to schools of their \nchoice. Instead, that money is sent directly to schools. Local \ngovernment monopolies run most schools and tell most students which \nschools to attend. There is little choice and no K-through-12 \nmarketplace as there is in higher education.\n\n  Former Librarian of Congress Daniel Boorstin often wrote that \nAmerican creativity is flourished during ``fertile verges,'' times when \ncitizens became more self-aware and creative.\n  In his book ``Breakout,'' Newt Gingrich argues that society is on the \nedge of such an era and cites computer handbook writer Tim O'Reilly's \nsuggestion for how the Internet could transform government. ``The best \nway for government to operate,'' Mr. O'Reilly says, ``is to figure out \nwhat kinds of things are enablers of society and make investments in \nthose things. The same way that Apple figured out, `if we turn the \niPhone into a platform, outside developers would bring hundreds of \nthousands of applications to the table.' ''\n  Already, 19 States have begun a variety of innovative programs \nsupporting private school choice. Private organizations supplement \nthose efforts. Allowing $2,100 Federal scholarships to follow 11 \nmillion children would enable other school choice innovations in the \nsame way developers rushed to provide applications for the iPhone \nplatform.\n\n[[Page S4820]]\n\n  Senator Tim Scott, the Presiding Officer today, has proposed the \nCHOICE Act, allowing $11 billion other Federal dollars--dollars the \nFederal Government now spends through the program for children with \ndisabilities--to follow those 6 million children to the schools their \nparents believe provide the best services. A student who is both low \nincome and has a disability could benefit under both of the programs, \nespecially when taken together with Senator Scott's proposal, \nScholarships for Kids constitutes the most ambitious proposal ever to \nuse existing Federal dollars to enable States to expand school choice.\n  Under Scholarships for Kids, States would still govern pupil \nassignment, deciding, for example, whether parents could choose private \nschools. Schools chosen would have to be accredited. Federal civil \nrights rules would apply. The proposal does not affect the school lunch \nprogram. So Congress can assess the effectiveness of this new tool for \ninnovation, there is an independent evaluation after 5 years.\n  In the late 1960s, Ted Sizer, then Harvard University's education \ndean, suggested a $5,000 scholarship in his Poor Children's Bill of \nRights. That is what he called it. In 1992, when I was the U.S. \nEducation Secretary, President George H.W. Bush proposed a GI Bill for \nKids, a half-billion-dollar Federal pilot program for States creating \nschool choice opportunities. Yet despite its success in higher \neducation, ``voucher'' remains a bad word among most of the K-through-\n12 education establishment, and the idea hasn't spread rapidly.\n  Equal opportunity in America should mean that everyone has the same \nstarting line. There would be no better way to help children move up \nfrom the back of the line than by allowing States to use Federal \ndollars to create 11 million new opportunities to choose a better \nschool.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am here to discuss the Every Child \nAchieves Act. I think it is significant that for the first time in more \nthan a decade, the Senate is considering legislation to make \nsignificant changes to our Nation's elementary and secondary education \nsystem, and this conversation is long overdue.\n  As a former teacher, I appreciate the challenges our schools have, \nand I am very much looking forward to the debate ahead. I want to \napplaud Senators Alexander and Murray, the chair and ranking member of \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, for reaching a \ncompromise bill that passed out of their committee with strong \nunanimous bipartisan support.\n  Today, I want to focus on some of the provisions included in this \nbill that have to do with STEM education--science, technology, \nengineering, and math. This is an issue I have been working on for a \nnumber of years--really since I was Governor in the late 1990s in New \nHampshire. We know the most critical jobs needed to compete in the \nglobal economy are in the STEM fields, but data consistently shows our \nAmerican students are falling further and further behind in these \nsubjects.\n  One of the other challenges is that we have an enormous gender gap in \nemployment in these fields. Forty-eight percent of the workforce in \nthis country are women. Yet only 24 percent of the jobs in STEM fields \nare held by women.\n  I had the opportunity last night to cohost a screening in the Capitol \nof an important new documentary called ``Code: Debugging the Gender \nGap.'' This documentary tells a very powerful story about the lack of \ndiversity in the technology industry, outlining the resulting cost to \nour society, and it explores strategies that would solve the problem.\n\n  Last night we had more than 150 people in attendance at the \nscreening, which was cohosted by Representative Susan Davis from \nCalifornia. The creators of the movie were there, and U.S. Chief \nTechnology Officer Megan Smith. What followed the documentary was even \nmore impressive, and that was a lengthy and very passionate discussion \nabout how much work we have to do on this front.\n  We need to give the next generation a stronger educational foundation \nin these topics, and, most important, we need to get them engaged and \nexcited to be working in STEM fields. This effort is going to require \nstudent engagement inside and outside the classroom. It is critical our \nschools have the resources to offer STEM opportunities during the \nschoolday. But of course as most of us remember from our childhood, it \nis sometimes what happens outside the classroom that is even more \nimportant than what happens inside the classroom if we are going to get \nkids excited about learning.\n  Afterschool programs allow students opportunities for more \nindividualized instruction, for innovative experiences, and for \nopportunities to build their leadership skills. Afterschool programs \ncan be especially successful in inspiring interest in groups that are \ntraditionally underrepresented in STEM fields, such as young women, \nstudents of color, and students from low-income backgrounds.\n  So I especially appreciate Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member \nMurray for working with me to include language from my Supporting \nAfterschool STEM Act, which is in the underlying bill and allows \nFederal grants to be used to support STEM-related afterschool \nactivities.\n  This language will expand student access to high-quality, afterschool \nprograms in STEM subjects. It will also promote mentorship \nopportunities and the building of partnerships with researchers and \nother professionals in these fields.\n  Again, one of the things we know about helping kids to stay in \nschool, getting them excited, is that if they have a mentor, if they \nhave someone who is really interested in what is going on in their \nlives, who is supporting them, then they are much more likely to be \nsuccessful. These programs will give students firsthand experience to \nsee what careers in the STEM subjects can look like.\n  Now, the Every Child Achieves Act also includes language based on a \nsecond STEM-related bill that I first introduced when I got to the \nSenate back in 2009--the Innovation Inspiration School Grant Program. \nThis language would authorize Federal STEM education grants to support \nthe participation of low-income students in related competitive \nextracurricular activities, such as robotics competition.\n  I am particularly excited about this because in New Hampshire, \ninventor Dean Kamen--also the inventor of the insulin pump and the \nSegway--founded a fantastic program called FIRST Robotics Competition. \nIt is now wildly successful. Nationwide, we have nearly 100,000 high \nschool students who compete. It is sort of an ``Einstein meets Michael \nJordan'' kind of competition. Students have just 6 weeks to work in a \nteam to design, construct, and program robots, and then they enter \ntheir robots in regional and championship competitions.\n  It is great fun to attend these events because kids are so excited \nabout working with these robots and about the STEM subjects. They get \nexcited about engineering, about science, about math, and technology, \nand you can see that in the students as they are building these robots. \nThey are excited about accomplishing their goals, about being creative. \nWhen there are last-minute problems with the robots, they have to work \nto adjust. But most of all, whether or not they win, you can see the \npride they feel for themselves, for their teammates that comes from \nsuccessfully accomplishing their task: building that robot and being \nsuccessful in the competition.\n  You can't replicate this kind of experience in a classroom. So I am \nvery pleased that support for programs such as FIRST are now included \nin the bill we are considering on the Senate floor. These are \nprovisions that I think will take very important strides toward \ninspiring future generations of scientists and engineers, of \nmathematicians and experts dealing with technology.\n  Again, I thank Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray for their \nwork on these issues and for producing\n\n[[Page S4821]]\n\na bill we are now debating on the floor that has such strong bipartisan \nsupport.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from New \nHampshire for her remarks and thank her especially for her \ncontributions to the legislation and her persistent support for STEM \neducation. She has been a champion. As a former Governor, she is a \ngreat help as we seek to remind ourselves that the path to real \naccountability, higher standards, and better teaching really runs \nthrough the States and local governments, where the creativity is and \nwhere people are closer to the children.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I rise to speak about my amendment No. \n2110.\n  As a fifth-generation Montanan and a product of Montana public \nschools and because my wife is an elementary school teacher and I am \nthe father of four children, and one of my children has a degree in \nelementary education as well, I truly understand how important a first-\nrate education is to our kids' future.\n  As I meet with parents and educators across Montana, they frequently \nshare concerns about the one-size-fits-all student performance and \nteacher qualification metrics that currently dictate Federal funding as \npart of No Child Left Behind. While well-intended, many of these \nmetrics have proven difficult for schools--and particularly schools in \nrural areas--to achieve. The Federal funding tied to these policies has \nall too often forced States and school districts to adopt policies that \nmay not best fit the students' and communities' unique needs.\n  As the Senate debates the Every Child Achieves Act to reform our \nNation's education policies, one of my priorities will be fighting to \nincrease local control over academic standards and education policies \nand working to push back against burdensome Federal regulations that \noften place our schools in a straitjacket.\n  For example, the U.S. Department of Education has incentivized States \nto adopt common core standards by offering exemptions from No Child \nLeft Behind regulations and making extra Federal education funds \naccessible through programs such as Race to the Top to States that \nadopt Common Core. Like many Montanans, I am deeply concerned that the \nFederal Government's obvious efforts to back States into adopting such \nprograms is an inappropriate interference in educational policy \ndecisions that should be made by States, parents, teachers, and local \nschool boards because strengthening our education system is vitally \nimportant to our country's future.\n  If we are serious about wanting to make future generations as \nfortunate as ours, it is critical that we prepare our children to excel \nin a globally competitive economy. Our children should receive a well-\nrounded education that focuses on core subjects, such as reading, \nwriting, science, and math, as well as technical and vocational \ndisciplines and training in the arts.\n  A wealth of social data informs us that individuals who do not \nreceive a quality education are disproportionately prone to have low \nincomes, suffer from poverty, and land in prison. It is clear that the \nFederal Government's one-size-fits-none approach simply isn't working.\n  By increasing local control of our schools and lessening the \ninfluence of Washington bureaucrats, we can provide States with the \nflexibility needed to meet the unique needs of our students and the \nunique needs of our States as well as our communities.\n  Just last year, the New York Times did an assessment of the ``health \nand wealth'' of every county in the Nation--every county. We might \nexpect folks living in Silicon Valley to be doing fairly well or \nperhaps see the suburbs of New York City thriving. What shocked me was \nseeing that 6 of the Nation's top 10 wealthiest counties surround \nWashington, DC. This sends a pretty clear message about where \nWashington's priorities really are.\n  During the recession, while millions of Americans were struggling to \nmake ends meet amidst layoffs and economic instability, Washington, DC, \nthrived. The Federal Government poured millions of dollars into new \nFederal buildings, and salaries kept growing. The average Federal \nbureaucrat in the Department of Education in Washington, DC, makes \n$107,000 a year.\n  It is time we stopped building bureaucratic DC kingdoms and returned \nthose dollars to the classrooms. That is why I am asking for support of \nthe Academic Partnerships Lead Us to Success--or A-PLUS--amendment to \nthe Every Child Achieves Act. This measure will help expand local \ncontrol of our schools and return Federal education dollars to where \nthey belong--closer to the classroom. By shifting control back to the \nStates, individual and effective solutions can be created to address \nthe multitude of unique challenges facing schools across the country. \nThrough these laboratories of democracy, Americans can watch and learn \nhow students can benefit when innovative reforms are implemented at the \nlocal level.\n  My amendment would give States greater flexibility in allocating \nFederal education funding and ensuring academic achievement in their \nschools. With A-PLUS, States would be freed from Washington's \nunworkable teacher standards, States would be freed from Washington-\nknows-best performance metrics, and States would be freed from \nWashington's failed testing requirements. Should this amendment be \nadopted, States would need to adhere to all civil rights laws. They \nhave to work toward advancing educational opportunities for \ndisadvantaged children as well, of course.\n  States would be held accountable by parents and teachers, though, \nbecause a bright light would shine directly on the decisions made by \nState capitals and local school districts. With freedom from Federal \nmandates come more responsibility, more transparency, and more \naccountability on the issues.\n  It would also reduce the administrative and compliance burdens on \nState and local education agencies and ensure greater public \ntransparency in student academic achievement and the use of Federal \neducation funds.\n  Increasing educational opportunities in Montana and across the \ncountry isn't going to happen through Federal mandates or these one-\nsize-fits-nobody regulations. We need to empower our States, our local \nschool boards, our teachers, and our parents to work together to \ndevelop solutions that best fit our kids' unique needs. As a father of \nfour--and every parent knows this--I know that each one of my children \nis very unique. And that is precisely what my A-PLUS amendment does.\n  Washington is the problem. We are ground zero. The problem is here in \nWashington, DC, and we have the solutions in Montana and in our States \nacross the country.\n  The A-PLUS amendment goes a long way toward returning the \nresponsibility for our kids' education closer to home and reduces the \ninfluence of the Federal Government over our classrooms.\n  I thank Senators Grassley, Cruz, Vitter, Johnson, Lee, Lankford, \nBlunt, Crapo, Rubio, and Gardner for cosponsoring my A-PLUS amendment. \nI ask my other Senate colleagues to join us in empowering our schools \nto serve their students, not a bunch of DC bureaucrats, and to support \nthis important amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                         Distribution of Wealth\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as someone who travels around this \ncountry, I am always amazed by the huge disconnect that exists between \nwhat we do here in Congress and what the American people want us to do. \nThe simple truth, as poll after poll has shown, is that Congress is way \nout of touch as to where the American people are. Let me give a few \nexamples before I get to the thrust of my remarks.\n  Many of my Republican colleagues are still talking about cutting \nSocial Security--a disastrous idea--but according to a recent NBC News/\nWall Street Journal poll, by a 3-to-1 margin the American people want \nus to expand Social Security benefits, not cut them. How out of touch \ncan one be?\n  About 2 weeks ago, the same poll told us that while there is \nvirtually no Republican in the Senate who is prepared to support \nraising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, what the American people \nwant by a pretty solid majority\n\n[[Page S4822]]\n\nis not to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour but to raise the \nminimum wage to $15 an hour--something that is occurring now in Los \nAngeles, Seattle, and other places around the country.\n  Tragically, this Congress is way out of touch with the American \npeople on issue after issue, and it is high time we started to get our \nact together and to respond to the needs--the pressing needs--of the \nAmerican people.\n  Between 1985 and 2013, there was a huge redistribution of wealth in \nAmerica. I know my Republican colleagues get very nervous when people \ntalk about wealth distribution. Well, guess what, over the last 30 \nyears we have had a huge degree of distribution of wealth in America. \nUnfortunately, that redistribution went in the wrong direction. That \nredistribution, to the tune of trillions of dollars, went from the \npockets of the middle-class and working families of our country into \nthe hands of the top one-tenth of 1 percent. So if we want to \nunderstand economics in the last 30 years, the middle class shrank and \none-tenth of 1 percent doubled the percentage of wealth they own.\n  Today the United States has more wealth and income inequality than \nany other major industrialized country on Earth. The top one-tenth of 1 \npercent now owns 22 percent of all the wealth in this country, while \nthe bottom 90 percent owns 22.8 percent. In other words, the top one-\ntenth of 1 percent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, \nand the trend is toward more and more wealth and income inequality. \nThat is the economic reality we are looking at now.\n  But let me talk for a moment about another reality which saddens me \nvery much and which we cannot continue to ignore. We are the wealthiest \ncountry in the history of the world. Yet we have the highest rate of \nchildhood poverty of any major industrialized nation on Earth, with \nalmost 20 percent of our kids living in poverty.\n\n  In recent years we have seen a proliferation of millionaires and \nbillionaires in this country. Yet over 50 percent of the children in \nour public schools are so low-income that they are eligible for the \nfree or reduced-price School Lunch Program.\n  As a result of the collapse of the American middle class over the \nlast 40 years, men and women in this country are working longer and \nlonger hours in order to cobble together enough income to sustain their \nfamilies. Yet while over 85 percent of male workers are working more \nthan 40 hours a week and over 66 percent of working women are working \nmore than 40 hours a week, we have a dysfunctional childcare system \nwhich denies millions of working families the ability to secure high-\nquality and affordable childcare.\n  Last week I spoke to a woman who lives right here in Washington, DC, \nand she told me that to get her 1-year-old child into quality daycare \nhere in the Nation's Capital, she and her husband are spending close to \n$30,000 a year for one child. DC childcare is probably more expensive \nthan other parts of the country, but millions of parents are struggling \nwith childcare bills of $15,000, $20,000 or $25,000 a year when their \nincome is $30,000, $40,000 or $50,000 a year. If you have two young \nkids, I don't know how you manage.\n  The truth of the matter is that while working families are \ndesperately trying to find quality childcare at an affordable cost, we \nare turning our backs on those families. The result is that millions of \nchildren in this country are not receiving the quality childcare or \nearly education they need when the psychologists tell us that ages 0 to \n4 are the most important years of a human being's life in terms of \nintellectual and emotional development.\n  What sense is it that we ignore the needs of millions of working \nfamilies and their children? What sense is it to tell working moms and \ndads that they cannot get the quality and affordable childcare they \nneed? What sense is it to send many children into kindergarten and \nfirst grade already far, far behind where they should be intellectually \nbecause they had inadequate childcare?\n  This is not what a great country is supposed to be about. When we \ntalk about the future of America, we cannot be talking about turning \nour backs on the children of this country. That is why we should be \ndoing in this country what nations all over the world have done, and \nthat is to invest in our kids and move toward a universal pre-K \neducation system for all of our children.\n  I am glad that the Elementary and Secondary Educating Act is on the \nfloor right now for debate. I want to thank Senator Murray and Senator \nAlexander for their hard work on this important bill. In Vermont and \naround this country--and I have had town meetings on this issue in \nVermont where hundreds of teachers, parents, and kids come out--they \nunderstand that No Child Left Behind has failed, and what we are doing \nnow begins to address that failure and move us in a very different \ndirection.\n  When we talk about the needs of young people--something we very \nrarely do--we should understand that it is not just that we have a \ndysfunctional childcare and pre-K system which must be significantly \nimproved, it is not just that No Child Left Behind must be reformed, \nand it is not just that a college education is now unaffordable for \nmillions of working-class and low-income families. All of those are \nterribly important issues that we must address. But I hope very much \nthere is another issue that we will finally start to pay attention to. \nThis country, this Senate, and the House of Representatives must come \nto grips with the fact that today in America we have a horrendous, \nhorrendous level of youth unemployment in this country. This is an \nissue that gets virtually no discussion at all. This is an issue of \ncrisis proportions that we are not addressing. For the future of this \ncountry, not to mention for the future lives of millions of our young \npeople, we cannot continue to sweep the issue of youth unemployment \nunder the rug.\n  Last month the Economic Policy Institute released a new study about \nthe level of youth unemployment in this country. What they found should \nconcern every Member of the Congress and, in fact, every person in our \ncountry. The Economic Policy Institute analyzed census data on \nunemployment among young people who are jobless--who have no jobs--\nthose who are working part time when they want to work full time, and \nthose who have given up looking for work altogether. This is what they \nfound. From April 2014 to March 2015--a 1-year period--the average real \nunemployment rate for young, White high school graduates between the \nages of 17 and 20 was 33.8 percent. The jobless rate for Hispanics in \nthe same age group was 36.1 percent. Unbelievably, the average real \nunemployment rate for Black high school graduates and those who dropped \nout of high school was 51.3 percent.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the EPI's \nfindings.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n [From the Working Economics Blog, Economic Policy Institute, June 8, \n                                 2015]\n\n     Young Black High School Grads Face Astonishing Underemployment\n\n                           (By Alyssa Davis)\n\n       Last week, I wrote about how high school graduates will \n     face significant economic challenges when they graduate this \n     spring. High school graduates almost always experience higher \n     levels of unemployment and lower wages than their \n     counterparts with a college degree, and their labor market \n     difficulties were particularly exacerbated by the Great \n     Recession. Despite officially ending in June 2009, the \n     recession left millions unemployed for prolonged spells, with \n     recent workforce entrants such as young high school grads \n     being particularly vulnerable.\n       Underemployment is one of the major problems that young \n     workers currently face. Approximately 19.5 percent of young \n     high school graduates (those ages 17-20) are unemployed and \n     about 37.0 percent are underemployed. For young college \n     graduates (those ages 21-24) the unemployment rate is 7.2 \n     percent and the underemployment rate is 14.9 percent. Our \n     measure of underemployment is the U-6 measure from the BLS, \n     which includes not only unemployed workers but also those who \n     are part-time for economic reasons and those who are \n     marginally attached to the labor force.\n       When we look at the underemployment data by race, we often \n     see an even worse situation. As shown in the charts below, \n     23.0 percent of young black college graduates are currently \n     underemployed, compared with 22.4 percent of young Hispanic \n     college grads and 12.9 percent of white college grads. And as \n     elevated as these rates are, the picture is bleakest for \n     young high school graduates, who are majority of young \n     workers.\n       51.3 percent of young black high school graduates are \n     underemployed, compared\n\n[[Page S4823]]\n\n     with 36.1 percent of young Hispanic high school grads and \n     33.8 percent of white high school grads. This means a \n     significant share of young high school graduates in all \n     racial groups either want a job or have a job that does not \n     provide the hours they need. A majority of young black high \n     school graduates wish they could work more but can't because \n     of weak job opportunities.\n       While there has been real progress in healing the damage \n     inflicted on the labor market by the Great Recession, these \n     underemployment rates among young high school graduates \n     remain quite elevated relative to pre-recession levels. In \n     order to correct these high rates, we need to prioritize low \n     rates of unemployment and boost aggregate demand for workers. \n     Last week, Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative John \n     Conyers introduced the Employ Young Americans Now Act to help \n     young Americans find pathways to employment. This bill is a \n     necessary first step to putting young high school graduates \n     back to work and to put our economy on the road to full \n     employment.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, today in our country over 5\\1/2\\ million \nyoung people have either dropped out of high school or have graduated \nhigh school and do not have jobs. It is no great secret to anyone that \nwithout work, without education, and without hope people get into \ntrouble. They get into destructive activity or self-destructive \nactivity. The result of all of that is that, tragically, here in the \nUnited States today we have more people in jail than any other country \non Earth. We have more people in jail than in the authoritarian \nCommunist country of China, with a population over three times our \npopulation. Today the United States represents 4 percent of the world's \npopulation. Yet we have 22 percent of the world's prisoners. \nIncredibly, over 3 percent of our country's population is under some \nform of correctional control. According to the NAACP, from 1980 to \n2012, the number of people incarcerated in America quadrupled from \nroughly 500,000 to over 2 million people.\n  A study published in the journal Crime & Delinquency found--this is \nreally quite unbelievable and quite tragic--that almost half of Black \nmales in the United States are arrested by the age of 23. If current \ntrends continue, one in four Black males born today can expect to spend \ntime in prison during his lifetime. This is an unspeakable tragedy. It \nis something we cannot continue to ignore. But this crisis is not just \nthe destruction of human life. It is also very, very costly to the \ntaxpayers of our country. Locking people up in jail is a very expensive \nproposition.\n  In America we now spend nearly $200 billion on public safety, \nincluding $70 billion a year on correctional facilities. It is beyond \ncomprehension that we as a nation have not focused attention on the \nfact that millions of young people are unable to find work and begin \ntheir adult lives in a productive way. We cannot continue to turn our \nbacks on this national tragedy.\n  Let me be very clear. I think I speak for the vast majority of people \nin this country and I hope the majority of Members in the Senate. It \nmakes a lot more sense for us to be investing in jobs and in education \nthan to be spending billions of dollars on jails and incarceration. We \nhave to start creating the situation where our kids can leave school \nand lead productive lives and not have them arrested and incarcerated.\n  I have introduced legislation along with Representative John Conyers \nin the House that would provide $5.5 billion in immediate funding to \nStates and cities throughout this country to employ 1 million young \nAmericans between the ages of 16 and 24 and to provide job training \nopportunities to young adults.\n  Some people may say $5.5 billion is a lot of money. It is. But it is \na lot less expensive to provide jobs and education to our young people \nthan to lock them up and to destroy their lives.\n  As we debate ESEA--again, I want to thank Senator Murray and Senator \nAlexander for their important work--I want this issue to be on the \ntable. I intend to offer an amendment that says that in this country we \nare going to put our young people to work and we are going to get them \nan education rather than lock them up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, since our Nation's founding, the idea of \na strong public education for every child has been part of the fabric \nof America. In the late 1770s, Thomas Jefferson introduced a bill in \nVirginia that outlined his plan for public schooling. At the time he \nwrote: ``By far the most important bill in our whole code is that for \nthe diffusion of knowledge among the people.''\n  Jefferson knew that educating children would strengthen our country. \nThat is still true today. Today a good education can provide a ticket \nto the middle class. When all students have the chance to learn, we \nstrengthen our future workforce and our economy. But nearly everyone \ntoday agrees that the current education law--No Child Left Behind--is \nbadly broken.\n  The bipartisan bill we are debating on the floor today--the Every \nChild Achieves Act--is a strong step in the right direction to finally \nfix that law, and it will help continue our Nation's tradition of \nmaking sure all students have access to a quality public education.\n  Some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are interested \nin voucherizing the public school system. Instead of investing in our \npublic school system, they want to send Federal resources to private \nschools. That would be a major step backward. Vouchers undermine the \nbasic goals of public education by allowing funding that is designated \nfor our most at-risk students to be rerouted to private schools. I urge \nmy colleagues to oppose any attempt to use Federal education funds for \nprivate school vouchers.\n  I strongly oppose vouchers for several reasons. For one, vouchers \ndivert much-needed resources away from our public schools and reroute \nthem to private and religious schools. Today public schools across our \ncountry, and particularly those schools with high concentrations of \nstudents in poverty, need more funding, not less. We can't afford to \nsend scarce Federal resources away from our public schools to benefit \nprivate schools.\n  Secondly, vouchers would send Federal taxpayer dollars to private \nschools that are in no way accountable to the public. Proposals to \ncreate vouchers do not require private schools to adopt strong academic \nstandards or provide students with disabilities the same services they \nhave in public schools. Unlike public schools, private schools do not \nneed to serve all of our students. There is no guarantee that private \nschools would make sure students have access to State-licensed \nteachers, and they would not administer the same assessments as public \nschools, which would diminish our accountability of Federal tax \ndollars.\n  I can tell you, as a former school board member, when people in my \ncommunity were unhappy with how their taxpayer dollars were spent, they \nwould find me in the grocery store, at the school board meeting or call \nme at home at night. But if Federal tax dollars go to private schools, \nthere is no elected official that a public citizen can call and say: I \ndon't like how you are spending our tax dollars, and I want you to look \nat this.\n  Many of our colleagues today demand evidence and accountability in \nother programs. I hope they do it in education as well. Some of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle like to argue that vouchers \ncreate options for students and families. Well, that might be true for \nstudents of more affluent families, but vouchers don't provide a real \nchoice for the overwhelming majority of students. Vouchers might cover \nsome but usually not all of the tuition of a private school. In some \ncases a voucher would make just a small dent in the full cost of a \nprivate school. That would enable students from more affluent families \nthe ability to afford private schools because they personally have the \nmeans to make up the difference. But students from low-income \nbackgrounds would still be priced out of that choice.\n  Vouchers only provide the illusion of choice to students from low-\nincome backgrounds, and it is those low-income students who ultimately \nlose out when funds are siphoned away from the public schools that they \nattend. Perhaps the most important reason I oppose private-school \nvouchers is because they do not improve student achievement. Study \nafter study has shown that vouchers do not pay out for students or for \ntaxpayers.\n  In 2012 researchers compared students enrolled in Milwaukee's voucher \nprogram compared with students in\n\n[[Page S4824]]\n\nMilwaukee's public schools. The researchers found little evidence that \nthe voucher program increased the achievement of participating \nstudents.\n  The District of Columbia's voucher program has gone through four \ncongressionally mandated studies from the Department of Education. Each \nof those studies concluded that the program did not significantly \nimprove reading or math achievement, and that program came at the cost \nof funding that could have helped improve local public schools.\n  There are a number of reasons to oppose any amendment that redirects \nFederal funds to private schools. Public schools already have to deal \nwith scarce Federal resources. This would exasperate the problem. \nPrivate schools would not be accountable for the Federal taxpayer \ndollars they get. Vouchers do very little to expand choices for low-\nincome families. Finally, as I said, studies have shown that vouchers \ndo not increase student achievement.\n  An amendment to allow public funds--taxpayer dollars--to flow to \nprivate schools would be a step in the wrong direction. I strongly urge \nour colleagues to oppose any amendment that works to voucherize any of \nour Federal dollars.\n  I believe that real improvement in student achievement comes when our \nteachers and school leaders have the resources they need to help our \nstudents succeed. We have to work together to strengthen our public \nschool system, not dismantle it.\n  I hope we can continue our bipartisan work together--we have done \nwell--to help ensure all students have access to a quality public \neducation regardless of where they live or how they learn or how much \nmoney they make. That should be our mission.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak about an \namendment that I am offering with Senator Kirk, Senator Brown, and \nSenator Baldwin, which would establish an accountability mechanism for \nstudent access to the core resources necessary for learning.\n  First, I wish to thank Senators Kirk, Brown, Baldwin, and others for \nhelping with this very important matter.\n  More than 60 years after the landmark decision of Brown v. Board of \nEducation, one of the greatest challenges still facing this Nation is \nstemming the tide of rising inequality. We have seen the rich--in fact, \nreally the very rich--get richer while middle-class and low-income \nfamilies have lost ground. We see disparities in opportunities starting \nat birth and growing over a lifetime. With more than one in five \nschool-age children living in families in poverty and roughly half of \nour public school population eligible for free or reduced-priced \nlunches because they come from low-income families, we cannot afford \nnor should we tolerate a public education system that fails to provide \nthe resources and opportunities for the children who need them the \nmost.\n  When President Johnson signed the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct into law 50 years ago, he described education as the ``only valid \npassport from poverty.'' He noted:\n\n       From our very beginnings as a nation, we have felt a fierce \n     commitment to the ideal of education for everyone. It fixed \n     itself into our democratic creed.\n\n  I believe this amendment will help us stay true to that ideal. There \nare other amendments we will consider that, frankly, will do just the \nopposite, such as those that would divert scarce resources from public \nschools to private schools through vouchers or so-called portability \namendments that Senator Murray so eloquently spoke about. Rather than \ntransferring resources away from our public education system, the \npassport to opportunity in our country, we should be doing more to \nensure they have adequate resources. We have to do work to achieve real \nequity in educational opportunity.\n  Survey data from the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights \nshowed troubling disparities, such as the fact that Black, Latino, \nAmerican Indian, Native Alaskan students, and English learners attend \nschools with higher concentrations of inexperienced teachers. In fact, \nnationwide one in five high schools lacks a school counselor, and \nbetween 10 and 25 percent of high schools across the Nation do not \noffer more than one of the core courses in the typical sequence of high \nschool math and science, such as algebra I and II, geometry, biology, \nand chemistry. Their curricula are very limited, and, indeed, perhaps \ninadequate.\n  The Education Law Center reports that a majority of States have \nunfair funding systems with flat or regressive funding distribution. \nFor these reasons, I introduced the Core Opportunity Resources for \nEquity and Excellence Act, or the CORE Act. Senators Brown and Baldwin \nwere my cosponsors. This bill would establish an accountability \nmechanism for resource equity. This was the first education bill \nintroduced in this Congress, and we are very proud of that.\n  Holding our educational system accountable for both results and \nresources is paramount. The No Child Left Behind Act looked at results, \noutcomes, testing, and measurement. What it failed to grasp is that we \nneed resources also. We need the inputs. The Every Child Achieves Act, \nthe legislation we are discussing today, includes important \ntransparency on resource equity. I thank Senators Alexander and Murray \nfor that. It requires States to report on key measures of school \nquality beyond student achievement on statewide assessments, including \nstudent access to experienced and effective educators, access to \nrigorous and advanced course work, availability of career and technical \neducational opportunities, and safe and healthy school learning \nenvironments. However, reporting alone will not ensure that students \nget the resources they need and deserve. I commend the reporting. I \nthink it is a necessary but not quite sufficient measure.\n  I am pleased to offer this opportunity dashboard of core resources \namendment with Senators Kirk, Baldwin, and Brown. This amendment has \nthe support of dozens of national organizations.\n  Specifically, our amendment will require States to develop and report \non measures of access to critical education resources, identify \ndisparities in access for districts, schools, and student subgroups, \ndevelop plans with school districts to address disparities in access to \ncritical educational resources, and include the opportunity dashboard \nof core resources on the State report card so everyone will know where \nthe resources are, where they are going, and how we are making our \ncommitment to an equitable and excellent education for every American \nchild.\n  This amendment has bipartisan support, and, more importantly, broad \nsupport in the communities across the Nation. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it when it comes to the floor for a vote.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this week the Senate is considering the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act. As we have heard from the \nprevious speakers, the issues that are involved in this decision really \ngo to the heart of America and its future.\n  Public education is the avenue to opportunity for most children in \nAmerica, and if that avenue is blocked or if it is inadequate, that \nchild will suffer, the family will suffer, and the Nation will suffer. \nThere is hardly a bigger, more important assignment that could come our \nway than to consider elementary and secondary education.\n  We are fortunate that we have two good leaders on this issue--two of \nthe best in this Senate, Senator Lamar Alexander and Senator Patty \nMurray. Senator Alexander is a Republican from Tennessee and a former \nSecretary of Education. He takes this job and assignment very \nseriously, and I have spoken to him many times about these issues. My \ncolleague, friend, and fellow leader on the Democratic side, Senator \nMurray of Washington, and Senator Alexander have done an extraordinary \nbipartisan job of bringing this measure to the floor. That is not to \nsay that I agree with every provision nor that any Senator does, but to \nhave this reported unanimously from committee by both political parties \nwith the political climate we have in Washington is nothing short of \namazing.\n\n[[Page S4825]]\n\n  We find ourselves on the floor debating the specifics of the Every \nChild Achieves Act. I am glad this bill maintains Impact Aid assistance \nfor districts such as North Chicago in my home State of Illinois, which \nis a neighbor to the Great Lakes naval training station.\n  The bill also preserves the universally agreed upon triumph of No \nChild Left Behind--to disaggregate data among subgroups of students.\n  I remember back in 2002, when we passed No Child Left Behind, I was \nrelatively new to the Senate, and I sat back there. Directly behind me \nwas a Senator from Minnesota named Paul Wellstone. To say that Senator \nPaul Wellstone hated No Child Left Behind is an understatement. Every \ntime I got up and appeared to be supporting it, he would be behind me \nwhispering: Senator Durbin, this is a mistake. Don't you vote for this. \nYou will be sorry. Well, I voted for it.\n  As I reflect on it, many good things happened, but a lot of things \nhappened that we didn't expect to happen. We had testing, and I think \ntesting is an important part of metrics and measurement to see whether \nthe students are actually progressing. But some parts of the bill went \noverboard by disqualifying schools and saying they were not up to the \njob because their test scores didn't hit certain numbers. Teachers \nwould complain to me that they went through all of this education and \nhad experience in teaching, but now they were just teaching to the \ntest. They lost the thrill of being teachers and that diminished them \nin their ability to help the children.\n  We also know what happened when it came to some of the other aspects \nof this bill. Some of the States started dumbing down their State \nstandards so schools would pass the test. It wasn't a pretty sight. It \nis time to rewrite this broken bill, and the bill that we have before \nus attempts to do just that.\n  No Child Left Behind made important advances in how we ensure that \nall children are being served by public education. As we debate the \nEvery Child Achieves Act this week, we must resist the urge to go too \nfar the other way. What happened with No Child Left Behind was a \npolitical curiosity. Here was a new Republican President, George W. \nBush, appealing to a Democratic Congress to give the Federal Government \nmore control when it came to K-12 education. That was really a new \napproach, and it is one that, frankly, surprised many of us. As a \nresult, No Child Left Behind went in directions and to degrees that \nmany of us did not expect. Now we are getting a pushback from those who \nsay it went too far. The pendulum is about to swing back in the other \ndirection. This bill allows States to develop their own State education \nplan, set their own achievement goals, and hold themselves accountable. \nEvery Child Achieves does not require States to identify low-performing \nschools or take meaningful actions to provide additional support when \nthe schools are consistently not serving their students. Without these \nprotections, students of color and low-income students could easily be \nleft behind. There are reasonable, commonsense improvements that should \nbe made to this bill to enhance accountability. We can have federally \nrequired accountability and intervention without federally prescribed \naccountability and intervention.\n\n  Let me also say a word about vouchers. The Senator from Washington \njust spoke about vouchers. I asked her when No Child Left Behind was \nwritten and she told me 2002, and I think it was somewhere around that \nperiod when we passed the DC vouchers system. We are members of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee. It was Senator DeWine of Ohio who \noffered the DC voucher system as an amendment on an appropriations \nbill. I offered three amendments to his proposal. He proposed that \nFederal tax dollars be given to individual parents in DC to choose the \nschool they wish, even if it was a private or religious school--not \ncharter schools per se but so-called DC opportunity or voucher schools. \nI offered three amendments in committee to his proposal.\n  Here is what they were: First amendment, every teacher in a DC \nvoucher school had to have a college degree. The amendment was \ndefeated. The Republican majority said, no, we don't want to limit the \ncreativity here of these new teachers in voucher schools. The second \namendment I offered said the students who attend the voucher schools \nwill take the same tests as the students attending DC Public Schools so \nwe can compare how they are doing. That amendment was also defeated by \nthe majority in the Appropriations Committee. They didn't want to be \nheld to the same standards of testing and achievement. The third one \nwas the most shocking. I said any building used for a DC voucher school \nhad to pass the fire safety code in the District of Columbia. That, \ntoo, was defeated.\n  Years later, I sent staff out to take photos of some of the DC \nvoucher schools. It was depressing. Many of these schools were just \nschools in name only. They weren't real schools. When we held a hearing \nbefore the Appropriations Committee, they couldn't even explain what \nstandards they were teaching to. Is that the kind of system we want to \nset up nationally and put our tax dollars towards? Is that where \nfamilies want to send their children? So I agree with Senator Murray. \nBefore we start talking about voucher schools, let's focus on our first \nresponsibility; that is, public education.\n  I also want to talk about an amendment that may be offered by Senator \nBurr of North Carolina on Title I formulas. Title I is the single \nlargest source of Federal funding for elementary and secondary \neducation. It helps States and school districts address poverty and the \nneeds of low-income students. This was the inspiration for the Federal \nGovernment to make a massive investment and commitment to education in \nthe 1960s, and the reason behind it was because we saw the gross \ndisparities in school districts from State to State and from district \nto district. We believed then, as I believe now, that kids from poor \nfamilies don't have a fighting chance if they don't have the chance of \na good education. Title I was designed to send those dollars to help \nthose school districts educate those children.\n  Now, the amendment that is proposed by the Senator from North \nCarolina, Mr. Burr, would devastate low-income students in my home \nState of Illinois. It would reduce Illinois's title I share by an \nestimated $180 million a year. That is a 28-percent reduction in \nFederal assistance in my State of Illinois to help poor, low-income, \nand minority students--a 28-percent reduction. Chicago public schools \nalone would lose $68 million. I just have to say for the record, they \nare struggling even today to meet their budget needs and their pension \nrequirements. This kind of cut would be devastating.\n  I think about the violence in the great city of Chicago and many \nother cities as well. I think about the responsibility of the Chicago \npublic school system which educates almost 400,000 students. A $70 \nmillion cut to Chicago would mean that these kids in low-income \nfamilies would struggle and many would not succeed in achieving a good \neducation. Is that the best we can do? I think it is a mistake.\n  I have to serve notice on my colleagues. I don't know what procedural \ntools are available to us, but when it comes to an amendment that takes \nthat kind of money away from critically important school districts in \nmy State, I am going to use every tool in the box to stop this from \ncoming to the floor and passing. There is just too much at stake. I \nhope my colleagues will join me in this effort to stop this as well.\n  Finally, let me talk about an issue that is near and dear to all of \nus and especially to the Presiding Officer--criminal background checks. \nIn the State of Illinois, if you want to be a teacher--before you can \neven be a student teacher--you have to go through a criminal background \ncheck. What does that consist of? Being fingerprinted and having your \nfingerprints and personal information turned over to our State police \nand the FBI. We take this very seriously in Illinois, and we are not \nthe only State. There are many States that do exactly the same thing. \nWe don't want anyone in the classroom, anyone in an unsupervised \nsituation with small children around, who is going to be a danger to \nthose children, period.\n  There are two proposals before us. One is being offered by the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, and it is a criminal background approach \nwhich I cannot support. The reason I cannot support it is because it \nimposes new Federal\n\n[[Page S4826]]\n\ncriminal background check standards in addition to what I just \ndescribed in Illinois. We already have fingerprinting and a criminal \nbackground check that goes to the State registry of crime as well as \nthe FBI, which provides the basic information you need to know as to \nwhether this potential teacher has anything in their background that is \nworrisome or would disqualify that teacher. It is already being done. \nThe amendment being offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania says now \nwe are going to make sure they go through a second check, a federally \nmandated criminal background check, which sends the school districts in \nIllinois to the same agencies I just described; in other words, a \nsecond check which under Illinois law would be at the expense of the \nschool district--that goes to the State police, the FBI, and others. \nCome on. Why would we waste our money--precious Federal money that we \nneed for education--in duplicating background checks? It makes no sense \nwhatsoever.\n  So I commend the Senator from Pennsylvania for being concerned about \nthis. There isn't a parent or grandparent alive who doesn't share his \nconcern, but let's not impose an additional Federal mandate on States \nthat are already doing a professional job. If States say we have a \nbackground check in place that conforms to what the standards are in \nWashington, why should they have to do it a second time?\n  Senator Whitehouse of Rhode Island makes that proposal. He has an \nalternative amendment. He proposes that the State background checks \nmeet a list of Federal compliance requirements, while explicitly \nensuring that states would not need to duplicate background checks for \ncurrent employees who have already met these requirements and have been \ncleared. I think that is better. That eliminates the duplication and \neliminates the wasted dollars on a second, unnecessary duplicative \nbackground check.\n  I might add that the Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from \nRhode Island addressed the concern about mistakes. If there is a name \nsent in by mistake and a potential teacher is disqualified and it turns \nout the information is erroneous, there is a due process provision in \nSenator Toomey's bill and one that I think is more complete in the bill \noffered by Senator Whitehouse.\n  It wasn't that many years ago, our colleagues may remember, that our \ncolleague Senator Ted Kennedy ended up on a no-fly list. He kept \nsaying: Why am I on a no-fly list? It was a mistake. It was a \ngovernment mistake that identified him as a danger to the country. \nMistakes can be made. There needs to be a due process requirement in \nhere so those accused of something that they are not guilty of have a \nchance to have their day to tell their story as best they can.\n  The bottom line is that this bill is one of the most important we \nwill consider. I thank the chairman and ranking member for the time \nthey put into this, and I thank them for their bipartisan efforts. \nThere will be some disagreements on the amendments before us, but I \nthink we are all in common agreement. If we don't get this right, many \nof the other things we do don't mean much.\n  If we don't provide that avenue of opportunity to kids from lower-\nincome, impoverished families, they are not likely to enjoy life as \nthey might with a good education and realize the American dream. This \nis our step in the right direction. I hope we can make it even stronger \nas we consider amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Illinois for his remarks. I \nwas thinking, as he was talking about Senator Kennedy, whom we all \nloved, I think the mistake was that he was on a Republican no-fly list. \nThat was the mistake. But he loved telling that story and enjoyed it \nvery much. It is nice to be reminded of him today because he was \nchairman of this committee that is producing the fix for No Child Left \nBehind.\n  He would make, in my view, the most outrageous liberal speeches from \nthe back of the Senate, and then he would come to the front of the \nSenate and would work out a good bipartisan agreement and get a good \npiece of legislation. He set a wonderful example for us, and it is nice \nto be reminded of him.\n  Mr. President, Senator Murray and I have conferred, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the time until 4:30 p.m. today be equally \ndivided between the two managers or their designees and that it be in \norder to call up the following amendments: Hirono amendment No. 2109, \nTester amendment No. 2107, Alexander amendment No. 2139, Murray \namendment No. 2124, Bennet amendment No. 2115; further, that at 4:30 \np.m. today, the Senate vote on the above amendments in the order \nlisted, with no second-degree amendments in order to any of the \namendments prior to the votes and that the Alexander amendment No. 2139 \nbe subject to a 60-affirmative-vote threshold for adoption; and that \nthere be 2 minutes of debate equally divided between the votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. For the information of all Senators, we expect a \nrollcall vote on three of these amendments and that the rest will be \nadopted by voice vote.\n  PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I rise in support of amendment No. 2109, \njust mentioned by the chairman, the Hirono-Heller amendment which \naddresses Asian-Pacific and Pacific Islander student data.\n  In my home State of Nevada, as in many of my colleagues' home States, \nthe AAPI population is one of the fastest growing. I can give you an \nexample of that according to census data. Nevada's AAPI or Asian-\nPacific and Pacific Islander population grew by 116 percent between \n2000 and 2010. Now, even though this AAPI group represents students who \ncome from a variety of different backgrounds--Chinese, Filipino, \nVietnamese, Korean--current law and the Every Child Achieves Act uses a \nbroad ``Asian-Pacific Islander'' category when reporting on student \nachievement. Basically, if you are registering as a student, you have \none category--one bubble--called Asian-Pacific Islander, regardless of \nwhether you are Chinese, Filipino, Vietnamese, Korean. It doesn't \nmatter. It is a single bubble. As a result of this single bubble, this \nstudent population as a whole seems to perform well, but the broad AAPI \ncategory hides big achievement gaps between subgroups. The current \ncensus data gives us this evidence.\n  According to the 2010 census, 72 percent of Asian Indian adults have \nbachelor degrees or higher; whereas, only 26 percent of Vietnamese \nadults do. Steps should be taken to help close these achievement gaps \nand create an environment where all students can succeed. This is \ncritical to ensuring that our Nation's children are preparing to attend \ncollege or enter the workforce. That is why the Hirono-Heller amendment \nis so important.\n  Our amendment simply requires school districts with large populations \nof AAPI students to show how these subgroups are performing. This \namendment would also apply in large school districts with over 1,000 \nAAPI students. This represents less than 3 percent of the school \ndistricts nationwide. In fact, 11 States would not be affected at all \nby the Hirono-Heller amendment. It is also important to note that this \namendment would only be used for public reporting purposes. It would \nnot require accountability measures or intervention at any level.\n  The bottom line is that having this kind of subgroup data available \nequips parents and local officials with the necessary information to \ndetermine how their students are doing and how to better support \nstudents who need the most help. Isn't that what these school districts \nare all about, which is to try to identify those students and to better \nsupport students of those who need help.\n  As a father of four and grandparent of two, I think parents should \nhave access to this kind of data, to know how schools are serving these \nchildren in these specific subgroups, so they can make the right choice \nfor their children. School choice advocates agree, charter school \nadvocates agree, and the truth is that school districts across the \nNation are already collecting and reporting this aggregated AAPI \nstudent data. In fact, just this morning, I sat down with several \nschool superintendents from all across my home State who told me that \naccess to this type of\n\n[[Page S4827]]\n\ndata would be extremely helpful in their districts.\n  Principals and teachers also understand the value of this subgroup \ndata and how it reveals groups of students who need assistance that \nwould otherwise be missed by looking at the broader AAPI category. That \nis why this amendment is also supported by the National Association of \nElementary School Principals, it is why this amendment is supported by \nthe National Association of Secondary School Principals, and why it is \nsupported by the National Education Association. I am proud our \namendment is also supported by over 100 AAPI, Latino, and African-\nAmerican civil rights groups, educators, women's groups, and the \ndisability community.\n  These groups agree with Senator Hirono and me that AAPI subgroup \ndisaggregation is a top priority. I thank Senator Hirono for her \nleadership on this issue and her dedication to serving the needs of all \nof our communities. I would also like to thank Chairman Alexander and \nranking member Senator Murray for their efforts to not only put \ntogether a bipartisan bill but also to move forward with an open \namendment process during this debate.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to vote in support of the Hirono-\nHeller amendment to ensure that parents have choice and that school \nadministrators alike are able to target students who need the most \nhelp.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, over the weekend, we all cheered on the \nwomen's national soccer team as they beat Japan 5 to 2 in the World \nCup. Their teamwork and the skills they displayed on the field were \nyears in the making. Many of the players on the women's national team \ndeveloped their skills and a love for soccer while attending their \npublic schools growing up.\n  In fact, before midfielder Carli Lloyd shattered records in the World \nCup finals on Saturday, she was the star of the Delran High School \nsoccer team in New Jersey. Unfortunately, not all young girls have the \nsame opportunities today as young boys do to participate in school \nsports. In our Nation's schools, all girls should have equal \nopportunities to pursue athletics, whether they just want to help their \nhigh school team have a winning season or whether they dream of one day \nplaying in the World Cup final.\n  Today, I am offering an amendment to help close the opportunity gap \nin sports between young men and women. Back in 1972, Congress passed \nwhat is known as title IX. That is the law that bans discrimination in \neducation on the basis of gender. This law applies to all educational \nopportunities that have had a huge impact on opening opportunities for \nyoung women to play sports.\n  For the first time, schools were required to provide equal \nopportunity to girls and boys to play organized sports, and they were \nrequired to provide equal benefits and services, like coaches and \ncourts and playing fields. Title IX has truly changed our country for \nthe better. The number of women and girls whose lives it touches is \ngrowing every single day. I have seen that firsthand in my own family. \nWhen I went to school, the atmosphere was a lot different than it is \ntoday. Back then, I could participate in just a very few sports, and it \nwas simply unheard of for women athletes to receive athletic \nscholarships.\n  Now, 15 years later, it was amazing to watch my own daughter choose \nto play soccer, learning to be a part of a team and cheering each other \non and learning how to be gracious in victory and in defeat. The \ndifferences between my daughter's generation and my own could not be \nmore stark.\n  Today, more young women than ever are playing sports, but inequality \nstill exists and girls don't have the same opportunities to play sports \nas boys. In fact, if you add up all of the missed opportunities across \nthe country, young women have 1.3 million fewer chances today to play \nsports in high school compared to boys. That is according to the \nNational Federation of High School Associations. So the amendment I am \noffering that we will be voting on shortly will help ensure that \nschools simply report information about school sports in elementary, \nmiddle, and high school.\n  I thank Senator Mikulski, who has been a champion for title IX, for \nworking with me on this amendment. Under our amendment, schools would \nreport on both access to girls organized sports and the funding for \ngirls sports. For the first time, schools would need to show the \npublic, show all of us, what they spend on travel expenses and \nequipment and uniforms for both boys and girls sports teams. This \ninformation will simply help us shine a light on the persistent \ninequalities in sports between men and women.\n  Playing sports isn't just good for a single sports season, it has a \npositive effect on and off the field. According to the National \nCollegiate Athletic Association, when young women play sports, they are \nmore likely to have higher grades, and they are more likely to graduate \nfrom high school than nonathletes. Research also shows that girls who \nhave opportunities to play sports have lower risk of obesity later in \nlife, lower incidence of depression, and more positive body image than \nnonathletes.\n  Congress can help ensure that girls all over our country have the \nchance not only to improve their athletic ability but also to develop \nvaluable skills like teamwork and discipline and self-confidence. Those \nskills lead to success on and off the playing field.\n  I urge our colleagues to vote for this important amendment. Let's \ngive young women and girls equal opportunity in sports. So many girls \nacross the country spent this week dreaming of one day being one of \nthose women champions they saw on television last weekend. Let's make \nsure they know Congress has their back.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner).

I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2094\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak on amendment No. 2094, \nwhich is based on legislation I have introduced with Senator Manchin \ncalled the Protecting Students from Sexual and Violent Predators Act. \nThis has bipartisan support. This is a commonsense amendment that will \nprotect children from child molesters and predators infiltrating our \nschools.\n  We all know the overwhelming majority of school employees would never \nharm a child in any way, but we also know pedophiles know where the \nchildren are. They are in the schools. So schools can be a magnet for \nthe very people we need to keep out of our schools. I have been \nfighting this for some time now--over a year and a half--since the \nlegislation was first introduced. I am not going to stop fighting this.\n  There are a lot of good reasons to make this fight happen, to secure \nthe protections for our school kids from these predators. For me, the \nreasons begin with the three children I have, who are 15, 14, and 5 \nyears old. When I put one of my children on a school bus in the \nmorning, I have every right to believe I am sending my child to an \nenvironment where they are as safe as they can possibly be, and so does \nevery other parent in Pennsylvania and every other parent across the \ncountry. We in Congress have the obligation to make sure we are doing \nall we can to make sure they will in fact be in the safest possible \nenvironment. Sadly, we know that is just not always the case.\n\n  The motivation and the inspiration for this legislation that Senator \nManchin and I introduced is a horrendous story about a little boy named \nJeremy Bell, and that story begins, sadly, at a school in Delaware \nCounty, PA, where one of the teachers was repeatedly molesting young \nboys, raping one of the boys.\n  The administrators of the school figured out what was going on. They \nreported it to authorities, but the authorities were never convinced \nthey had enough evidence to mount a strong case. They couldn't \nconfidently charge the predator. So the school decided they would \ndismiss this teacher for sexually abusing his students, but shockingly, \nappallingly, they gave him a letter of recommendation to make sure he \ncould become someone else's problem.\n  Well, given that he was a pedophile and a predator, he surely did \nbecome someone else's problem. He went to West Virginia, became a \nteacher--based in part on the recommendation he got--and rose, in fact, \nto the level of being a school principal. Along the way, of course, he \ncontinued to attack and abuse young boys, finally raping and killing \nyoung Jeremy Bell.\n  Well, justice eventually caught up with that monster. He is serving \nthe rest of his life in jail, as he should, but it was too late for \nJeremy Bell.\n  The sad truth is this is not as isolated an incident as we would like \nto think and as it should be. In fact, last year there were 459 arrests \nof school employees for sexual misconduct with the kids they are \nsupposed to be taking care of. So far this year we are on track to have \neven more arrests than last year. Keep in mind that these are the cases \nwhere the evidence is so clear the prosecution is confident in making \nan arrest and pressing charges. How many more cases are out there where \nwe just don't have enough certainty to actually make the arrest and \npress the charges? There are many more.\n  So Senator Manchin and I decided we would introduce legislation that \nwould take an important step towards the goal of protecting our kids. \nOur legislation has two big categories, two big features that together \nwould go a long way toward ensuring greater security for our kids.\n  One is a Federal standard for criminal background checks. Let me just \nrespond to the comments made by the Senator from Illinois just a few \nminutes ago, suggesting that somehow my legislation requires a \nduplicative background check. That is factually and simply incorrect. \nThere is no duplication. There is no redundancy. What we do in our \nlegislation is to establish a Federal standard and say that all of the \nmajor criminal databases must be checked, but we don't ask anyone to \ncheck it twice. I don't know how that idea occurred. The checks are a \nsensible way to make sure nobody slips through the cracks.\n  We do require there be a periodic review, at the frequency \nestablished by the States, so we make sure we are checking up on school \nemployees periodically. That is not a redundancy.\n  The second fundamental aspect of our legislation, after the criminal \nbackground checks, is that we would prohibit the practice of knowingly \nrecommending for hire a predator, a violent abuser, a pedophile. This, \nunfortunately, has its own name. This practice is called passing the \ntrash. That recommendation was exactly what allowed Jeremy Bell's \nkiller to get a job as a teacher so that he could prey on Jeremy Bell. \nOur legislation would forbid that.\n  Both of these protections have broad bipartisan support. The House of \nRepresentatives, by the way, unanimously passed a bill that is \nvirtually identical just in the last Congress. And just last fall the \nHouse and Senate combined, by a combined vote of 523 to 1, adopted the \nChild Care and Development Block Grant Act, which has the same \nlanguage. It has the same provisions to\n\n[[Page S4829]]\n\nprotect children in childcare centers from these kinds of predators. I \nfully support that protection for very young kids. I just fail to see \nwhy we shouldn't provide the same level of security and protection for \nslightly older kids. That is what this is about.\n  So in addition to the bipartisan support, our legislation has been \nendorsed by many, many groups--child protection groups, law enforcement \ngroups, prosecutors, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the \nPennsylvania School Board Association. There is very broad support for \nthis because it makes sense.\n  Let me go a little bit more into detail about these two aspects.\n  First, there is the criminal background check. Let's be clear. Every \nState does some kind of criminal background check on hiring for \nschools. The problem is many are woefully inadequate. In some cases \nthey miss entire databases, and so they miss convictions.\n  For instance, some States check only their State database. They do \nnot check the Federal database so they do not know about the criminal \nconvicted two States over who moved into their State postconviction.\n  Another fact is that many States don't require background checks for \ntheir contractors. In our legislation, if you are an adult who has \nunsupervised contact with kids--whether you are a bus driver, a sports \ncoach or the janitor in the school--you have to have the background \ncheck. Some States don't require that.\n  We establish a Federal standard so that we are protecting all kids \nuniformly. So this whole background check component is what I consider \nthe first part of the bill.\n  The second part, which is really a distinct part but still every bit \nas crucial, is this prohibition against passing the trash that I \nalluded to earlier. This is a provision that would have perhaps \nprevented the murder of Jeremy Bell. We simply say if a school wishes \nto receive Federal funds, it has to ban this practice.\n  This is so appalling--the idea that someone would knowingly recommend \nfor hire a predator who is preying on children. It is so appalling that \nit is hard to believe it happens, but the fact is it does. Sometimes it \nhappens across State lines, and there is nothing any State can do about \nthe laws of a different State. This absolutely calls for a Federal \nsolution.\n  For example, recently in Las Vegas, NV, a kindergarten teacher was \narrested for kidnapping a 16-year-old girl and infecting her with a \nsexually transmitted disease. That same teacher, it turns out, had \nmolested six children--fourth and fifth graders--just several years \nbefore in Los Angeles, CA. Now, the Los Angeles school district knew \nabout the allegations. In fact, not only did they know about the \nallegations, but they were so concerned that when a lawsuit was filed \nagainst them they recommended settling.\n  The Nevada school district specifically asked if there had been any \ncriminal concerns regarding the teacher who was a candidate for a job, \nand the Los Angeles school district not only hid the truth but provided \nthree references for the teacher. I think that makes it abundantly \nclear that this is a problem that transcends State lines. There is \nnothing Nevada could have done about the dishonesty and the deceit of \nthe people in the Los Angeles school district who allowed this to \nhappen.\n  Let me sum this up. The Toomey-Manchin bill offers a simple \nproposition. It says if a school district wants to use Federal tax \ndollars, it has to make sure those dollars are not being used to pay \npedophiles' salaries.\n  I don't think that is an unreasonable demand. To do that, it says \nthere are two components. One is that you perform a criminal background \ncheck that is rigorous enough to catch people who have criminal \nbackgrounds and a prohibition against passing the trash.\n  Now, we have run into opposition on this, as you know. In fact, there \nwas a letter signed by a number of organizations led by the National \nEducation Association, the Nation's largest teachers union group. The \nbasic thrust of the argument in the letter is that it is unfair to \nexclude even a convicted admitted child abuser from being a \nschoolteacher. Here is the quote from the letter: ``Individuals who \nhave been convicted of crimes and have completed their sentences should \nnot be unnecessarily subjected to additional punishment because of \nthese convictions.''\n  Under this logic, an admitted convicted child molester can finish \ntheir prison term, walk out of a prison, go across the street to a \nschool and be hired to be a first grade teacher. That is ridiculous. \nOur kids are not part of some social experiment to see how often \nconvicted child molesters will repeat their crimes. I am not going to \ntolerate or risk trapping small children in a classroom with a \nconvicted child rapist. That is unbelievable.\n  We have a national sex offender registry for exactly this reason. As \na society, we understand these people commit these crimes serially. \nEven after serving a prison sentence, very often they go right back to \ntheir old ways. So I think it is perfectly acceptable--in fact, it is \nincumbent upon us--to say that when someone has been convicted of this \ntype of crime they are disqualified from being left in unsupervised \ncontact with children.\n  The same letter from the National Education Association endorsed an \nalternative amendment that has been proposed by Senator Whitehouse. He \nhas proposed an alternative to my amendment, and I find it troublesome \nbecause, among other problems, the Whitehouse amendment actually would \nweaken the protections in existing State laws.\n  There are 44 States that currently have a category of criminal \nconviction which precludes a person from ever being hired to teach in a \nschool or to have unsupervised contact with kids. What Senator \nWhitehouse would do in his legislation is to require every State to \ngive these individuals the legal right to challenge their being blocked \nfrom being hired. That does not exist in 45 States right now.\n  So you have to ask yourself: What possible purpose could there be for \nmandating that States create these minitrials, some little judicial \nmechanism to challenge the notion that they should be precluded from a \njob based on their prior conviction for child abuse? The only purpose \nwould be to get an exemption so they could be hired. Well, I am shocked \nSenator Whitehouse would propose legislation that would weaken the \nexisting protections we have in 45 States, but that is what he does.\n  I would point out that in the case of the Child Care and Development \nBlock Grant Act--which passed 523 to 1 and was supported by every \nDemocrat in the House and the Senate, by the way, the one vote being \nfor unrelated reasons--that language that protected kids did not have \nthis mechanism of creating a quasi-judicial entity so that convicted \nchild abusers could nevertheless be hired. So if it wasn't a good idea \nthen, when we were passing legislation that pertains to daycares, it is \nnot a good idea now. So I hope we will oppose the Whitehouse amendment.\n  I just want to underscore that there is urgency to this problem. Last \nyear alone there were 459 teachers arrested for sexual abuse or \nmisbehavior with the children they are supposed to be taking care of. \nWe are on path so far, in the 6 months into this new calendar year, to \nhave far more arrests than we had last year. Every one of these stories \nis not a statistic. Every one of these stories is a huge personal \ntragedy--a shattered life, a stolen childhood, often a family torn \napart by grief and misery. How many more of these kinds of arrests are \nwe going to tolerate before we establish a better system for preventing \nthis from happening in the first place?\n  I think it is time for no more excuses. The House of Representatives \nhas already passed this legislation unanimously. All we need to do is \npass this amendment on this bill, and it will find its way to the \nPresident's desk. It will be signed, and kids across America will be \nmore secure.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Toomey-Manchin amendment--\nProtecting Students from Sexual and Violent Predators Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S4830]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 \nminute on the Hirono-Heller amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2109\n\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the \nHirono-Heller amendment No. 2109.\n  The current AAPI--American Asian Pacific Islander--category hides \nhuge achievement gaps among subgroups, i.e., Chinese, Filipino, \nVietnamese, Japanese, et cetera. With better subgroup data, teachers, \nparents, policymakers, and community organizations will know where they \ncan target support to the students who need the help most.\n  Our amendment only applies to districts with over 1,000 AAPI \nstudents. We are not talking about 1,000 students but 1,000 AAPI \nstudents, which means fewer than 3 percent of school districts \nnationwide would be affected. That is about 400 out of over 16,000 \nschool districts. Currently, Delaware, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, New \nHampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia, and \nWyoming have no districts that would be affected.\n  Our amendment is endorsed by over 100 groups, including teachers, \nprincipals, school choice and charter school groups, not to mention a \ncoalition of AAPI, Latino, African American, women's, and disability \nrights groups.\n  This is not an onerous requirement on school districts. They already \nhave the capacity to collect this kind of what we call disaggregated \ndata, which will enable all of our schools to help the kids who need \nthe help the most.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. HIRONO. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment. Instead of \nlessening the national school board, this would make it more intrusive. \nThis amendment would say that instead of schools reporting the academic \nresults of five major racial groups, they would do it by country of \norigin. There are 196 countries of origin. So if we apply the same \nthinking to White, Hispanic, Black, Native American, we would have an \namazing mandate from Washington to States about this amount of data.\n  The Senator's argument should be made to a local school board, which \nmay do this if it wishes, or to a State board, which may make these \naggregations if it wishes, but this should not be a Washington mandate \nto increase from 5 to 16 the number of countries mandated under Asian \nAmerican and Pacific Islander and to set a precedent for country-of-\norigin reports for 196 countries.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2109.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support amendment \nNo. 2107 to restore four title VII grant programs that were removed \nfrom the Every Child Achieves Act. These initiatives will help Native \nAmerican students who are too often forgotten in the debate about \nimproving education in America. Restoring these initiatives will help \nstudents in Indian Country develop the tools they need to succeed.\n  The bottom line is that this authorizes programs that were removed \nfrom ESEA. These programs help Native American kids succeed, and they \nneed all the help they can get. These programs have never been funded. \nThis is an authorization bill. If we put it in, these programs will \ncontinue to be authorized and we can fight about funding later, but to \ntake them out of an authorization bill means these programs are dead, \nand I think it would be a disservice to Indian Country.\n  I would appreciate a ``yes'' vote on amendment No. 2107.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I urge a ``no'' vote. These programs \nhave not been funded for 20 years for a good reason. It is because the \nmoney for these programs can come through other programs, such as the \nWorkforce Innovation Act.\n  This bipartisan bill consolidates 49 programs that were authorized or \nfunded through No Child Left Behind. This would take us in the \ndirection of more Federal programs, not fewer.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote so that we can reduce the amount of Federal \nprograms from Washington to the States, and let's use the existing \ndollars that we have to help Indians, Native Americans, and Alaska's \nnative education programs. That is the most effective way to do it.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the votes following the first vote in \nthis series--that means this vote and the next vote--be 10 minutes in \nlength.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, if you really want to solve inequality \nin America by giving children an opportunity to attend a better school, \nvote yes because that would give any State the opportunity to take 89 \nFederal programs, consolidate them into $2,100 scholarships, and give \none of those scholarships to every low-income child in the State--that \nis 20 percent of the children--for that child to decide which school \nthey would attend. It might be public; it might be private. We would be \nusing the same policy that we used with colleges and universities. The \nmoney follows the child to the school that the parent decides that \nchild should attend. This is not a mandate; this is an opportunity. The \nschools would have to be accredited.\n  If you really want to create equality in America by giving every \nchild an opportunity to be at the same starting line, let the State \ndecide to give a $2,100 scholarship to follow a low-income child to the \nschool that the family decides the student should attend, public or \nprivate.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this amendment would retreat on our \nfundamental commitment to make sure that every child has access to a \nquality education, and it would do it by consolidating almost every K-\n12 education program we have and turning that funding into a public or \nprivate school voucher. It would cut programs for STEM, for literacy, \nfor afterschool--priorities that are important to Members across the \naisle, and it would dismantle the important bipartisan work we have \ndone to fix this badly broken No Child Left Behind law in a way that \nworks for parents, teachers, and students. It ignores the research on \nthe impact of concentrated poverty on student achievement and allows \nStates to move Federal resources from our highest needs schools and \ndistricts to more affluent ones and to unaccountable private schools.\n  I know my colleague from Tennessee understands this is a nonstarter \nfor me, and I really urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We have pretty well worked through some of the more \ncontentious amendments we have had to deal with. We expect to have more \namendments tomorrow morning before lunch, although it probably will be \nlater tonight, even in the morning, before we have an agreement on how \nto do that. So we will continue to work toward that.\n  Let me see if the Senator from Washington has any comments she would \nlike to make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Let me say to the Senator from Tennessee that his work \non this has been really great. We are working hard on both sides of the \naisle to get a bill to the President, and this is part of that process. \nI concur with him that we are working through this, and our hope is to \nget up some more amendments tomorrow morning. We should be able to \nannounce that later tonight or tomorrow morning.\n  Again, I thank the chairman of the committee.\n\n[[Page S4832]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/08/senate-section/article/S4832-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Mr. President, I first want to thank Senator Alexander, \nand I have a few remarks to make about sanctuary cities and how they \nthreaten the safety of our country.\n  I am cosponsoring Senator Cotton's amendment to this bill that would \nwithhold Federal law enforcement funds to sanctuary jurisdictions. The \namendment, based largely on the provisions of the Michael Davis, Jr. \nand Danny Oliver in Honor of State and Local Law Enforcement Act, which \nwe introduced a few weeks ago, ensures that jurisdictions that choose \nto endanger their communities and the public at large by adopting these \nreckless policies receive no Federal law enforcement funding.\n  It is a fundamental principle of law enforcement that individuals who \nare tried in one jurisdiction and who also face charges in other \njurisdictions are held and turned over to the next jurisdiction before \nbeing released because it becomes an extremely dangerous problem if \nthey are released before charges are disposed of in another \njurisdiction. That is being violated deliberately and openly by a \nnumber of cities in the country as an act of defiance and disrespect \nfor those traditions of courtesy between Federal and State \njurisdictions and even county and city jurisdictions.\n  Congress has an obligation to ensure that limited taxpayer dollars \nare not given to those cities and counties that refuse to cooperate \nwith basic Federal law enforcement efforts to remove criminal aliens \nfrom the country.\n  I would like to take a few moments to talk about the life of Kate \nSteinle. Kate was a 32-year-old young woman who grew up approximately \n40 miles east of San Francisco in Pleasanton, CA. She graduated from \nAmador Valley High School and California Polytechnic State University. \nShe worked as a sales representative for a medical device equipment \ncompany and was precisely the type of person every parent aspires for \ntheir child to become. Kate's family described her as ``loving, smart \nand beautiful.'' Kate's brother said that ``she was the most wonderful, \nloving, caring person.'' Kate's friends described her as an ``amazing, \nvery compassionate person'' with an infectious smile and the kind of \nfriend who was always there.\n  Last Wednesday, Kate had plans to visit her brother and his wife in \nPleasanton with the hopes of learning whether she would soon have a new \nniece or nephew. Before leaving, she spent some time with her father \nstrolling around San Francisco and taking pictures at Pier 14--one of \nthe busiest and most popular tourist destinations in the city.\n  While on Pier 14 and in broad daylight, Kate was shot to death by an \nillegal alien. Kate's mother, Liz Sullivan, described the horrific \nencounter to the San Francisco Chronicle, explaining that Kate just \nkept saying, ``Dad, help me, help me.'' Kate's father performed CPR \nuntil the paramedics arrived and took her to the hospital, where she \nfought for her life but ultimately passed away.\n  Her death was at the hands of Francisco Sanchez, an illegal alien \nwith seven felony convictions who had been deported to Mexico at least \nsix separate times, most recently in 2009. According to information \nobtained by my office, this individual's criminal history includes \nmultiple criminal convictions and lengthy Federal and State prison \nsentences dating back to 1991, including felony heroin possession, \nfelony manufacture of narcotics, revoked probation, and at least four \nconvictions for illegal reentry after deportation, among others.\n  In an interview with local media, this individual admitted to \nshooting Kate. In the same interview, the individual stated that he \nrepeatedly returned to San Francisco because he knew San Francisco was \na sanctuary city where he would not be pursued by immigration \nofficials.\n  Make no mistake--in essence, that is what a sanctuary city is. Not \nonly do they not honor detainers--the basic law enforcement requirement \nbetween jurisdictions--but they send a signal that ``No matter whether \nyou are legal or illegal, you are safe in our city, and we will do \nnothing to facilitate your apprehension for violations of law.''\n  Despite this extensive criminal history of approximately six prior \ndeportations and no obligation to release this individual to local \ncustody in San Francisco--a jurisdiction that is known to release \nillegal immigrants back into the public--Federal authorities turned \nthis individual over to San Francisco on March 26.\n  I question whether the Federal Government should have ever turned him \nover to San Francisco. Perhaps they should have deported him on the \nspot. But, courtesy says, San Francisco indicated they had another \ncriminal charge and they turned him over. The charge apparently was for \ndistribution of a controlled substance. On April 15, for reasons which \nat this point are unclear, this individual was released from San \nFrancisco County Jail--an action that led directly to the death of Kate \nSteinle on July 1.\n  So San Francisco filed a detainer with the Bureau of Prisons, which \nhad this individual in custody, and the Bureau of Prisons dutifully--\naccording to, it appears, normal procedures--turned him over to San \nFrancisco for processing of San Francisco's criminal charge. Then, the \nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, doing its job, filed their \ndetainer with San Francisco in effect saying: San Francisco, when you \nfinish handling this case, he is ours to be deported. Being a sanctuary \ncity, however, San Francisco did not honor it.\n  Notably, within the same 24-hour period, across the country in \nanother sanctuary jurisdiction--Laredo, TX--Angelica Martinez was \nbrutally murdered with a hammer by her husband, Juan Francisco De Luna \nVasquez, an illegal alien. He had been deported from the United States \nfour times. Local police said this was the third violent encounter \nbetween this couple and that Vasquez had also had a previous driving-\nwhile-intoxicated charge and a charge for evading arrest. As a \nsanctuary city, Laredo refused to even tell the Department of Homeland \nSecurity of the arrest and denied Homeland Security the ability to file \na detainer with their jurisdiction. They just denied it.\n  These cases, colleagues, highlight the tragic and completely \navoidable consequences of sanctuary jurisdiction policies. Indeed, if \nnot for sanctuary cities and the Obama administration's continued \ndestruction in other areas of immigration enforcement, Kate and others \nsurely would be alive today. Her death could have been prevented, but \nthe extreme open borders ideology that rejects even the deportation of \ncriminals--that is, people who commit crimes other than the crime of \nentering the country illegally--led to her death, as it has led to the \ndeath of many others.\n  Although sanctuary jurisdictions are not a recent development, they \nhave been allowed to flourish under this administration. Let me repeat \nthat. This administration has allowed sanctuary cities to flourish. On \na few occasions, officials in the government have complained, once \nabout Chicago, Cook County, but no action was ever taken to pressure \nCook County to change. The administration has not only refused to stop \ncities from acting in this way but has emboldened them with this \nsystematic dismantling of immigration enforcement.\n  In fact, while this administration has taken legal action against \nState and local jurisdictions that have simply attempted to help the \nFederal Government enforce our immigration laws, they sued them to \nblock their efforts to enforce the law or help the Federal Government \nenforce the law--States and counties which have never attempted to \ndeport people, but they have taken efforts when they capture somebody \nfor a crime or for a DUI and find out they are illegally in the \ncountry--they would like to be able to turn them over to the Federal \nGovernment in some fashion so they can be deported.\n  This has been resisted by the Federal Government, unfortunately. In \n2010,\n\n[[Page S4833]]\n\nthe Federal Government openly announced it would not undertake any \nlegal action against sanctuary jurisdictions for refusing to cooperate \nwith the enforcement of our immigration laws. Thus, while it had the \ntime and resources to sue States like Arizona and litigate such cases \nall the way to the Supreme Court, this administration has not spent a \ndime to take similar actions against sanctuary jurisdictions around the \ncountry, and the administration was well aware of the dangers posed by \nthese policies.\n  Former ICE Executive Associate Director of Enforcement and Removal \nOperations Gary Mead said that sanctuary cities--and in particular Cook \nCounty, IL--were ``an accident waiting to happen.'' That was obviously \na sound prediction, and we have seen the tragic results.\n  Not only has the government failed to stand up to sanctuary \njurisdictions, but two days ago--the White House is now claiming that \nif Congress had just passed the Gang of 8 bill, the comprehensive \namnesty bill, then this would never have happened. But the Gang of 8 \nbill the President pushed so hard for would have dramatically increased \nincidents of criminal alien violence, officially legalizing dangerous \noffenders while handcuffing immigration officers from doing their jobs. \nLaw enforcement professionals told us the Gang of 8 bill would have \nundermined the rule of law in America, not strengthened it. These are \nthe people who know.\n  Chris Crane and Ken Palinkas, presidents of the National ICE Council \nthat represents all ICE officers, and the USCIS union, respectively--\nthese two leaders of these two important organizations issued a \nstatement on behalf of their officers--the key officers who enforce \nimmigration law in America. This is what our Federal law officers had \nto say about the President's idea that the Gang of 8 bill would fix \nthese kinds of problems:\n\n       The [Gang of Eight] proposal will make Americans less safe \n     and it will ensure more illegal immigration--especially visa \n     overstays--in the future. It provides legalization for \n     thousands of dangerous criminals while making it more \n     difficult for our officers to identify public safety and \n     national security threats. . . .\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       The legislation was guided from the beginning by anti-\n     enforcement special interests and, should it become law, will \n     have the desired effects of these groups: Blocking \n     immigration enforcement. . . .\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       [It is an] anti-public safety bill and an anti-law \n     enforcement bill.\n\n  Imagine if the country's chief law enforcement officer--that is, the \nPresident of the United States--had spent that year trying to end \nsanctuary cities and deport criminal aliens and enforce the laws of the \nUnited States instead of trying to empower open borders activists and \nfighting against law enforcement and refusing to enforce whole sections \nof plain law through his Executive amnesty what could have been done to \nend unlawfulness in this country and turn this country around.\n  Just to show how deep the disagreement was between the Federal law \nofficers and their supervisors--their politically-appointed \nsupervisors--they actually filed a lawsuit in Federal court contending \nthat their superiors were ordering them to violate their oath to \nenforce the laws of the United States. They sought relief in the \nFederal court. The district judge found merit in their claims, but \nruled against them on a procedural issue. That case is now before the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n  It is an incredible spectacle that law enforcement officers were \nsuing their supervisors--the political appointees of the President--\nbecause they were being ordered to violate the plain law they had sworn \nto uphold.\n  It is time to get our priorities straight. We need immigration reform \nall right but reform that serves the interests of the American people--\nnot international corporations, not anti-enforcement zealots, not the \nopen borders lobby. They don't get to dictate to America how laws \nshould be enforced. Immigration reform should mean improving \nimmigration controls, not further weakening or eliminating them.\n  Just yesterday it was reported that a six-time deported illegal alien \nin Arizona was charged in a felony hit-and-run of a mother and her two \nyoung children who were seriously injured in the crash--six times \ndeported, he returns.\n  When they return, do they not go to jail? Are we just going to \ncontinue to deport them time after time with no real consequence?\n  Mr. President, 121 homicides have been committed by aliens who were \nreleased from ICE custody over the last few years. People who were \nreleased after being held by Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nofficers, illegally here--not deported but were released--have murdered \n121 people.\n  So over 170,000 criminal aliens with final orders of removal are \nwalking our streets. ICE releases tens of thousands of criminal aliens \nevery year into our communities. The policies of this administration \nhave effectively nullified law in a host of areas. That is plain fact.\n  I have talked to the officers personally. I know what the policies \nare. I know the effects of these policies are exactly what the \nadministration wanted, exactly what the special interests wanted, \nexactly what the ACLU wanted, exactly what La Raza wanted. That is what \nthey have been asking for. That is what this administration has \ndelivered.\n  Now, when a murder occurs which becomes national news, they say that \nit is not our fault; it is Congress's fault.\n  These actions have effectively nullified plain law. George Washington \nUniversity Law Professor Jonathan Turley--who supported President \nObama's reelection--has documented that. These are facts. The number of \nacceptable crimes committed by illegal aliens is zero.\n  Congress must take action now to protect all Americans, including the \nmillions of dutiful immigrants who are in our country, many of them in \nhigh-crime areas, to protect them from criminal gangs and violent \noffenders.\n  Just recently, I, along with Senators Vitter, Perdue, Cotton, Inhofe, \nand Boozman, introduced the Michael Davis, Jr. and Danny Oliver in \nHonor of State and Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill named for two \nsheriff's deputies in California who were murdered by an illegal alien \nwith an extensive criminal record, and, I thought, three deportations. \nTalking to the widows of these officers recently, I am told that he may \nhave been deported four times--and had an extensive criminal record.\n  So this bill is a companion to the House bill introduced earlier this \nyear by the chairman of the House Subcommittee on Immigration and \nBorder Security Trey Gowdy. It is a good bill.\n  Our bill is similar. In addition to enhancing cooperation with States \nand local law enforcement and eliminating loopholes that allow criminal \naliens to obtain immigration benefits, this bill would constitute a \nclear, strong, and responsible response to sanctuary jurisdictions and \nother government actions. Specifically, it would withhold Federal \nfunding from sanctuary jurisdictions that do not cooperate with the \nenforcement of Federal immigration laws or do not honor Federal \nimmigration detainers, provide immunity to jurisdictions that honor \ndetainers and hold aliens until ICE can pick them up, and provide a \ngeneral sense of Congress that ``the Department of Homeland Security \nhas probable cause to believe that an alien is inadmissible or \ndeportable when it issues a detainer'' for an alien. That would clear \nup one of the loopholes being cited here to excuse some of these \nactions.\n  By the way, I believe it is 300 sanctuary cities and counties in the \ncountry out of 17,000 or so law enforcement jurisdictions. Some of them \nare quite large cities: Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles.\n  The passage of these sections alone could do more to combat sanctuary \njurisdictions and protect the people of those communities and really \nthe country from criminal aliens than what this administration has \naccomplished in the 7 years or so it has been in office.\n  It is time for Congress to make its first item of business the \nimmediate passage of legislation to cut off Federal law enforcement \nmoneys to sanctuary cities. Not one more parent should lose a son or \ndaughter because American cities are harboring criminals. In any \nState--like mine, I was attorney general of Alabama--one jurisdiction \nis prosecuting a person for a crime, and when that is completed and \nanother one has a warrant against them, they\n\n[[Page S4834]]\n\nfile a detainer. When you are finished with the criminal, he is sent \nback, whether he is acquitted or whether he is convicted. This is basic \nlaw enforcement. It goes on in every jurisdiction in this country.\n  The Federal Government holds people for State jurisdictions and the \nState jurisdictions hold people for the Federal Government. I was a \nFederal prosecutor for 12 years. It is done all the time. It is \nshocking to me--absolutely shocking--that a great city of the United \nStates of America would not honor a detainer by the U.S. Government.\n  The Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers should not second-\nguess why it is issued or not. It is up to that jurisdiction to try or \nacquit or treat responsibly the person they are now prepared to release \nto them. To ignore that is a breach of the most fundamental \nrelationships between Federal law enforcement, and it is done for \npolitical reasons by political mayors, generally, and city councils to \ntry to win votes, I suppose. It has no principle in fact.\n  I am also calling on Congress to move toward a series of measures, \nwhether as stand-alone bills, in appropriations measures or in any \nother planned legislation, to establish immigration reforms that serve \nthe interests of all lawful residents of the United States living here \ntoday. These are some things we need to do:\n  End the release of criminal aliens from Federal custody. We cannot \njust let them go after having been convicted of a crime. They need to \nbe deported. The law says they shall be deported. It has been ignored.\n  Cut off visas to foreign countries that will not repatriate their \naliens. It is an absolute outrage that countries like China refuse to \ntake back people who are lawfully deported by the United States. Yet \nthey want us to give visas to them. We should cut off funding. We \nshould cut off their visas until they agree to promptly take back these \nindividuals. That is the whole basis of international visa law. All \nnations know that. Most nations take their nationals back promptly. \nThis refusal by these countries backs up our system, costs us millions \nof dollars in housing, and all kinds of other additional problems. It \nneeds to end. We can end it just like that if the President would take \naction. The law requires it. The President doesn't really need a law to \nfix that one.\n  Suspend visas to countries with high overstay rates. Some of these \ncountries have this huge number that get a visa and never return home \nand they reach these higher rates. We don't have to keep giving visas \nto countries whose residents don't return like they are supposed to and \nat the time they are supposed to.\n  We need to close the asylum loopholes and eliminate fraud. This is a \nhuge issue and can be greatly abused. We need to end the catch and \nrelease at the border with mandatory detention and repatriation for \nillegal border crossers. This administration has ended Operation \nStreamline, which is a very effective policy. It started during the \nBush administration and was continued for a while under President \nObama. Now they have undermined that.\n  We need to protect the work site with E-Verify. If a person can't \nestablish they are here lawfully with a lawful Social Security number, \nthey don't need to be employed.\n  We need to curtail an oversupply of foreign work visas to protect \nAmerican jobs first. The only immigration measures politicians should \nbe discussing today are those that protect Americans, that protect \nAmerican security and safety and American jobs and American \ncommunities. More than enough has been done for the special interests. \nThey have had their day. They had their day too long.\n  Whether we are talking about employees at Walt Disney in Florida, \nunemployed construction workers in California or truck drivers in North \nDakota, it is time for the needs of Americans who are out of work to \ncome first. We don't have enough jobs for Americans. We don't need to \nbring in more foreign workers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Mr. President, this is the 105th time I have come to \nthe Senate floor to urge my colleagues to wake up to the reality of \nclimate change. I know the Presiding Officer is a veteran of several of \nthese speeches. For far too long, far too many of us in this Chamber \nhave simply dismissed the evidence of climate change. They have ignored \nthe sober warnings of scientists, generals, of doctors, of economists, \neven of big company CEOs that these risks are real. The warnings are \nclear: If we continue on our present path, we will leave our children \nand grandchildren with a world very different from our own and not for \nthe better.\n  By denying the science, dismissing the risks or simply by their \nsilence, Senate Republicans have effectively pledged allegiance to the \nfossil fuel companies--companies that make a lot of money polluting the \natmosphere with carbon emissions and that spend big on politics.\n  Outside this Chamber, however, the American people want action. \nAmericans overwhelmingly favor limits on greenhouse gases and getting \nmore electricity from renewables. It is happening across the country. \nIt is definitely true in Rhode Island, my home State, but it is not \njust Rhode Islanders.\n  Over this past recess, I went to Tennessee. I found that people in \nthe Volunteer State see the effects, they see the risks, and they see \nthe opportunities that come with climate change.\n  In Knoxville, I met with Mayor Madeline Rogero, and I heard about the \ngreat work she is doing. Knoxville is making their infrastructure more \nresilient to flooding and storms and working to reduce its greenhouse \ngas emissions, partnering with local utilities and citizens groups. \nGreenhouse gas emissions from the city's operations were down 12 \npercent in 2014, compared to 2005. Their goal is to make it to 20 \npercent.\n  Mayor Rogero told me about the risks climate change poses in Eastern \nTennessee: changes in the Smoky Mountains parks nearby, programs like \nRound It Up that help people with utility bills getting hammered by \nearlier, hotter summer weather. She told me Knoxville wasn't alone. \nEven little Ducktown, TN, built a 28-kilowatt solar array.\n  I visited Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which is researching how \nclimate change will affect Tennessee and the United States and the rest \nof the world. Let me tell you, they are not doubting climate change at \nOak Ridge. They are planning for it. They are modeling warming up to 18 \ndegrees Fahrenheit in the vast boreal forest regions of the Northern \nHemisphere.\n  They are concerned about the phony science being propagated by the \nfossil fuel industry front groups--what I have called the parallel \nscience designed to look like science without actually being peer-\nreviewed or meeting the standards--and they are saddened to see the \npublic taken in and Congress stalled. They have a brilliant animation \nof industrial-era carbon emissions climate. If I could use a monitor \ninstead of this piece of cardboard I would show it to you, but I can't. \nSo you will have to find it. You can go to my website where I have a \nlink: whitehouse.senate.gov/climatechange.\n\n[[Page S4835]]\n\n  One employee at Oak Ridge, a Tennessean who had grown up nearby, told \nme about the recent trouble with fire ants. The fire ant is an invasive \nspecies from South America that can deliver a nasty sting. She said \ngrowing up she had never seen them--not a worry. Now she has to worry \nabout a swarm of them getting on her children. Normally, cold nights \nand winter freezes limit the range of the fire ant. But this invasive \nspecies has moved north into Tennessee with the warming temperatures.\n  For those colleagues who believe the only values that matter are \nthose that can be monetized, the USDA estimates that U.S. losses to the \ninvasive fire ant are almost $6 billion a year.\n  Fire ants aren't the only invasive pests that benefit from warmer \nnights and winters. The threat of the invading emerald ash borer and \nthe Asian longhorned beetle means that campers visiting Tennessee can't \nbring their own firewood into the Great Smoky Mountains National Park \nanymore. As of March 1, only heat-treated firewood is allowed, \ncertified by the USDA or the State.\n  Climate change threatens the Great Smoky Mountains with much more \nthan invasive species. The national park may lose up to 17 percent of \nthe mammals that presently live there as climate change shifts their \nhabitat and changes the composition of the forest.\n  The Tennessee Wildlife Resource Agency says that ``Tennessee's \nwildlife and natural resources face a serious threat from climate \nchange.'' The agency did a comprehensive assessment of the potential \neffects climate change would have on the State's wildlife. These are \nsome of its key findings:\n\n       Tennessee's forests are expected to undergo changes in \n     forest growth and composition. . . . [S]ome high elevation \n     forest types will be dramatically impacted or lost entirely; \n     brook trout populations are expected to decline; migratory \n     songbirds may alter their ranges, with some species \n     disappearing from Tennessee altogether; and larger floods and \n     longer droughts could cause increased erosion, reduced water \n     supply, and the spread of invasive species.\n\n  Meeting with local environmental leaders and advocates at the \nSouthern Alliance for Clean Energy, I learned that air quality is \nanother significant problem for the Volunteer State, especially in \nEastern Tennessee.\n  Here is a map I got from them showing the counties that still get a D \nor an F for air quality: Sullivan County, D; Knox County, D; Loudon \nCounty, D; Jefferson County, D; Sevier County, F; Blount County, F; \nHamilton County, which has Chattanooga in it, F; Cannon County, D; \nWilson County, F; Williamson County, F; Shelby County, F.\n  If you fix the carbon pollution from the coal plants, you will fix a \nlot of these air quality problems, too, and these air quality problems \nin the famous Great Smoky Mountains. They were smoky enough, I guess, \nto begin with. This is not helping.\n  I also learned of the threats posed by flooding from storms. In May \n2010, a massive storm rolled over Tennessee and caused $1.5 billion \ndamage in Nashville alone. FEMA declared disaster areas in 30 counties \nand more than 60,000 families received Federal aid. Precipitation has \nmeasurably increased in parts of Tennessee during the last century, and \nas climate change continues, heavy rains and extreme weather are \nexpected to increase. For fishermen, in addition to the warming of the \nstream water, streams that are blown out by extreme rains are bad for \ntrout fishing.\n\n  In Tennessee I also saw great hope for climate action. Mayor Rogero \nis working with Oak Ridge National Laboratory to design a climate \nchange sustainability plan for Knoxville and the area around it, \nincluding the lab campus. The laboratory is also a leading research \ncenter for advanced nuclear technology, including small modular \nreactors that could help unlock low-carbon energy with reduced risk of \naccidents or proliferation.\n  Tennessee is ripe with wind and solar potential, and the famous \nTennessee Valley Authority, after a slow start, is getting around to \nrenewables investments and supporting distributed generation. The TVA \nhas learned from things such as having to derate powerplants on the \nTennessee River because the river grew too warm to cool the thermal \nload of the plant and seeing giant demand sways from 12,000 to 35,000 \nmegawatts.\n  I met with University of Tennessee professors who are helping the TVA \nmake the move. The University of Tennessee has entire programs on \nclimate change. They are not denying it. They have professors such as \nDean Rivkin at the College of Law, Mary English at the Howard Baker \nCenter, and John Nolt, recently the head of the faculty senate, who has \nwritten on the moral importance of counting climate casualties. By the \nway, Professor Nolt cites studies showing global deaths from the \nconsequences of climate change every year in the range of 140,000, \n300,000 and 400,000. But why should we care?\n  Private companies get it in Tennessee. I heard a lot about Wampler's \nFarm Sausage, headquartered in Lenoir City, which has invested in solar \nand biomass energy production to cut down on energy bills and provide \nstability to its business. For them it is about business and the \nenvironment. The company sees consumer demand ahead for sustainably \nproduced products. In the words of company president Ted Wampler, Jr., \n``being green is going to sell sausage.''\n  I had a nice dinner with lovely people from the Knoxville Garden \nClub. Some had come to Congress for the annual garden club trip to urge \nCongress to take action. They see in their garden the changes that are \nreflected in the USDA plant hardiness zone for Knoxville shifting in \ntheir very lifetimes.\n  A highlight of the trip was the annual meeting of the Outdoor Writers \nAssociation of America. I was invited by the executive director, Tom \nSaddler, and joined a panel with Dr. Cameron Wake from the University \nof New Hampshire, Hal Herring from Field & Stream magazine, and Todd \nTanner, the president of Conservation Hawks. I urge anybody who is \nlistening to this to take 10 minutes and look at the fly fishing clip \n``Cold Waters'' on the Conservation Hawk's Web site. It is called \nco2ldwaters.org, but the trick is there is a ``2'' in the middle. The \nWeb site is co2ldwaters.org. One thing was crystal clear from our panel \nand from the discussion that followed, and that is this: Real \noutdoorsmen don't deny climate change. If you don't believe me, believe \nlegendary outdoorsman Yvon Chouinard. Look at the clip at \nco2ldwaters.org.\n  If we in this Chamber could wake up and stop denying this problem, we \ncould do a lot to help. Real legislative action, such as a price on \ncarbon, could unlock energy innovation and it could make the fat-cat, \npolitician-buying polluters actually compete fair and square on a level \nplaying field with clean energy. Of course they would rather not. They \nwould rather pollute the world and rig the politics to rig the \ncompetition so they can keep polluting for free.\n  If you think from my comments that I am mad about the disgraceful \npolitical conduct of the oil and coal barons, well, you are right; I \nam. It is sickening. It is a disgrace. And no, it is not good enough to \nsay just enough good things about climate change to get through a \ncocktail party at Davos, while you keep your corporate money flowing to \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Petroleum Institute, and \nother denial front groups to stop progress at all costs. You can't have \nit both ways. I will know the Big Oil CEOs are serious when they \npublicly tell the Wall Street Journal editorial page that it is OK to \nknock off the climate denial.\n  What I would like is to take their high-priced lobbyists, to take \ntheir slippery lawyers, to take their paid-for bogus scientists and put \nthem all up in the high country for a week with Yvon Chouinard or \nsomeone like him who really loves and knows the country they are \nwrecking. It just might be good for their souls.\n  Senator Schatz and I have a bill to level the energy playing field by \nlevying a carbon fee on fossil fuel emissions. In our bill every nickel \ncollected goes back to the American people, and most of it goes back \nthrough cutting taxes. When it is time for Republicans to break free of \nthis filthy grip the fossil fuel industry has, we will be there. We \nwill be there, and we will be waiting. Take a look at our bill. It \nwould be a win-win-win for the American people, and it aligns with what \nso many Republicans outside of Congress are saying about the correct \nsolution to the climate problem.\n\n[[Page S4836]]\n\n  I hope my Republican colleagues, particularly my friends from \nTennessee, take a close look at it. Both Senators from Tennessee \nrecognize human-caused climate change. The senior Senator, our friend \nwho has just done such a masterful job of bringing this elementary and \nsecondary education bill to the floor and steering it so far through \nthis process, is a renowned champion of clean energy research and of \nelectric vehicles.\n  Tennessee's junior Senator said in 2009, when cap-and-trade ideas \nwere swirling:\n\n       I wish we would just talk about a carbon tax, 100 percent \n     of which would be returned to the American people. So there's \n     no net dollars that would come out of the American people's \n     pockets.\n\n  Gentlemen, that is our bill. I am open to this discussion any time, \nbut let's please not wait too long. As they know at Oak Ridge, as they \nknow in the mayor's offices in Knoxville and Ducktown, as they know at \nthe University of Tennessee, and as the rangers know up in the Great \nSmoky Mountains, time's a wasting, and we need to wake up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/08/senate-section/article/S4836-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       MILLENNIUM COMPACTS FOR REGIONAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION ACT\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to speak about the successes of the \nMillennium Challenge Corporation, or MCC, which is one of the U.S. \nGovernment's newest and most potent resources in the war against global \npoverty.\n  MCC was founded by a bipartisan act of Congress in 2004 as a new way \nto deliver foreign assistance. While the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment, USAID, remains a critical tool for working with countries \nin need, MCC was given a very specific and focused goal: to reduce \npoverty through economic growth. The countries receiving MCC grants \nwould be partners with a strong say in how their money would be spent. \nAnd, countries would need to compete for MCC dollars--only the best \ngoverned countries that performed better than their peers on matters of \neconomic freedom, ruling justly, and investing in their people, would \nbe worthy of MCC funding.\n  The MCC model is working. Countries are taking a hard look at their \nproblems and poring over their performance scorecards so that they can \nbecome MCC-eligible. Academics have confirmed that the so-called ``MCC \nEffect''--MCC's ability to incentivize significant policy reforms from \ncountries seeking a compact--is real and meaningful.\n  MCC countries are reforming in vital ways to be part of MCC. Ghana, \nfor example, is reforming its entire power sector in order to receive \nMCC assistance. In Lesotho, women were fundamentally unequal citizens, \nunable to open a bank account without a man's permission. MCC made the \nLesotho partnership contingent upon removing those barriers, and women \nnow enjoy economic freedoms unavailable to them before.\n  With 11 years under its belt and a proven record of success, the MCC \nis looking towards the future and assessing how it can amplify its \nalready significant effects on fighting poverty. One way we can do that \nis to give MCC the flexibility to coordinate its work on a regional \nbasis. That is why I introduced S. 1605, the Millennium Compacts for \nRegional Economic Integration Act, or the M-CORE Act, along with \nSenators Flake, Coons, and Isakson on June 18, 2015. The M-CORE Act \nwould enable MCC to establish concurrent compacts in eligible \ndeveloping countries, enhancing their ability to promote economic \ngrowth and cross-border engagement between and among nations. Through \nthe greater regional economic collaboration that MCC regional compacts \nwill achieve, countries can address deficiencies in communications, \ntransportation, and energy networks. MCC's bilateral compacts have \nincreased access to reliable power, built highway corridors, and \nimproved business climates, thereby promoting economic growth and \ncross-border engagement within MCC partner countries.\n  Regional investments can have an even greater rate of return. In \nCentral America, for example, MCC's work on road infrastructure could \nhave had an even greater impact if the roads connected across borders. \nAnd in Africa, neighboring countries could collaborate on a regional \npower pool, connect land-locked countries to transportation \ninfrastructure, or address other policy, institutional, and logistical \nchallenges that hamper economic growth and development.\n  MCC has, by mandate, always focused on economic analysis and rigorous \ndata; and its approach to regional investments has been no exception. \nMCC's extensive analysis has concluded that a regional approach to \npoverty reduction, under the right circumstances, can present \nopportunities to take advantage of higher rates of return on investment \nand larger scale reductions in poverty.\n  In short, MCC regional investments have the potential to greatly \nenhance economic growth in well-governed regions of the developing \nworld. I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in supporting this \ncommonsense legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/08/senate-section/article/S4836-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4836-S4837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING LINDA NORRIS\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of Linda \nNorris, a beloved former member of both my State and Washington, DC, \nstaff who passed away recently. Linda was the very first member of Team \nCrapo and has left a lasting legacy in my office as well as in her \nadopted State of Idaho.\n  Linda retired from the Senate nearly 7 years ago after providing 18 \nyears of service to Idahoans. Linda was the first staff member to join \nmy congressional campaign as a member of my first House campaign staff. \nShe was prominent and pivotal in my campaign and quickly became one of \nthe most reliable and intuitive staff members. Linda then became my \nfirst regional director in Twin Falls, ID, serving throughout my \nservice in the U.S. House of Representatives and into my service in the \nU.S. Senate. As State Director of Constituent Services, she established \nhigh constituent service standards, ones that are still used in my \noffice, and she advocated strongly for military families and veterans. \nHer friendly nature, southern charm, and quick intellect helped defuse \npotential conflicts, and she represented the House and Senate offices \nwith the utmost professionalism.\n  Whether she was working in Idaho or Washington, DC, her priority was \nto serve the people of Idaho, which she carried out with the utmost \ncare and diligence. Her lasting legacy will be her influence over \ndomestic violence awareness and prevention. More than 20 years ago, she \narranged for me to visit a local shelter for abused children. The visit \ninspired an immovable commitment to increase awareness of domestic \nviolence and to advocate for solutions and assistance for victims in \nevery possible circumstance. Her interest and advocacy in this matter \nalso spurred her into action when she recognized the need for training \npublic servants who worked on public lands in how to handle domestic \nviolence situations that arise when people are on public lands, not in \ntheir homes. With my strong support, she worked with the appropriate \nindividuals within the U.S. Forest Service to initiate programs to \ntrain employees on domestic violence prevention. This remarkable \nachievement might be enough to most people, but Linda was a force that \ncontinued to search for ways to improve the lives of others.\n  She touched the lives of many Idaho military families and youth. As \nan Army wife herself, Linda had a personal understanding of military \nfamilies. This experience gave her empathy to advocate effectively and \nattentively on behalf of Idaho military members, veterans, and their \nfamilies. Linda also instituted and guided my military academy \nnomination process, helping countless Idaho youth on their path to \nsuccess.\n  She was observant, inspired, tactful, and hard-working. Linda helped \nhighlight the unrecognized good deeds of\n\n[[Page S4837]]\n\nfellow Idahoans by suggesting I create two awards: the Spirit of Idaho \nfor volunteers, and the Spirit of Freedom for veterans and those who \nwork with veterans. These awards recognize the extraordinary efforts of \nIdahoans and the service of veterans and volunteers serving veterans. \nShe also helped achieve hard-sought land access and conservation \npolicies. Linda was a nurse by training and profession, which is \nconsistent with her gift for helping and caring for people, a behavior \nshe demonstrated repeatedly. The legacy that she left upon her \nretirement remains today in the Crapo office.\n  Since news of her unexpected passing has reached my staff and former \nstaff members, remembrances of Linda have poured in. I would like to \nshare a few with you:\n  ``Linda was a singular individual who set the pace for constituent \nservices in Idaho. She cared for individuals and families, not `cases'. \nHer approach influenced me and how I set up succeeding constituent \nservices operations. Her zealous care for people has been emulated and \nhas resulted in thousands of Idahoans getting the help they deserve \nfrom their government.''\n  ``Linda was truly an amazing, generous, and gracious lady. She truly \nwas beautiful both inside and out. Linda made me feel so welcome on my \nfirst trip to Idaho. She joked with people that she introduced me to \nthat I was from way, way Southern Idaho. We decided that Lava Hot \nSprings would be my adopted hometown. Really being from Louisiana, I \nloved that Linda and I shared strong Southern roots, and great wacky \nstories.''\n  ``She has that southern mixture of sweetness and sass with an \nunderlying spirit and determination that was always apparent.''\n  Beyond her professional accomplishments, Linda was a great friend. \nNot only did she pay attention to my professional needs, but she also \nrecognized when some personal time was needed. Many times when I was \nworking in her region, she built in time in the schedule for a much \nneeded clothes shopping trip, a visit to the eye doctor, or just some \ndown time with my family. My wife, family, and I have all been blessed \nwith her friendship. Linda will be missed beyond measure, and I extend \ndeep condolences to family and friends. Thank you for your service, \nLinda. Rest in peace, dear friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/08/senate-section/article/S4837-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        RECOGNIZING CANDLE-LITE COMPANY ON ITS 175TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor one of New \nHampshire's most revered and accomplished leaders, Ruth Lewin Griffin, \nas she celebrates her 90th birthday.\n  Born in Fall River, MA, Ruth moved to Portsmouth, NH, at a young age \nand continues to reside there today. Most notably, she served as \nexecutive councilor for the third district of New Hampshire for 20 \nyears. As a testament to her continued commitment to the Granite State, \nRuth currently serves as chairman of the Portsmouth Housing Authority.\n  But Ruth's career of service began long before her time on the \nexecutive council. After graduating from Portsmouth High School, Ruth \nwent on to pursue a degree from Wentworth Hospital School of Nursing. \nUsing the skills she learned as a registered nurse, she dove headfirst \ninto a career as a public servant, holding office as a State senator \nand State representative and serving on the Portsmouth Police \nCommission and board of education. She also served as a delegate to two \nConstitutional Conventions and as a Republican national committeewoman. \nRuth has earned well-deserved praise for her service to our State, \nincluding being named one of New Hampshire's Ten Most Powerful Women \nfor 6 years in a row, and most recently, she received the 2015 Granite \nState Legacy Award, which honors dedication to the State, its people, \nand way of life.\n  In addition to her tremendous service to New Hampshire, Ruth has been \nblessed with a wonderful family, including the late John Griffin, five \nchildren, five grandchildren, and two great-grandsons. Four generations \nof the Griffin family have lived on their family farm, raising sheep, \nchickens, and other livestock. As the matriarch of the family, Ruth \nstrives to teach her family members the values she learned on the \nfarm--hard work, humility, and perseverance. She will often tell you, \ninvoking her family motto, that she lives her life ``by courage, not by \ncunning.''\n  Ruth embodies the spirit of a true New Hampshire leader. Her life is \nmarked by her dedicated service and her devotion to making New \nHampshire a better place to live and work. I had the privilege of \nserving alongside Ruth in the Governor's office and the attorney \ngeneral's office and will be forever grateful for her wisdom, guidance, \nand mentorship. I am very proud to recognize and celebrate Ruth's \nbirthday and her extraordinary contributions to the State. I wish Ruth \nand her family the best on this very special day and for many more \nyears of health and happiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/08/senate-section/article/S4837-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4837-S4838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING LAURA MYERS\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today, we honor the life and legacy \nof Laura Myers, whose passing signifies a great loss to Nevada. I send \nmy condolences and prayers to her family and friends during this time \nof hardship. Laura was an incredible person, committed to bringing joy \nto those around her through humanitarian service and fair-and-balanced \nnews to residents across Nevada. She truly represented the best of \njournalistic excellence. She will be sorely missed by the entire Nevada \nfamily.\n  Laura was born on August 26, 1961, in Las Vegas. She spent the \nmajority of her childhood in northern Nevada, where she received her \neducation and graduated from the University of Nevada, Reno. She began \nher journalism career with the Reno Gazette-Journal in 1984 and took \nher first step in political coverage, reporting the Nevada Legislature, \nin 1987. She was then hired in 1988 by the Associated Press to cover \nnews in Carson City and later in the San Francisco and San Jose, CA, \nareas.\n  Over the next 20 years, Laura pursued both her humanitarian and \njournalistic passion, leaving and returning to the AP several times and \nworking with Habitat for Humanity in Uganda, Mongolia, and New York, \nalongside her day job throughout the 1990s and 2000s. Laura's first \ndeparture from the AP was in 1992 after she joined the Peace Corps, \nwhere she spent time working to help a remote village in Togo, West \nAfrica. In 1995, Laura worked with the American Refugee Committee, \nmanaging logistics at a refugee camp in the Congo. Immediately after, \nshe accepted another job offer from the AP with a position covering \npolitics, foreign affairs, the military, and national security in \nWashington, DC.\n  In 2003, Laura left the AP and fulfilled her passion for movies, \nstudying at the New York Film Academy. Afterwards, in 2006, Laura spent \n10 months in North Africa and the Middle East as a management \nconsultant for Arabic- and French-language newspapers. After filling \nanother position with the AP in 2007, Laura worked for Food for All of \nWashington. From 1988 to 2008, her extraordinary hard work and good \ncharacter maintained a good relationship with the AP, continuously \npreserving an opportunity to return. In 2009, after committing time to \nteaching English to adults in Egypt, Laura returned to Nevada and was \nhired as the Las Vegas\n\n[[Page S4838]]\n\nReview-Journal's political reporter in 2010. Her finals years were \nspent bringing unforgettable political coverage to the Las Vegas \ncommunity.\n  Throughout her 30 years in Nevada journalism, Laura strived to travel \nthe world and achieve a greater understanding of her surroundings. She \nsought to transcribe and bring an accurate picture of her findings to \nher readers. Her insatiable appetite to uncover important news stories \nand bring Nevadans pertinent political information made her the \nincredible journalist that she was. She embodied the Battle Born spirit \nof determination, fearlessness, confidence, and resilience. She was a \nfierce competitor, bringing out the absolute best of Nevada journalism. \nI worked with Laura for many years and have seen firsthand her \nunwavering dedication to her trade. Our relationship operated under an \nopen-door policy, and I am grateful for everything she has done.\n  I extend my deepest sympathies to her family. We will always remember \nLaura for her invaluable contribution to the local community and for \nher compassion that touched so many lives around the globe. Her legacy \nof kindness, dedication, and true drive will echo on for years to come \nin Nevada journalism.\n  Laura fought to bring Nevada only the most accurate journalism. Even \nin her final weeks, her dedication to those around her never faltered. \nI am honored to commend her for her hard work and invaluable \ncontribution to the Silver State. Today, I join the Las Vegas community \nand citizens of the Silver State to celebrate the life of an upstanding \nNevadan and friend, Laura Myers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/08/senate-section/article/S4838-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DAVID SAMRICK\n\n Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I wish to recognize Mr. David \nSamrick on the occasion of his recognition as the 2014 Service Center \nExecutive of the Year by Metal Center News. Mr. Samrick has worked at \nMill Steel since 1965, and was named president in 1976 after his father \nstepped back from day-to-day management of the family's company. Under \nhis leadership, Mill Steel has grown from a single-location in Grand \nRapids, MI into the 23rd largest service center organization selling \nflat-rolled steel from Canada to the gulf coast. I appreciate the \nopportunity to recognize Mr. Samrick's success as a business leader, as \nwell as the contributions he has made to communities throughout western \nMichigan.\n  Mr. Samrick is the heart and soul of Mill Steel, the company founded \nby his parents in 1959. Its success is a testament to Mr. Samrick's \nteam-building skills and his confidence in the company's leadership. \nEach member of the six-person leadership team has equity in the \ncompany, and all share the responsibility of directing its operations. \nThe team reflects a diversity which is unique in the steel industry, a \nreflection of Mr. Samrick's belief in attracting the best talent \navailable regardless of age or gender. An example of the breadth and \ndiversity of experience at Mill Steel is the fact that--when you \ninclude Mr. Samrick--the company's leadership team includes individuals \nborn in the 1940s, 50s, 60s, 70s and 80s.\n  The success of Mr. Samrick's approach to management is evident in \nMill Steel's track record, especially during the past 5 years. The \ncompany's revenue first crossed the $100 million mark in the early \n2000s. In 2010, Mill Steel expanded outside the Midwest with the \npurchase of the former Coated Steel facility in Birmingham, AL. Last \nyear, it added a facility at the Port of Indiana to its holdings. This \nhas allowed Mill Steel to become a prominent player in the flat-roll \nsteel market from Toronto to Texas. It anticipates 700,000 tons of \nflat-rolled steel will pass through the doors of Mill Steel next year, \nwith revenue expected to exceed $600 million in 2015.\n  Mill Steel's success is due in no small part to the company's hard \nwork and the loyalty displayed between it and its clients. Mr. \nSamrick's patient and trusting leadership has helped Mill Steel remain \nflexible during economic downturns. This flexibility is also \nillustrated in the company's commitment to technology and service. In \nparticular, the company's Rapid Response program allows it to regularly \nprepare and ship an order within 4 hours of being received. Mr. \nSamrick's trust in his team allows Mill Steel to address the dynamic \nneeds of its customers, encouraging loyalty and trust across the board.\n  Mr. Samrick's successful approach to leadership is not only rooted in \nhis confidence in the leadership and staff of Steel Mill; it reflects \nhis love for his family and a desire to lead a balanced lifestyle. Mr. \nSamrick is devoted to his wife, two children and five grandchildren. He \nalso embraces a culture of philanthropy, demonstrated by his role as a \nnational leader on the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, and \nhis longtime commitment to Big Brothers and Big Sisters of Western \nMichigan and its parent organization, D.A. Blodgett St. John's of \nMichigan.\n  For almost 20 years, Mill Steel has led the fundraising efforts of \nBig Brother and Big Sisters of Western Michigan. The company took \nleadership of the organization's annual golf outing in 1996. Since that \ntime, the event has raised nearly $1.7 million, helping match 11,000 \nchildren with mentors. The annual golf outing culminates in a dinner \nwhere the Harry Samrick Scholarship, named in honor of Mr. Samrick's \nfather, is awarded. It is one of the many ways Mr. Samrick and Mill \nSteel supports children, including services projects at group homes and \nvisits to children hospitals.\n  Again, I would like to congratulate Mr. David Samrick on being \nrecognized as the 2014 Service Center Executive of the Year by Metal \nCenter News. I applaud Mr. Samrick's success, as well as his dedication \nto his family and community. I am confident his leadership will \ncontinue to shape the future of Steel Mill and communities throughout \nwestern Michigan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/08/senate-section/article/S4838-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RECOGNIZING HASPEL\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, small businesses can often \ninfluence American culture and provide rich traditions that we \ncelebrate for decades to come. Born out of the unique features of their \nhometowns, these businesses have become an important part of our \nhistory. The ``Throwback Thursday'' Small Business of the Week, Haspel \nof New Orleans, LA has created an all-American brand of clothing that \nhas supported domestic enterprise and manufacturing.\n  In 1909, Joseph Haspel Sr. created his namesake seersucker brand to \nhelp Louisianians cope with the Mighty Mississippi's heat and humidity. \nHaspel recognized the need for versatile, lightweight clothing that \ncould be worn during both the summer days and evenings. He based the \npuckered cloth off of a similar design used by workers in India, where \nthe fabric was originally used to make overalls and laboring clothes. \nHaspel soon realized that a wide variety of folks could benefit from \nthe innovative design--not simply just the day laborers for which the \ndesign was initially intended. From here, the seersucker business suit \nwas born and quickly became a popular icon of the southern gentleman, \nworn at jazz concerts and cocktail parties alike. The style spread \nfarther north and eventually solidified its place as an emblem of \nsophistication, having outfitted nearly every President since Calvin \nCoolidge. Haspel is now in its fourth generation as a family-owned \nbusiness and continues to provide lightweight and stylish clothing \nacross the country.\n  Joseph Haspel centered his brand on the unique culture of New Orleans \nand southern Louisiana. In addition to providing a cloth that would \nhelp people stay cool throughout the summer, he was committed to \ncrafting clothes that were enjoyable to wear. To demonstrate his wash-\nand-wear fabric, Haspel supposedly jumped into the Atlantic Ocean in \nhis suit, hung it up to dry, and wore it to an event later that \nevening. His commitment to durable, comfortable clothing has attracted \nloyal customers for over 100 years. This wash-and-wear material is used \ntoday for everything from suits to shorts.\n  Congratulations again to Haspel for being selected as the ``Throwback \nThursday'' Small Business of the Week. Thank you for your continued \nembodiment of Louisiana culture and dedication to 100 percent made-in-\nAmerica quality clothing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/08/senate-section/article/S4838-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4838-S4839]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to\n\n[[Page S4839]]\n\nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/08/senate-section/article/S4839-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4839]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/08/senate-section/article/S4839-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4839]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n                         Enrolled Bills Signed\n\n  Under the order of the Senate of January 6, 2015, the Secretary of \nthe Senate, on June 26, 2015, during the adjournment of the Senate, \nreceived a message from the House of Representatives announcing that \nthe Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Thornberry) has signed the following \nenrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 893.

A bill to provide for the establishment and maintenance of a \nNational Family Caregiving Strategy, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwith my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Baldwin, to require the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to develop a national strategy \nto recognize and support the more than 40 million family caregivers in \nthe United States.\n  The U.S. population is aging. According to Census Bureau projections, \n21 percent of our population will be 65 and older by 2040, up from just \nunder 14 percent in 2012.\n  Every day, 10,000 baby boomers turn 65 years old, and as many as 90 \npercent of them have one or more chronic health conditions. Americans \n85 and older--our oldest old--are the fastest growing segment of our \npopulation. This is the population that is most at risk of multiple and \ninteracting health problems that can lead to disability and the need \nfor round-the-clock care.\n  At the very time that our population is aging and the need for care \nand support is increasing, declining birthrates mean that the \npopulation of professional and informal caregivers is shrinking. Today, \nthere are seven potential caregivers for each person over 80 and at the \nhighest risk of requiring long-term care. By 2030, there will be four, \nand by 2050, the number drops to fewer than three. As a consequence, in \nthe future, more people will have to rely on fewer caregivers.\n  Families will likely continue to be the most important source of \nsupport for people with long-term care needs. We must do more to \nsupport the 43 million family caregivers in the United States who, in \n2009, provided an estimated $450 billion in uncompensated long-term \ncare. This is an increase from $375 billion just 2 years earlier, and \nmore than double the value of all paid long-term care.\n  Family caregivers provide tremendous value, but they also face many \nchallenges. While the typical family caregiver is a 49-year old woman \nwho takes care of an older relative, 34 percent of family caregivers \nare aged 65 or older. Nearly one in ten is 75 or older. Many of these \ncaregivers are putting their own health at risk, since caregivers \nexperience high levels of stress and have a greater incidence of \nchronic conditions like heart disease, cancer and depression.\n  Most family caregivers are employed and struggle to balance their \nwork and caregiving responsibilities. Nearly seven in ten caregivers \nreport making sacrifices in the workplace because of their caregiving \nresponsibilities. They face financial hardships if they must reduce \ntheir hours, change jobs, or leave the workforce entirely because of \ncaregiving demands. Family caregivers age 50 and older who leave the \nworkforce to care for a parent lose, on average, nearly $304,000 in \nwages and benefits over their lifetime.\n\n  I am therefore introducing legislation with my colleague from \nWisconsin to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \ndevelop a national strategy to recognize and support family caregivers. \nTitled the Recognize, Assist, Include, Support, and Engage, or RAISE \nFamily Caregivers Act, the legislation is based on a recommendation of \nthe bipartisan Commission on Long Term Care. It is modeled after a law \nthat I co-authored in 2010 with then-Senator Evan Bayh that created a \ncoordinated strategic national plan to combat Alzheimer's disease.\n  The RAISE Family Caregivers Act directs the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to establish a National Family Caregiving Project to \ndevelop and sustain a national strategy to support family caregivers. \nThe bill would create a Family Caregiving Advisory Council composed of \nrelevant Federal agencies and non-federal members. It would include \nrepresentatives of family caregivers, older adults with long-term care \nneeds, individuals with disabilities, employers, health and social \nservice providers, advocates for family caregivers, state and local \nofficials, and others with expertise in family caregiving.\n  The Advisory Council would be charged with making recommendations to \nthe Secretary. The strategy and plan would be updated annually to \nreflect new developments. The plan would include an initial inventory \nand assessment of federally-funded caregiver efforts. It would then \nidentify specific actions that government, communities, employers, \nproviders, and others can take to support family caregivers.\n  The Project would be funded from existing funding appropriated for \nthe Department of Health and Human Services. No new funding is \nauthorized. Like the National Alzheimer's Project Act, it would sunset \nin fifteen years.\n  Family caregivers are an invaluable resource to our aging society. \nChances are that, sooner or later, we will all either be family \ncaregivers or someone who needs one. The RAISE Family Caregivers Act \nwill launch a coordinated, national strategic plan that will help us to \nleverage our resources, promote innovation and promising practices, and \nprovide our nation's family caregivers with much-needed recognition and \nsupport. Our bipartisan legislation has been endorsed by AARP. I urge \nall of our colleagues to join us as cosponsors.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                         AARP,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 8, 2015.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Tammy Baldwin,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Collins and Baldwin: AARP is very pleased to \n     endorse the Recognize, Assist, Include, Support, and Engage \n     (RAISE) Family Caregivers Act. Thank you for your efforts to \n     work on a bipartisan basis to support family caregivers. Most \n     of us are, have been, or will be a family caregiver or will \n     need help to live independently. This is an ageless and \n     nonpartisan issue.\n       Family caregivers are the backbone of services and supports \n     in this country. They help make it possible for older adults \n     and people with disabilities to live independently in their \n     homes and communities. There are about 40 million family \n     caregivers currently caring for adults. In 2009, family \n     caregivers provided an estimated $450 billion in unpaid care \n     to adults who needed help with daily activities such as \n     bathing, dressing, meal preparation, and transportation, more \n     than total Medicaid spending that year. Our country relies on \n     the contributions family caregivers make and should recognize \n     and support them. Family caregivers take on physical, \n     emotional, and financial challenges in their caregiving \n     roles.\n       The RAISE Family Caregivers Act would require the \n     development of a national strategy to support family \n     caregivers. The bill would create an advisory body to bring \n     together relevant federal agencies and others from the \n     private and public sectors to advise and make \n     recommendations. The strategy would identify specific actions \n     that government, communities, providers, employers, and \n     others can take to recognize and support family caregivers \n     and be updated annually.\n       By supporting family caregivers, we can help people stay at \n     home where they want to be, helping to delay or prevent more \n     costly nursing home care and unnecessary hospitalizations, \n     and saving taxpayer dollars. We appreciate your bipartisan \n     leadership and are committed to working with you to pass the \n     RAISE Family Caregivers Act this year.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This part may be cited as the ``American Dream Accounts \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 10302. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Only 9.8 out of every 100 individuals from low-income \n     families will graduate from an institution of higher \n     education before reaching the age of 24.\n       (2) Lack of knowledge about how to apply to, and pay for, \n     an institution of higher education is a barrier for many low-\n     income students and students who would be in the first \n     generation in their families to attend an institution of \n     higher education.\n       (3) According to Public Agenda, most young adults give \n     secondary school counselors fair or poor ratings for advice \n     about attending an institution of higher education, including \n     advice about how to decide what institution of higher \n     education to attend, how to pay for higher education, what \n     careers to pursue, and how to apply to an institution of \n     higher education.\n       (4) More than 1,700,000 students fail to file the Free \n     Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), and about one-\n     third of such students would qualify for a Federal Pell \n     Grant.\n       (5) During the last 2 decades, costs of attending \n     institutions of higher education have increased dramatically, \n     but need-based financial aid has not kept pace with such \n     increasing costs.\n       (6) In the 1990-1991 school year, the maximum Federal Pell \n     Grant covered 45 percent of the average cost of attendance at \n     a public 4-year institution of higher education (including \n     tuition, fees, room, and board), but in the 2010-2011 school \n     year, the maximum Federal Pell Grant covered only 34 percent \n     of such cost.\n       (7) Parental and youth college savings are strong \n     predictors of a youth's expectations about attendance at an \n     institution of higher education.\n       (8) Only 32 percent of parents who earn less than $35,000 a \n     year are saving for their child's education at an institution \n     of higher education.\n       (9) According to the Center for Social Development, \n     ``wilt'' occurs when a young person who expects to graduate \n     from a 4-year institution of higher education has not yet \n     attended such institution by the ages of 19 to 22.\n       (10) Children who have savings dedicated for attendance at \n     an institution of higher education are 4 times more likely to \n     attend a 4-year institution of higher education and avoid \n     ``wilt''.\n\n     SEC. 10303.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Only 9.8 out of every 100 individuals from low-income \n     families will graduate from an institution of higher \n     education before reaching the age of 24.\n       (2) Lack of knowledge about how to apply to, and pay for, \n     an institution of higher education is a barrier for many low-\n     income students and students who would be in the first \n     generation in their families to attend an institution of \n     higher education.\n       (3) According to Public Agenda, most young adults give \n     secondary school counselors fair or poor ratings for advice \n     about attending an institution of higher education, including \n     advice about how to decide what institution of higher \n     education to attend, how to pay for higher education, what \n     careers to pursue, and how to apply to an institution of \n     higher education.\n       (4) More than 1,700,000 students fail to file the Free \n     Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), and about one-\n     third of such students would qualify for a Federal Pell \n     Grant.\n       (5) During the last 2 decades, costs of attending \n     institutions of higher education have increased dramatically, \n     but need-based financial aid has not kept pace with such \n     increasing costs.\n       (6) In the 1990-1991 school year, the maximum Federal Pell \n     Grant covered 45 percent of the average cost of attendance at \n     a public 4-year institution of higher education (including \n     tuition, fees, room, and board), but in the 2010-2011 school \n     year, the maximum Federal Pell Grant covered only 34 percent \n     of such cost.\n       (7) Parental and youth college savings are strong \n     predictors of a youth's expectations about attendance at an \n     institution of higher education.\n       (8) Only 32 percent of parents who earn less than $35,000 a \n     year are saving for their child's education at an institution \n     of higher education.\n       (9) According to the Center for Social Development, \n     ``wilt'' occurs when a young person who expects to graduate \n     from a 4-year institution of higher education has not yet \n     attended such institution by the ages of 19 to 22.\n       (10) Children who have savings dedicated for attendance at \n     an institution of higher education are 4 times more likely to \n     attend a 4-year institution of higher education and avoid \n     ``wilt''.\n\n     SEC. 10303.

interest shall not be taken into account under subsection (a) \n     if--\n       ``(A) allocations of items are made by the partnership to \n     such qualified capital interest in the same manner as

referred to in such paragraph.\n       ``(3) Special rule for changes in services and capital \n     contributions.--In the case of an interest in a partnership \n     which was not an investment

allocated to the qualified capital interest \n     (consistent with the requirements of paragraph (1)) if the \n     partnership had sold all of its assets at fair market value \n     immediately

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 218, submitted \nearlier today.\n\n[[Page S4895]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 218) congratulating the United States \n     Women's National Team for winning the 2015 FIFA World Cup.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise as the coauthor, with Senator \nCollins, of this Senate resolution to honor and congratulate an \nextraordinary team on an extraordinary accomplishment. The U.S. women's \nnational soccer team and their triumphant 5-to-2 victory over Japan at \nthe 2015 FIFA World Cup final was an extraordinary accomplishment and a \ngreat victory for them, for the United States, for women's soccer, and \nwomen's sports.\n  These inspiring athletes have spent the past months captivating \naudiences around the globe with their determination, tenacity, and \nsheer grit. It started with our national team winning the so-called \ngroup of death against Australia, Sweden, and Nigeria. They went on to \nbeat powerhouse teams Colombia, China, and Germany on the way to the \nfinal.\n  All along the way, they tied a World Cup record by playing 540 \nconsecutive minutes without conceding a single goal. In the final, our \nnational team came up strong, scoring four goals in the first 16 \nminutes, including three goals from New Jersey's own Carli Lloyd. \nFellow New Jerseyan Tobin Heath would add another goal, and the team \ncruised to a resounding 5-to-2 victory. All in all, in the entire \ntournament, our women's national team never lost a game.\n  We are all proud of them. I am especially proud of fellow New \nJerseyans Christie Rampone, Heather O'Reilly, Tobin Heath, and Golden \nBall winner Carli Lloyd. But more than pride, we look to this team for \ninspiration. The women's World Cup final was the most watched soccer \ngame in American history. The final game had my stepchildren Jana, who \nis an avid player and a big women's soccer fan, and her brother Sonny, \nwho was rooting the team on--they were both riveted at what these women \nplayers were accomplishing. This game showed them what hard work and \ndetermination can do.\n  For Jana and every young girl who aspires to be the best, this \nvictory makes her dreams seem within reach. Just as the 1999 U.S. World \nCup team motivated an entire generation to pursue their dreams, I am \ncertain the performance of this team will do the same and push this \ngeneration to dream bigger, work harder, and achieve even more than \nthey have ever imagined.\n  I congratulate our champions. I look forward to the adoption of the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to recognize the 2015 United States \nWomen's National Soccer Team. Sunday night, our athletes brought home \ntheir third World Cup championship and continued the excellence that we \nhave come to know from the team. Four of the woman's national team \nplayers--Shannon Boxx, Julie Johnston, Lori Chalupny, and Christen \nPress--are also on Chicago's National Women's Soccer League team, the \nRed Stars.\n  More than 22 million Americans watched Team USA--including a crowd of \nthousands gathering in Lincoln Park in Chicago to watch the match on \nthe big screens and cheer the U.S. women to victory. This was not an \neasy road for the United States team. Their mettle was tested against \nthe best teams in the world, including No. 1 ranked Germany in the \nsemifinal.\n  These 23 athletes displayed the best qualities of champions: depth, \nconfidence, selflessness, athleticism, and unconquerable spirit. With a \ndecisive 5-2 victory over Japan, the U.S. Women's National Team showed \nthe world that this is what legacy looks like.\n  We will forever remember when this team of athletes brought the \nNation to its feet, yelling, ``I believe, I believe that we will win.'' \nAnd they did.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate all the players, coaches, and staff of \nthe 2015 U.S. women's national soccer team.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I want to thank all of my colleagues \nfor their hard work that has brought us to this point on the bipartisan \nEvery Child Achieves Act. My friend and colleague from Tennessee, \nChairman Alexander, and my great colleague, Ranking Member Murray, of \nthe HELP Committee have worked tirelessly to bring this bill to the \nfloor. I salute them for finding many points of agreement that unite us \nin a very bipartisan way in forming our approach to high-stakes \ntesting--an issue that has bedeviled this body and our Nation for many \nyears--and requiring increased data collection and reporting, expanding \naccess to early childhood education, increases in authorization of \nfunding, and finally, after 13 years, reauthorizing the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act.\n  This bill is by no means perfect. Few measures approved by the \nCongress are. We work to come as close to perfection as possible. But, \nas the saying goes, we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. \nThis bill is a good bill. I personally would like to see some of the \naccountability provisions of the bill strengthened, ensuring that \nschools have real incentives to make reform.\n  I have some very serious qualms about a proposal that would change \nthe formula for allocating title I funding in a way that would take \nfunding away from certain districts in Connecticut and other States \nthat serve low-income children.\n  I am hoping that three of the amendments I have written will make \nthis legislation stronger.\n  First, I am pleased to say that an amendment that I had led to make \nsure schools and districts understand their responsibility under title \nIX was adopted in the underlying bill. I thank Chairman Alexander and \nRanking Member Murray for their commitment on this important title IX \nprovision that makes the bill better and guarantees that title IX will \nbe enforced.\n  A lot of people think title IX affects only athletic programs. In \nfact, it actually covers all forms of gender-based\n\n[[Page S4896]]\n\ndiscrimination in schools, including sexual harassment and assault, \nbullying, the needs of pregnant and parenting students, female \nparticipation in the STEM field, and a lot more. All kinds of \ndiscrimination are covered by title IX.\n  This landmark measure in our Federal law requires every school to \ndesignate an employee to serve as a title IX coordinator, helping \nstudents and staff to understand their rights and their obligations. \nUnfortunately, a lot of schools currently fail to designate such a \ncoordinator.\n  In Connecticut, my friend Bill Howe has provided vitally important \nstatewide title IX compliance training for years, but I know he often \nfound it very difficult to secure funding for his efforts and was \nsometimes forced to dip into his own pocket to keep these programs \ngoing. Bill Howe is a hero in Connecticut for maintaining and \nsustaining a title IX training program.\n  My amendment will give States the resources they need to ensure their \nschools are protecting and promoting gender equity. No longer will Bill \nHowe be forced to make that funding out of his own pocket--Connecticut \nwill have it as well.\n  I am proud to join with Senator Ayotte in championing an amendment \nthat will provide critical training and resources to help educators \nrecognize and respond to the earliest signs of mental illness. This \nprovision is really key because school personnel frequently see young \npeople in many different situations, and therefore they are among the \nbest positioned to see young people who are at risk of serious mental \nillness and identify those risk signs and provide mental health \nservices at critical times before those illnesses become more serious.\n  We know from our tragic and horrific experience--we in Connecticut \nknow better than most--that violence and emergency situations can \nhappen anywhere, including at the youngest ages in elementary and \nsecondary schools. Resources must be made available for people to help \ndeescalate crisis situations. These funds will help diffuse those \ncrises before they occur or while they occur by providing critical \nmental health services.\n  Training programs are important for teaching school professionals how \nto safely deescalate a crisis, recognize the signs and symptoms of \nmental illness, and refer people to appropriate mental health service \nproviders at the early stages of mental illness, reducing the number of \ncrisis situations.\n  Some of the programs already in place provide models of what kind of \ntraining will be funded. They have proven immensely successful. They \nare profoundly important, and they can serve as models for other \nschools. Some of those models are in Connecticut--training and \neducation in helping to diffuse and resolve crises and provide for \ntreating mental illness.\n  Third, I am perhaps most proud to offer the Jesse Lewis Empowering \nEducators Act. I am proud to offer the Jesse Lewis Empowering Educators \nAct because I think it reflects an advance in education that truly \nembodies the spirit and legacy of Jesse Lewis himself--a brave young \nboy who had emotional intelligence way beyond his years and who was a \nvictim of the unspeakable, unimaginable, horrific tragedy that occurred \nin Newtown. I thank my colleagues, Senators Murphy and Cantwell, for \ncosponsoring it.\n  Jesse was one of the children who lost their lives in the Sandy Hook \ntragedy. In those painful, aching days after Sandy Hook, I sat in the \nliving room of Scarlet Lewis, Jesse's mom, and I saw firsthand through \nJesse's own words and photos the awe-inspiring courage and caring of \nthis boy--his empathy and resilience and the compassion he demonstrated \nrepeatedly throughout his all-too-brief life.\n  This amendment is directly shaped by the Sandy Hook Advisory \nCommission's final report, which highlights the importance of \nintegrating social and emotional learning concepts into our schools. \nThe commission noted that social-emotional learning is an integral part \nof education because students must learn coping skills, such as how to \nidentify and name feelings and emotions such as frustration, anger, \nsadness, and how to use their problem-solving skills to manage those \ndifficult emotional and potentially conflictual situations.\n  Resolving conflict means understanding the reasons for it. Social \nintelligence is the means to do it, and training teachers in how to \nteach it is one of the great missions we need to make sure our schools \nserve.\n  As much as the commission's work, this amendment really is formed by \nScarlet Lewis and Jesse. His example of emotional and social learning, \nof intelligence in that sense, provides an example of what we should \nseek to emulate in our schools--demonstrating caring and concern for \nothers, maintaining positive relationships, and making responsible \ndecisions and resolving conflicts effectively. All of these are \nteachable and learnable skills. In fact, they are essential to learn \nfor participating and contributing to society. The only question is, \nWhere are young people going to learn them? If they do not learn them \nat home, they need to be taught in our schools.\n  If students are surrounded by educators who understand these concepts \nand who have the right tools and training to teach them, these students \ncan learn to demonstrate what intelligence and emotional intelligence \nmeans in practical, everyday terms--how it can make people happier and \nmake the people around those young people happier. Demonstrating the \nkinds of emotional gifts and intelligence that Jesse had innately is \nitself a gift that can be taught, and we have an obligation to teach \nit.\n  Social and emotional learning is a strategy that is strongly grounded \nin academic research. Numerous studies and reports, including the great \nwork being done at the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence, have \nfound that students who exhibit these skills not only perform better \nacademically but are less likely to engage in problematic behavior, \nsuch as alcohol and drug use, violence, truancy, and bullying. It makes \nperfect common sense. Students who have that emotional intelligence \nbetter adjust and avoid the pitfalls of substance abuse, violence, \nbullying, and conflict with fellow students.\n  We have an obligation to adopt social--emotional learning as part of \nthe curricula of our schools and to make sure teachers are trained in \nhow to impart and inculcate those great talents and gifts that are so \nimportant to the happiness of the young people who come through their \nclassrooms, and I am hopeful this amendment will become part of this \nbill.\n  My amendments recognize that education is not only about reading, \nwriting, and arithmetic, but learning requires an environment and a \nculture that cares for each student and prepares each person as an \nindividual and as a healthy, involved member of a larger community. I \nthink that will be a legacy we can leave through this bill, and I hope \nwe will.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/08/senate-section/article/S4896-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
