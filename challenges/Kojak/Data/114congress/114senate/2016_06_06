Mr. President, today the Senate is returning from a 10-day \nrecess, but even though the Republicans took 10 days off, the Zika \nvirus did not.\n  Last week a child was born in New Jersey with severe birth defects \ncaused by the Zika virus. Thousands of our citizens are exposed to Zika \nnow, today, but the problem will only get worse. Zika is a problem that \nis here and is not going away quickly. As the weather continues to warm \nand the mosquitoes become more active, it will inevitably cause local \ntransmission. The number of infected Americans will skyrocket.\n  In light of the threat posed by Zika, one would expect Republicans to \nspend their break working on an emergency spending bill to send to the \nPresident's desk with the full amount, $1.9 billion. They did not. \nInstead, Republicans spent their recess boasting their Republican \nstandard bearer, Donald Trump. The Republican Party's capitulation to \nDonald Trump is complete. As headlined last week in the Washington \nPost, ``It's official: The GOP is now the Party of Trump.''\n  I was especially disappointed to see that our senior Senator from \nKentucky personally led this pro-Trump propaganda tour. Senator \nMcConnell spent last week as Donald Trump's head cheerleader, a \ntrumpet. The Republican leader left Washington 10 days ago without \ndoing his job on Zika so he could stump for Trump. In the last 10 days, \nit has become clear that Senator McConnell will go to any length to \nsupport Donald Trump.\n  Consider the Republican leader's refusal to denounce Donald Trump's \nracist attack on U.S. District Court Judge Curiel, a man born in \nIndiana--in the United States. Donald Trump opined a Federal judge \nshould be disqualified from presiding on his case because of his \nMexican heritage. He went even further in saying he would feel the same \nway if the judge were Muslim. How did the Republican leader respond? \nSenator McConnell repeatedly refused to say Donald Trump's attacks\n\n[[Page S3392]]\n\non Judge Curiel's ethnicity are racist. This is precisely the type of \nfailure that gave rise to Donald Trump in the first place.\n  Senator McConnell and all congressional leaders have never taken a \nstand against Trump's vile rhetoric. That is because the hate emanating \nfrom Trump's mouth reflects the Republican Party's agenda in the U.S. \nSenate for the last 7\\1/2\\ years--the agenda Senator McConnell himself \npromoted. For years Senator McConnell and other Republican leaders \nembraced the darkest elements within their party. The Republican Party \nmade anti-woman, anti-Latino, anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant, and anti-\nObama policies the norm. Trump is the logical conclusion of what \nRepublican leaders have been saying and doing for the past 7\\1/2\\ \nyears.\n  By refusing to denounce Trump's attack on a Federal judge for the \nracism it clearly connotes, it shows Senator McConnell is the poster \nboy for Republicans' spinelessness that allowed Donald Trump to be the \nRepublican nominee for President of the United States. I have made this \nargument for months. I am not the only one making it now. Now, even \nsome Republicans are joining me. The conservative blog ``RedState'' \nrailed against Senator McConnell's refusal to condemn Trump's racist \nattacks.\n  The conservative blog ``RedState'' said this: ``[Senator McConnell] \nfell back to the last coward's refuge: we have to support Trump because \nhe won the primary.''\n  The junior Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Sasse, a Republican, is willing \nto say what Senator McConnell will not. What he is saying today and he \ntweeted was: ``Public Service Announcement: Saying someone can't do a \nspecific job because of his or her race is the literal definition of \n`racism.' ''\n  Newt Gingrich, former Republican Speaker of the House, called Trump's \ncomments ``inexcusable.'' There are others. But for his part, Senator \nMcConnell is doubling down on Trump. The Republican leader is waging a \nnonstop campaign to persuade any Republicans who have doubts about \nsupporting Trump to drop their complaints and fall in line. The \nRepublican leader even went so far--listen to this--as to compare \nDonald Trump as comparable to President Dwight Eisenhower, to GEN \nDwight Eisenhower.\n  Donald Trump is a failed businessman who bilked millions of Americans \nout of their hard-earned money. No wonder he will not release his tax \nreturns. Trump doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as \nPresident Eisenhower, who led the Allied forces in World War II and, \namong other things, integrated America's schools. Comparing Eisenhower \nto Trump? Give us a break.\n  Donald Trump is the converse of all for which leaders such as \nEisenhower, Lincoln, Roosevelt, and Ronald Reagan stood. They stood for \nequality, fairness, and decency. Trump and McConnell obviously do not. \nDonald Trump stands for hatred and stands for division. Senator \nMcConnell also defended Trump's temperament, reassuring everyone that \nas President, Donald Trump ``would be fine.'' That is what he said. \nThat is a quote.\n  The Republican leader also extolled Trump's intelligence. Senator \nMcConnell even claimed the Republican Party is ``at an all-time high,'' \nwith Trump at its helm. That is how the Republican leader spent last \nweek. He wasn't fighting for resources to stop the spread of Zika. He \nwas leading the cheers as he stumped for Trump.\n  Senator McConnell was doing zero for the 100,000 poisoned residents \nof Flint, MI. Senator McConnell was doing zero to fund our Nation's \nresponse to the opioid epidemic. It is terrible. The Republican leader \nwas too busy being a trumpet for Trump, and now that he has firmly \nentrenched himself in Trump's corner, I can't help but wonder just how \nfar Senator McConnell's support extends. For example, were Donald's \nTrump's comments about Judge Curiel racist, as the Senator from \nNebraska said? Senator McConnell wouldn't answer that question \nyesterday. He had numerous opportunities to do it. So I will give him \nanother opportunity today.\n  There are other questions the Republican leader needs to answer. Does \nhe believe a Federal judge should be disqualified because of his \nMexican heritage? Does he believe these attacks are acceptable for a \nman who wants to be President of our great country? Does he agree \njudges should face a religious test?\n  Senator McConnell said last week: ``We know that Donald Trump will \nmake the right kind of Supreme Court appointments.'' After Donald \nTrump's latest attacks on the judiciary, does he truly believe Trump is \nthe right man to pick nominees to our Nation's highest Court?\n  The Republican leader defended Trump's temperament, saying he ``would \nbe fine'' as President. I ask the Senator from Kentucky, is it fine \nwhen Donald Trump calls women pigs and dogs? Is it fine when Trump \ncalls immigrants rapists and murderers? Is it fine that his party's \nPresidential candidate urges violence at rallies? These are not \nrhetorical questions.\n  The Republican leader has so fully embraced Donald Trump that we are \nall unclear as to where Trump's platform ends and the Senate \nRepublicans' begins. If Republicans think a man who believes in \nreligious and ethnic tests for Federal judges is fit to be President of \nthe United States, they must explain why this is acceptable. The Nation \nhas a right to know how far Senate Republicans' support of Donald Trump \nextends, and that starts with the Republican leader because now there \ndoesn't appear to be any daylight between Donald Trump and Senator \nMcConnell.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/06/senate-section/article/S3391-8"}, {"day": "06", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3392]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, anybody who has been watching the \nnational news--and particularly the weather--knows we have been having \nsome serious flooding back home in Texas. Tragically, we lost nine \nsoldiers from Fort Hood in a very unfortunate drowning incident as part \nof that flooding. These soldiers were in the midst of a training \nmission when their vehicle got stuck in a flooded creek. I know I speak \nfor a lot of people when I say my prayers and condolences are with the \nFort Hood family and the families of these lost soldiers.\n  I know from experience that the Fort Hood community is a resilient \none and, unfortunately, has seen more than its fair share of tragedy in \nrecent years. But I also know the community there in Killeen, along \nwith the entire State and Nation, will continue to offer support for \nour men and women in uniform, and particularly for those who have lost \nloved ones and those who are recovering in the days ahead.\n  Amidst the sad news, I have been continually thankful for the hard \nwork\n\n[[Page S3393]]\n\nand dedication of our first responders, who have devoted their lives to \nsaving others. It is at times like these, when they rise to the \noccasion, that I am particularly grateful for their service.\n  As you might expect, my staff and I are in close contact with local \nofficials across the State of Texas in the more than 30 counties where \nGovernor Abbott has declared a disaster. We will be working with the \nGovernor as they prepare to assess the damage on the ground and \ndetermine what sort of Federal resources are necessary to help people \nrebuild. Should Governor Abbott request a formal Federal declaration of \ndisaster for the affected counties, I intend to do everything I can to \nhelp get such a request granted and to make sure these Texans have what \nthey need to recover as quickly as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/06/senate-section/article/S3392-4"}, {"day": "06", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3393-S3394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n MEMORIAL DAY, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL, AND FOREIGN POLICY\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, on a happier note, during this last \nweek, we had the occasion to celebrate Memorial Day, a day of \nremembrance. I know many of us had a chance to spend time with true \nAmerican heroes--the veterans, the Active-Duty military members and \ntheir families--to remember the fallen on Memorial Day.\n  I had a particularly delightful occasion this Memorial Day to spend \ntime with about 115 high school graduates from across Texas as part of \na sendoff ceremony as they prepare to head to our Nation's military \nacademies. We have been doing this every year for 10 years. As I always \ntell people: If you are a little down, if you are in a bad mood or \nfeeling a little depressed, all you need to do is be around these \nwonderful young men and women who are really mature beyond their years \nand who aspire not only to attend our Nation's service academies but to \nbe the next generation of military leaders. They truly are the best and \nthe brightest.\n  It was also great to provide an occasion for these young people and \ntheir families to be there and hear from inspirational leaders such as \nCOL Bruce Crandall, a Medal of Honor winner from the Vietnam war.\n  So in remembering this last week the service of so many people in \ndefense of our Nation and these young people who I just mentioned on \nMemorial Day and our academy sendoff, it is appropriate that we return \nto the Senate this week to finish the national defense authorization \nbill, legislation that will provide our military men and women with the \nresources they need in order to protect and defend our country.\n  This is an absolutely critical piece of legislation and one that \nCongress has passed each year for some 50 years-plus. If anyone doubts \nthat, all they need to do is ask Chairman McCain because he will remind \nus every chance he gets that this is must-pass-every-year legislation \nand something that has become a tradition--a good tradition--for the \nSenate.\n  This bill was passed out of the Armed Services Committee with \noverwhelming bipartisan support. Not a single Democrat voted against \nthe legislation, and before Memorial Day, the Senate voted unanimously \nto move this legislation forward--98 yes and 0 no votes.\n  Despite this being a clear bipartisan priority, we have been stuck \nand mired down for no real reason, frankly, because of objections from \nthe other side of the aisle. The minority leader has chosen to use \nevery tactic and every tool available to him to slow this down. \nFrankly, this is not acceptable. The Defense authorization bill \nprovides critical resources to our military. It will give our men and \nwomen in uniform a modest pay raise and support critical training and \nequipment modernization efforts. And it ensures that future generations \nof military leaders have the support they need.\n  I don't know what happened at Fort Hood when these nine soldiers \ndrowned, but I hope it doesn't have anything to do with their lack of \nadequate training under these circumstances. What we need to do as part \nof our duty in the Senate is to get our work done and to pass the \nDefense authorization bill so there is not even a suspicion or hint of \nlack of adequate training or preparation by our military members that \nleads to tragedy.\n  At a time when we face instability at every turn and our military is \nconfronting evolving and constant threats, political posturing is not \nappropriate. In fact, it is dangerous. Unfortunately, this is a product \nof misguided foreign policy choices made by this administration over \nthe last 8 years. It has put our country and our military at greater \nrisk. Our enemies have become emboldened and our allies' confidence has \nbeen shaken.\n  Instead of recognizing the growing threats our military men and women \nface every day, the President tries to diminish them, calling ISIS the \n``JV team.'' This is a terrorist group that continues its reign of \nviolence across Iraq and Syria and continues to grow in strength across \nNorth Africa.\n  Words matter. When President Obama and former Secretary of State, \nSecretary Clinton, refused to attribute terrorism to radical Islam, it \nsent a message. And when the Obama administration and its allies ignore \nthe reality of the enemy we are facing, our men and women in uniform \nare at greater risk of not having the full resources they need in order \nto defend U.S. interests at home and abroad.\n  A few weeks ago, I had the chance to visit with U.S. soldiers in the \nMiddle East and to get a good glimpse of the reality on the ground that \nthe administration seems to be lacking. I heard firsthand about the \nthreats they face every day from ISIS-affiliated groups. That danger is \ngrowing, not receding.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that this growing ISIS presence \ncorrelates with gaps in our foreign policy under the Obama \nadministration. This is particularly clear in Libya, where the Obama \nadministration's failure in 2011 left a gaping hole of power--another \nfailed state in the Middle East, which, as we have seen before, becomes \na power vacuum that attracts foreign fighters and other people who want \nto use that to leap into Europe and commit acts of terror, either there \nor in the United States.\n  After Secretary Clinton pushed to remove Muammar Qadhafi, she \nprematurely heralded this intervention as her signature achievement as \nSecretary of State. This is something President Obama now admits was a \nmistake. She calls it her signature achievement as Secretary of State.\n  Yet the vacuum created by the United States' retreating in the region \nhas only led to more chaos, and the ISIS fighters and recruiters have \nquickly filled the space, as I said a moment ago. The Financial Times \neven called it ``a mess no one should think will be resolved by the \ncurrent UN-backed peace process.'' This chaos doesn't just give \nterrorism a foothold; it provides a strategic launch point for \nterrorist attacks, directly across the Mediterranean from Europe.\n  In 2011, when the Obama administration, lacking any coherent, long-\nterm strategy, decided to lead from behind in Libya, I strongly opposed \nthat decision. While I can't say the same for others I have served with \nin the Senate, I have been proud to vote against premature troop \nwithdrawals from volatile regions, as in Iraq, following the surge, \nwhich the chairman of the Armed Services Committee and so many others \nsaid was our one last chance in Iraq. To see us now fighting even as \ntrainers and advisers in places such as Fallujah and Ramadi and other \nplaces where we have lost young lives to liberate--to see those now \nsquandered by a premature exit from Iraq due to the administration's \nfailure to get a security Status of Forces Agreement is just \nheartbreaking.\n  We know so many did oppose the surge, including then-candidate Obama, \nbut the fact is, it paid off. Now we see all too clearly the \nconsequences of precipitous withdrawal--the squandering of hard-earned \nprogress achieved by the surge.\n  Of course, Secretary Clinton defended President Obama's decision to \nremove U.S. troops before the region could be stabilized. In fact, when \nasked about the potential threat of civil war in Iraq by exiting too \nearly, Secretary Clinton simply said, ``Well, let's find out.'' Well, \nwe found out, after all. Foreign policy isn't something we just find \nout about or make up as we go along. It requires thoughtful planning \nand purposeful, intentional action.\n  Of course, Syria is another case study of what can happen when the \nWhite House refuses to act decisively\n\n[[Page S3394]]\n\nand proactively against our adversaries. Unfortunately, when red lines \nare crossed with no consequences and when groups like ISIS aren't \ntreated as the serious threat they are, terrorism can make its way onto \nU.S. soil. Just consider the attacks in San Bernardino or the multiple \nattacks on our allies in Europe.\n  Unfortunately, as groups such as ISIS are getting stronger, our \nfriends around the world are increasingly getting concerned that the \nUnited States doesn't have their backs. The White House prioritized its \ncourtship with Iran, the No. 1 state sponsor of global terrorism, while \nchoosing to ignore our friends and allies in the region. Turning its \nback on Israel to give Iran billions of dollars in sanctions relief was \na hallmark of President Obama's tenure in the Oval Office, and \nSecretary Clinton said that she was proud to play a part in crafting \nthat terrible nuclear deal. This simply is not good foreign policy. Why \nshould we choose to reward those who have harmed us or threatened us \nwhile ignoring our oldest and strongest relationships? The result is \nwhat we would pretty much expect: an Iran that is ascendant in the \nMiddle East and growing in belligerence with a nuclear program largely \nintact.\n  Our actions do speak louder than words, and right now our friends in \nthe Middle East and around the world are losing faith in their \nrelationship with the United States. This is simply a product of failed \nforeign policy under the Obama-Clinton leadership. I think it is \ntelling that when former President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat, was asked \nabout President Obama's policies on the world stage, he said, ``I can't \nthink of many nations in the world where we have a better relationship \nnow than we did when he took over.'' This is President Carter on \nPresident Obama's foreign relations. He went on to go through a list of \ncountries as examples of where, in his words, ``the United States' \ninfluence and prestige and respect in the world is probably lower now \nthan it was six or seven years ago.'' On that point, I agree with \nPresident Carter. The foreign policy of this administration is nothing \nto be proud of.\n  Our job now in the Senate is to reassure our allies that the military \nmight of the United States has not fallen by the wayside. One way we \ncan do that is by ensuring our military has the resources and funding \nnecessary to remain a strong emblem of American strength for the rest \nof the watching world. After delays and obstruction from our friends on \nthe other side of the aisle, I hope we can finally complete our work \nthis week on the Defense authorization bill under the able leadership \nof Chairman McCain.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Texas for his \nvery compelling statement.\n  Just one example of what the Senator from Texas has referred to is \nthe whole issue of Qadhafi. I would remind my colleague from Texas that \nwe got rid of Qadhafi without losing a single American and then walked \naway. We walked away from it, and now we see ISIS establishing a strong \nbeachhead--a direct failure of leadership of the Obama administration \nand the then-Secretary of State.\n  There were many of us, including the Senator from Texas, who said: \nLook, we have to do a lot of things now that you have gotten rid of \nQadhafi. This country has never known democracy; it has no \ninstitutions. For example, we could have taken care of their wounded. \nWe could have helped them secure their borders. Instead, what did we \ndo? We killed Qadhafi--or his own people killed him. But we set up a \nscenario that happened and just walked away--just as we walked away \nfrom Iraq, just as we are sort of walking away from Afghanistan while \nthe Taliban is starting to show success throughout the country. This \nadministration is very good at walking away. Unfortunately, the \nconsequences are attacks on the United States of America and Europe.\n  So I thank the Senator from Texas for his very important statement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/06/senate-section/article/S3393-1"}, {"day": "06", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3394-S3397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, it is my pleasure to rise with my friend \nand colleague from Rhode Island to speak about the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 2017.\n  For 54 consecutive years, Congress has passed this vital piece of \nlegislation, which provides our military servicemembers with the \nresources, equipment, and training they need to defend the Nation. The \nNDAA is one of the few bills in Congress that continues to enjoy \nbipartisan support year after year. That is a testament to this \nlegislation's critical importance to our national security and the high \nregard with which it is held by the Congress.\n  Last month, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted 23 to 3--23 to \n3--to approve the NDAA, an overwhelming vote that reflects the \ncommittee's proud tradition of bipartisan support for the brave men and \nwomen of our Armed Forces.\n  I thank the committee's ranking member, the Senator from Rhode \nIsland, for his months of hard work on the NDAA. It has been a great \npleasure to work with him on this legislation, and I remain \nappreciative of the thoughtfulness and bipartisan spirit with which he \napproaches our national security. He is a great partner and a great \nleader.\n  I also thank the majority leader, the Senator from Kentucky, for his \ncommitment to bring the NDAA to the Senate floor on time and without \ndelay. It is a testimony to his leadership that the Senate will once \nagain consider this bill in regular order with an open amendment \nprocess.\n  I am tremendously proud of the Senate Armed Services Committee's work \non this legislation. This year's NDAA is the most significant piece of \ndefense reform legislation in 30 years. It includes major reforms to \nthe Department of Defense that can help our military rise to the \nchallenge of a more dangerous world.\n  The NDAA contains updates to the Pentagon's organization to \nprioritize innovation and improve the development and execution of \ndefense strategy. The legislation continues sweeping reforms of the \ndefense acquisition system to harness American innovation and preserve \nour military's technological edge.\n  The NDAA modernizes the military health system to provide military \nservicemembers, retirees, and their families with higher quality care, \nbetter access to care, and a better experience of care.\n  The NDAA authorizes a pay raise for our troops. It invests in the \nmodern equipment and advanced training they need to meet current and \nfuture threats. It helps to restore military readiness with $2 billion \nfor additional training, depot maintenance, and weapons sustainment. \nAnd it gives our allies and partners the support they need to deter \naggression and fight terrorism.\n  This is a far-reaching piece of legislation, but there is one \nchallenge it could not address: the dangerous mismatch between growing \nworldwide threats and arbitrary limits on defense spending that are in \ncurrent law. This mismatch has very real consequences for the thousands \nof Americans who serve in uniform and sacrifice on our behalf all \naround the Nation and the world. Our troops are doing everything we ask \nof them, but we must ask ourselves: Are we doing everything we can for \nthem? The answer, I say with profound sadness, is we are not.\n  Since 2011 the Budget Control Act has imposed arbitrary caps on \ndefense spending. Over the last 5 years, as our military has struggled \nunder the threat of sequestration, the world has only grown more \ncomplex and far more dangerous. Since 2011 we have seen Russian forces \ninvade Ukraine, the emergence of the so-called Islamic State and its \nglobal campaign of terrorism, increased attempts by Iran to destabilize \nU.S. allies and partners in the Middle East, growing assertive behavior \nby China and the militarization of the South China Sea, numerous cyber \nattacks on U.S. industry and government agencies, and further testing \nby North Korea of nuclear technology and other advanced military \ncapabilities. Indeed, the Director of National Intelligence, James \nClapper, testified in February that over the course of his \ndistinguished five-decade career, he could not recall ``a more diverse \narray of challenges and crises'' than our Nation confronts today.\n  Our military is being forced to confront these growing threats with \nshrinking resources. This year's defense budget is more than $150 \nbillion\n\n[[Page S3395]]\n\nless than fiscal year 2011. Despite periodic relief from the budget \ncaps that imposed these cuts, including the Bipartisan Budget Act of \nlast year, each of our military services remains underfunded, \nundersized, and unready to meet current and future threats. In short, \nas threats grow and the operational demands on our military increase, \ndefense spending in constant dollars is decreasing. How does that make \nany sense?\n  The President's defense budget request strictly adheres to the \nbipartisan budget agreement, which is $17 billion less than what the \nDepartment of Defense planned for last year. As a result, the military \nservices' underfunded requirements total nearly $23 billion for the \ncoming fiscal year alone. Meanwhile, sequestration threatens to return \nin 2018, taking away another $100 billion from our military through \n2021. This is unacceptable.\n  While the NDAA conforms to last year's budget agreement at present, I \nhave filed an amendment to increase defense spending above the current \nspending caps. This amendment will reverse shortsighted cuts to \nmodernization, restore military readiness, and give our servicemembers \nthe support they need and deserve. I do not know whether this amendment \nwill succeed, but the Senate must have this debate and Senators are \ngoing to have to choose a side.\n  At the same time, as I have long believed, providing for the common \ndefense is not just about a bigger defense budget--as necessary as that \nis. We must also reform our Nation's defense enterprise to meet new \nthreats, both today and tomorrow, and to give Americans greater \nconfidence, which they don't have a lot of now, that the Department of \nDefense is spending their tax dollars efficiently and effectively. That \nis exactly what this legislation does.\n  The last major reorganization of the Department of Defense was the \nGoldwater-Nichols Act, which marks its 30th anniversary this year. Last \nfall the Senate Armed Services Committee held a series of 13 hearings \non defense reform. We heard from 52 of our Nation's foremost defense \nexperts and leaders. The Goldwater-Nichols Act of 30 years ago \nresponded to the challenges of its time. Our goal was to determine what \nchanges needed to be made to prepare the Department of Defense to meet \nthe new set of strategic challenges. As Jim Locher, the lead staffer on \nGoldwater-Nichols, testified last year: ``No organizational blueprint \nlasts forever. . . . [T]he world in which DOD must operate has changed \ndramatically over the last 30 years.''\n  Instead of one great power rival, the United States now faces a \nseries of transregional, cross-functional, multidomain, and long-term \nstrategic competitions that pose a significant challenge to the \norganization of the Pentagon and the military, which is often rigidly \naligned around functional issues and regional geography. Put simply, \nthe Goldwater-Nichols Act of 30 years ago was about operational \neffectiveness--improving the ability of the military services to plan \nand operate together as one joint force. The problem today is strategic \nintegration--how the Department of Defense integrates its activities \nand resources across different regions, functions, and domains, while \nbalancing and sustaining those efforts over time.\n  The NDAA would require the next Secretary of Defense to create a \nseries of ``cross-functional mission teams'' to better integrate the \nDepartment's efforts and achieve discrete objectives. For example, one \ncould imagine a Russia mission team with representatives from policy, \nintelligence, acquisition, budget, the services, and more. There is no \nmechanism to perform this kind of integration at present. The Secretary \nand the Deputy have to do it ad hoc, which is an unrealistic burden. \nThe idea of cross-functional teams has been shown to be tremendously \neffective in the private sector and by innovative military leaders, \nsuch as GEN Stan McChrystal. If applied effectively in the Office of \nthe Secretary of Defense, I believe this concept could be every bit as \nimpactful as the Goldwater-Nichols reforms.\n  The NDAA would also require the next Secretary to reorganize one \ncombatant command around joint task forces focused on discrete \noperational missions rather than military services. Here, too, the goal \nis to improve integration across different military functions and do so \nwith far fewer staff than these commands now have. Similarly, the \nlegislation seeks to clarify the role of the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs, focusing this leader on more strategic issues, while providing \nthe Chairman greater authority to assist the Secretary with the global \nintegration of military operations.\n  The NDAA also seeks to curb the growth in civilian staff and military \nofficers that has occurred in recent years. Over the past 30 years, the \nend strength--the total number of members of the services--of the joint \nforce has decreased by 38 percent. The number of men and women serving \nin the military has decreased by 38 percent, but the ratio of four-star \nofficers--admirals and generals--to the overall force has increased by \n65 percent. We have seen similar increases among civilians at the \nsenior executive service level. The NDAA, therefore, requires a \ncarefully tailored 25-percent reduction in the number of general and \nflag officers, a corresponding 25-percent decrease to the ranks of \nsenior civilians, and a 25-percent cut to the amount of money that can \nbe spent on contractors who are doing staff work.\n  The NDAA also caps the size of the National Security Council policy \nstaff at 150. The National Security Council staff will be capped at \n150. The staff has steadily grown over administrations of both parties \nin recent decades. Under George Herbert Walker Bush, there were 40; \nmore than 100 in the Clinton administration; more than 200 during the \nGeorge W. Bush administration; and now there are reports of nearly 400 \nunder the current administration, plus as many as 200 contractors. This \ntremendous growth has enabled a troubling expansion of the NSC staff's \nactivities from their original strategic focus to micromanagement of \noperational issues in ways that are inconsistent with the intent of \nCongress when it created the NSC in 1947. It has gotten so bad that all \nthree leaders who served as Secretary of Defense under the current \nadministration recently blasted the NSC's micromanagement of \noperational issues during their tenures. Former Secretary of Defense \nLeon Panetta has come out publicly in favor of shrinking the staff, \nsaying he thinks we can do the job better with fewer people.\n  In short, the NSC staff is becoming increasingly involved in \noperational issues that should be the purview of Senate-confirmed \nindividuals in the chain of command, and doing so beyond the reach of \ncongressional oversight. If this organization were to return to the \nintent of the legislation that established it, it could reasonably \nclaim that its strategic functions on behalf of the President are \nprotected by Executive privilege. If, on the other hand, the NSC staff \nis to play the kind of operational role it has in recent years--and I \ncould give my colleagues example after example--if it is going to play \nthe kind of operational role it has in recent years, then such a body \ncannot escape congressional oversight.\n  The purpose of the provision in the NDAA to cap the size of the NSC \nstaff is to state a preference for the Congress's original intent in \ncreating the NSC.\n  As I have said, integration is a major theme in the NDAA. Another one \nis innovation. For years after the Cold War, the United States enjoyed \na near monopoly on advanced military technologies. That is changing \nrapidly. Our adversaries are catching up, and the United States is at \nreal and increasing risk of losing the military technological dominance \nwe have taken for granted for 30 years. At the same time, our leaders \nare struggling to innovate against an acquisition system that too often \nimpedes their efforts. I have applauded Secretary Carter's attempts to \ninnovate and reach out to nontraditional high-tech firms, but it is \ntelling that this has required the Secretary's personal intervention to \ncreate new offices, organizations, outposts, and initiatives--all to \nmove faster and get around the current acquisition system.\n  Innovation cannot be an auxiliary office at the Department of \nDefense; it must be the central mission of its acquisition system. \nUnfortunately, that is not the case with the Office of the Under \nSecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, also \nknown as AT It has grown too big,\n\n[[Page S3396]]\n\ntries to do too much, and is too focused on compliance at the expense \nof innovation. That is why the NDAA seeks to divide AT's duties \nbetween two offices--a new Under Secretary of Defense for Research and \nEngineering and an empowered and renamed Under Secretary of Management \nand Support, which was congressionally mandated 2 years ago.\n  The job of research and engineering would be developing defense \ntechnologies that can ensure a new era of U.S. qualitative military \ndominance. This office would set defense-wide acquisition and \nindustrial-based policy. It would pull together the centers of \ninnovation in the defense acquisition system. It would oversee the \ndevelopment and manufacturing of weapons by the services. In short, \nresearch and engineering would be a staff job focused on innovation, \npolicy, and oversight of the military services and certain defense \nagencies, such as DARPA.\n  By contrast, management and support would be a line management \nposition. It would manage the multibillion-dollar businesses--such as \nthe Defense Logistics Agency and the Defense Commissary Agency--that \nbuy goods and services for the Department of Defense. It would also \nmanage other defense agencies that perform other critical business \nfunctions for the Department, such as performing audits, paying our \ntroops, and managing contracts. This would not only enable research and \nengineering to focus on technology development, it would also provide \nfor a better management of billions of dollars of spending on mission \nsupport activities.\n  These organizational changes complement the additional acquisition \nreforms in the NDAA that build on our efforts of last year. This \nlegislation creates new pathways for the Department of Defense to do \nbusiness with nontraditional defense firms. It streamlines regulations \nto procure commercial goods and services. It provides new authorities \nfor the rapid prototyping, acquisition, and fielding of new \ncapabilities. It imposes new limits on the use of so-called ``cost-\nplus'' contracts. The overuse of these kinds of contracts and the \ncomplicated and expensive government bureaucracy that goes with them \nserves as a barrier to entry for commercial, nontraditional, and small \nbusinesses that are driving the innovation our military needs.\n  Another major reform in this year's NDAA is the most sweeping \noverhaul of the military health system in a generation. This strong \nbipartisan effort is the result of several years of careful study. The \nNDAA creates greater health value for military families and retirees \nand their families by improving the quality of health care they \nreceive, providing timely access to care, and enhancing patient \nsatisfaction--all done at lower costs to the patients by encouraging \nthem to seek high-value health services from high-value health care \nproviders.\n  The NDAA incorporates many of the best practices and recent \ninnovations of high-performing private sector health care providers. \nFor example, the NDAA creates specialized care centers of excellence at \nmajor medical centers based on the specialized care delivery model in \nhigh-performing health systems like the Cleveland Clinic. The \nlegislation also expands the use of telehealth services and \nincentivizes participation in disease management programs. Finally, the \nNDAA expands and improves access to care by requiring a standardized \nappointment system in military treatment facilities and creating more \noptions for patients to get health care in the private sector.\n  Taken together, these reforms, along with many others in the bill, \nwill improve access to and quality of care for servicemembers and their \nfamilies and retirees and their families, and they will improve the \nmilitary and combat medical readiness of our force and reduce rising \nhealth care costs for the Department of Defense. This entails some \ndifficult decisions. The NDAA makes significant changes to the \nservices' medical command structures and right-sizes the costly \nmilitary health system infrastructure, and, yes, the NDAA asks some \nbeneficiaries to pay a little more for a better health system.\n  Let me make three brief points.\n  First, Active-Duty servicemembers will not pay for any health care \nservices or prescription drugs they receive, and the NDAA does not \nincrease the cost of health care by a single cent for families of \nactive-duty servicemembers enrolled in TRICARE Prime. There will \ncontinue to be no enrollment fees for their health care coverage. All \nbeneficiaries, including retirees and their families, will continue to \nreceive health care services and prescription drugs free of charge in \nmilitary hospitals and clinics.\n  Second, the NDAA does ask working-aged retirees, many of whom are \npursuing a second career, to pay a little more. Increases in annual \nenrollment fees for TRICARE Choice are phased in over time, and there \nare modest increases in pharmacy copays at retail pharmacies and for \nbrand-name drugs through the mail-order pharmacy. It is important to \nremember that 68 percent of retirees live within the service area of a \nmilitary hospital or clinic where they will continue to enjoy no co-\npays for prescription drugs, and all military retirees have access to \nthe mail-order pharmacy, where they can access a 90-day supply of \ngeneric prescriptions free of charge through fiscal year 2019.\n  Third, while some military retirees will pay a little more, the \nguiding principle of this reform effort is that we would not ask \nbeneficiaries to pay more unless they receive greater value in return--\nbetter access, better care, and better health outcomes. The NDAA \ndelivers on that promise. Modernizing the military health system is \npart of the NDAA's focus on sustaining the quality of life of our \nmilitary servicemembers, retirees, and their families.\n  The NDAA authorizes a 1.6-percent pay raise for our troops and \nreauthorizes over 30 types of bonuses and special pays. The legislation \nrestructures and enhances leave for military parents to care for a new \nchild, and it provides stability for the families of our fallen by \npermanently extending the special survivor indemnity allowance. No \nwidow should have to worry year to year that she or he may not receive \nthe offset of the so-called widows' tax. If this NDAA becomes law, he \nor she will never have to worry about that.\n  The NDAA also implements the recommendations of the Department of \nDefense Military Justice Review Group by incorporating the Military \nJustice Act of 2016. The legislation modernizes the military court-\nmartial trial and appellate practice, incorporates best practices from \nFederal criminal practice and procedures, and increases transparency \nand independent review in the military justice system. Taken together, \nthe provisions contained in the NDAA constitute the most significant \nreforms to the Uniform Code of Military Justice in a generation.\n  Among the many military personnel policy provisions in the NDAA, \nthere is one that has already attracted some controversy. That, of \ncourse, is the provision in the NDAA that requires women to register \nfor Selective Service to the same extent as men beginning in 2018. \nEarlier this year, the Department of Defense lifted the ban on women \nserving in ground combat units. After months of rigorous oversight, a \nlarge bipartisan majority in the Armed Services Committee agreed that \nthere is simply no further justification to limit Selective Service \nregistration to men. That is not just my view but the view of every \nsingle one of our military service chiefs, including the Army Chief of \nStaff and the Commandant of the Marine Corps.\n  There will likely be further debate on this issue. As it unfolds, we \nmust never forget that women have served honorably in our military for \nyears. They filled critical roles in every branch of our military. Some \nhave served as pilots, like Martha McSally, who flew combat missions in \nAfghanistan. Some served as logisticians, like the Presiding Officer, \nSenator Joni Ernst, who ran convoys into Iraq. Others have served as \nmedics, intelligence officers, nuclear engineers, boot camp \ninstructors, and more. Many of these women have served in harm's way, \nand many women have made the ultimate sacrifice, including 160 killed \nin Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  As we uphold our commitment to the well-being of our servicemembers \nand their families, we must also uphold our commitment to American \ntaxpayers. As part of the committee's comprehensive effort to root out \nand eliminate wasteful spending and improve the Department of Defense \nacquisition system, the NDAA imposes strict oversight measures on \nprograms such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the B-21\n\n[[Page S3397]]\n\nLong Range Strike Bomber, the Ford-class aircraft carrier, and the \nlittoral combat ship. These provisions will ensure accountability for \nresults, promote transparency, protect taxpayers, and drive the \nDepartment to deliver our warfighters the capabilities they need on \ntime, as promised, and at reasonable costs.\n\n  The NDAA also upholds America's commitment to its allies and \npartners. It authorizes $3.4 billion to support our Afghan partners as \nthey fight to preserve the gains of the last 15 years and defeat the \nterrorists who seek to destabilize the region and attack American \ninterests. The legislation provides $1.3 billion for counter-ISIL \noperations. The NDAA fully supports the European Reassurance Initiative \nto increase the capability and readiness of U.S. and NATO forces to \ndeter and, if necessary, respond to Russian aggression. It also \nauthorizes up to $500 million in security assistance to Ukraine, \nincluding lethal assistance. We should give the Ukrainian people the \nability to defend themselves. Finally, the legislation includes $239 \nmillion for U.S.-Israel cooperative missile defense programs.\n  As we continue to support allies and partners against common threats, \nthe NDAA makes major reforms to the Pentagon's complex and unwieldy \nsecurity cooperation enterprise, which has complicated the Department \nof Defense's ability to effectively prioritize, plan, execute, and \noversee these activities.\n  This legislation also makes sure we are not providing support to \nadversaries like Russia. The United States' assured access to space \ncontinues to rely on Russian rocket engines. Purchasing these engines \nprovides a financial benefit to Vladimir Putin's cronies, including \nindividuals who have been sanctioned by the United States, and it \nsubsidizes the Russian military industrial base. This is unacceptable \nat a time when Russia continues to occupy Crimea, destabilize Ukraine, \nmenace our NATO allies, violate the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear \nForces Treaty, and bomb moderate rebels in Syria. That is why the NDAA \nrepeals a provision from last year's Omnibus appropriations bill that \nfurthered dependence on Russia.\n  Once the nine Russian rocket engines allowed by the past two NDAAs \nare expended, the Defense Department would be required to achieve \nassured access to space without the use of rocket engines designed or \nmanufactured in Russia. In testimony before the committee, the \nSecretary of Defense, the Director of National Intelligence, and the \nSecretary of the Air Force each confirmed that the United States can \nmeet its assured access to space requirements without the use of \nRussian rocket engines.\n  We do not have to rely on Russia for access to space. Given the \nurgency of eliminating reliance on Russian engines, the NDAA will allow \nfor up to half of the funds for the development of a replacement launch \nvehicle or propulsion system to be made available for offsetting any \npotential increase in launch costs as a result of prohibitions on \nRussian rocket engines. With $1.2 billion budgeted over the next 5 \nyears, we can cover the costs of ending our reliance on Russia while \ndeveloping the next generation of American space launch capabilities.\n  Finally, the legislation takes several steps to bolster border \nsecurity and homeland defense. It authorizes $688 million for \nDepartment of Defense counterdrug programs. It enhances information \nsharing and operational coordination between the Department of Defense \nand the Department of Homeland Security. It provides additional support \nfor the U.S. Southern Command, and it continues support for the U.S.-\nIsrael anti-tunneling cooperation program, which helps to improve our \nefforts to restrict the flow of drugs across the U.S. southern border.\n  I say to my colleagues: This is an ambitious piece of legislation, \nand it is one that reflects the growing threats to our Nation. \nEverything about the NDAA is threat driven--everything, that is, but \nits top line of $602 billion. That is an arbitrary figure set by last \nyear's budget agreement, having nothing to do with events in the world, \nand which itself was a product of 5 years of letting politics, not \nstrategy, determine the level of funding for our national defense. \nFormer Chairman of the Joint Chiefs GEN Martin Dempsey described last \nyear's defense budget as ``the lower ragged edge of manageable risks.'' \nYet here we are 1 year later with defense spending arbitrarily capped \nat $17 billion below what our military needed and planned for last \nyear. I don't know what lies beneath the lower ragged edge of \nmanageable, but this is what I fear it means--that our military is \nbecoming less and less able to deter conflict and that if, God forbid, \ndeterrence does fail somewhere and we end up in conflict, our Nation \nwill deploy young Americans into battle without sufficient training or \nequipment to fight a war that will take longer, be larger, cost more, \nand ultimately claim more American lives than it otherwise would have.\n  That is the growing risk we face, and for the sake of the men and \nwomen serving in our military, we cannot change course soon enough. The \nSenate will have the opportunity to do just that when we consider my \namendment to reverse the budget-driven cuts to the capabilities of our \nArmed Forces that are needed to defend the Nation. I hope we will seize \nthis opportunity.\n  We ask a lot of our men and women in uniform, and they never let us \ndown. We must not let them down. As we move forward with consideration \nof the NDAA, I stand ready to work with my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to pass this important legislation and give our military the \nresources they need and deserve.\n  Again, I note the presence of my esteemed colleague and friend, the \nranking member of the Armed Services Committee, without whom this \nlegislation would not have been possible. It happens to be a source of \ngreat pride to me--and I hope to Americans who believe that we are \nbitterly divided--that as an example of defending this Nation and \nproviding for men and women whom we send into harm's way, the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island and I have developed a partnership that I believe has \nbeen incredibly productive. Without the kind of partnership that I have \nenjoyed with my friend from Rhode Island, it would not have been \npossible to produce this legislation, which is obviously the most \nimportant obligation we have, and that is to defend the Nation.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/06/senate-section/article/S3394-1"}, {"day": "06", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise to discuss the fiscal year 2017 \nnational defense authorization bill, which was passed out of the Armed \nServices Committee on May 19 by a vote of 23 to 3.\n  I want to begin by thanking Chairman McCain, not only for his kind \nand thoughtful words but for ably leading the committee through many \nthought-provoking hearings and a successful markup with bipartisan \nsupport of the bill. I believe the committee has worked diligently in \nthe past month, not only to evaluate the President's budget request for \nfiscal year 2017 but also to take a hard look at the Department of \nDefense and to consider what reforms are necessary. Most, if not all, \nof that effort is a direct result of the leadership of Chairman McCain \nand his commitment to ensuring that we were thoroughly immersed in the \ndetails, that we had access to expert testimony, and that we heard both \nsides of the argument and led to the markup, which was productive and \nhas resulted in the legislation that is before us today.\n  I think we both agree that we can make improvements, and we both will \nstrive to do that over the course of the next several weeks and in our \ndeliberation with the House, but we are beginning with very thoughtful \nand very constructive legislation that we brought to the floor. I thank \nthe chairman for that.\n  There are many provisions in this bill that will help the Department \ntoday and in the future. It is a lengthy bill that contains sweeping \nreforms, as the chairman described in some detail, and I support many \naspects of this bill. In fact, I was privileged to work with the \nchairman and our staffs in developing some of these aspects. Because of \nthe scope and because of the range of these improvements and reforms, I \nbelieve--and I think this is shared by others--that we need a continued \ndialogue with the Department of Defense and other experts to ensure \nthat we not only take the first steps but that the subsequent \nconsequences, both intended and unintended, are well known and \ncontribute to our overall national security. We truly must ensure that \nour decisions which are ultimately incorporated in this legislation \nimprove the Department's operations and do not create unnecessary and \ndetrimental consequences.\n  Let me highlight some of the aspects of the bill that will help our \nmilitary in ongoing overseas operations.\n  We are engaged in a difficult struggle with ISIL and radical \nextremists, and critical to our efforts to fight against ISIL are our \nlocal partners. That is why this bill includes $1.3 billion to support \nthe Iraq and Syria train-and-equip programs and $180 million to support \nthe efforts of Jordan and Lebanon to secure their borders.\n  The bill also includes $3.4 billion for the Afghanistan Security \nForces Fund to preserve the gains of the last 15 years. These are \ncritical investments that enhance our interests and keep pressure on \nour enemy.\n  The bill provides the funds necessary to enable our operations across \nIraq, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, and other locations where ISIL, Al Qaeda, \nand its remnants are located. This funding will continue to enable the \nDepartment to hunt the leaders of these organizations and illuminate \ntheir network of supporters. Ensuring that there is continuous pressure \non violent extremists is critical, and it is with that focus that the \nchairman and I worked to include these important elements in the \nlegislation.\n  The bill funds U.S. Special Operations Command, or SOCOM, at the \nrequested level of $10.76 billion, including an increase of $26.7 \nmillion to help address technology gaps identified by SOCOM on its \nfleet of MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aerial vehicles, which are important to \nour ability to effectively carry out counterterrorism strikes while \navoiding collateral damage. The bill also extends critical authorities \nused by special operations forces and enhances the role of the \nAssistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity \nConflict in providing oversight and advocacy for SOCOM within the \nDepartment.\n  The fight against terrorism is not our fight alone, and it requires \nthe support of old and new partners across the globe. This bill will \nenable the Department of Defense to support and enable our foreign \npartners and also, critically, will continue to provide support to our \nintelligence community to protect the homeland.\n  Of major significance, this year's bill would undertake the most \ncomprehensive reform of the Defense Department's security cooperation \nenterprise in decades. Since 9/11, Congress, partly at the request of \nthe Department and partly through our own doing, has created dozens of \nnew authorities to enable our Armed Forces to engage with the national \nsecurity forces of friendly foreign countries. This patchwork has been \ndifficult to navigate and oversee. To address this problem, this bill \nwould consolidate and streamline security cooperation authorities. This \nwill greatly enhance the Defense Department's ability to address the \nwide-ranging and evolving nature of global threats.\n  Additionally, the NDAA consolidates roughly $2 billion in security \ncooperation funding into a new fund, the Security Cooperation \nEnhancement Fund. This new fund will enhance public transparency, \nincrease flexibility, and improve congressional oversight.\n  While the Department of Defense is responsible for only two of the \nadministration's nine lines of effort against ISIL--and this bill funds \nthose two lines of effort--DOD also plays an essential enabling role \nfor many other parts of our government, particularly in the areas of \nintelligence collection and analysis. This bill ensures the Department \nis able to continue this critical support so we can maintain an \nintegrated effort against our enemy. The Department of Defense is not \nthe only Federal agency that is responsible for our Nation's security. \nAll agencies have a role and should receive the resources they need.\n  The bill before us also includes $3.4 billion for the European \nReassurance Initiative, which will deliver critical investments to \nincrease U.S. military presence in Europe, improve existing \ninfrastructure, and enhance allied and partner military capabilities to \nrespond to external aggression and bolster regional stability. It also \nauthorizes up to $500 million for the Ukraine Security Assistance \nInitiative to continue the ongoing efforts to support the Ukrainian \nsecurity forces in the defense of their country.\n\n  One major concern the committee heard repeatedly, and the chairman\n\n[[Page S3399]]\n\nmade reference to on numerous occasions, is about the state of \nreadiness with our troops and their equipment. I am very pleased that \nthis bill contains almost $2 billion in additional readiness funding to \nsatisfy some of the Service Chiefs' unfunded requirements, with the \ngoal of restoring military readiness as soon as possible. Additionally, \nall of these increases are paid for with corresponding and targeted \nfunding reductions.\n  One other aspect of our national security is our nuclear deterrent. \nIn many cases, it forms the bedrock of our defense posture. This is an \nessential mission which must not be neglected and our committee \ncontinues to support it on a bipartisan basis.\n  The bill continues to fund the President's request to modernize our \ntriad of nuclear-capable air, sea, and ground delivery platforms. This \nis the first year of full engineering, manufacturing, and development \nfunding for the B-21, which will replace the B-52s that were built in \nthe 1960s. While the B-21 will be costly, I believe this bill places \nrigorous oversight on the program to ensure that we understand the \ntechnology risk as it moves forward.\n  Turning to the area of undersea deterrence, if we are to maintain a \nsea-based deterrent, the current fleet of 14 Ohio-class submarines must \nbe replaced starting in 2027 due to the potential for hull fatigue. By \nthen, the first Ohio submarine will be 46 years old--the oldest \nsubmarine to have sailed in our Navy in its history.\n  The third aspect of our triad, our land-based ICBMs, will not need to \nbe replaced until the 2030s. We have authorized the initial development \nof a replacement for this responsive leg of the triad, which acts as a \ncounterbalance to Russian ICBMs.\n  Let me focus for a moment on the submarine program, which is frankly \nan important part of our national security and an important industry \nfor my home State where this construction begins. This bill supports \nthe Virginia-class attack submarine production at a level of two per \nyear. The Navy's requirement for attack submarines is a force of 48 \nboats. Since attack submarine force levels will fall below 48, even \nwith the purchase of two Virginia-class submarines per year, we cannot \nallow the production rates to drop at all.\n  The bill also supports the Virginia Payload Module upgrade to the \nVirginia-class submarines, with production starting in fiscal year \n2019. The Virginia Payload Module program is important to begin \nreplacing Tomahawk missile magazine capacity that will decline sharply \nas we retire the Navy's four guided missile submarines in the next \ndecade.\n  Our support of the Virginia-class attack submarine program has led to \nstability that helped drive down costs and improve productivity. This \nbill continues that support and also supports the plans for achieving \nsimilar effectiveness on the Ohio replacement program. Establishing and \nachieving cost reduction goals in these Virginia-class and Ohio \nreplacement programs will yield significant stability to our Nation's \nsubmarine base, which will ensure the Navy has a modern, capable \nsubmarine fleet for many years to come.\n  The chairman also indicated in his remarks that the bill accomplishes \nmuch on behalf of our servicemembers and the Department of Defense. It \nauthorizes a 1.6 percent pay raise for all servicemembers and \nreauthorizes a number of expiring bonus and special pay authorities to \nencourage enlistment, re-enlistment, and continued service by active \nduty and reserve component military personnel. The bill permanently \nextends the Special Survivor Indemnity Allowance scheduled to expire \nnext year, clarifies the applicability of certain employment rights for \nmilitary technicians, establishes an independent National Commission on \nMilitary, National, and Public Service to review the Selective Service \nprocess, and makes numerous enhancements to military whistleblower \nprotections.\n  Notably, this bill also contains a robust package of health care \nreforms. The current military health care system, designed decades ago, \nhas served us well. Since 2001, battlefield survival rates have been \nhigher than at any time in our Nation's history. Clearly, battlefield \nmedicine is a pocket of excellence in the military health system that \nmust be maintained. However, it is also clear that the military health \ncare system has increasingly emphasized delivering peacetime \nhealthcare, and beneficiaries have voiced their concerns about access \nto care.\n  While I know that many in the military community are wary of changes \nto the healthcare system, I believe the reforms included in this bill \nare designed to improve and maintain operational medical force \nreadiness while at the same time affording better value to TRICARE \nbeneficiaries by providing higher quality medical care, with better \naccess to that care, and a better experience of care.\n  I am also pleased to note that the mark includes the 105 \nrecommendations of the Military Justice Review Group. The review group \nwas made up of judges and lawyers, all military justice experts, who \nspent 18 months reviewing and providing recommended changes to update \nthe entire Uniform Code of Military Justice. These provisions provide a \nmuch-needed updating of the military justice system, and I want to \ncommend the members of the review group for their work and also the \ncounsels on the committee, Gary Leeling and Steve Barney, for all their \nefforts in this area.\n  Again, a major effort, as has been highlighted by the chairman, is to \ncontinue the Senate tradition for improving the way DOD buys \neverything, from major systems like the F-35 and submarines to office \nsupport services, to spare parts, and even to the buying of new \ntechnologies and next-generation research products.\n  I am pleased we have taken positive steps to strengthen our \ncontracting and program management workforces and support Secretary \nCarter's efforts to reach out to innovative Silicon Valley companies \nand other high-tech small businesses. I am glad we are building on the \nconsiderable and successful efforts Under Secretary Frank Kendall has \ntaken to control costs and improve delivery times of our major weapons \nsystems through his active management and leadership, which have \nresulted in a very successful series of better buying power procurement \nreforms.\n  Consistent with those efforts, we have taken steps to improve our \nability to estimate costs of new weapons systems, especially the cost \nto maintain them in the field or at sea, sometimes for decades, and to \nde-layer the bureaucracy and untangle the redtape that the Pentagon \nacquisition process has sometimes been very much weighted down by.\n  We can use better data and better analysis to make better decisions \non what we acquire and how we maintain it. I want to note that I \nbelieve there are a few provisions where continued dialogue with the \nPentagon can improve our bill and make sure we achieve our shared goal: \ndelivering the best and most modern systems to our forces, while \nprotecting taxpayer money in the most responsible manner possible.\n  I hope we can work together to reexamine and refine a few provisions \nof the bill to that end. For example, I am concerned that we overly \nlimit the flexibility of DOD to use all available contract types to \nbest balance the needs of government and industry. I am pleased the \nbill before us is very supportive of the scientists, engineers, and \nother technical innovators in organizations like DARPA, in the \nDepartment of Defense, and in DOD laboratories across the Nation.\n  We fully fund the President's request for science and technology \nresearch programs, including the university research programs that are \nthe foundation of almost all military and commercial technology. We \nalso fully fund the important work of DARPA and the Strategic \nCapabilities Office, both of which are working to develop the next-\ngeneration systems that will dominate the battlefields of the future, \non the ground, on the sea, under the sea, in space, and in cyber space.\n  We also take important steps to ensure that DOD can better compete \nwith the private sector for a limited and shrinking pool of world-class \ntechnical talent. I am pleased to see we have given the DOD labs and \nDARPA important tools to hire the best scientists and engineers through \nfaster hiring processes and some special pay authorities.\n\n[[Page S3400]]\n\n  We have also taken steps to cut the redtape that often ties up these \norganizations and keeps them from achieving their full innovative \npotential, as well as to allow the labs to more easily build and \nmaintain modern research equipment and laboratory facilities. One of \nthe major challenges facing DOD is the difficulty in moving such a \nlarge and diverse organization to adopt new and more efficient business \npractices.\n  I am pleased the bill provides a number of authorities and pilot \nprograms that will allow the Department to explore new business \npractices, informed by best commercial practices, which hopefully will \ndrive down costs and reduce the bureaucratic burdens on the military. \nFor example, we push for the Department to make more use of the \nburgeoning field of big data and data analytics so it can collect and \nuse information and data in a much more sophisticated way, to improve \nDOD management, human resources, and acquisition practices.\n  Big data techniques are changing the way the commercial sector \nmarkets products, manufactures, and manages supply chains and \nlogistics. It is even changing the way people manage sports teams. We \nwould like to see similar techniques and technological advances used in \nways that will improve the efficiency of the Pentagon and its \nprocesses.\n  We take a major step in this bill to redesignate the position of the \nUnder Secretary for Acquisition Technology and Logistics as the Under \nSecretary for Research and Engineering. I understand and support the \nchairman's intent to make sure that innovation, research, and \ntechnology are at the forefront of Pentagon thinking. We all know we \nare now in a world where the Pentagon can no longer corner the market \non the best people or the best new technologies.\n  Our foreign competitors are closing the gap on our battlefield \ntechnological superiority, and global commercial companies are far \noutspending the government on the development of new systems and \ntechnology in areas like cyber security, biotechnology, aerospace, and \nothers that are critical to the future of our national security.\n  I hope the reorganization and realignment steps we take in this bill \nsupport DOD's effort to stay at the leading edge of technological \nadvances. I worry that we may not understand all of the implications of \nthe major changes we are proposing, and I hope we can continue to have \na robust and open dialogue, including with the Pentagon's leadership, \nso we can take these steps in a thoughtful, considered way.\n  Once again, we have taken very bold and very thoughtful steps, but I \nthink we can enhance these steps with a bigger, productive dialogue. \nThis bill takes several other steps to reform both the organizational \nstructures of the civilian and military leadership and also the \nPentagon's overall approach to its operations. One of the most \nsignificant provisions of the bill is the creation of cross-functional \nteams. The Office of the Secretary of Defense is organized exclusively \nalong functional lines, such as acquisition, personnel, logistics, \nfinance, and intelligence, but the real work of the Department is \nmission performance, which requires integrating across all of these \nfunctional stovepipes to achieve specific objectives. This integration \ntask has always been a serious challenge, conducted through layers of \nmanagement spanning more and more functional boundaries, ending with \nthe Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense.\n  The Armed Services Committee, in the years before drafting the \nGoldwater-Nichols act, grappled with the broad problem of mission \nintegration across DOD. The committee found solutions for achieving \n``jointness'' in the combat operations of the Department, but the \ncommittee was unable, at that time, to find practical mechanisms to \nachieve mission integration in the Office of the Secretary of Defense.\n  The problem of integrating across silos of function expertise is not \nunique to DOD or the government as a whole. Industry has long struggled \nwith the same problem. Not surprisingly, industry has pioneered \neffective ways to integrate across their enterprises, dramatically \nimproving outcomes in shorter timeframes, and ultimately streamlining \nand flattening organizational structures. This bill is the first major \nstep in applying these concepts systematically in government. It will \nnot be easy. There will be resistance to such changes, but I believe we \nare taking steps in the right direction, and I encourage the leadership \nof the Department of Defense to work with Congress to make this reform \nsuccessful.\n\n  Another important provision is a reform of the Joint Requirements \nOversight Council, JROC, which shepherds the joint acquisition process. \nThis bill elevates the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs from merely \n``first among equals'' on the Council to the principal adviser to the \nChairman on military requirements. The committee hopes this change will \nsolve one of the most important and consistent criticisms of the JROC; \nnamely, that it is a quid-pro-quo process dominated by parochial \nservice interests.\n  There are other reform provisions--changes to the role of Chairman of \nthe Joint Staffs and Combatant Commands, a reduction in the number of \ngeneral and flag officers, and a change to the type of strategy \ndoctrines produced by the Department. Again, these reforms are a good \nstart, but these are major changes that may have unforeseen \nconsequences. I think they would benefit, again, from further \ndiscussion with the Defense Department's military and civilian \nleadership and outside experts. I encourage and look forward to that \ndialogue.\n  Let me highlight one provision of the bill that I am somewhat \nconcerned with. It limits the Defense Department's ability to implement \nan important Executive order that protects the health, safety, and \nlabor rights of veterans, disabled persons, and other persons of the \ndefense industry workforce. The Executive order is an important tool to \nensure that DOD is working with responsible contractors that are more \nlikely to deliver goods and services critical to national security on \ntime and on budget when they are following these procedures.\n  This order is being implemented in a way that protects the rights of \nall employees, while also protecting due process rights for the \ncompanies concerned, and ensuring that there is no discrimination \nagainst them based on incomplete evidence of wrongdoing or \nunsubstantiated allegations. I hope we can work to continue a policy, \nas enunciated by the Executive order, that I think we can all support, \nensuring DOD is working with responsible contractors to protect our \nworkforce and support national security missions.\n  Finally, I would like to say a few words about the funding levels for \ndefense. The bill reported out of committee includes $523.9 billion in \ndiscretionary spending for defense base budget requirements and $58.9 \nbillion for Overseas Contingency Operations. It also includes $19.3 \nbillion for Department of Energy-related activities, resulting in a \ntop-line funding level of $602 billion for discretionary national \ndefense spending.\n  While these funding levels adhere to the spending limits mandated by \nthe Bipartisan Budget Act, BBA, of 2015, concerns have been raised that \nthe Department requires additional resources. As all Members are aware, \nwhen the Senate considered the BBA last fall, it established the \ndiscretionary funding levels of defense spending for fiscal year 2017.\n  That agreement passed this chamber with support from Senators from \nboth political parties. Furthermore, the BBA split the increase in \ndiscretionary spending evenly between the security and nonsecurity \ncategories. As we consider the fiscal year 2017 NDAA, there is likely \nto be--in fact, the chairman has made it very clear--an effort to \nincrease military spending above the level established by the BBA.\n  It is important to remember that since the Budget Control Act was \nenacted in 2011, we have made repeated incremental changes to the \ndiscretionary budget caps for both defense and nondefense accounts. We \nhave done so in order to provide some budget certainty to the \nDepartment of Defense and also to domestic agencies. As debate on this \nbill continues, the chairman has indicated he will propose an amendment \nto increase spending for defense only.\n  Again, this seems to run counter to the central tenets of all the \nprevious budget negotiation agreements. If defense funds are increased, \nfunding for\n\n[[Page S3401]]\n\ndomestic agencies must also be increased, I believe. In addition, this \nis a point that I think all of us acknowledge, our national security is \nbroader than simply the accounts in the Department of Defense. It is \nthe FBI, it is the Department of Homeland Security, and it is many \nother agencies that contribute to our national security.\n  Let me conclude, once again, by thanking the chairman and my \ncolleagues on the committee who contributed significantly and \nthoughtfully through this whole process, and I particularly thank the \nstaff who worked laboriously and at great personal cost to ensure that \nwe have a bill we can bring to our colleagues on the floor and stand \nand continue a very thoughtful, vigorous, and important dialogue about \nthe national security of the United States. Let me thank them.\n  I know there are many amendments that have been filed. I look forward \nto working with the chairman and all of my colleagues to get this \nlegislation completed and sent forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If no one yields time, the time will be equally charged to both \nsides.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n   50th Anniversary of Robert F. Kennedy's ``Ripples of Hope'' Speech\n\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, on this exact date half a century ago, \nthen-Senator Robert F. Kennedy delivered a powerful speech in Cape \nTown, South Africa, a nation that was then struggling through the cruel \ninjustices of apartheid. It was the conclusion of a remarkable trip to \nSouth Africa in which Bobby Kennedy visited the Nobel Peace Prize-\nwinning Chief Lutuli, visited Soweto, visited the University of Wits in \nJohannesburg, and spoke with students at the University of Cape Town.\n  Last week I had the opportunity to help lead a congressional \ndelegation to commemorate Bobby Kennedy's historic journey and his \nfamous ``Ripples of Hope'' speech he delivered during his visit. The \ntrip offered all of us an opportunity to reflect on the parallels \nbetween America's civil rights movement and South Africa's liberation \nstruggle and to renew the conversation of reconciliation as both \ncountries face legacies that remain both difficult and unresolved.\n  More importantly, as South Africa and the United States face serious \nchallenges to the very institutions that underpin and preserve our \ndemocracies, this trip served as a reminder that while our \nconstitutional orders may be supported by courageous and principled \nleaders through critical moments in our history, nations don't endure \nbecause of a few charismatic and historic individuals, they endure \nbecause of institutions.\n  I was honored to be joined on this trip by a bipartisan group of \ncolleagues from the House of Representatives, including, most \nimportantly, Congressman John Lewis of Georgia, who is a hero of \nAmerica's own civil rights movement, Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer of \nMaryland, and five others. There was also a ``Ripples of Hope'' \ndelegation that traveled alongside us that included RFK's children, \nKerry Kennedy and Rory Kennedy. Kerry is now president of the RFK Human \nRights Foundation. There were more than a dozen members of the Kennedy \nfamily, of several generations, as well as the leaders and some members \nof the Faith in Politics Institute. It is Faith in Politics that \nannually organizes--under the leadership of Congressman John Lewis--the \ncivil rights pilgrimage of Members of Congress, Republicans and \nDemocrats, House and Senate, who retrace the steps of the famous Selma \nmarch, which he helped lead, as well as the pivotal events of both \nMontgomery and Birmingham at the height of the American civil rights \nmovement. These three organizations--the Faith in Politics Institute, \nthe RFK Foundation, and the congressional delegation--met up in South \nAfrica.\n  At the time of Bobby Kennedy's visit 50 years ago, South Africa was \ndeep in the throes of apartheid, with a liberation movement that had \nbeen decapitated in the Liliesleaf raid of 1963 and pushed far \nunderground. At that point, Black South Africans lived in fear, and \ntheir leaders were either imprisoned or in exile. The National Party \nand the South African security forces controlled nearly every state \ninstitution. As author Evan Thomas has described it, ``Nowhere was \ninjustice more stark or the prospect for change bleaker than South \nAfrica in 1966.'' RFK would later write about what he what called ``the \ndilemma of South Africa: a land of enormous promise and potential, \naspiration and achievement--yet a land also of repression and sadness, \ndarkness and cruelty'' as of 1966. To put it plainly and simply, \napartheid was a brutal form of racial subjugation.\n  In the midst of an environment in which White supremacy was codified \nby law and most anti-apartheid leaders and stalwarts were imprisoned or \non the run, Bobby Kennedy was invited to give the University of Cape \nTown's Day of Affirmation address. Kennedy began his speech at Jameson \nHall, describing ``a land in which the native inhabitants were at first \nsubdued, but relations with whom remain a problem to this day; a land \nwhich defined itself on a hostile frontier; . . . a land which once \n[was] the importer of slaves, and now must struggle to wipe out the \nlast traces of that former bondage.'' RFK then paused before \nconcluding: ``I refer, of course, to the United States of America.''\n  As you listen to the audio recording of his speech, you can then hear \na ripple of recognition and applause that Kennedy--who many thought was \nintroducing his speech about South Africa--was instead recognizing \nremarkable parallels between our two nations. As Kennedy spoke to a \nlarge crowd who had waited in the cold for hours, he made it clear with \nhis opening that he came not to preach to the people of South Africa \nfrom our supposed position of superiority due to the length of our \ndemocratic experiment but to share and to learn from our common \nlegacies and challenges.\n  Then and now, the differences between the United States and South \nAfrica are profound and real. Yet Americans and South Africans do share \nmore than we might widely recognize. We have similar stories to tell, \nand we have many lessons that we can and should learn from each other.\n  Today, more than 20 years after the end of apartheid, South Africa's \npost-apartheid nonracial democracy is struggling to deliver on the \npromise of its ambitious founding principles and to transform its \neconomy to generate opportunity for all its citizens. Meanwhile, here \nin the United States, we are mired in dysfunctional politics, and many \nAmericans justifiably feel that we have failed to make even modest \nprogress on the economic and social challenges we face.\n  Our countries also share a deeply embedded history of racial \ndiscrimination and division from which we have not yet healed--a shared \nstruggle exemplified by the fact that 50 years ago during Kennedy's \ntrip to South Africa, American civil rights activist James Meredith was \nshot by a White gunman while marching for voting rights in Mississippi.\n  We share complex histories of struggles balancing the role of \nviolence and nonviolence in seeking justice and equality under the law.\n  Today we share flawed criminal justice systems that \ndisproportionately punish our citizens of color, and we share sadly \nimperfect education systems that don't do enough to support them.\n  Today we also continue to share a struggle to find the most \nappropriate way to welcome and incorporate literally millions of \nundocumented immigrants and to prevent the tensions associated with \nxenophobia--something we have seen in the United States and we also \nheard about in South Africa last week.\n  Yet, despite our common shortcomings, we share remarkable \nconstitutions and inspiring foundational documents--South Africa's \nFreedom Charter and our own Declaration of Independence--whose soaring \nprinciples say powerful and inspiring things but whose lived \nexperiences have so far fallen short.\n  We share a powerful commitment to democracy framed by these strong \noriginal documents, respect for the rule of law, and capable and \nindependent judiciaries--institutions created and sustained by the work \nof many over hundreds of years.\n\n  We share a striking foundational moment: Our President George \nWashington and their President Nelson Mandela--both, as founding \nPresidents,\n\n[[Page S3402]]\n\nstepped down from their offices willingly and set powerful precedents \nof respect for constitutions and term limits.\n  We share the fact that we are deeply religious nations across all \nracial backgrounds and all income levels. Both South Africa and the \nUnited States have deep and long traditions of faith and religion which \nhave powerfully influenced our public lives. These, of course, are \ntraditions which were at times in the past twisted into justifications \nfor prejudice and racial discrimination but which also served as \nguiding lights for the nonviolent efforts to achieve justice and \nreconciliation.\n  If you think about it, these shared faith traditions have inspired \nsome of our most powerful leaders. Congressman John Lewis, who was with \nus on this trip, was beaten, bloodied, and arrested 40 times in the \nstreets of the South, fighting for equality in the South under the law. \nHe led the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. As the leader of \nthe march on Selma in 1966, he encountered State troopers armed with \nguns, tear gas, and clubs wrapped in barbed wire as he crossed the \nEdmund Pettus Bridge and simply said, before the onslaught that later \nbecame known as Bloody Sunday, ``Let us pray.''\n  We all remember that Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was one of \nthe most important leaders of our civil rights movement, the Baptist \npreacher and president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference \nwho, when imprisoned in a Birmingham jail, wrote that ``human progress \nnever rolls in on wheels of inevitability; it comes through the \ntireless efforts of men willing to be coworkers with God.''\n  Similarly, in South Africa some of their most important leaders were \nclergymen. One of the most moving moments for me in our trip was the \nchance to revisit a fellowship I have shared with Archbishop Desmond \nTutu, for whom I worked briefly 30 years ago. Tutu, the Anglican bishop \nwho led the South African Council of Churches and fought for decades \nagainst apartheid, was lifted up and recognized with the Nobel Peace \nPrize in 1984 and many years later received the Presidential Medal of \nFreedom here in the United States. He ultimately chaired the post-\napartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which engaged in the \nvery hard work of convening whole committees of both those who \ncommitted the atrocities of apartheid and their victims in a \ndisciplined, constitutionally created, nationwide effort at \nreconciliation. It was Archbishop Desmond Tutu who wrote, ``Hate has no \nplace in the house of God.''\n  In both the United States and South Africa, the language used to \nchallenge unjust structures and actions of the government in civil \nsociety at the time were rooted in Biblically based questions of \njustice and righteousness. It made possible national conversations \nabout forgiveness and reconciliation.\n  Some of the most striking and powerful witnesses offered quietly on \nthe sides of our journey were from two Americans who were participants \nin the faith and politics civil rights pilgrimage this year in \nCharleston, SC. They were survivors of the horrible events at the \nEmanuel AME Church in Charleston, a tragedy in which relatives and \nfriends were savagely murdered during a Bible reflection prayer \nsession. It was a tragedy from which two survivors, Felicia and Polly, \ntraveled with us to South Africa last week, with the Kennedy \ndelegation. It was many of those who survived that tragic event in \nCharleston, SC, who just a few days later, in confronting the gunman, \nwere able and willing, out of the depths of their faith, to say \npublicly:\n\n       We have no room for hate. We have to forgive.\n\n  I will remind you that one thing that is most impressive about \nCongressman John Lewis from his own experience in our civil rights \nmovement is his ability to reconcile and forgive. Decades after a \nmember of the Ku Klux Klan beat John Lewis and many other Freedom \nRiders in the summer of 1961, the now U.S. Congressman John Lewis \nwelcomed a Klansman who had actually beaten him decades before to his \noffice here in Washington and said, as he has repeated many times on \nour civil rights pilgrimage, ``I accept your apology. I forgive you.''\n  One of the most striking aspects of Nelson Mandela's leadership as \nthe first President of a truly free, nonracial South Africa was his \ncapacity for forgiveness. Twenty years after he was released from \nprison--an imprisonment that lasted 27 years and robbed him of his \nopportunity to be a free man, to see his own children grow up, to be a \ncontributing part of his society; an apartheid imprisonment that took \naway virtually his entire adult life--20 years after his release from \nprison, Mandela invited one of his former jailers to dinner at his own \nhome, a man with whom he had become friends, saying that their \nfriendship ``reinforced my belief in the essential humanity of even \nthose who had kept me behind bars.'' Think about the depths of that \nforgiveness. As our own President Obama has put it, referring to \nMandela by his familiar name, ``It took a man like Madiba to free not \njust the prisoner, but the jailer as well.''\n  It is individuals such as John Lewis and Nelson Mandela who set the \nexample of healing, forgiveness, and reconciliation that may ultimately \nallow us to move forward from our foundational sins of slavery and \ndiscrimination. And it is the powerful witness of those from South \nCarolina, from the Emanuel AME Church, who have challenged us anew, in \nan era of Black Lives Matter concerns and protests, to redouble our \nefforts to achieve real repentance by those who weigh violence against \nour racial minorities in the United States and those whose still need \nreconciliation and forgiveness.\n  Last week our congressional delegation had a chance to break bread \nwith Archbishop Desmond Tutu. We heard him discuss the vital importance \nof the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which allowed the people of \nSouth Africa to attempt to work together to move past the bitterness \nand hatred of apartheid. There is much work undone in South Africa \ntoday, as I referenced, but the transformational impact of the Truth \nand Reconciliation Commission is beyond doubt in that it made it \npossible for both the perpetrators and the victims of apartheid to see \neach other face to face and to engage in many acts of contrition and \nreconciliation.\n  We had a chance on our trip to South Africa to visit Liliesleaf Farm \njust outside of Johannesburg, which was the site where the leaders of \nthe underground anti-apartheid movement--led by Nelson Mandela, Walter \nSisulu, and Andrew Mlangeni, the African National Congress--where all \nof those leaders were at one time picked up by the South African \nsecurity police. This was in July of 1963. We had a chance to meet with \nand hear from many of the stalwarts of that stage of the struggle--from \nWalter Sisulu's son Max to Mlangni himself, now in his late eighties--\nabout their struggles following the raid and the Rivonia treason \ntrials, after which there were life sentences imposed on many of those \ncaptured at Liliesleaf.\n\n  We also visited Nelson Mandela's home in Soweto and his jail cell on \nRobben Island, where he served out 18 years of his very long sentence. \nWe had a remarkable and moving tour of Robben Island, provided for us \nby Ahmed Kothrada, who goes by the casual name of ``Kathy,'' and who \ntalked with us about his experience on Robben Island and about how they \nmaintained discipline, how they were able to continue to work together \nto shore up each other's spirits as they coped with year after year of \nbrutal conditions and hard prison labor.\n  One of the most striking things for me was to hear from this man, Mr. \nKothrada, the absence of bitterness, the absence of vitriol after his \nlife, too, was marred by decades of imprisonment by the apartheid \nregime.\n  It wasn't just members of our delegation who had an opportunity to \nlearn from these conversations. There were also many South Africans who \nhad the opportunity to hear from Congressman John Lewis, as he spoke \npassionately in several different settings, both in Johannesburg and in \nCape Town, about his experience in our civil rights movement. It was \nuplifting to see him mobbed afterwards by young South Africans \neverywhere he went who wanted to meet with him, hear from him, take \npictures with him, and reflect once again on the common and \nconstructive legacies of our two nations.\n  As we look back at 50 years, we see from the struggles of people like \nJohn Lewis and Nelson Mandela that while progress is possible, RFK's \nobservation that ``humanity sometimes progresses very slowly indeed'' \nremains true, and humanity has much more work to do.\n\n[[Page S3403]]\n\n  Today, in South Africa, over half the Black population lives in \npoverty compared to less than 1 percent of the White population. \nAverage annual household income is over $25,000 for White South \nAfricans, yet barely $4,000 for Blacks. South Africa's unemployment \nrate is 7 percent for Whites and over 30 percent for Blacks, and it is \nmuch higher in the townships and for younger South Africans. Even when \nBlack students make it to South Africa's universities, like the \nUniversity of Cape Town, they are much less likely to graduate.\n  I have many more statistics that I could cite, but by important \nmeasures, inequality between Whites and Blacks has actually increased \nsince the end of apartheid in South Africa since 1994.\n  These disparities are not unique to South Africa. A Pew Research \nCenter study found that in 2013 in the United States, White households \nhad a median net worth 13 times greater than that of our African-\nAmerican households--the largest discrepancy in decades in our country. \nOur Department of Education recently found that compared to White \nstudents, Black students in America are far less likely to have access \nto preschool, advanced high school courses, are much more likely to be \nsuspended, and are much less likely to complete college.\n  These divides sadly extend to our legal system as well. On average, \nBlack men in America receive sentences 20-percent longer than White men \nwho commit identical crimes. The population of my home State of \nDelaware is 22 percent Black, yet two-thirds of our prison population \nis African American.\n  Behind all these challenging and difficult statistics lies the very \nreal challenge of how to be true to our foundational values and yet \nfind a path forward that creates both growth and empowerment and \nopportunity and progress for the peoples of both of our countries. By \nany measure, we have more work to do. Echoing the words of Congressman \nLewis, ``we have come a great distance . . . but we have a great \ndistance farther to go.''\n  In that June 6 address 50 years ago, Bobby Kennedy described the \nplane that brought him to South Africa from which ``we could see no \nnational boundaries, no vast gulfs or high walls dividing people from \npeople.'' Today, globalization has proven that the boundaries between \nus and them--whether by race or religion, party or nationality--are \nindeed what RFK called them--illusions of differences.\n  Still, we need to find the courage and the strength to tackle these \nproblems, to not fall victim to the forces of apathy and complacency. \nWe must find solutions that work for each country in its own context.\n  Exactly 50 years ago today, Bobby Kennedy told South Africans: ``Few \nwill have the greatness to bend history but each of us can work to \nchange a small portion of the events, and then the total of all these \nacts will be written in the history of this generation.'' That, in some \nways, was the enduring power of his best known quote from that speech, \nabout how each man, each individual--man or woman--who stands up for an \nideal acts to improve the lot of others or strikes out against \ninjustice and sends forth a tiny ripple of hope. All those ripples in \ncombination can form a wall of water that knocks down even the greatest \nof impediments to progress and justice, such as the walls of apartheid.\n  It was these very ripples that sent forth hope to all South Africans \nin 1966, when Bobby Kennedy spoke. It was these ripples that sustained \nMandela's struggle over decades and that prompted the son of an African \nimmigrant to America to take his first steps towards a career in public \nservice, a decision that ultimately brought him to our Presidency \ntoday. It was the same commitment to equality and justice that led me, \n30 years ago, to travel to South Africa and work for the Council of \nChurches there, under the tutelage of both Reverend Paul Verryn and \nArchbishop Desmond Tutu. It was this same experience which was \nreflected in Bishop Tutu's ``Ubuntu,'' the distinctly South African \nidea that, as President Obama put it, we are all bound together in ways \ninvisible to the eye but there is a oneness to humanity.\n  I met a remarkable range of men and women, young and old, leaders of \nthis generation and the last in South Africa in this past week, and I \nwas reminded in all of our conversations--on Robben Island, at \nLiliesleaf, with young entrepreneurs in Soweto, with business leaders \ntrying to grow the economy and create opportunity, with those from \nevery background in South Africa--that all of these men and women have \nfought that fight, sending forth ripples of hope that brought the \nmighty walls of apartheid crashing down and built a more equal nation \nin its place 20 years ago. That has to continue to be part of this \nprogress today and going forward.\n  Bobby Kennedy's visit 50 years ago played a critical role in changing \nthe tone and tempo of the anti-apartheid struggle at the time. Margaret \nMarshall, a student activist then in South Africa, recalled this from \nthe time of his visit in 1966:\n\n       The world seemed to ignore us . . . but Bobby Kennedy was \n     different. He reminded us . . . that we were not alone. \n     That we were part of a great and noble tradition, the \n     reaffirmation of nobility and value in every human person. \n     We all had felt alienated. It felt to me that what I was \n     doing was small and meaningless. He put us back into the \n     great sweep of history.\n\n  Last week, speaking at that same university at which her father \nprovided this vital infusion of optimism a half century ago, Kerry \nKennedy told us these ripples of hope didn't have to come from \ngovernments or militaries or corporations. They can come from anyone, \nanywhere--from seemingly average people, just as was the case with \nMargaret Marshall five decades ago. Today, they come from us, from the \ncitizens we represent across this Nation and the people struggling \nacross South Africa to find together a better and brighter future.\n  In the months and years to come, the United States and South Africa \ncan and should look to each other for lessons and inspirations as we \ncontinue to work to heal the damage of racial injustice, to reverse the \ntrends of economic inequality, and to protect our experiments in \ndemocracy.\n  As South Africa prepares for upcoming municipal elections in August, \nand as we prepare for our own national elections in November, both \nnations are entering periods in our electoral history where our \ninstitutions of democracy and governance are being challenged. Today, \nSouth Africa is showing just how important to the sustainment of \ndemocracy it is to have not just charismatic, worldly, historical, or \nforgiving heads of state or individuals leading churches but also a \nvery strong public protector, an independent judiciary, a vibrant \nmedia, and an engaged electorate.\n  In America and South Africa, I believe our institutions will protect \nand preserve our democracies. These institutions must, of course, be \ninspired and led by courageous and principled individuals, like Senator \nKennedy, like Congressman Lewis, like President Mandela. But nations \ndon't endure because of individuals. Nations must endure because of \nstrong institutions.\n  Two months after he returned to the United States, Kennedy reflected \non his speech of 50 years ago today, and said:\n\n       I acknowledged the United States, like other countries, \n     still had far to go to keep the promises of our Constitution. \n     What was important . . . was that we were trying.\n\n  In 1991, when President Mandela came here to speak, he told an \nAmerican audience: ``I am not a saint, unless you think of a saint as a \nsinner who keeps on trying.'' The people of the United States must keep \ntrying to be true to our foundational values and documents, and the \npeople of South Africa must as well. We must all keep on trying, as \nPresident Obama said, because ``action and ideas are not enough. No \nmatter how right, they must be chiseled into law and institutions'' \nthat will endure.\n  We have a lot of trying left to do. From last week, I have concluded \nthat we have much to learn from each other and much to teach the rest \nof the world. So let's rededicate ourselves, 50 years after Bobby \nKennedy's speech gave hope to South Africa and the world, to facing \nthese challenges together.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S3404]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       72nd Anniversary of D-day\n\n  Mr. TILLIS. Madam President, I am here today to talk about a very \nimportant event in American history. Seventy-two years ago today, six \nAmerican and four British and Canadian divisions began the assault on \nAdolf Hitler's Fortress Europe, on what German Field Marshal Rommel \nfamously referred to as ``the longest day.''\n  As the paratroopers moved to their planes and infantrymen embarked on \ntheir ships, Dwight Eisenhower reminded them of their cause when he \nsaid:\n\n       You are about to embark upon the Great Crusade, toward \n     which we have striven these many months. The eyes of the \n     world are upon you. The hopes and prayers of liberty-loving \n     people everywhere march with you. In company with our brave \n     Allies and brothers-in-arms on other Fronts, you will bring \n     about the destruction of the German war machine, the \n     elimination of Nazi tyranny over the oppressed peoples of \n     Europe, and security for ourselves in a free world.\n\n  North Carolina was at Normandy on that day. At 1:51 a.m., Fort \nBragg's 82nd Airborne Division, under the command of MG Matthew \nRidgeway and BG James Gavin, began the fight. The paratroopers of the \n``All-American Division'' were scattered by bad weather and German \nanti-aircraft fire, missing many of their designated drop zones. Within \nhours, though, through sheer guts and determination, the All-American \nDivision had captured towns and crossroads and ensured that the Panzer \ncounterattack did not reach Normandy beaches, allowing the Allied \ninfantry to push into the heart of German-occupied France.\n  The 82nd Airborne finished the war as the most decorated combat unit \nin the history of the United States, a distinction that still holds \ntoday. The cross-channel invasion fixed Omaha and Utah Beaches for the \nAmerican assault. ``Bloody Omaha'' was the most difficult of the \nlanding beaches, due to its rough terrain and bluffs fortified by \nRommel's infantry division.\n  Omaha was hit by the U.S. First and 29th Infantry Divisions. The \n29th, known as ``The Blue and Gray Division,'' was a National Guard \nunit composed of men from North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland. In \nthe first wave, A Company, 1st Battalion, 116th Infantry, from the \nVirginia National Guard in Bedford, VA, was annihilated as it landed.\n  The catastrophic losses suffered by the small Virginia community led \nit to being selected for the site of the National D-day Memorial. \nLosses were so heavy that GEN Omar Bradley seriously considered pulling \nAmerican forces from Omaha Beach. However, follow-on units from the \nNorth Carolina National Guard reached that beach, as immortalized in \nthe opening scenes of the movie ``Saving Private Ryan.''\n  By nightfall, the division headquarters and 10,000 reinforcements \nlanded and began fighting inland. On Omaha Beach, ``uncommon valor was \n[quite] common'' that day.\n  By the evening of June 6, over 1,000 men from the 29th had become \ncasualties on Omaha Beach. Added to losses at other beaches and drop \nzones made the total casualties for Operation Overlord 6,500 Americans \nand 3,000 British and Canadian soldiers.\n  During World War II, the 29th Infantry Division had such a high \ncasualty rate it was said that its commanding general actually \ncommanded three divisions: one on the field of battle, one in the \nhospital, and one in the cemetery. The 29th Infantry Division lost \n3,720 killed in action, 15,403 wounded in action, 462 missing in \naction, 526 prisoners of war, and another 8,665 noncombat casualties, \nfor a total of 28,776 casualties during 242 days of combat.\n  Today, thousands of North Carolinian guardsmen continue the brave \ntradition of this proud unit.\n  The people of North Carolina remember the soldiers of D-day and their \ncomrades from other battlefields of the war. On the Cape Fear River \nsits the USS North Carolina, the most decorated battleship of World War \nII. It is not a museum. It is a reminder. It is our memorial. The names \nof over 10,000 North Carolinians who paid the ultimate price are set on \nthe walls of that great ship. In Franklin Roosevelt's words, ``They \nfought not for the lust of conquest. They fought to end conquest. They \nfought to liberate.''\n  As we observe D-day, I hope we all recognize the ultimate sacrifice \nso many men and women have paid in uniform, and on the week that we \nconsider the national defense authorization, I hope all of my \ncolleagues will recognize the incredible importance and the debt we owe \nthem to do our job here so that they can continue to defend us abroad. \nWe have to do everything we can to get them safe and prepared and ready \nto do that mission.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I didn't know my colleague from North \nCarolina was going to come to the floor to talk about D-day. That is \nwhat I am going to talk about too. I would like to follow on his \ncomments, first, to congratulate him for a terrific job of explaining \nthe importance of this day, not just to our country but to the world, \nthe day America truly began the liberation of Europe, and also for his \ndescription of the North Carolina brave soldiers who lost their lives \nthat day.\n  It was 72 years ago this morning when the invasion began. It was a \nday in which there was a lot of concern and anxiety. People knew this \nwas going to be a major conflict.\n  Some 40 years later, Ronald Reagan spoke at Pointe du Hoc. He made \nthe point that every church in America was filled that morning. By \nabout 4 that morning, people were praying all over the country, knowing \nthis was going to be a very difficult battle. It was the largest \namphibious assault in the history of the world. There were 150,000 \nAllied troops involved, and as my friend from North Carolina indicated, \nwe lost over 10,000 troops that day, most of whom were Americans. There \nwere 10,000 aircraft involved as well and 6,000 ships.\n  It was thought that day that Franklin Delano Roosevelt would give a \nspeech, as he had done many times before, called a ``fireside chat,'' \nfrom the White House, talking about the invasion and helping the \nAmerican people to understand the importance of that day, but he \ndecided to do something else instead. He decided, instead of giving a \nspeech, to recite a prayer. That prayer has become known as the ``D-day \nPrayer.'' It is a very powerful statement.\n  About 2 years ago on this day, the 70th anniversary, we passed \nlegislation in the Senate to actually ensure that prayer would be part \nof the World War II Memorial. We are now going through the process to \nhave that included in the World War II Memorial so all Americans today, \nand the children and grandchildren of those World War II veterans and \nheroes, as they come to Washington, are able to see this prayer \nFranklin Delano Roosevelt said that day. I would like to read these \nwords that were spoken 72 years ago by President Roosevelt, if I might. \nHe said:\n\n       My fellow Americans: Last night, when I spoke with you \n     about the fall of Rome, I knew at that moment that troops of \n     the United States and our allies were crossing the Channel in \n     another and greater operation. It has come to pass with \n     success thus far.\n       And so, in this poignant hour, I ask you to join with me in \n     prayer:\n       Almighty God: Our sons, pride of our Nation, this day have \n     set upon a mighty endeavor, a struggle to preserve our \n     Republic, our religion, and our civilization, and to set free \n     a suffering humanity.\n       Lead them straight and true, give strength to their arms, \n     stoutness to their hearts, steadfastness to their faith.\n       They will need Thy blessings. Their road will be long and \n     hard. For the enemy is strong. He may hurl back our forces. \n     Success may not come with rushing speed, but we shall return \n     again and again; and we know that by Thy grace, and by the \n     righteousness of our cause, our sons will triumph.\n       They will be sore tried, by night and by day, without \n     rest--until the victory is won. The darkness will be rent by \n     noise and flame. Men's souls will be shaken with the \n     violences of war.\n       For these men are lately drawn from the ways of peace. They \n     fight not for the lust of conquest. They fight to end \n     conquest. They fight to liberate. They fight to let justice \n     arise, and tolerance and good will among all Thy people. They \n     yearn but for the end of battle, for their return to the \n     haven of home.\n       Some will never return. Embrace these, Father, and receive \n     them, Thy heroic servants, into Thy kingdom.\n       And for us at home--fathers, mothers, children, wives, \n     sisters, and brothers of brave men overseas--whose thoughts \n     and prayers are ever with them--help us, Almighty God, to \n     rededicate ourselves in renewed faith in Thee in this hour of \n     great sacrifice.\n       Many people have urged that I call the Nation into a single \n     day of special prayer. But\n\n[[Page S3405]]\n\n     because the road is long and the desire is great, I ask that \n     our people devote themselves in a continuance of prayer. As \n     we rise to each new day, and again when each day is spent, \n     let words of prayer be on our lips, invoking Thy help to our \n     efforts.\n       Give us strength, too--strength in our daily tasks, to \n     redouble the contributions we make in the physical and the \n     material support of our armed forces.\n       And let our hearts be stout, to wait out the long travail, \n     to bear sorrows that may come, to impart our courage unto our \n     sons wheresoever they may be.\n       And, O Lord, give us Faith. Give us Faith in Thee; Faith in \n     our sons; Faith in each other; Faith in our crusade. Let not \n     the keenness of our spirit ever be dulled. Let not the \n     impacts of temporary events, of temporal matters of but \n     fleeting moment let not these deter us in our unconquerable \n     purpose.\n       With Thy blessing, we shall prevail over the unholy forces \n     of our enemy. Help us to conquer the apostles of greed and \n     racial arrogancies. Lead us to the saving of our country, and \n     with our sister Nations into a world unity that will spell a \n     sure peace--a peace invulnerable to the schemings of unworthy \n     men. And a peace that will let all of men live in freedom, \n     reaping the just rewards of their honest toil.\n       Thy will be done, Almighty God.\n       Amen.\n\n  This is the prayer that he spoke on D-day. What a powerful moment.\n  On this day, 72 years later, we remember the bravery and the \nsacrifice of D-day. We remember the fact that this was the beginning of \nthe liberation of Europe, and, indeed, as President Roosevelt \npredicted, we would ultimately prevail, despite great losses.\n  Let us also today, as we are talking on the floor--this evening, \ntomorrow, and through the week--about our defense forces, remember the \nimportance of this prayer, as it talks about the need for us to ensure \nwe do have a strong military and that we support those in the military \nforces as we take up the Defense authorization legislation.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 4206\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I yield back the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rubio).

Mr. President, today the Senate voted on amendment \nNo. 4206 to S. 2943, the National Defense Authorization Act, NDAA, for \nfiscal year 2017. This amendment would ensure that beneficiaries \naffected by changes to military health care designed to maintain \ncritical wartime medical readiness skills and core competencies will be \nable to access through TRICARE medical services no longer available at \nmilitary treatment facilities. I support this amendment because it \nensures military families and retirees receive the care they deserve \nwhile allowing the military to focus on its wartime medical skills and \ntraining, and I would have voted in favor of it if I were present for \nthe vote.\n  Currently, the Military Health System has the dual role of medically \nsupporting wartime deployments while caring for Active Duty members, \nretirees, and their families in peacetime. However, the core \ncompetencies and skills required for wartime and peacetime medical care \ncan, at times, diverge. Great efficiencies can be found through public-\nprivate partnerships that can allow military medical professionals to \nfocus on their wartime skills, while allowing the civilian health \nsystem to provide more care to military families and retirees. In our \nfiscally constrained environment, we must ensure that we use our \ndefense dollars for maximum effect.\n  Amendment No. 4206 specifies how beneficiaries will receive care \nbecause of changes to the Military Health System. The amendment also \nrequires the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to Congress on the \nmodifications to medical services, treatment facilities, and personnel \nin the Military Health System. This ensures appropriate oversight of \nthe Department of Defense's reforms in this area. I will continue to \nwork to ensure that the individuals that protect us every day receive \nthe care and support that we owe them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4229\n\n       (Purpose: To address unfunded priorities of the Armed \n     Forces)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 4229.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4229.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of May 25, 2016, under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the National \nDefense Authorization Act, which we will be processing this week, I \nhope. Particularly, I want to talk about Section 578. Section 578 is a \nprovision designed to protect the children of our servicemembers and \nspecifically to protect them while they are at school from convicted \npedophiles and other dangerous felons.\n  This is an issue I have been working on for 2\\1/2\\ years. My \ninvolvement resulted from hearing about a horrific story that is about \na little boy name Jeremy Bell. The story begins at a school in Delaware \nCounty in Southeastern Pennsylvania. A schoolteacher there had molested \nseveral boys--had raped one. When the school officials and the local \nlaw enforcement figured out that something very, very wrong was going \non, they unfortunately concluded that they just did not have\n\n[[Page S3406]]\n\nenough evidence. They did not have a strong case that they could bring \nagainst this teacher.\n  The school wanted to get rid of him, and tragically they were OK with \nletting him become someone else's problem. They wrote a letter of \nrecommendation with the understanding that he would leave. This monster \ntook the letter of recommendation, went across the State line to West \nVirginia, was hired as a teacher, and several years later he had become \na principal. Of course, these people don't change their ways, and he \ndidn't. He continued to molest and attack little boys. It ended when he \nraped and killed a 12-year-old boy named Jeremy Bell in West Virginia.\n  That time, justice caught up with this teacher. He is now serving a \nlife sentence in jail for that murder, but of course it is too late for \nJeremy Bell. Tragically, Jeremy Bell is not alone.\n  Since Joe Manchin and I first began this effort in this Chamber 2\\1/\n2\\ years ago, at least 1,150 school employees have been arrested across \nthe country for sexual misconduct with the kids whom they are supposed \nto be looking after, they are supposed to be caring for, and they are \nsupposed to be teaching--1,150. That is more than one a day. Of course, \nthose are the ones where the officials knew enough to feel confident \nthat they could make an arrest and actually press charges. How many \nmore cases are actually happening? I would stress that these aren't \njust numbers. Every one of these 1,150 arrests represents a horrific \ntragedy and, in many cases, more than one.\n  Consider a few examples from my State of Pennsylvania.\n  Just this past January, the parents of children at Trinity High \nSchool in Washington County learned something absolutely horrific. They \nlearned that a special education teacher there was charged with raping \na little girl over a 15-year period. It started when she was just 3 \nyears old, and they didn't discover this until she was 18. He had raped \nanother little girl who was only 6 years old.\n  Or consider the Phoenixville Area Middle School in Chester County. In \nNovember 2013, the school's principal was sentenced to 2 years in \nprison for having child pornography. A month later, a special education \nand math teacher at the school was arrested for possessing child \npornography, some involving very, very young children.\n  It is hard to even talk about these things. It is very uncomfortable \nto hear about this, to talk about this, but we can't shy away from \nthis. If we think it is uncomfortable to think about it, talk about it, \nand hear about it, what about the experience for the child and the \nchild's family? Every day it seems there is a new story.\n  In Pittsburgh, Plum High School, two teachers have pled guilty to \nhaving sex with younger students. A third one is awaiting trial on \nrelated charges. The DA is investigating allegations that the school \nsuperintendent and principal might have ignored reports of abuse along \nthe way.\n  Another teacher has been charged with witness intimidation. He made \none of the victims, a girl who is a victim, stand up in front of the \nclass, and he mocked her because she brought the issue to the attention \nof the authorities.\n  This is outrageous. This has to stop. I have vowed that I am going to \ndo everything I can to try to provide greater security to our kids in \nour schools.\n  This past December we took a big step in the right direction, in my \nview. Congress passed legislation, and President Obama signed it into \nlaw. It was legislation in the broader education bill we passed that \nhad my legislation which now explicitly prohibits, forbids, knowingly \nrecommending one of these monsters for hire. So exactly the \ncircumstances that gave rise to the murder of Jeremy Bell--where a \nschool knows they have a pedophile, they discover it, and they still \nsend along a letter of recommendation so that he can become someone \nelse's problem--are now illegal, as well they should be. It is not as \nrare as you might think. In fact, the practice is so common that it is \nwell understood in the circles of child advocates and the people who \nprosecute these crimes and who defend children when they have been \nvictimized by these crimes. It is so common that it even has its own \nname. It is called ``passing the trash.'' But, unfortunately, when we \ngot that piece of our legislation passed, we were not successful in \npersuading all of our colleagues that we also had to have another \nelement to this. To really keep our kids safe, we need to make sure \nthat we have a rigorous background check and that people aren't able to \nskirt--and we know that does happen.\n  I promised I would be back on the Senate floor to try to address this \nweakness, this loophole--the fact that we don't have consistently \nrigorous background checks--to make sure that we are not hiring these \ncreeps in the first place.\n  I am very pleased to announce today that I think we are very close to \ntaking another step forward in this legislation, thanks to Chairman \nMcCain, who just left the floor. But the senior Senator from Arizona, \nthe chairman of the Armed Services Committee, incorporated into this \nlegislation, the national defense authorization bill, the bill that I \nintroduced to protect our servicemembers' children. That is what it is \ncalled; it is called the Protecting Our Servicemembers' Children from \nSexual and Violent Predators Act. It simply states that a school \ndistrict that accepts Impact money--that is the funding we approve in \nCongress; it runs through the Defense Department, and it goes to the \nschool districts that are educating the children of our servicemembers \nwhen they are on a base. What our legislation says is that such a \nschool district has to have a safe environment for kids. That is all. \nThey have to have a policy requiring criminal background checks for all \nthe school workers, any adults, who have unsupervised contact with \nchildren. If a person applies for a job with such a school and it turns \nout they have been convicted--not alleged, but convicted of a serious \ncrime, including murder, rape, or any violent or sexual crime against \nchildren--then such a person may not be employed at a school in a \ncapacity where they would have unsupervised access to children. As I \nsaid, this applies only to those school districts that receive Federal \nImpact Aid; that is, those school districts that receive money to help \ncompensate them for the fact that they are educating our military \nfamilies' children. It is about 17 percent of America's school \ndistricts that receive this Federal Impact Aid. It is roughly 8.5 \nmillion kids.\n  The legislation also applies to the DOD-operated schools. The Defense \nDepartment operates its own schools to educate the children of our \nmilitary personnel. To the credit of the Defense Department, it is \nalready their own internal policy to require these appropriate \nbackground checks that are rigorous enough to make sure that we stop a \nviolent predator from being hired in this capacity.\n  Because it is just internal policy, it could change, and enforcement \ncould lapse. What our legislation does is codify it because this is the \nright thing to do. Let's codify it. Since it is the right thing to do \nand we are doing it at our DOD schools, let's also do it at the other \nschools that are educating our military families' kids.\n\n  I don't think this should even be controversial. Pennsylvanians whom \nI talk to don't think this is controversial. Of course, they think we \nshould insist that our schools are at least as safe an environment as \nwe can make them. While the men and women are providing enormous \nservice to all of us--the sacrifice they make by wearing the uniform, \ncommitting to serving in our Armed Forces--don't we owe it to them to \nprovide the level of protection that we can provide to their kids? I \nthink we do.\n  In addition, it shouldn't be controversial because, substantively, \nthis isn't anything new.\n  Last year every Member of Congress but one--the vote was 523 to 1, \nthe House and the Senate--passed almost identical background check \nlegislation with respect to daycare workers who worked for a daycare \nthat got funding through the childcare and development block grant \nbill. In other words, we have already agreed. With 1 dissenting vote--\nout of 100 Senators and 435 House Members, there was 1 dissenting vote. \nEvery other Senator and House Member on both sides of the aisle agreed \nthat this level of background check security ought to be provided for \nvery young kids. Why wouldn't we do it for slightly older kids--the \nkids who are in primary and secondary schools--as well?\n\n[[Page S3407]]\n\n  Despite that, there is opposition. Just last week, the senior Senator \nfrom Illinois came to the floor to criticize my legislation. He stated: \n``This provision fails to provide adequate due process and civil rights \nprotections for innocent individuals.'' I want to address this because \nI couldn't disagree more.\n  First, it is important to note that our legislation--the legislation \nthat forbids the hiring of these pedophiles, people who have committed \nthese terrible crimes against kids--applies only if the applicant has \nbeen convicted of a crime. If you have been alleged or rumored--that is \nnot what the legislation contemplates; it is only someone who has been \nconvicted.\n  The last time I checked, our criminal justice system was loaded with \ndue process rights. In order to get a conviction, we have very \nelaborate processes that someone can avail themselves of, and of course \nthey always do. So nobody has been convicted without having had the \nopportunity for all of us to pay for their lawyer to defend them, for \ninstance, if they need to; to have a jury trial if they want to do \nthat; all the civil rights guarantees throughout the Constitution. It \nis all there. Due process--they have already had enormous due process \nor they wouldn't have been convicted.\n  But our legislation goes a step beyond that. What we do is we say \nthat the applicant is entitled to a copy of the background check, so \nthey get full disclosure of whatever was discovered, and the school \ndistrict must have an appeals process if it turns out the applicant is \ndenied, because we acknowledge that it is conceivable that there could \nbe a mistake. It could be like the wrong John Smith who is applying for \na job at a school. There could be an error of some sort. In the first \nplace, you have to have been convicted, and in the second place, you \nget to appeal. What more due process is necessary than that?\n  Well, I can tell you because we have had this debate before, and some \non the other side have suggested that they want something that I don't \neven think qualifies as due process. It is a totally different \ncategory, but they call it due process. What they want is a carve-out. \nThey want a minitrial. They want to give the convicted pedophile the \nopportunity to make the case for why an exception should be made in his \ncase. It is unbelievable to me. How do I know this? Because last year \n39 special interest groups sent a letter to the Senate asserting that \nit is unfair to deny even a convicted child molester a teaching job. \nThey wrote this. I am going to quote from the letter briefly. It says:\n\n       We believe that individuals who have been convicted of \n     crimes and have completed their sentences should not be \n     unnecessarily subjected to additional punishments because of \n     these convictions.\n\n  Let's think about what they are saying. What they are explicitly \nsaying is that a person could admit to and be convicted of raping a \nchild, serve a sentence, walk out of prison, go down the road to the \nlocal elementary school, apply for a job as a teacher, and they should \nbe hired. It is unbelievable.\n  I am not suggesting that the pedophile should never be eligible to do \nany work at all, never have any job. That is not what I am saying. But \nhow about we keep them away from young kids? Is that really \nunreasonable? That is all we are asking for. That is what we are \nsaying.\n  We have other colleagues who object to this notion, this legislative \napproach, on the grounds that it offends their sense of federalism. \nThey think we should leave it to the States to decide whether and to \nwhat extent the States and school districts will protect kids from \npredators. I strongly disagree with that for many reasons. We might \nwell have an extended debate about that, but let me just give two brief \nones.\n  First, I think we have an oversight responsibility. I think the \nPennsylvanians who send me to the Senate and know I am casting votes on \nhow we are going to spend their tax dollars expect that I am providing \nsome kind of oversight--such that, for instance, their tax dollars \naren't used to hire a pedophile in a school. That would not be a \ncontroversial notion with my constituents.\n  The second thing is that the folks who are hung up on the federalism \nissue insist that every State is free to do what it wants to do. They \nhave to be able to pass whatever laws--or not--as they see fit.\n  What about the military family who can't determine which State? They \ndon't get to pick the State in which they are based--not always. They \nare in a State. It is not their native State. They are assigned to that \nbase in a particular State, and they have to live with whatever the \nlaws are there.\n  Don't we agree that every child in America deserves to have \nprotection from these predators?\n  I do.\n  Our legislation doesn't go that far. I wish it did. We tried, and I \nam not going to give up. But can't we at least provide that security \nfor the children of our military families? That is what our legislation \ndoes do.\n  Again, I want to thank Chairman McCain. He has been a consistent \nadvocate for providing this level of protection to children. He was a \ncosponsor of my legislation that prohibited passing the trash. His \nsupport was essential in getting it passed last year, and I am really \nproud of and grateful to him for working with me to incorporate the \nlanguage of my legislation into our NDAA legislation.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues that it is past time to act on this. As \nI said, Senator Manchin and I have been pushing this for 2\\1/2\\ years, \nand in that time another 1,150 school employees have been arrested for \nsexual misconduct with the kids they are supposed to be taking care of.\n  Clearly, we are not doing enough. And we really need to ask \nourselves: How much bigger does that number have to get? How many more \nchildren have to have their childhoods ruined? How many families need \nto be torn apart before we are willing to pass this measure? I would \nargue that we have seen more than enough, the children of America have \nseen more than enough, and the children of the men and women who wear \nthe uniform of this country and who make the sacrifices to protect and \ndefend all of us absolutely deserve this protection.\n  So I hope we will pass this Defense authorization bill with this \nlanguage intact, and I once again express my appreciation to the \nchairman for putting it into the base text.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Remembering Muhammad Ali\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, over the weekend the world learned the \nsad news of the passing of Muhammad Ali. Ali was one of the preeminent \nathletes of the 20th century. His story was an American story. It is \none that touched people in every corner of the world. It is one that \nbegan in my hometown of Louisville. Louisville is where he grew up. \nLouisville is where he fought his first professional fight. Louisville \nis where the Muhammad Ali Center stands today. It is a memorial to his \nlegacy and to his life story. It is where mourners now lay flowers in \nhis memory.\n  As people around the world honor ``The Greatest,'' the spotlight \nshines bright upon his hometown. I wish to again add my condolences as \nwell. I wish to again recognize a legend from Louisville who was more \nthan just a boxer, he was an icon known for grace on his feet and power \nin his fists inside the ring and a great exuberance for life outside \nit.\n  Mr. President, after needless and inexplicable delay by colleagues \nacross the aisle, we have begun consideration of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act today and will work to pass it this week.\n  The NDAA authorizes funds aimed at meeting the combat-readiness needs \nof our armed services, maintaining our national security posture, and \nsupporting defense health care and benefits for servicemembers and \ntheir families. It is an important measure we consider each year. It is \nespecially critical today given the myriad of threats facing our \ncountry.\n  The next Commander in Chief, regardless of party, will take office \nfacing a number of security challenges--\n\n[[Page S3408]]\n\neverything from instability in Libya, Syria, and Yemen, to a \nbelligerent North Korea, to a newly aggressive Russia. It is imperative \nto do what we can now to better position our country to confront \nchallenges currently facing us and to better prepare for those yet to \ncome.\n  Ensuring military readiness and keeping Americans safe should be a \ntop priority for all of us, so I would encourage my colleagues to put \naside partisan politics and work together to bring this NDAA across the \nfinish line this week. We may pass the bill on Friday, we may pass it \nsooner, but we will pass it this week. So let's all work hard to do so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/06/senate-section/article/S3397-2"}, {"day": "06", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I am honored to recognize the Wyoming \nDental Association as it celebrates its 100th anniversary. This \nhistoric milestone marks the success of the organization's efforts to \nassist its members in their mission of achieving the highest level of \npatient care for Wyoming.\n  Life on the frontier posed many challenges for Wyoming's first \ndentists. Pioneer practitioners often traveled long distances through \nrugged terrain to treat their patients. Armed with rudimentary tools, \nincluding forceps, pedal-powered drills, and whiskey to kill the pain, \nthese circuit riders treated patients with little or no oversight. \nSeeing a need for standardization, the Wyoming Legislature created the \nWyoming Board of Dental Examiners, which required all practicing \ndentists to register with the State. In 1916, several licensed dentists \njoined to form the Wyoming Dental Association, an organization \ndedicated to supporting the State's dentists. From that day forward, \nthe association's members dedicated themselves toward advancing the \npractice of dentistry.\n  Thanks to extensive progress made in technology and medical care, \nmodern oral health care has dramatically improved. Today there are over \n500 licensed dentists in Wyoming. Our State's dentists are dedicated to \ntheir patients' health, not only providing dental care, but also \neducating the public on the importance of oral hygiene. Every dentist \nhas adopted a professional code of ethics and works to maintain the \nhighest standards of excellence.\n  The Wyoming Dental Association is a leader in promoting dental \nhygiene. Through its dedicated advocacy and leadership, the association \ncollaborates with the Wyoming Legislature, local government agencies, \nand nonprofit organizations to help the people of Wyoming. Their \nachievements are impressive.\n  In particular, dentists around the State volunteered hundreds of \nhours to complete Wyoming's oral health initiative, which was designed \nto gauge the overall dental health of residents. The initiative \nprovided stakeholders with valuable data which led to the development \nof strategies to improve education and access to care. Thanks to the \nWyoming Dental Association's participation in this crucial study, the \nState is advancing dental health care to new levels of success.\n  After 100 years, the Wyoming Dental Association is stronger than ever \nthanks to its incredible leadership. The dedicated efforts of the \nassociation's executive director, Diane Bouzis, and its current board \nof directors continue to improve the services its members receive. \nThank you to President Mike Shane, President-elect Dana Leroy, Vice \nPresident Lance Griggs, Secretary-Treasurer Deb Shevick, and ADA \ndelegates Rod Hill and Brad Kincheloe. We also acknowledge the hard \nwork of the State's district directors, including Lorraine Gallagher, \nBrian Cotant, Steve Harmon, Paul Dona, Aaron Taff, and Leslie Basse. \nThese incredible individuals serve the association and their patients \nwith great integrity.\n  The Wyoming Dental Association is a remarkable organization committed \nto improving dental health care in all of Wyoming's communities. I am \npleased to offer my sincere appreciation to the members of the Wyoming \nDental Association as they celebrate their centennial.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/06/senate-section/article/S3409-1"}, {"day": "06", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO CARL GULBRANDSEN\n\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Carl Gulbrandsen on \nhis retirement from the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation, or WARF. \nAfter 19 impressive years at the foundation, 16 years as managing \ndirector, Carl committed his career to ensuring the success of WARF and \nits mission to support, aid, and encourage UW-Madison research by \nprotecting its discoveries and licensing them for use around the world.\n  Carl's journey began when he enlisted in the military during the last \nyears of the Vietnam war. Carl was stationed at a medical post in \nGermany, leading him to later obtain a Ph.D. in physiology from the \nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison in 1978. That same year, he began law \nschool, as his medical background ignited an interest in the law and \nits impact on medical regulations.\n  After serving as a litigation lawyer at the firm of Ross and Stevens \nfor several years, Carl decided to expand his legal practice, taking \nthe patent law exam in 1985. Carl's first case secured a patent for \nvitamin D metabolism, a discovery made by Heinrich Schnoes and Hector \nDeLuca of UW-Madison's biochemistry department, who went on to become \nWARF's most prolific patent holder.\n  Guided by his academic background, Carl's patent litigation career \nflourished. Carl firmly believed in the ``Wisconsin Idea'': the \nscientific research and work done at the University of Wisconsin should \nbenefit the State as a whole. After a decade working in private \npractice, Carl joined WARF in 1997 as a legal adviser. In 2000, Carl \ntook over as managing director, determined to create a transparent \norganization known for its deep and broad ranging expertise. Over the \nlast 16 years as managing director, Carl's leadership has often called \nfor grace under fire. In 1998, Dr. James Thomson's breakthrough \nresearch on human embryonic stem cells was considered one of the \ndiscoveries of the century, while at the same time sparking controversy \nand debate over the ethics of stem cell use. Carl's leadership ensured \nWARF's success amidst controversy, allowing researchers to continue \ntheir important research. Today, Dr. Thomson's work continues through \nthe nonprofit WiCell Research Institute, which provides stem cell \nresources to more than 300 labs worldwide, assisting scientists in the \ndiscovery of new breakthroughs in stem cell applications.\n  Under Carl's direction, WARF achieved significant global impact and \ncontinues to give back to the UW community and the Wisconsin economy as \na whole. Since 2000, WARF's endowment has doubled to $2.86 billion, \nenabling it to gift $895 million to the UW-Madison, ensuring its \ncontinued success as a top research institution. Additionally, Carl \nhelped establish WiSys Technology Foundation to guarantee that the \nimpressive scientific advances at campuses throughout the UW System go \nbeyond campus laboratories and into the marketplace.\n  As his tenure as managing director comes to a close, Carl's work and \nexpertise has firmly established WARF as one of the Nation's most \nrespected scientific organizations. Under his leadership, WARF helped \nshape stem cell policy, brought forth new cancer therapies, and created \ncountless technologies that will improve and even save lives. Although \nI am sure he will be missed by colleagues and those whose lives he has \nimpacted, I am excited that he will have the opportunity to pursue \nother goals. I wish him, his wife, Mary, and their family well as they \nwrite the next chapter of their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/06/senate-section/article/S3409-2"}, {"day": "06", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3409-S3410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DR. JANIE DARR\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, today I honor Rogers School \nDistrict Superintendent Dr. Janie Darr, who will retire this month \nafter nearly five decades of commitment to education in the community. \nFor more than 40 years, Dr. Darr has served the Rogers School District, \nbeginning as an English teacher in 1967, before working her way up to \nadministrative assistant and eventually superintendent when chosen by \nthe school board in 1999.\n\n[[Page S3410]]\n\n  During her tenure with the school district, she has made sure that \nstudents come first. Rogers High School has been named as one of the \nbest high schools in the State and Nation by U.S. News and World Report \nunder the direction of Dr. Darr. She has directed the district in times \nof fast growth and increased diversity. The Rogers School Board \nrecognized Dr. Darr's dedication to education by naming its newest \nelementary school in her honor. The Janie Darr Elementary School opened \nin 2014 and has the capacity to serve up to 750 students.\n  Dr. Darr has a special way of treating everyone with dignity and \nrespect, so it is no surprise that public service is a centerpiece of \nher life. If serving as superintendent isn't enough to keep her busy, \nher commitment to the community and the State keep her active in a \nvariety of other roles, including service on the Arvest Bank Board, \nUnited Way, Ozark Guidance Center, and Rogers Historical Museum boards. \nShe is an ex-officio member of the Rogers Public Education Foundation \nboard and a lifetime member of the parent-teacher association. She is \nan active member of Central United Methodist Church in Rogers, where \nshe is a trustee and former staff-parish relations and education \ncommittee chair, as well as a former Sunday school teacher and youth \ncounselor.\n  I congratulate Dr. Janie Darr for her outstanding commitment to \neducation, the Rogers School District, and our community as a whole. As \na member of the Rogers School Board for many years, I had the privilege \nof working closely with Dr. Darr and have greatly appreciated her \nfriendship and leadership. I enjoyed supporting her efforts to continue \nmaking the school district a positive experience for students, faculty, \nand staff. I wish her continued success in retirement. Rogers School \nDistrict is much improved thanks to the dedicated leadership of Dr. \nDarr.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/06/senate-section/article/S3409-3"}, {"day": "06", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECOGNIZING FORT SMITH NATIONAL HISTORIC SITE\n\n Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, in honor of the National Park \nService's 100th birthday year, I want to recognize Fort Smith National \nHistoric Site in Fort Smith, AR. Situated along the Arkansas River, \nFort Smith was officially recognized as a historic site in 1961 to \npreserve two frontier forts from the 19th century, as well as the \ncourtroom of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of \nArkansas. These sites are a wonderful representation of the history of \nthe Arkansas River Valley.\n  The first fort was first established to resolve disputes between the \nOsage and Cherokee in 1817. But as frontier settlement continued \nfurther west, the fort was eventually abandoned in 1824. The remnants \nof its foundation were later uncovered by archeologists and are visible \non site today.\n  The second fort was built in 1838, just 2 years after Arkansas \nofficially became a State. It served a variety of functions for over \nthree decades. Two of the fort's original buildings are still intact \ntoday and are open for tours. Visitors to Fort Smith can make a stop in \nthe fort's original commissary building and experience firsthand what \nit was like when it functioned as supply warehouse for provisions \nwaiting to be sent to troops out west.\n  Fort Smith is also home to the jail and courtroom where the infamous \nJudge Isaac Parker--also called the hanging judge for the number of \ndeath sentences he handed down--presided for two decades in the late \n19th century. Although jurisdiction of this particular court has since \nshifted, at the time, Judge Parker and the court wielded vast influence \nover an expansive area.\n  The Fort Smith National Historic Site is just another example of \nArkansas' rich American history. I encourage Arkansans and all \nAmericans to stop by and learn about some of the prominent figures and \ncharacters in 19th century Arkansas--including U.S. marshals, outlaws, \nand judges. In honor of the National Park Service's 100th year, I \nencourage you to find your park.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/06/senate-section/article/S3410-1"}, {"day": "06", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/06/senate-section/article/S3410-2"}, {"day": "06", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/06/senate-section/article/S3410-3"}, {"day": "06", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3410-S3411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 6, 2015, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on May 27, 2016, during the adjournment of \nthe Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker has signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       S. 184.

MEMBERS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT POSSIBLE\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN (for herself, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Markey, Ms. Ayotte, Mr. \nCoons, and Mr. Kirk) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 482\n\n       Whereas in July 2012, a Hizballah terror attack in Bulgaria \n     killed 5 Israeli tourists and 1 Bulgarian;\n       Whereas in March 2013, a Hizballah operative in Cyprus was \n     convicted of planning terror attacks after admitting that he \n     was a member of Hizballah, had been trained in the use of \n     weapons, and used a dual Swedish-Lebanese passport to travel \n     around Europe on missions as a courier and scout for \n     Hizballah;\n       Whereas although that Hizballah operative was convicted on \n     criminal-related charges, authorities had to drop terrorism \n     charges against him because Hizballah was not listed as a \n     terrorist organization;\n       Whereas in July 2013, the European Union (referred to in \n     this Resolution as the ``EU'') designated Hizballah's so-\n     called ``military wing'', but not the organization as a \n     whole, as a terrorist organization;\n       Whereas the EU designation of Hizballah's military wing has \n     enabled substantial and important cooperation between United \n     States and European authorities aimed at uncovering and \n     thwarting Hizballah's international criminal activities, such \n     as drug trafficking and money laundering, the proceeds of \n     which are used to purchase weapons and advance Hizballah's \n     terrorist aims;\n       Whereas the Hizballah International Financing Prevention \n     Act of 2015 (Public Law 114-102) was signed into law in \n     December 2015, broadening financial sector sanctions against \n     Hizballah to compel foreign financial institutions to refrain \n     from supporting the terrorist group;\n       Whereas in February 2016, the United States Drug \n     Enforcement Administration and U.S. Customs and Border \n     Protection partnered with counterparts in France, Germany, \n     Italy, and Belgium to arrest top leaders of the European cell \n     of Hizballah's External Security Organization Business \n     Affairs Component, which engages in international money \n     laundering and drug trafficking to support Hizballah's terror \n     activities;\n       Whereas for many years, Iran and Syria have been the prime \n     sponsors of Hizballah, by harboring, financing, training, and \n     arming the terrorist group;\n       Whereas according to the Department of State's Country \n     Reports on Terrorism, Iran has armed Hizballah, provided \n     hundreds of millions of dollars in support of Hizballah, and \n     trained thousands of its fighters;\n       Whereas Hizballah now has an arsenal of approximately \n     150,000 missiles and rockets, many of which can reach deep \n     into Israel, at a time when Hizballah Secretary General \n     Hassan Nasrallah is threatening to invade Galilee or attack \n     civilian Israeli chemical plants to generate mass \n     destruction;\n       Whereas while the EU confronts the migrant crisis sparked \n     by violence in Syria, 6,000 to 8,000 Hizballah fighters have \n     been on the ground in Syria aiding the Assad regime in its \n     slaughter of innocent Syrians;\n       Whereas the Lebanese Armed Forces, the legitimate security \n     establishment of the country as set forth in United Nations \n     Security Council Resolution 1701 (2006), are struggling to \n     control the flow of weapons and Hizballah fighters at its \n     borders;\n       Whereas Hizballah trains and provides weapons for armed \n     groups in Iraq and Yemen, further destabilizing the region \n     and perpetuating violence in those countries;\n       Whereas in October 2012, Hizballah Deputy Secretary General \n     Naim Qassem stated that Hizballah does not ``have a military \n     wing and a political one . . . Every element of Hizballah, \n     from commanders to members as well as our various \n     capabilities, are in the service of the resistance'';\n       Whereas the United States, Canada, Israel, and the \n     Netherlands have designated Hizballah in its entirety as a \n     terrorist organization, while Australia and New Zealand have \n     applied the designation to the organization's military wing;\n       Whereas in March 2016, the Gulf Cooperation Council, \n     composed of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and \n     the United Arab Emirates, formally branded Hizballah, in its \n     entirety, a terrorist organization, and the League of Arab \n     States shortly thereafter adopted the same designation; and\n       Whereas in April 2016, the Organization of Islamic \n     Cooperation, denounced Hizballah's ``terrorist acts'' in the \n     Middle East:\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses appreciation to the EU for the progress made \n     in countering Hizballah since the EU designated Hizballah's \n     military wing as a terrorist organization;\n       (2) expresses support for the continued, increased \n     cooperation between the United States and the EU in thwarting \n     Hizballah's criminal and terrorist activities; and\n       (3) urges the EU to designate Hizballah in its entirety as \n     a terrorist organization and increase pressure on the group, \n     including through--\n       (A) facilitating better cross-border cooperation between EU \n     members in combating Hizballah;\n       (B) issuing arrest warrants against members and active \n     supporters of Hizballah;\n       (C) freezing Hizballah's assets in Europe, including those \n     masquerading as charities; and\n       (D) prohibiting fundraising activities in support of \n     Hizballah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/06/senate-section/article/S3414-1"}, {"day": "06", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3414-S3415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 483--DESIGNATING JUNE 20, 2016, AS ``AMERICAN EAGLE \n DAY'' AND CELEBRATING THE RECOVERY AND RESTORATION OF THE BALD EAGLE, \n                THE NATIONAL SYMBOL OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER (for himself and Mr. Durbin) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 483\n\n       Whereas the bald eagle was chosen as the central image of \n     the Great Seal of the United States on June 20, 1782, by the \n     Founding Fathers at the Congress of the Confederation;\n       Whereas the bald eagle is widely known as the living \n     national symbol of the United States and for many generations \n     has represented values such as--\n       (1) freedom;\n       (2) democracy;\n       (3) courage;\n       (4) strength;\n       (5) spirit;\n       (6) independence;\n       (7) justice; and\n       (8) excellence;\n       Whereas the bald eagle is unique only to North America and \n     cannot be found naturally in any other part of the world, \n     which was one of the primary reasons the Founding Fathers \n     selected the bald eagle to symbolize the Government of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the bald eagle is the central image used in the \n     official logos of many branches and departments of the \n     Federal Government, including--\n       (1) the Office of the President;\n       (2) Congress;\n       (3) the Supreme Court;\n       (4) the Department of Defense;\n       (5) the Department of the Treasury;\n       (6) the Department of Justice;\n       (7) the Department of State;\n       (8) the Department of Commerce;\n       (9) the Department of Homeland Security;\n       (10) the Department of Veterans Affairs;\n       (11) the Department of Labor;\n       (12) the Department of Health and Human Services;\n       (13) the Department of Energy;\n       (14) the Department of Housing and Urban Development;\n       (15) the Central Intelligence Agency; and\n       (16) the United States Postal Service;\n       Whereas the bald eagle is an inspiring symbol of the spirit \n     of freedom and the sovereignty of the United States;\n       Whereas the image and symbolism of the bald eagle has \n     played a significant role in art, music, literature, \n     architecture, commerce, education, and culture in the United \n     States, and on United States stamps, currency, and coinage;\n       Whereas the bald eagle was once endangered and facing \n     possible extinction in the lower 48 States, but has made a \n     gradual and encouraging comeback to the lands, waterways, and \n     skies of the United States;\n       Whereas the dramatic recovery of the national bird of the \n     United States is an endangered species success story and an \n     inspirational example to other environmental, natural \n     resource, and wildlife conservation efforts worldwide;\n       Whereas, in 1940, noting that the species was ``threatened \n     with extinction'', Congress passed the Bald Eagle Protection \n     Act (16 U.S.C. 668 et seq.), which prohibited killing, \n     selling, or possessing the species, and a 1962 amendment \n     expanded protection to the golden eagle, thereby establishing \n     the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act;\n       Whereas, by 1963, there were only an estimated 417 nesting \n     pairs of bald eagles remaining in the lower 48 States, with \n     loss of habitat, poaching, and the use of pesticides and \n     other environmental contaminants contributing to the near \n     demise of the national bird of the United States;\n       Whereas the bald eagle was officially declared an \n     endangered species in 1967 under the Endangered Species \n     Preservation Act of 1966 (Public Law 89-669; 80 Stat. 926) in \n     all areas of the United States south of the 40th parallel due \n     to the dramatic decline in the population of the bald eagle \n     in the lower 48 States;\n\n[[Page S3415]]\n\n       Whereas the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) \n     was signed into law in 1973 and, in 1978, the bald eagle was \n     listed as ``endangered'' throughout the lower 48 states, \n     except in Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, Washington, and \n     Wisconsin, where it was designated as ``threatened'';\n       Whereas, in July 1995, the United States Fish and Wildlife \n     Service announced that bald eagles in the lower 48 States had \n     recovered to the point where populations of bald eagles \n     previously considered ``endangered'' were now considered \n     ``threatened'';\n       Whereas, by 2007, bald eagles residing in the lower 48 \n     States had rebounded to approximately 11,000 pairs;\n       Whereas the United States Department of the Interior and \n     the United States Fish and Wildlife Service removed the bald \n     eagle from Endangered Species Act protection on June 28, \n     2007, but the species continues to be protected under the \n     Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act of 1940 (16 U.S.C. 668 \n     et seq.), the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 (16 U.S.C. \n     703 et seq.), and the Lacey Act and the amendments thereto \n     (16 U.S.C. 3371 et seq.);\n       Whereas the trained, educational bald eagle ``Challenger'' \n     of the American Eagle Foundation in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, \n     was invited by the United States Department of the Interior \n     to perform a free-flight demonstration during the official \n     bald eagle delisting ceremony held at the Jefferson Memorial \n     in Washington, DC;\n       Whereas experts and population growth charts estimate that \n     the bald eagle population could reach 15,000 pairs, even \n     though a physical count has not been conducted by State and \n     Federal wildlife agencies since 2007;\n       Whereas caring and concerned agencies, corporations, \n     organizations, and people of the United States representing \n     the Federal, State, and private sectors passionately and \n     resourcefully banded together, determined to save and protect \n     the national bird of the United States;\n       Whereas the recovery of the bald eagle population in the \n     United States was largely accomplished due to the dedicated \n     and vigilant efforts of Federal and State wildlife agencies \n     and non-profit organizations, such as the American Eagle \n     Foundation, through public education, captive breeding and \n     release programs, hacking and release programs, and the \n     translocation of bald eagles from places in the United States \n     with dense bald eagle populations to suitable locations in \n     the lower 48 States which had suffered a decrease in bald \n     eagle populations;\n       Whereas various non-profit organizations, such as the \n     Southeastern Raptor Center at Auburn University in the State \n     of Alabama, contribute to the continuing recovery of the bald \n     eagle through rehabilitation and educational efforts;\n       Whereas the bald eagle might have been lost permanently if \n     not for dedicated conservation efforts and strict protection \n     laws like the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 \n     et seq.), the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act of 1940 \n     (16 U.S.C. 668 et seq.), the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of \n     1918 (16 U.S.C. 703 et seq.), and the Lacey Act and the \n     amendments thereto (16 U.S.C. 3371 et seq.); and\n       Whereas the sustained recovery of the bald eagle population \n     will require the continuation of recovery, management, \n     education, and public awareness programs to ensure that the \n     population numbers and habitat of the bald eagle will remain \n     healthy and secure for generations to come: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates June 20, 2016, as ``American Eagle Day'';\n       (2) applauds the issuance of bald eagle commemorative coins \n     by the Secretary of the Treasury as a way to generate \n     critical funds for the protection of the bald eagle; and\n       (3) encourages--\n       (A) educational entities, organizations, businesses, \n     conservation groups, and government agencies with a shared \n     interest in conserving endangered species to collaborate and \n     develop educational tools for use in the public schools of \n     the United States; and\n       (B) the people of the United States to observe American \n     Eagle Day with appropriate ceremonies and other activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/06/senate-section/article/S3414-2"}, {"day": "06", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 484--AUTHORIZING THE TAKING OF A PHOTOGRAPH IN THE \n                             SENATE CHAMBER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Mr. Reid) submitted the following \nresolution;

      (A) a certification regarding whether the need exists for \n     the closure or realignment of additional military \n     installations; and\n       (B) if such need exists--\n       (i) a certification that the additional round of closures \n     and realignments would result in annual net savings for each \n     of the military departments beginning not later than six \n     years following the commencement of such closures and \n     realignments; and\n       (ii) a certification that the additional round of closures \n     and realignments will have the primary objective of \n     eliminating excess infrastructure capacity within the \n     Department of Defense and reconfiguring the infrastructure of \n     the Department to maximize efficiency and reduce costs.\n       (2) If the Secretary does not include the certifications \n     referred to in paragraph (1) as part of the submission of the \n     force-structure plan and infrastructure inventory prepared \n     under subsection (a), the President may not commence a round \n     for the selection of military installations for closure and \n     realignment under this subtitle in the year following \n

need for the closure or realignment of additional \n     military installations.\n       (2) The Comptroller General shall submit to Congress the \n     evaluation prepared under paragraph (1) not later than 60 \n     days after the date on which the force-structure plan and \n     infrastructure inventory are submitted to Congress.\n       (d) Final Selection Criteria.--(1) The final criteria to be \n     used by the Secretary in making recommendations for the \n     closure or realignment of military installations in the \n     United States under this subtitle shall be the military value \n     criteria specified in paragraph (2) and additional criteria \n     specified in paragraph (3).\n       (2) The military value criteria specified in this paragraph \n     are as follows:\n       (A) The current and future mission capabilities and the \n     impact on operational readiness of the total force of the \n     Department of Defense, including the impact on joint \n     warfighting, training, and readiness.\n       (B) The availability and condition of land, facilities, and \n     associated airspace (including training areas suitable for \n     maneuver by ground, naval, or air

operations and \n     training.\n       (D) The cost of operations and the manpower implications.\n       (3) The additional criteria that the Secretary shall use in \n     making recommendations for the closure or realignment of \n     military installations in the United States under this \n     subtitle are as follows:\n       (A) The extent and timing of potential costs and savings, \n     including the number of years, beginning with the date of \n     completion of the closure or realignment, for the savings to \n     exceed the costs.\n       (B) The economic impact on existing communities in the \n     vicinity of military installations.\n       (C) The ability of the infrastructure of both the existing \n     and potential receiving communities to support forces, \n     missions, and personnel.\n       (D) The environmental impact, including the impact of costs \n     related to potential environmental restoration, waste \n     management, and environmental compliance activities.\n       (e) Priority Given to Military Value.--The Secretary shall \n     give priority consideration to the military value criteria \n     specified in subsection (d)(2) in the

public-private \n     contracts, guarantees, the costs of any other activity of the \n     Department of Defense or another Federal agency that may be \n     required to assume responsibility for activities at the \n     military installation, and such other factors as the \n     Secretary determines as contributing to the cost of a closure \n     or realignment.\n       (g) Emphasis Given to Savings.--(1) Subject to subsection \n     (e), the Secretary shall emphasize recommendations for the \n     closure or realignment of a military installation that yield \n     net savings within five years of completing such closure or \n     realignment.\n       (2) The Secretary shall not consider any recommendation \n     that does not yield net savings within 20 years unless the \n     Secretary determines that the military value of such \n     recommendation supports or enhances a critical national \n     security interest of the United States.\n       (h) Relation to Other Materials.--Except as provided in \n     subsection (g), the final selection criteria specified in \n     subsection (d) shall be the only criteria to be used, along \n     with the force-structure plan and infrastructure inventory \n     referred to in subsection (a), in making recommendations for \n     the closure or realignment of military installations in the \n     United States under this subtitle.\n       (i) Department of Defense Recommendations.--(1) If the \n     Secretary makes the certifications required under subsection \n     (b), the Secretary shall, by no later than April 15,

later than 60 \n     days after the date on which the force-structure plan and \n     infrastructure inventory are submitted to Congress.\n       (d) Final Selection Criteria.--(1) The final criteria to be \n     used by the Secretary in making recommendations for the \n     closure or realignment of military installations in the \n     United States under this subtitle shall be the military value \n     criteria specified in paragraph (2) and additional criteria \n     specified in paragraph (3).\n       (2) The military value criteria specified in this paragraph \n     are as follows:\n       (A) The current and future mission capabilities and the \n     impact on operational readiness of the total force of the \n     Department of Defense, including the impact on joint \n     warfighting, training, and readiness.\n       (B) The availability and condition of land, facilities, and \n     associated airspace (including training areas suitable for \n     maneuver by ground, naval, or air forces throughout a \n     diversity of climate and terrain areas and staging areas for \n     the use of the Armed Forces in homeland defense missions) at \n     both existing and potential receiving

operations and \n     training.\n       (D) The cost of operations and the manpower implications.\n       (3) The additional criteria that the Secretary shall use in \n     making recommendations for the closure or realignment of \n     military installations in the United States under this \n     subtitle are as follows:\n       (A) The extent and timing of potential costs and savings, \n     including the number of years, beginning with the date of \n     completion of the closure or realignment, for the savings to \n     exceed the costs.\n       (B) The economic impact on existing communities in the \n     vicinity of military installations.\n       (C) The ability of the infrastructure of both the existing \n     and potential receiving communities to support forces, \n     missions, and personnel.\n       (D) The environmental impact, including the impact of costs \n     related to potential environmental restoration, waste \n     management, and environmental compliance activities.\n       (e) Priority Given to Military Value.--The Secretary shall \n     give priority consideration to the military value criteria \n     specified in subsection (d)(2) in the making of \n     recommendations for the closure or realignment of military \n     installations.\n       (f) Determining Costs.--When determining the costs \n     associated with a closure or realignment of a military \n     installation under this subtitle, the Secretary shall \n     consider the costs associated with military construction, \n     information technology, termination of public-private \n     contracts, guarantees, the costs of any other activity of the \n     Department of Defense or another Federal agency that may be \n     required to assume responsibility for

Savings.--(1) Subject to subsection \n     (e), the Secretary shall emphasize recommendations for the \n     closure or realignment of a military installation that yield \n     net savings within five years of completing such closure or \n     realignment.\n       (2) The Secretary shall not consider any recommendation \n     that does not yield net savings within 20 years unless the \n     Secretary determines that the military value of such \n     recommendation supports or enhances a critical national \n     security interest of the United States.\n       (h) Relation to Other Materials.--Except as provided in \n     subsection (g), the final selection criteria specified in \n     subsection (d) shall be the only criteria to be used, along \n     with the force-structure

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider en bloc the following \nnominations: Calendar Nos. 506 and 507 only, with no other executive \nbusiness in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the nominations en bloc.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read the nominations of \nJennifer Choe Groves, of Virginia, to be a Judge of the United States \nCourt of International Trade; and Gary Stephen Katzmann, of \nMassachusetts, to be a Judge of the United States Court of \nInternational Trade.\n  Thereupon, the Senate proceeded to consider the nominations en bloc.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate is considering the \nnominations of Gary Katzmann of Massachusetts and Jennifer Choe Groves \nof Virginia to fill judicial vacancies on the U.S. Court of \nInternational Trade. It is a step in the right direction that the \nmajority leader has agreed to take these nominations, but two other \nnominees to the Court of International Trade remain pending on the \nSenate floor. There is no good reason we cannot also confirm these \nnominees today.\n  I support the confirmation of both highly qualified nominees. Since \n2004, Gary Katzmann has served as an Associate Justice of the \nMassachusetts Appeals Court, the State's second highest court. Before \njoining the bench, Justice Katzmann served for over 20 years as an \nAssistant U.S. Attorney for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District \nof Massachusetts. In addition to his superb credentials, Justice \nKatzmann's family is part of our Nation's history of providing refuge \nto those fleeing persecution. Justice Katzmann's father and grandmother \ncame to the U.S. as refugees from Nazi Germany.\n  Jennifer Choe Groves has over 20 years of legal experience working in \nprivate practice and the government, having served in the New York \nDistrict Attorney's Office and in the Office of the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative. When confirmed, Ms. Groves will be the first Asian \nAmerican and Pacific Islander judge to serve on the U.S. Court of \nInternational Trade.\n  While the Senate is taking up these nominees today, the majority \nleader has allowed just 18 judicial nominees to be confirmed since \nRepublicans took over the Senate majority last year. Contrast this \ndismal record to the last 2 years of George W. Bush's administration, \nwhen Democrats were in control. At this same point in the Bush \nPresidency, Democrats confirmed 68 of President Bush's judicial \nnominees.\n  Senate Republicans have allowed only a trickle of judicial \nconfirmations despite the fact that, under their watch, judicial \nvacancies have nearly doubled from 43 to 85. Of these, 29 have been \ndesignated as judicial emergencies where caseloads are unmanageably \nhigh and the administration of justice is strained.\n  The harm that Republican obstruction has wrought on our Federal \ncourts extends from the trial courts across America to our Nation's \nhighest court. Today marks 82 days since Chief Judge Merrick Garland \nwas first nominated to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court. Under the \nSenate's recent timeline for considering judicial nominees, Chief Judge \nGarland should have received a hearing and a vote by now. Instead, \nSenate Republicans have continued as their party standard bearer has \nsaid to ``delay, delay, delay.'' This has resulted in a diminished \neight-member Supreme Court that has been repeatedly unable to serve its \nhighest function under our Constitution.\n  It is the Senate's duty to ensure our independent judiciary can fully \nfunction. I hope Senate Republicans understand that obligation and act \non Chief Judge Garland's nomination, as well as the 22 judicial \nnominations that will still remain languishing on the Senate floor \nafter today.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I know of no further debate on the \nnominations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Hearing no further debate, the question is, \nWill the Senate advise and consent to the Groves and Katzmann \nnominations en bloc?\n  The nominations were confirmed en bloc.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nmotions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, the \nPresident be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the \nSenate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/06/senate-section/article/S3470-2"}, {"day": "06", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
