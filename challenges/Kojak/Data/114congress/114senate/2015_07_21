This past weekend, Republican Presidential hopeful Donald \nTrump did what he did best: He said something dishonest and really \ndistasteful. In speaking about the senior Senator from Arizona, he \nmocked Senator John McCain, mocked his service in the Vietnam conflict. \nHe went so far as to say John McCain was not a war hero.\n  John McCain and I came to the House of Representatives the very same \nday, both new Members of the House. He was representing a district in \nArizona and I my district in Nevada. We are neighbors. We served \ntogether in the House. We came here to the Senate at the same time. He \nis one notch ahead of me in seniority in this body because the State of \nArizona has more people than Nevada. That is how seniority is \ndetermined, among other ways.\n  John McCain was a naval pilot and comes from a family who served our \ncountry admirably in the military for decades--his grandfather and his \nfather. On one of his first missions to Vietnam, John McCain was shot \ndown and badly injured--broken back and arms. He was very badly hurt. \nHe was placed in a Vietnamese concentration camp, where he spent almost \n6 years. About half of that time was in solitary confinement, and many \ndays and weeks of that were spent being punished, tortured, and \nrebreaking parts of his body that had been broken.\n  John McCain, to me, is a hero. He is a person who has represented \nthis country admirably in the Congress. He was a Republican nominee for \nPresident. America knows John McCain. I personally have some \ndisagreements on policy on an occasion or two with John McCain, but we \nhave never disagreed about our relationship. My relationship with \nSenator McCain is one where I have great admiration for him, for his \nstrength of character, and for his moral courage in Vietnam.\n  In the aftermath of these remarks about John McCain, Republicans have \nbeen falling all over themselves to criticize Donald Trump. But it \nmakes me wonder: Where were all these same Republicans when Mr. Trump \nslandered millions? It was only a month ago that Trump said:\n\n       When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their \n     best. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and \n     they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing \n     drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists.\n\n  That is his quote.\n  When Trump insulted the Senator from Arizona, a Member of his own \nparty, Republicans could not denounce him fast enough, but when Trump \ncalled immigrants ``rapists,'' there was nothing but silence--nothing \nbut silence. There is an ugly truth behind that silence, and it is \nthis: When it comes to immigration policy--and, frankly, most other \npolicy--there is no meaningful difference between the Republican Party \nand Donald Trump. Consider the facts on just this one issue. Trump \nrejects a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented. Instead, he \nfavors a system of merit that creates a road to legal status. He has \nnever ever said two sentences defining that.\n  We have heard before the same kind of talk from Republicans, those \nrunning for President--I think we have 16 of them now.\n  Jeb Bush rejects the pathway to citizenship. He claims to support a \npathway to legal status but ``not necessarily citizenship.''\n  Scott Walker rejects a pathway to citizenship. He said, ``If somebody \nwants to be a citizen, they need to go back to their country of \norigin.''\n  The junior Senator from Texas also rejects a pathway to citizenship. \nHe said, ``I think that it is likely that there could be some \nbipartisan solution to those who are here illegally if a path to \ncitizenship were taken off the table.''\n  Governor Chris Christie rejects a pathway to citizenship, too. He \nsaid it is ``an extreme way to go.''\n\n[[Page S5180]]\n\n  Trump wants to terminate President Obama's Executive actions on \nimmigration, tearing apart millions of families and deporting about \n800,000 DREAMers. We have heard that before, too.\n  Jeb Bush also wants to repeal President Obama's Executive actions. On \nFOX News, on the ``Hannity'' show, he said he would ``repeal Obama's \nexecutive amnesty.'' That is a quote.\n  The junior Senator from Texas also wants to terminate the President's \nExecutive actions. Here is what he said: ``If I am elected president, \nthe very first thing I intend to do on the first day is rescind every \nsingle unconstitutional or illegal executive action from President \nObama.''\n  Governor Chris Christie is actively opposing the President's \nExecutive actions. In fact, his State joined a lawsuit challenging \nPresident Obama's actions.\n  The junior Senator from Florida also rejects President Obama's \nExecutive actions that keep families together. Senator Rubio's \nspokesperson told one news outlet that ``immigration executive orders \nwon't be permanent policy under [a Rubio] administration.''\n  These are the facts. When it comes to immigration policy--and, as I \nmentioned, sadly, most other policy issues--there is no daylight \nbetween Donald Trump and the rest of the Republican field.\n  While the rest of the Republican Presidential hopefuls may not engage \nin the same repugnant rhetoric, make no mistake--they are all on the \nsame page as Donald Trump.\n  If I ask each Republican running for President ``Name one difference \nbetween your immigration policy and Trump's immigration policy,'' given \nrecent history, there will be a deafening silence.\n  When Trump insulted McCain, Republicans couldn't denounce him fast \nenough, but when Mr. Trump called millions of hard-working immigrants \nrapists and murderers, there was nothing but silence. Maybe this is \nbecause none of the Republicans running for President can name a single \nway in which they disagree with Trump's policies on immigration.\n  In the meantime, Democrats will continue to fight to pass \ncomprehensive immigration reform, just as we did more than 2 years ago. \nWe will continue to fight Republican piecemeal legislation that \ncriminalizes immigrant communities--whole communities--and we will \ncontinue to fight for families who are constantly being scapegoated by \ntoday's Republican Party.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/21/senate-section/article/S5180-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      MEASURE DISCHARGED AND PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S.J.

Mr. President, I believe that real, long-term economic \ngrowth is built from the middle out, not from the top down. Our \ngovernment, our economy, and our workplaces should work for all of our \nfamilies, not just the wealthiest few. But across the country today, \nmillions of workers are working harder than ever without basic overtime \nprotection.\n  That is why I am so proud to come to the floor today to express my \nstrong support for the Obama administration's new proposal to restore \novertime protections for millions of workers and families. Not only is \nthis the right thing to do, but it is good for our economy.\n  I wish to share a story of a man named Paul who lives in \nMassachusetts. As reported in the Boston Globe, Paul worked very hard \nat a discount retail store to provide for his family. Each week he was \nworking 72 hours, on average. On one particular stretch, he worked for \n40 days in a row without a single day off, but his employer didn't pay \nhim one extra dime for the work he did beyond 40 hours a week.\n  That is fundamentally unfair. And Paul, believe me, is not alone. \nThere are so many workers like him in States across the country, and \nthese workers feel as though they have been left behind in this \neconomic recovery. They need government policies on overtime \nprotections to catch up.\n  In 1938, Congress recognized the need to set a standard for the 40-\nhour workweek. By law, when workers put in more than 40 hours a week, \ntheir employers had to compensate them fairly with time-and-a-half pay. \nBut those protections have eroded over the past several years. In \ntoday's economy, many Americans feel as though they are working more \nand more for less and less pay, and in many cases, they are. A salaried \nworker can be asked to work 50 or 60 or 70 hours a week and never see a \ndime of overtime pay. One of the main reasons is because overtime rules \nare severely out of date.\n  Right now, if a worker earns just a little more than $23,000 a year, \nhe or she does not qualify for time-and-a-half pay. That salary \nthreshold is much too low today. In fact, the current salary level is \nless than the poverty threshold for a family of four. Workers should \nnot have to earn poverty wages to get guaranteed overtime protection. \nThat salary threshold has only been updated once since 1975.\n  Back in the mid-1970s, 62 percent of the American workforce was \ncovered by overtime rules. Today, just 8 percent of our salaried \nworkers have overtime protection, and big corporations have used these \noutdated overtime rules to their advantage. They force their employees \nto work overtime without paying them fair time-and-a-half pay. That, of \ncourse, is good for a big corporation's profit margin. But as the \nUnion-Bulletin in Walla Walla, WA, editorialized a few weeks back, \nthese workers are ``working, paying taxes, raising families, and often \nsuffering due to the long hours.''\n  But unlike so many of the challenges we face here, there is a \nsolution to this, and it doesn't require congressional action. Last \nweek, the Department of Labor proposed to raise the salary threshold \nfrom about $23,000, which is what it is today, to just over $50,000 a \nyear. That will restore overtime protections for millions of Americans.\n  This, by the way, is especially important for parents. Think about \nwhat this would mean for a working mom who right now works overtime \nwithout getting paid for it. By restoring this basic worker protection, \nshe can finally work a 40-hour workweek and spend more time with her \nkids. Or, if her employer asks her to work more than 40 hours a week, \nshe would have more money in her pocket to boost her family's economic \nsecurity. That is so important for strengthening our middle class \ntoday.\n  Now, I do want to keep working to improve the proposed rule. I \nbelieve the Department of Labor should also update what is known as the \nduties test. For workers who make more than the salary threshold but \nstill do what is called blue collar work, the duties test is designed \nto ensure that they get overtime protections. But today that duties \ntest is out of date.\n  Under the current law, big corporations can exploit the duties test \nto avoid paying their workers time-and-a-half, and I believe that needs \nto change. When workers put in more\n\n[[Page S5181]]\n\nthan 40 hours a week on the job, they should be paid fairly for it. \nThat is just the bottom line.\n  I have heard from some of my Republican colleagues that they do not \nwant to update overtime rules. But if the Republicans want to take away \nthis basic worker protection--basic worker protection--they are going \nto have to answer to millions of hard-working Americans who are putting \nin overtime without receiving a dime in extra pay. They can try, but I \nknow I and many others are going to be right here fighting back for the \nworkers and families we represent.\n  Boosting wages and expanding economic stability and security is good \nfor families, and it is good for our economy. And, by the way, that is \nexactly what we should be focused on here in Congress--to help grow our \neconomy from the middle out, not just the top down.\n  This isn't the only action we need to take to raise wages and expand \neconomic stability for our families today. In the coming weeks and \nmonths, I am going to be working closely with Senate Democrats to \ncontinue our efforts to raise the minimum wage, to expand access to \npaid sick leave and fair and predictable work schedules, and to ensure \nwomen get equal pay for equal work.\n  But restoring overtime protections is a critical part of our work to \nmake sure more families get much needed economic stability. Enacting \nthese policies would be strong steps in the right direction to bring \nback the American dream of economic security and a stable middle-class \nlife for millions of families.\n  For workers such as Paul, who just want fair pay for a fair day's \nwork, for the parents who have sacrificed family time for overtime and \nnot seen a dime in extra pay, and for families who are looking for some \nmuch needed economic security, I urge all of my colleagues to support \nrestoring overtime protections.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, we are going to be moving to the highway \nbill. In fact, we are going to have the motion to proceed today at 2:15 \np.m., and I think it is important that people realize the significance \nof this.\n  We do a lot of work around here that is not really critical. There \nare some issues that are. If you would like to read the Constitution \nsometime when you have nothing else to do, it will tell you that what \nwe are supposed to be doing are two things: defending America and roads \nand bridges. That is what it says in Article I, Section 8 of the \nConstitution. So anytime you are sitting around with nothing to do, you \nought to read it, and you will realize that what we are going to do at \n2:15 today is very significant.\n  Passing a long-term transportation reauthorization bill has been my \ntop priority since I resumed the office of the chairmanship of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. It is probably the second most \nimportant thing we do, second only to the Defense authorization bill.\n  In the first hearing we had in January, we had Secretary Foxx, the \nSecretary of Transportation, who is an outstanding Secretary. He is \njust as concerned about this as we are. Senator Boxer and I brought in \nSecretary Foxx as well as local government leaders to share the \nimportance of ongoing Federal and State partnerships in maintaining the \nmodern surface infrastructure system. Since that time, my committee has \nput forward a bipartisan bill called the DRIVE Act. It is significant, \nand it is not partisan. There is no such thing as a Democratic bridge \nor a Republican bridge or a Democratic road or a Republican road.\n  Historically, Republicans have been recognized as leading in this \narea, from way back in the days when President Lincoln spearheaded the \nTranscontinental Railroad; Teddy Roosevelt and the Panama Canal; and, \nof course, the Interstate Highway System, created by President \nEisenhower.\n  President Eisenhower recognized that weakened defense and interstate \ncommerce made our Nation vulnerable to the world. In 1952, when he \nproposed the Interstate Highway System, he commented that this was \nevery bit as much about defending America as it was about the economy \nand being able to transport commerce around the States. In laying out \nthe full interstate system, he envisioned it to be the physical \nbackbone of the economy, fueling the growth of our GDP, our cities, and \nthe competitiveness of our exports. This vision and certainty maximized \nthe economic and mobility benefits of the system. Businesses and \nindividuals knew that they could locate somewhere on the future \ninterstate system and be connected to not just the rest of the country \nbut the rest of the world.\n  This legacy system, which was built over 50 years ago, had a design \nlife of 50 years, and it has actually been over 60 years--close to 70 \nyears since it was built. We are beyond our warranty period, and we are \nin serious danger of eroding half a century of investments without \nproper maintenance, modernization, and reconstruction. We are on \nborrowed time with a system that is in full need of restoration. Our \nnational interstate system currently has a maintenance backlog of $185 \nbillion on about 47,000 miles of interstate, and that is just to bring \nit back to the design it was in 1956.\n  Maintaining Eisenhower's vision of economic opportunity and strength \nin defense requires a continued partnership between the Federal \nGovernment and the States, which is the hallmark of the DRIVE Act. Yet, \ndue to 33 short-term patches since 2005--I have to say this because \nthis is significant. We\n\n[[Page S5182]]\n\nshould be operating on a transportation reauthorization system all the \ntime. The last one we did was in 2005. I was the author of it, in fact. \nThat was a 5-year bill. Since that time, we have gone through some 30 \ndifferent short-term extensions. A short-term extension doesn't do any \ngood. A transportation reauthorization bill is needed in order to \naccomplish all the reforms that are necessary and to have time to \nhandle the major, large problems we have to deal with.\n  Passing a long-term bill is crucial to many aspects of day-to-day \nlife in America. More than 250 million vehicles and 18 billion tons--\nvalued at $17 trillion--in goods traverse across the country every \nyear. Yet every day 20,000 miles of our highways slow below the posted \nspeed limits or experience stop-and-go conditions. The National Highway \nSystem is only 5.5 percent of the Nation's total roads, but it carries \n55 percent of all vehicle traffic and 97 percent of the truck-borne \nfreight. We are talking about 97 percent of the freight on only 5 \npercent of the highways.\n  Congress just passed a 2-month extension. Now we have a \nresponsibility to pass a long-term bill.\n  The highway trust fund currently needs $15 billion a year to maintain \nthe current spending. When we started out with the highway trust fund, \nthat was a percentage every year. When someone would drive up and pay a \ntax when buying gas, that was supposed to be for taking care of the \nhighways--and it did.\n  I can remember when I was serving in the House. The biggest problem \nwe had at that time was we had too much money in the highway trust \nfund. We had more than we needed. I remember when President Clinton \ncame in. He wanted to rob the highway trust fund for all of his \nprograms. He got by with it for a while. That is not the problem \nanymore. The problem now is there is not enough money.\n  The situation has changed. People are not using as much fuel. So we \nhave fallen short by $15 billion a year of having the amount of money \nnecessary to continue today's spending level. That is $15 billion a \nyear. This is a 6-year bill. That means about $90 billion is needed in \nexcess of the amount of money, revenue, that is derived from the \nhighway trust fund.\n  The DRIVE Act--that is what we call this--will put America back on \nthe map as the best place to do business. The DRIVE Act has several key \ncomponents that position America's transportation system to support our \ngrowing economy. It prioritizes funding for core transportation formula \nprograms to provide States and local governments with a strong Federal \npartner. It prioritizes the Interstate Highway System, that national \nhighway system, and the bridges at risk for funding shortfalls.\n  It creates a new multibillion-dollar-per-year freight program to help \nStates deliver projects and promotes the safe and efficient \ntransportation of goods. It targets funds for major projects in the \ncommunity, such as shown right here. This is a picture of the Brent \nSpence Bridge I have in the Chamber. This goes from Kentucky to Ohio \nand actually takes transportation also to Indiana. This is a very old \nbridge. You can see it is going to have to be replaced.\n  These are the huge things you cannot do with short-term extensions. \nYou are going to have to have a major bill, such as the one we are \nhaving right now.\n  Lastly, the DRIVE Act provides greater efficiency in the project \ndelivery process, reforms that put DOT in the driver's seat during the \nNEPA process by requiring agencies to bring all the issues to the \ntable, keeping them under a deadline, and eliminating duplication.\n  One of the problems we have with the environmental requirements is \nthey end up delaying projects. So this bill gives exceptions. Let me \nsay that I was very proud of Senator Boxer. Senator Boxer is a very \nproud liberal. I am a very proud conservative. One of the few things we \nagree on is the highway bill. It does require some changes that allow \nthem to go ahead and keep working in spite of some of the NEPA \nrequirements or the environmental requirements. This gives bridge \nprojects special consideration, with new exemptions from section 4(f), \nthe historic property reviews for concrete and steel bridges--a new \nexemption from the Migratory Bird Treaty Act for bridges in serious \ncondition.\n  Now, this sounds kind of off the wall, but one of the problems is the \nswallows. The swallows go in there and they block--they nest in there. \nSo we are supposed to be repairing bridges. The swallow is not an \nendangered species. It is not listed, but the Migratory Bird Treaty Act \ndoes give them protection, and this waives that in the case of bridge \nconstruction. It also enforces greater transparency for Federal funds \nto show the taxpayers where the money is being spent.\n  This is just a brief overview of the bill. As the DRIVE Act \nprogresses on the floor, I intend to address the significance of each \nprogram in more detail. The most important point I must address about \nthe DRIVE Act is that our bill sets funding levels for the next 6 \nyears.\n  There is, at the very least, what the Federal Government should \nprovide, so States, local officials, and the construction industry can \ngear up for the large $500 million to $2 billion major highway projects \nand bridge projects so we can get them off the ground. They have to get \nready for it. That is what this bill does. Thousands of projects across \nthe Nation are currently in jeopardy, and construction will come to a \nhalt unless legislation becomes a reality.\n  Future projects like--let's go back. You saw already the Brent Spence \nBridge in Kentucky. There is also the $2.6 billion Mobile River Bridge \nin Alabama. This is a projection of what it will look like. This is as \nit is today. This would be impossible without something like a 6-year \nbill. In DC, the Memorial Bridge is literally crumbling into the \nPotomac. People do not understand what happens to these bridges. You \ncan see--in our case in Oklahoma, we had a bridge over I-35. In the \nyear 2005, as a part of that bill, that legislation, we were able to \nrepair it. In 2004, right before that took place, one of the chunks \ncame off--just like you are seeing here on the bridge--and actually \nkilled a young lady who was driving under it with her three children. \nThat is how serious this is. This is the Arlington Memorial Bridge. It \nwas built in 1932. Something has to be done with that. We will be able \nto do projects like this.\n  More than just a small part of the economic success enjoyed by the \nUnited States over the past 50 years has been the Interstate System. \nToday, we literally sit at the crossroads of its future. The solution \nis urgent. This is why Senator Boxer and I are bringing the DRIVE Act \nto the Senate floor as a solution. It will ensure that States have the \ntools and the certainty to make the necessary new investments to \nrebuild Eisenhower's vision, to fight growing congestion, to maintain \nthe mobility of goods and services necessary to keep the economy going. \nBy passing the DRIVE Act, Congress will be able to take pave the way \nfor the next 50 years of American excellence in infrastructure.\n  I have to say this. The importance of this is that the only \nalternative is to have short-term extensions. I am talking about 1- and \n2-month extensions, of which you cannot organize your labor. The cost \nof that--and by the way, I say this to my conservative friends--they \nwill be friends, and I can say this, since I have been ranked as the \nmost conservative Member of this body many times--that the conservative \nposition is not to oppose this massive highway bill that we are going \nto have but to oppose the short-term extensions. It costs about 30 \npercent more for a short-term extension than it does for a highway \nreauthorization bill. That is why this is so important.\n  Later on, I am going to go over many of the other bridges and \nstructures around that are going to have to be addressed. In the \nmeantime, this is something we are supposed to do. I kind of will end \nup where we started off; that is, there is an old document that nobody \nreads anymore called the Constitution. You go back and read that, you \nwill find out what we in this body are supposed to be doing. It is \ndefending America and it is providing bridges and roads.\n  So as we progress on this, there will not be time to go into any more \ndetail now because we have Members wanting to come down and use both \nthe Republican and Democratic time between\n\n[[Page S5183]]\n\nnow and the noon hour, but at 2:15 we are going to have a motion we \nwill be voting on to move to the consideration of this bill. It doesn't \nsay you have to be for it or against it or you want to change it.\n  If you want to have amendments, you have to get to the bill before \nyou can have amendments. So a motion-to-proceed vote will take place at \n2:15. Now, I want to tell all of the Members who are out there that if \nyou have amendments--we are going to try to knock this thing out in 2 \nweeks. We are going to be down here talking about it for 2 weeks. But \nif you have amendments, if you want a chance to offer your amendments, \nyou can offer them, but bring them down, file your amendments. If you \ndo not do that, we will pass a deadline and you will not be able to do \nthat. So I encourage our Members to do that. I look forward to the next \n2 weeks of discussing and passing the second most significant bill we \nwill consider this year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to again bring \nup a very important issue. It is important because it impacts a major \npart of our lives, a major law that Congress passed several years ago. \nIt is important because it goes to a fundamental principle--what should \nbe a fundamental principle of American democracy--that what Washington \npasses for the rest of the country it should live with itself. I am \ntalking about the Washington exemption from ObamaCare and my effort, \nwith others, to end that double standard.\n  As the Presiding Officer remembers, during the ObamaCare debate \nseveral years ago, this issue came up. It came up in the context of a \nfloor amendment. It was an important floor amendment, one of the very \nfew that conservatives in the Senate passed on the Senate floor.\n  That amendment to the ObamaCare bill said that all Members of \nCongress and our staff would get our health care through the so-called \nObamaCare exchange, just as millions of other Americans would under \nthis plan--no special rules, no special treatment, no special exemption \nor special subsidy. That was important to say that Congress would live \nunder whatever law passed for the rest of America, and that amendment \nwas passed on the Senate floor. It became part of the broader bill, and \nit was eventually passed into law. Obviously, as you know, I opposed--\nstrongly opposed--and continue to oppose the ObamaCare bill and the \nlaw, but that amendment was made a part of it.\n  Well, after it was passed into law, it was sort of one of those cases \nof which Nancy Pelosi said that we have to pass the law to figure out \nwhat is in it. After the fact, lots of folks on Capitol Hill in \nWashington started reading the law more carefully, read that provision, \nand said: Oh, you know what. How are we going to deal with this? \nSurely, surely we aren't going to be subjected to the ObamaCare \nexchanges the same as millions upon millions of other Americans--even \nthough that is exactly what the statute said.\n  Well, at that point a very determined lobbying campaign got under \nway--a lobbying campaign of many Members on Capitol Hill--of the \nPresident. And the campaign was simple. People rushed to the \nadministration, rushed to President Obama and said: Oh, you need to \nchange this. We can't live with the statute and the significant section \nof the statute that says all Members of Congress need to go to the \nexchange for their health insurance, just as millions of other \nAmericans do.\n  Sure enough, after months of that very determined and, sadly, \nbipartisan lobbying campaign, President Obama issued one of his \ncountless Executive orders and edicts to essentially change, with the \nstroke of his pen, contrary to statute, a significant part of the \nObamaCare statute.\n  He has done that dozens--if not hundreds--of times, and this is one \nsignificant example of that. He changed what the statute said and took \na lot of the sting out of that provision of the law for Members of \nCongress.\n  Through an OPM rule, he said two things. First, Members of Congress, \nwhen you go to the exchange, which is mandated, don't worry; you are \ngoing to have a big taxpayer-funded subsidy follow you to the \nexchange--unavailable to every other American at our income level and \ncompletely unique to Members of Congress. No other American going to \nthe ObamaCare exchanges enjoys this. But out of thin air, we are going \nto give you a big, taxpayer-funded subsidy that is nowhere in the \nstatute.\n  Then the second significant thing President Obama did through that \nOPM rule was to say this: Members of Congress, this doesn't have to \napply to your staff even though it says it does. You can designate \nwhomever you want on your staff as ``nonofficial'' and they don't have \nto go to the ObamaCare exchange at all.\n  Well, virtually all of my Republican colleagues regularly come to the \nfloor and rightly complain about President Obama changing statutory law \nwith the stroke of his pen, acting beyond his authority. This is a \ncrystal-clear example of that. If we complain about it in other \ncontext, I think we should speak up and complain about it even when it \nbenefits us. So that is what I am doing.\n  We should not stand for this Washington exemption from ObamaCare. We \nshould not stand for this complete, complete double standard. We should \ninsist that we live by that clear language of the ObamaCare statute so \nthat every Member of Congress gets his or her health care on the so-\ncalled ObamaCare exchange, just as millions of other Americans do--no \nexemption, no special subsidy, and no special treatment in any way, \nshape or form.\n  I have been fighting since that OPM rule to make sure we do exactly \nthat. There will be a floor amendment this week to pursue that end, and \nI urge my colleagues to do the right thing, to support that important \nfloor amendment. It is important to do that for two reasons--one, \nfocused on principle and one focused on real practicality.\n  First, as to the principle, I think it is a basic fundamental \nprinciple of American democracy--it certainly should be--that what \nWashington passes on the rest of the country it lives with itself. That \nshould be a fundamental principle of American democracy.\n  So my legislation, the No Exemption for Washington from Obamacare \nAct, the floor amendment which embodies exactly that legislation, would \nsay that every Member of Congress, the President, the Vice President, \nand their political appointees get their health care from the ObamaCare \nexchanges just like millions of other Americans--no special exemption, \nno special subsidy, no special treatment, no special insider deal.\n  The second reason we should support that is a lot more practical, and \nthat is that when you make the cook eat his own cooking, it often \nimproves dramatically. When you force the chef to have every meal out \nof his own kitchen, the product often improves dramatically.\n  So that is what I want to do in a simple, straightforward way, \nabiding by the clear language of the ObamaCare statute itself. All of \nofficial Washington--every Member of Congress, the President, the Vice \nPresident, and all of their political appointees--should have to go to \nthe exchanges for their health care, just like millions of other \nAmericans who have to as their fallback option. And we should do it in \nthe same way--no special exemption, no special subsidy, no special \ntreatment, and no special insider deal.\n  It is important we say this, and it is important we do it. We have an \nopportunity do it on the floor as we debate the bill before us.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important floor amendment and to \nlend support to the free-standing bill that I have introduced.\n  As I travel to Louisiana, I have regular townhall meetings, and I \nhave regular telephone townhalls when I am stuck here in Washington and \nvoting. Probably, the biggest single complaint I hear that really and \nrightly gets under the skin of my fellow Louisiana citizens goes to the \nheart of this discussion.\n\n[[Page S5184]]\n\n  Why the heck does everybody in Washington think they are above us? \nWhy do they pass laws and never have to live under them themselves?\n  Well, this is a crystal-clear example of that. What is worse is that \nthe statute itself sets out that we would live under ObamaCare, getting \nour health care from the ObamaCare exchange just like millions of other \nAmericans.\n  If you don't believe that is what the statute mandates, look exactly \nat the particulars of how Congress and the President are currently \ngetting around that through the special OPM rule that President Obama \nissued. This rule says that Congress can get its health care from a \nspecial small business exchange in the District of Columbia and can \nhave a huge taxpayer-funded subsidy applied, even though it is \nunavailable to every other American at our income level.\n  Now, what is wrong with that? Well, under the ObamaCare statute \nitself, that small business exchange is specifically set up and \nregulated and limited to small businesses of 50 employees or less.\n  How did Congress define itself as a small business with 50 employees \nor less? It is interesting, if you pull the paperwork that the \nleadership of the House and Senate sent over to allow Members to \nparticipate in this exchange. The folks who submitted that paperwork on \nbehalf of the House and the Senate, who signed off on it saying that \neverything contained therein was true and accurate, said: How many \nemployees does the Senate have? Forty-five. How many employees does the \nHouse have? Forty-five.\n  Really? That is interesting. This is a flatout lie. It is a flatout \nlie submitted in writing by the House and Senate on behalf of all of us \nto shoehorn Congress in to this small business exchange to get extra \nadded benefits, to get this taxpayer-funded subsidy unavailable to \nevery other American at our income level. And that proves how \noutrageous this end run around the statutory language is.\n\n  So again, I urge all our colleagues to come together in support of \nthis fix and to say: Yes, it should be the first rule of American \ndemocracy that what we pass for the rest of America we live by \nourselves. That is important, and we are going to do it in this case \nand in every case.\n  I urge my colleagues to support our freestanding bill--the No \nExemption for Washington from ObamaCare Act. I urge our colleagues to \nsupport the floor amendment, which is the same as that freestanding \nbill, and to pass it as a floor amendment--to pass it into law through \nthat mechanism.\n  Before yielding the floor, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the time during the quorum call be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to ADM James \nWinnefeld, Jr., who is retiring at the end of this month after serving \nwith distinction for more than 37 years, culminating his career as the \nVice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  Throughout his service as a senior military leader, Admiral Winnefeld \nhas provided this body, and in particular the Senate Committee on Armed \nServices, with valuable testimony and candid military advice. Over the \nlast 4 years, Admiral Winnefeld has served as the ninth Vice Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff. His vast experience, knowledge, \noutstanding leadership, and professionalism, combined with his deep \nrespect and consideration for our service men and women, will be \ngreatly missed.\n  During his tenure as Vice Chairman, Admiral Winnefeld provided \nmilitary advice to not only the legislative branch but also to the \nPresident of the United States, the Secretary of Defense, the National \nSecurity Council, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on a \nwide range of complex military and national security issues during an \nextremely challenging period in our country's history.\n  In a challenging fiscal and security environment, Admiral Winnefeld \nhelped to lead our military through global events and threats, to \ninclude the Department of Defense's rebalance to the Pacific, Iraq \ntroop withdrawal, Afghanistan transition, the global threat of ISIL, \ninstability in Syria, and Russia's provocative actions in Eastern \nEurope. In addition, the Vice Chair played key roles in advising our \nNation's leaders on various counterterrorism efforts.\n  As Vice Chairman, he led the development and implementation of the \n2014 Quadrennial Defense Review, an effort that involved thousands of \nsenior leadership man hours. Pivotal to his role as the Vice Chairman, \nhe also chaired the Joint Requirements Oversight Council, where he \nworked tirelessly to transform the requirement processes to become more \nagile, transparent, and inclusive. Admiral Winnefeld focused his \nefforts on the immediate capability needs of the combatant commanders \nand the most pressing military issues of the joint warfighter.\n  As cochair of the Defense Acquisitions Board, Admiral Winnefeld \nworked to link the requirements, resource, and acquisition communities \nin developing programs to deliver appropriate capabilities to the joint \nwarfighter at the right time and for the right price.\n  Admiral Winnefeld's work as a cochair of the Nuclear Weapons Council \nensured our military's nuclear enterprise and No. 1 priority remained \nviable and relevant as a strategic deterrent to our Nation's \nadversaries.\n  Admiral Winnefeld graduated from the Georgia Institute of \nTechnology--also known as Georgia Tech--and received his commission \nfrom the Navy ROTC Program there. He subsequently served with three \nfighter squadrons flying the F-14 Tomcat and as an instructor at the \nNavy Fighter Weapons School. Admiral Winnefeld's unit commands at sea \ninclude Fighter Squadron 211, the USS Cleveland, and the USS \nEnterprise.\n  He led the ``Big E'' through her 18th deployment, which included \ncombat operations in Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring \nFreedom immediately after the terrorist acts of September 11, 2001.\n  As the commander of Carrier Strike Group TWO, he led Task Forces 50, \n152, and 58 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and maritime \ninterception operations in the Arabian Gulf. He also served as the \ncommander of the U.S. 6th Fleet, the commander of NATO Allied Joint \nCommand Lisbon, and the commander of Striking and Support Forces NATO.\n  His shore tours include service in the Joint Staff Operations \nDirectorate, as senior aide to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and as \nexecutive assistant to the Vice Chief of Naval Operations.\n  As a flag officer, Admiral Winnefeld served ashore as the director of \nWarfare Programs and Transformational Concepts at U.S. Fleet Forces \nCommand, as the director of Joint Innovation and Experimentation at \nU.S. Joint Forces Command, and as the director for Strategic Plans and \nPolicy on the joint staff.\n  Prior to becoming the vice chairman, Admiral Winnefeld served as the \ncommander of North American Aerospace Defense Command and the U.S. \nNorthern Command.\n  As the commander of NORAD and NORTHCOM, Admiral Winnefeld led \nhistoric advances in the working relationship between NORTHCOM, \nHomeland Security, FEMA, the Drug Enforcement Administration, Customs \nand Border Protection, and the National Guard, specifically with the \ndual status commander concept. In addition, he led the U.S.-Mexican \nmilitary-to-military relationship to a historic level of collaboration \nand brought tangible results to our Nation's important struggle against \nthe fast-growing transnational criminal organizations.\n  Through his distinctive accomplishments, Admiral Winnefeld culminated \na long and distinguished career in the service of our Nation. His \ntenure leaves a lasting, positive legacy on our armed services. I \nappreciate his extraordinary service which reflected great credit\n\n[[Page S5185]]\n\nupon himself, the U.S. Navy, and the Department of Defense.\n  For nearly 40 years, Admiral Winnefeld has performed his duty \nprofessionally, honestly, and with great dedication. Our Nation will \nmiss his leadership and expertise. We wish him and his family all the \nbest as he moves to the next phase of his life. Personally, I want to \nthank Admiral Winnefeld and say job well done, God bless, and Godspeed.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 46 years ago yesterday, Neil Armstrong and \nBuzz Aldrin became the first people to walk on the Moon.\n  September will bring the 53rd anniversary of President Kennedy's \nspeech that launched America on the quest to land them on the Moon. He \nset that goal for the country not because it was easy but because it \nwas hard. I am here to congratulate the men and women of the New \nHorizons mission for making the hard work of sending a spacecraft to \nPluto look easy.\n  One week ago today, what had once been a fuzzy picture of Pluto came \ninto sharp focus. Dramatic transformations inspire everyone. As you can \nsee, NASA delivered an amazing before-and-after story. Until the New \nHorizons flyby, the best picture we had of Pluto offered little detail \nof our neighbor at the edge of the solar system, but now we can see \ndistinct features on its surface, including something that looks like a \nheart. Who couldn't love that. Thank you for this great picture.\n  It took the New Horizons spacecraft 9\\1/2\\ years to cross the 3 \nbillion miles between Pluto and Earth, but it was a mission much longer \nin the making.\n  In the late 1980s, a group of scientists came together to advocate \nfor sending a spacecraft to the edge of the solar system. Such a \nmission would tell us more about Pluto and once again push back the \nedge of the known frontier. Many of those scientists are still involved \nwith the New Horizons mission, including the Massachusetts Institute of \nTechnology's own Richard Binzel.\n  While these scientists pushed to get the green light for the mission, \nit was only achieved by the partnership between NASA, some of our best \nU.S. universities and the aerospace industry, and the hard work and \ninnovation of their scientists, engineers, and staff.\n  From just the initial information returned this week, scientists have \nto rethink what they thought they knew about Pluto, its Moons, and its \nspace environment. Images came back of mountains of frozen water as \nhigh as the Rocky Mountains on Pluto. On its Moon Charon, we can now \nsee deep canyons and a row of cliffs and troughs stretching 600 miles, \nas far as from Washington, DC, to Atlanta.\n  Instruments on the New Horizons probe confirm that the Pluto system \ncontains a large amount of frozen water. That is an essential building \nblock of life. One thing scientists didn't see--many of the meteorite \nimpact craters--suggests that Pluto was geologically active relatively \nrecently.\n  The voyage of discovery from the flyby will continue for years to \ncome. Not only will scientists learn more, but they will also train the \nnext generation of planetary scientists. I am proud the youngest member \nof the New Horizons team is Alissa Earle, a graduate student at MIT.\n  The New Horizons team is following in the great American exploration \ntradition. They are pushing back the boundaries of geography, \nknowledge, and technology. In doing so, they are inspiring the world. \nNo matter what you think of the classification of Pluto as a dwarf \nplanet, we can all agree that the New Horizons mission is already a \nmassive achievement.\n  I look forward to the further revelations it will bring as its data \nstreams back to Earth and it travels to the far edges of our solar \nsystem.\n  Finally, I would like to note that in the same week of taking us to \nPluto, NASA also commenced the continuous monitoring of the Sun and the \nEarth--the only home humans have known thus far. I hope the events of \nthis past week confirm the importance of using all of NASA's tools to \nfurther the exploration of our solar system and universe and better \nunderstand our own planet as well.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We think of the greatness they \nembodied: Thomas Sullivan, David Wyatt, Carson Holmquist, Skip Wells, \nand Randall Smith.\n  I think as the Nation has learned about these individuals carrying \nout what many would consider to be mundane activities in support of our \nU.S. military, those who protect us, they understand the greatness they \nsymbolized, most of them having served in Afghanistan and Iraq and some \nof them younger, beginning their careers, but all having excellent \nbackgrounds and exemplifying the very best America has to offer.\n  Our Nation mourns, our community mourns, and we have lost five of our \ngreatest. Also, hospitalized in Chattanooga today is a young man named \nDennis Pedigo, whose mother and father both served on the Chattanooga \nPolice Department, and he has followed in their footsteps.\n  I think people have heard all around our country the tremendous \nheroism that was exemplified by the Chattanooga Police Department, \nwhich rushed at the assailant and brought him to his end--by the way, \ntrained to do so, trained to go at them. This was not a SWAT team, but \nthese were patrol squads that were trained to deal with this kind of \nsituation and no doubt saved the lives of other people in doing so. So \nwe honor them. We honor all of them. We celebrate them. As a community \nwe have been harmed, and our community has prayed.\n\n  We had a vigil on Friday night that was extraordinary. Senator \nAlexander was there with our Governor, our mayor, county officials, and \nothers. It was an extraordinary time of our community coming together \naround what has happened.\n  I do believe that what people all over the country and the world have \nheard about ``Chattanooga strong'' is true, and I think our community \nwill be even stronger because of what has happened, and our Nation must \nunderstand where we are in the world and that these types of activities \nwill possibly continue.\n  I had a very good conversation on Friday with the Pentagon to talk \nabout what they are doing. I know threat activity has been rising for \nsome time, and they are looking at what needs to be done to ensure this \ndoesn't happen again.\n  I had a very good conversation this morning with Senator McCain, who \nI know is leading efforts with House Members to figure out if there is \na way to add something to the NDAA, a piece of legislation that we can \ndeal with very quickly here so we can make sure we have policies to \nprotect lives.\n  Our community is praying for these individuals. It is my hope that we \nwill put policies in place to ensure we appropriately protect these \nindividuals.\n  In addition to that, there are tangible things we can do. I know that \nwhen something like this happens,\n\n[[Page S5186]]\n\nthere are certain types of Federal benefits. Our offices are working \ntogether with outside groups to coordinate that.\n  Thankfully, our community has come together to make sure these \nfamilies have the financial support they need beyond that. There is an \neffort under way in Chattanooga now--and I hope people around the world \nwill participate--to make sure that the financial support that is \nnecessary to sustain these families in light of what happened occurs.\n  My friend and a great Tennessean--or at least we claim him as that \nbecause he lives in Chattanooga for part of the year--Peyton Manning, \nhas lent his name to this effort. My sense is that we will see a \ngenerous outpouring to ensure that, at a base level, some of the \nfinancial needs of these families, if not all, will be dealt with in an \nappropriate way.\n  I will close by saying this. Our community has been shocked, as has \nthe world. We have lost five outstanding people, and it has shaken \ntheir families.\n  I had the opportunity to meet briefly with the family of the fallen \nsailor, the last person who passed. He was riddled with bullets, and \nthe Erlanger trauma squad worked with him for hours and hours and hours \ntrying to save his life. Finally, after a tremendous fight, he lost his \nlife--again, in the line of duty.\n  The needs of these families are great. While our community is \npraying, they will try to meet their needs in other ways.\n  How do we respond to this? Lamar and I have both mentioned what comes \nout of this, and the fact is that I feel that our community is like \nnone I have witnessed from the standpoint of its compassion to others. \nMy sense is that the way our community is going to respond to this is \nmuch like what I would refer to in Genesis 12, where God said to the \nJewish people that they were blessed to be a blessing. I think most \npeople in our community, our State, and our Nation believe we have been \nincredibly blessed, and my sense is that in addition to responding to \nthe specific needs that need to be dealt with both here in Washington \nand back home and certainly at the State level, our community is going \nto rise up and ensure that, because we have been blessed, we continue \nto be a blessing to others. That is my hope, and that is what I am \nseeing happen. I have never seen such an outpouring of compassion \nanyplace else in my life.\n  I am proud to represent Tennessee. I am proud that my hometown has \nresponded in the way that it has, in spite of a deep mourning and grief \nthat we have for these outstanding men who lost their lives in the line \nof duty.\n  Senator Alexander and I will submit a resolution later today, and my \nsense is that the entire Senate will want to be a part of it.\n  With that, I will turn to my distinguished friend, a great colleague, \nand one of the greatest Senators our State has ever had, Lamar \nAlexander.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Corker for his eloquent \nand obviously heartfelt comments. He mentioned the word that we have \nheard most often since last Thursday, when he and I first got word of \nthis tragedy, and the word is ``heartbroken.'' We are heartbroken for \nthe lives that were lost, heartbroken for the families that remain, and \nheartbroken for the community of Chattanooga.\n  We can see the deep emotion that Senator Corker has expressed. As a \nresident and former mayor of Chattanooga, that community is very \nspecial to him.\n  On Friday at 5:30 p.m., in Mount Olivet Baptist Church, there was a \nmemorial service that nearly 1,000 people attended. Senator Corker, our \nGovernor, the police chief, and others spoke.\n  I know most people in the country know about what happened that day. \nMost of them would have liked to have been there to do what they could \nin a time such as this. You never know quite what to say. Sometimes all \nyou can do is just be there.\n  This is especially hard because these were young men--young men in \nthe service of our country, young men whose lives were filled with \nhappiness, young men who had the expectation of a long life for \nthemselves, young men who were filled with duty and service.\n  They were living in a strong community. Faith and the sense of \nhelping one another is strong Chattanooga faith. Chattanooga is a place \nof good neighbors. Chattanooga was recently named the best midsize city \nin America. Everything in Chattanooga seemed to be going in the right \ndirection, and then this happened. So it is especially heartbreaking in \nthe community of Chattanooga.\n  On Friday, I thought--while trying to think about what words I could \nadd to the words that were being said--about the time in 1985 when 289 \nmembers of the 101st Airborne Division lost their lives in a plane \ncrash in Newfoundland, and President Reagan came to Fort Campbell to \nmeet with the families to talk about it.\n  I was Governor then, and I drove up to hear what he had to say. He \nspoke of those men and women--as these five were--as peacekeepers. They \nwere there to protect lives, protect the peace, and to act as a force \nfor stability and trust for our country.\n  President Reagan said of those 289 men and women, which can be \nequally said of these five men, that their work was the perfect \nexpression of the best of the Judeo-Christian tradition. They were the \nones of whom Christ spoke when he said: ``Blessed are the peacemakers \nfor they shall be called the children of God.''\n  President Reagan said of the 289 who lost their lives 30 years ago \nwhat could be said of these five this week and what a poet said of \nsoldiers in another war:\n\n       They will never grow old; they will always be young. And we \n     know one thing with every bit of our thinking: They are now \n     in the arms of God.\n\n  Chattanoogans said last Friday the words ``Chattanooga strong,'' and \nthey were repeated by Senator Corker, the Governor, and most of the \nmembers of the community. People were standing up and supporting each \nother and the families who had been heartbroken by the loss of their \nloved ones.\n  I am enormously impressed with the people of Chattanooga and their \ncurrent leaders: the mayor, the Governor, and their Senator, who is \nalso their former mayor. I believe Chattanooga will be strong.\n  I think it is important, as we reflect and grieve here in the Senate \nwith Chattanooga--not just with the families and the people who knew \nthe five who passed--that we not only honor the five, but that we also \nhonor the city and its response to this terrible tragedy.\n  I pledge to continue to work with Senator Corker to do all that I can \nto help those five families and help create an environment that can \nkeep Chattanooga strong.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/21/senate-section/article/S5186-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5186-S5187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE HIGHWAY BILL\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, after literally months of discussion \nand a lot of cooperation from chairmen and ranking members and staffs \nand Members from both sides of the aisle, I am happy to announce that \nSenator Boxer and I have an agreement for a multiyear, bipartisan \nhighway bill. We hope to be able to discuss this agreement at our \nconferences shortly. This is a 6-year highway authorization that will \nallow planning for important long-term projects around the country. The \nbill also provides 3 years--3 years--of guaranteed funding for the \nhighway trust fund.\n  Senators from both parties know that a long-term highway bill is in \nthe best interest of our country, so we will continue working together \nto get a good one passed. Thanks to the dedication of both Republican \nand Democratic Senators and their staffs, I am hopeful that we will.\n  I wish to thank some other people who have been involved in getting \nus to where we are. In particular, I thank Chairman Jim Inhofe, \nChairman Orrin Hatch, Chairman John Thune, and Chairman Richard Shelby \nfor their efforts to reach a bipartisan accomplishment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if we have an agreement--and I am sure we do \nbecause I have great respect for Senator McConnell, Senator Boxer, and, \nof course, Senator Inhofe. We have this issue, though: We haven't seen \nthe bill. There can be an agreement, but until we put an agreement in \nwriting, things are a lot different.\n\n[[Page S5187]]\n\n  We have a number of committees that need to look this over in \naddition to the EPW Committee on which Senator Boxer is the lead \nDemocrat. We have the Commerce Committee that we have to deal with. We \nhave the Finance Committee that we have to deal with. We have the \nBanking Committee that we have to deal with.\n  I want a highway bill. I have had the good fortune of being chairman \nof the EPW Committee twice. I worked on a number of long-term highway \nbills back in the good old days when we did that, and I hope we can \nhave a long-term bill again. But we can't move forward on a bill until \nwe have read it and seen it and studied it. That doesn't mean study it \nfor several days, but we need to look at this document. I need to have \na caucus after we have this document so we can look at it.\n  So I hope my friend the Republican leader will be patient and wait \nuntil we get something we can study, and I will have a caucus with my \ncaucus and we will sit down and decide how we should move forward on \nthis matter.\n  I repeat, I admire all of the hard work that has been done by \neverybody up to this point, but we have to make sure we move forward \nwith this in the right direction. I understand all the issues probably \nmore than most about all the time involved in a bill such as this. \nThere are all kinds of potential ways to stall this, but we are not \ngoing to do that on our side. We are going to be as expeditious as we \ncan once we have something that we can read and understand and, as I \nsaid, study so we can understand it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, before my leader leaves the floor, I wish \nto thank him because he and Senator Durbin, Senator Schumer, and the \nrest of the leadership team have been pushing hard for a bill. As my \nleader knows, I have been negotiating in good faith with the Republican \nteam, headed by Leader McConnell, for a long-term, robust bill.\n  I agree with Leader McConnell that we have an agreement in principle. \nI also agree with my leader that we have to look at the details. So my \nwork now turns to getting those agreements up on the Internet so people \ncan read for themselves the various titles. It is my understanding that \nwe will start to see that language momentarily. I know we are working \nhard with my Chairman Inhofe to make a couple of changes to EPW. But I \nhave to say we have reached an agreement in principle on a 6-year bill \nwith 3 years of funding, and the text will be printed shortly. I \nbelieve it is a breakthrough. The highway trust fund goes bust in 10 \ndays.\n  This is what is happening across the country. It is unreal that in my \nState we would have this bridge collapse, I say to my friends, and now \ncommerce can't move between California and Arizona because we have had \nthis collapse on Interstate 10. How strange this would be if this--\nthank God no one lost their life in this accident. But this bridge was \nrated structurally obsolete, so we knew it couldn't bear all the \ntraffic. It is a huge amount of traffic. So this is my poster child for \nwhy I am working so hard on this.\n  I thank my Republican friends because they have really worked hard. \nOf course, I am looking at Bettina and Neil. I was talking to them at \n11:30 last night, and in the leader's office we resolved the last \ncouple of pressing issues, with his help. But we have to see the text. \nMy friends on the other side want to see the text of the Iran \nagreement. This isn't exactly the same, but we do need to see the text. \nSo I am urging everybody to get the text up as fast as possible so we \ncan vote as soon as possible. This is a breakthrough, but we need to \nsee the details.\n  I thank Leader McConnell because this has been a difficult \nnegotiation but I think one that is going to bear fruit in terms of \nmillions of jobs and thousands of businesses in much better shape.\n  Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                           Order of Business\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the cloture vote we were originally \ngoing to have at 2:15 p.m. will be pushed back several hours to 4 p.m.\n  I will just add--in addition to the comments of the Senator from \nCalifornia--I wish to thank Senator Inhofe, who I think was in the \nChamber.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Right here.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Nobody has been a stronger advocate for a multiyear \nhighway bill than the Senator from Oklahoma. In spite of the rather \ndramatic philosophical differences which exist between the Senator from \nCalifornia and the Senator from Oklahoma, when it comes to a \ntransportation bill, they have been a remarkable team over the years. \nSo I thank my chairman as well for an extraordinary contribution to all \nof this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I appreciate that very much. I wish to say \nthat working in concert with Senator Boxer has been a pleasure. A lot \nof times philosophically in this room here we disagree with each other, \nbut then when it gets down to what we are supposed to be doing here--I \nhave to remind people quite often that if you read the Constitution \nabout what we are supposed to be doing here--I am talking about Members \nof the U.S. Senate--we are supposed to be defending America and roads \nand bridges. That is it. So this is by far the most important matter \nbefore us right now, now that we have the Defense bill behind us, and I \nlook forward to making this a reality.\n  The idea of a 6-year bill is very significant because without that we \ncan't do the big projects. This morning on the floor with charts I \nshowed all the different big, large structures, such as the Spence \nBridge between Kentucky and Ohio. These are bridges and projects that \nhave to be done, and there has to be a long-term bill in order to do \nthat. I also shared this morning an experience that I had on the I-35 \nbridge that we put in through--the last major bill we had was in 2005. \nWe put those repairs in there. That was in Oklahoma City. We actually \nhad the death of a lady who was driving her three children under a \nbridge with concrete falling off. So we have to repair America, and \nthis is the first step toward that repair.\n  It is very important that we proceed to the bill. I would suggest to \npeople that if you don't like it and if you plan to vote against it, \nthat is fine, but bring it out here so we can discuss the merits, the \ndemerits, and we can also start working on amendments. I would \nencourage any Member who is listening right now to bring amendments to \nthe floor because when we proceed to the bill, I am going to be down \nhere on the floor as long as we are in session, and I will be wanting \nto get to these amendments. It doesn't do any good to wait until the \nlast minute and then show up and say ``I have an amendment'' on the day \nof passage of the bill. We will have deadlines. In order to get germane \nand nongermane amendments up for consideration, we have to have them \ndown here, and if Members miss a deadline, then Members won't have that \nopportunity. So it is really up to the Members now to make sure that \nhappens, but before we can get to that, the one thing that has to \nhappen is we have to proceed to the bill. That has to be passed at 4 \no'clock today.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/21/senate-section/article/S5187-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ORDER FOR RECESS\n\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Madam President, I enter a motion to reconsider the \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is entered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, it is my understanding that many of \nour colleagues on the other side have voted against cloture at this \nparticular point. They wanted to have further time to read the bill. I \nwant everybody to understand that the text is filed, it is at the desk. \nThere are detailed summaries available online on the EPW Committee Web \nsite.\n  As everyone knows, Senator Boxer, I, and others have been discussing \nthis in great detail.\n  I am hopeful that by tomorrow we will have cloture on the bill and an \nopportunity to go forward.\n  Let me just say to everybody that I know I haven't threatened a \nSaturday session all year, but there will be a Saturday session and \nprobably Sunday as well. Let me tell you why. We have a chance to \nachieve a multiyear, bipartisan highway bill. Senator Inhofe and \nSenator Boxer reported out a 6-year bill. This is a 6-year bill. We \nhave paid for the first 3 years. I believe our colleagues on the other \nside will find these pay-fors credible. They may not love every single \none of them, but there is not a phony one in there.\n  If we can get this bill over to the House, it is my belief they will \ntake it up. Give the House of Representatives an opportunity to express \nitself on this bill. Imagine the scenario if we actually were able to \nproduce a multiyear highway bill and get it to the President's desk for \nsignature before the August recess. It is something we could all feel \nproud of. In my view, there has been outstanding bipartisan work on \nthis, and so we need to keep at it, and that will require us, most \ndefinitely, to be here this weekend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/21/senate-section/article/S5188-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Madam President, first, we all appreciate the work done by \nSenator McConnell and Senator Boxer. Senator Boxer has been tireless on \nthis, as she is on everything. But we have an issue that I think we \nneed to address. We received this bill, which is more than 1,000 pages, \nabout an hour ago.\n  I am going to have a caucus tomorrow, and I hope we will have an \nopportunity at that time to have reports from committees of \njurisdiction. Committees of jurisdiction is more than just the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee; finance is involved, commerce, \nbanking, and other committees, of course, are interested.\n  So we need the opportunity to look at this bill. This is a big bill \nwith a lot of different sections in it dealing with a lot of different \nissues. We are not asking for anything unusual; we just want to be able \nto study the bill and talk about it in a private meeting tomorrow at 12 \no'clock.\n  Now, if we were doing something that was--``What are you talking \nabout? You mean you want to read this?'' Please. I mean, we have pages \nof quotes from my friends.\n  Senator Enzi said:\n\n       That is what created this enormous outrage across America \n     of: Did you read the bill? How can you read the bill if you \n     have not seen anything in it, if it has not been given to \n     you? I do not think it is intended to be given to us until we \n     have to shuffle this thing through at the end [and not know \n     what is in it].\n\n  Lamar Alexander, one of the most thoughtful people I have served with \nin government, said a couple of years ago:\n\n       We want to make sure the American people have a chance to \n     read it and they have a chance to know exactly what it costs \n     and they have a chance to know exactly how it affects them. \n     That is not an unreasonable request, we don't think. That is \n     the way the Senate works. That is our job. When it came to \n     the Defense authorization bill, we spent a couple of weeks \n     doing that. When it came to No Child Left Behind, the \n     Education bill, we spent 7 weeks going through it. . . . The \n     Homeland Security bill took 7 weeks. The Energy bill in 2002 \n     took 8 weeks. A farm bill last year took 4 weeks. So we have \n     a little reading to do, a little work to do.\n\n  John McCain said:\n\n       But could I also add, if we haven't seen it, don't you \n     think we should have time to at least examine it? I mean, I \n     don't think it would be outrageous to ask for a bill to be \n     read that we haven't seen.\n\n  I--as have a number of people in this body--have worked on highway \nbills in the past. We have worked on these bills, and they have taken \nweeks to get done. We are being presented with something here that \nbasically says: You take this or leave it. That isn't the way it should \nwork around here.\n\n[[Page S5189]]\n\n  I am going to do everything I can to move forward on a long-term \nhighway bill. I want to get it done. But we are going to have to look \nat this and find out what my different committees think, what different \nSenators think, what people at home think. You know, I have a lot of \npeople at home who are interested in what is in this bill. There is the \nbanking provision. There are the pay-fors. I looked at them last week, \nbut that has been a moving target also.\n  The ranking member of our Finance Committee at this stage--unless he \nhas learned something in the last half hour--doesn't know what the pay-\nfors are either.\n  So, in short, we want to be as cooperative as we can, but we are not \ngoing to lurch into this legislation without having had a chance to \nread in detail this 1,030-page bill and, after having read it, to have \na discussion within the caucus on this bill.\n  We would be in a very difficult position if--as the Republican leader \nsaid, we are going to work over the weekend, which is fine. I have no \nproblem with that. I have tried that myself a few times; it didn't work \nso well. But I am willing to be part of the deal here if we need to \nwork this weekend to get it done.\n  I don't know what the House plans to do, but we are assuming a lot, \nthat the House is going to take up this bill. If they did, that would \nbe wonderful, but I have to say that based on my conversation with the \nDemocrats in the House, in conversations they have had with the \nRepublican leadership over there, I don't think there is a chance in \nthe world they are going to take up this bill. They have sent us a \nbill--a bill that is for 5 months, with conversations between the White \nHouse--not our Whitehouse but the President's White House--to come up \nwith a long-term highway bill. Part of that is some consideration of \nthe Export-Import Bank. I realize how important that is. I have been on \nthis floor talking about how important that is. We have about 45 \ndifferent countries that have, as we speak, ex-im banks that are \nworking, that are taking away all of our business, so it is important \nthat we get that done also. But we cannot let one get in the way of the \nother. It is not our fault--Democrats' fault--that we don't have an Ex-\nIm Bank bill. We didn't create the problems with Ex-Im having gone out \nof business.\n  So I want to get a highway bill done and I want to get Ex-Im Bank \ndone, but the Ex-Im Bank problem should not stand in the way of us \ngetting a good, strong, robust highway bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, my good friend the Democratic leader \nwas saying as recently as a couple of weeks ago that we need to do a \nlong-term highway bill. Well, Senator Boxer and I took him seriously. \nWe have worked hard to come up with a bipartisan, multiyear, paid-for \nhighway bill. The fact that it hasn't been online very long is a good \nargument, and our friends will have an opportunity to read every bit of \nit. I hope at that point they will find it attractive to move forward. \nAs I have said for over I guess now something like 2 months, this bill \nis an opportunity for those who support the Ex-Im Bank to offer an \namendment on that subject.\n  So it is further complicated in terms of timing by the fact that the \nHouse of Representatives is leaving a week earlier than we are. I can't \nsay with certainty that the House of Representatives will take up and \npass a multiyear highway bill that doesn't raise the gas tax and is \ncredibly paid for, but it is a lot more attractive, it strikes me, than \na 6-month extension that we have to revisit again in December.\n  I am hopeful that the House will take a look at what we have done on \nthe Senate side on a bipartisan basis and find it very appealing. So we \nwould like to work our way through this and we intend to work our way \nthrough it--including the weekend--to get what we believe is an \nimportant accomplishment for the country over to the House of \nRepresentatives so they can take a look at it, and maybe they will find \nit appealing as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, if I could say to both leaders, whom I \nrespect tremendously--and I agree with Leader Reid 99.9 percent of the \ntime--this is the situation: We have a highway trust fund expiring, \ngoing bust, going broke, and, yes, we have to spend some time. You \nknow, we have a lot of staff; we can divide this up--250 pages, 4 \npeople. We have a summary. We have a summary of the bill out there for \neverybody, and we can just say we need 4 weeks or 6 weeks to look at \nit.\n  The EPW piece, as my friend Senator Inhofe knows, has been out there \nfor 3 months--not that long; at least 2 months. We haven't changed much \nin that. It has been out there, so that has been reviewed.\n  All I want to say is this: If we could just keep our eye on the \nprize--and I understand that the way we proceed over here is important. \nThat is why I voted no, not to go to a bill I wrote with Senator \nMcConnell, because I agree with my leader completely. We need a chance \nto look at it. But I would submit that this isn't the first time we \nhave ever done a highway bill. This is a little different from a health \ncare bill in the sense that it is a highway bill. Most of it is very \nsimilar. I would say EPW builds off the old bill we had before, and \nmost of the bills track older bills.\n  I don't think it is going to be that hard for us to detail our staff \nto read it because--here is the problem--if we don't, we have 800,000 \nconstruction workers who are still not back to work, and we have 7 \nStates that have stopped doing anything. So if we could just keep our \neye on the prize, which is businesses being able to do what they want \nto do: build--I had a bridge collapse 2 days ago. You can't get from \nCalifornia to Arizona.\n  So I hope that tomorrow we will be able to join with our friends and \nvote to proceed. If we don't like the bill, we will have three more \nopportunities to vote no. But I would love to get on this bill, get \nmoving on it, and see if we can keep this economy moving in the right \ndirection and not take a chance, as many economists said we will, if we \ndon't do a long-term bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator from California yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. My understanding is that the Senator and Chairman \nInhofe have been discussing with people around the country who would \nbenefit from this bill. Does the Senator have a sense of their \nenthusiasm for the product we have come up with?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I do. As I shared with Leader Reid today, we have 68 \norganizations, from labor, to business, to general contractors. I have \nthe list. They are asking us, begging us to move forward--the National \nGovernors Association. It is really a broad-based number of \norganizations that don't agree all the time. I mean that the building \ntrade doesn't often agree with the Chamber of Commerce, but they agree \non this. So I think there is enthusiasm.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would I be correct in saying they are less than \nenthusiastic about another short-term extension?\n  Mrs. BOXER. They agree with those of us who have said that is a death \nby a thousand cuts. We just can't keep on doing these short-term \nextensions.\n  I would say this to the Republican leader. If you or I went to the \nbank to get a mortgage and the banker smiled and said that you get that \nmortgage, but it is only for 6 months or 5 months, you wouldn't buy the \nhouse.\n  No one is going to build a new project or fix a bridge that has \nmultiyear costs if they know the money could run out in 5 months or in \nthe short term.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would it also be correct, I ask the Senator from \nCalifornia, if we are fortunate enough to send a multiyear paid-for \nhighway bill over to the House, that the same constituent groups that \nhave had an interest in this and have indicated their enthusiasm to you \nwould likely descend on the House and suggest that this might be \nsomething they ought to take a look at?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I think there will be huge momentum if we are able to \npass this in a bipartisan way; yes, I do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I have been listening carefully to what \nconcerns people have, and I have to remind everyone that it was June \n24--June 24--that we passed this bill out of committee. We had been \nworking on this bill for months before that.\n\n[[Page S5190]]\n\n  All of us realize that between the last bill we had, which was a \nmultiyear bill in 2005--that we then had a 5-year bill, and since that \nexpired at the end of 2009, we have had nothing but extensions. Those \nextensions cost 30 percent off the top just because short-term \nextensions don't work. But we went ahead, and we passed a bill.\n  The reason I am optimistic that if we can get this to the House they \nwill sign it is because that wasn't a problem at all when it went to \nthe House the last time. We showed them that the cost of the bill is \nfar less--the conservative position. That was with 33 Members of the \nHouse on the transportation and infrastructure committee. So all of the \nRepublicans and all of the Democrats on their committee voted for it. \nThose same Democrats and Republicans over there would support this.\n  I think the reason they came out originally for a shorter term bill \nwas to pack it in with some other things they wanted to get passed. But \nI have yet to talk to the first Member of the House who doesn't say: If \nyou bring us a multiyear bill, we will sign it.\n  So I think that is a moot statement. I think that will happen, and we \nare willing to stay here until it does happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I appreciate the chairman and the \nranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee pointing \nout that the actual underlying authorization language in this \nlegislation has been public information since June 24--June 24. The \nonly thing that is a little different about this underlying bill--it is \nnot as if this were air-dropped out of heaven, and it showed up on \npeople's desks--is that Senator Hatch, the chairman of the Committee on \nFinance, and other committee chairmen on the commerce committee, EPW, \nthe Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee have come up \nwith a group of pay-fors to figure a way to pay for 3 years now of this \nunderlying 6-year bill.\n  So I think it is absolutely accurate to say that the good work being \ndone by the Environment and Public Works Committee to pass a 6-year \nbill will be done when this bill is passed, but we have only been able \nto agree on 3 years of pay-fors. I wish we could have gone longer, but \nthat is not bad considering our recent record with these temporary \npatches, which I agree is a terrible way to do business.\n  So I congratulate the Senator from California and those who have \nworked to make this bill as good as it is, but I want to make another \npoint. There are others who are arguing: Well, we shouldn't be doing \nthis. We ought to be passing a temporary patch, and then we should be \ndoing international tax reform and trying to come up with some \nadditional revenue out of that process that will pay for a 6-year bill. \nWell, the fact of the matter is that nothing we will do with this bill \nprecludes that good work from going forward.\n  As a matter of fact, after 3 years of paying for this bill, at some \npoint we are going to have to find a way to recharge the bill in order \nto complete the work that was first started in the underlying 6-year \nbill. So I don't want anybody to be under a misconception, because I \nthink you might if you didn't know the context of thinking that all of \na sudden this 1,000-page bill appeared on people's desks, and they do \nnot know where it came from, and they do not know anything about its \nprovenance or what it will actually do. The truth is very, very \ndifferent.\n  It is important, and I respect the fact, as the Senator from \nCalifornia has made the point, that people do need to get comfortable \nwith the paperwork. But what we have tried to do is to come up with \ncredible ways to pay for the bill that actually represents a consensus \nto pay for 3 years rather than this idea of a 6-month patch and hoping \nthat somehow we will come up with the money in December for a 6-year \nbill.\n  So while I regret this failed cloture vote, this bill does represent \na significant step forward, and I am encouraged by what I have seen in \nterms of the bipartisan cooperation that allowed us to make progress on \na number of contentious matters so far this year, and I thank the \nminority whip for his good work on this as well.\n  We passed an education bill. We passed trade promotion authority. It \nwas not universally popular on both sides, but this was a priority for \nthe President and I think something that represents a step forward for \nour economy, opening markets for the things we raise and grow and the \nthings we make in this country.\n  We have done a number of important things that I hope begin to regain \nthe public's trust and confidence that we are actually able to function \nand that even though we have very different ideas about how to get to a \nconclusion, we can actually find common ground and make some progress.\n  In my State in particular--Texas being a large State--the Texas A \nTransportation Institute estimates that by the year 2020, 8.4 billion \nhours will be spent waiting in traffic--8.4 billion hours. Of course, \nthat also means that 4 billion gallons of gas will be wasted in the \nprocess. Imagine the pollution, not to mention the heartburn associated \nwith congestion on our highways and roadways.\n  We are, thank goodness, a fast-growing State relative to the rest of \nthe country. We are a big State. We need the transportation \ninfrastructure to keep our economy moving and to create jobs and \neconomic growth.\n  So I am confident we can work in a bipartisan manner to address what \nI hope is just a temporary obstacle and avoid these patches that kick \nthe can down the road and provide no predictability or planning ability \nso these long-term projects can be initiated and completed.\n  I would just point out the fact that Texas has not waited on the \nFederal Government in order to deal with its transportation needs. Last \nNovember, by an overwhelming 4-to-1 margin, Texans approved a ballot \ninitiative that provided an additional $1.7 billion to upgrade and \nmaintain our transportation network. So I congratulate our leaders at \nthe State level who have taken the initiative to begin to make that \ndownpayment on upgrading and maintaining our transportation network, \nbut estimates are we need as much as $5 billion in order to do that. So \nthis represents just a downpayment. We need to pass the Federal highway \nbill in order to complete our work.\n\n  As I pointed out, our State has currently about 27 million people. By \n2040, it is estimated to reach as many as 45 million people. So we need \nthis infrastructure, but we are not alone. We are not unique in that \nsense. Every State needs transportation infrastructure to keep people \nand goods moving in order to continue to grow our economy because a \ngrowing economy creates jobs and opportunity, and the one thing we need \nin this country is a growing economy.\n  Last year, in 2014, the Texas economy grew at 5.2 percent. The U.S. \neconomy grew at 2.2 percent. That is why, because of that 3-point \ndifferential, we have created more jobs in Texas--or seen jobs created \nby the private sector, I should say--than anywhere else in the country. \nIf we fail to pass a multiyear transportation bill, if we somehow \ndecide to shoot ourselves in the foot and fail in this important \neffort, we will have only ourselves to blame, and we will be \ncontributing to the problem rather than contributing to the solution.\n  The resources provided for in this legislation will help relieve \nurban congestion, upgrade rural routes, and improve the overall safety \nand efficiency of our highways. It is something our friends across the \naisle just a few short weeks ago said they wanted. They said they were \nworried about this impending deadline coming up where we needed to do \nsomething, and they were predicting that perhaps we would just have \nanother patch. They called for a longer term highway bill. So I would \nurge our colleagues to take yes for an answer.\n  Thanks to the good work done by Chairman Hatch of the Committee on \nFinance and a lot of work on a bipartisan basis across the aisle, we \nhave actually come up with enough money--enough legitimate pay-fors--to \npass a 3-year transportation bill with the prospect, if we can come up \nwith some additional funds through international tax reform, to \nbackfill the final 3 years. So nothing here actually precludes that \neffort. Nothing cuts that off. This is, I think, part of doing our\n\n[[Page S5191]]\n\nbasic job as Members of the Congress. It is not particularly attractive \nor sexy or interesting, but it is about competence, it is about doing \nour job, and it is about putting the American people's interests first.\n  So I hope by tomorrow our colleagues will have had a chance to \nsatisfy themselves and understand the pay-fors in this bill, \nrecognizing that most of this information has been out there in the \npublic domain for a long, long time. I am not asking them to like it, I \nam not asking them to fall in love with the pay-fors, but I am asking \nthem to let us go forward and to let the Senate be the Senate. Let \npeople offer their ideas, hopefully get votes on constructive \nsuggestions, eventually pass this legislation, and send it over to the \nHouse, where I predict, if it comes out of the Senate with a good \nstrong vote, our friends in the House will take it up and pass it and \nsend it to the President, and we will have fulfilled our \nresponsibility.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, let me add my voice to this bipartisan \nchorus. It is embarrassing to the United States of America that we are \nnow in the midst of our 33rd short-term extension of the highway trust \nfund.\n  This 60-day extension ends in 10 days. It is true and the Senator \nfrom Texas is correct that many of us have come to the floor and said \nthis is beneath the dignity of a great nation--that we cannot invest in \nour own economy, in our own business growth. Building the highways and \nbridges and the mass transit that sustains a great nation takes a \ndetermined long-term effort.\n  Now, there are those--not on our side of the aisle, but there are \nthose--who question whether the Federal Government should be involved \nin this at all. The so-called devolution movement argues, I understand, \nthat this really should be a State and local matter: Get the Federal \nGovernment out of the business of planning the transportation grid for \nAmerica.\n  I have three words for those people who believe that: Dwight David \nEisenhower, a Republican President who, in the 1950s, had the vision \nand determination, once he had seen the autobahn in Germany, to say \nthat the United States of America needs an interstate highway system \nfor its national defense. That is how he sold it. He sold it to a \nbipartisan Congress, and we have lived with that benefit ever since.\n  Our generation and even those before us have inherited the vision of \nthat President and Members of Congress who said: Let us invest in the \nlong-term development of America.\n  Think about your own home State and what interstate highways mean to \nyour economy. In my State, if you are a town lucky enough to live next \nto an interstate, you are bound to have a good economy. And if you are \nblessed with the intersection of two interstates, hold on tight, \nbecause the opportunities are limitless.\n  So that generation 60 years ago had a vision. The question is, Do we \nhave a vision? We certainly don't with 60-day extensions with the \nhighway trust fund. That is why when Senator McConnell on the \nRepublican side offered a long-term approach, 3 years--I wish it were \n6--but 3 years actually paid for, I believe we should take it \nseriously.\n  One Senator among us, Senator Boxer of California, did. As chairman \nof the Environment and Public Works Committee, Barbara Boxer rolled up \nher sleeves and started negotiating, crafting an agreement.\n  How about this for an assignment. We said to Senator Boxer: Come up \nwith a long-term highway trust fund bill, get it through four different \ncommittees to the satisfaction of at least the majority of the 45 other \nDemocratic Senators, work out your differences, and report to us in 10 \ndays. She did. I have to give credit to her, as big as this bill may \nbe--and by Senate standards it is one of the larger ones--it was an \nundertaking she took seriously and we should take seriously too. Now \nthat we have the bill, there is no excuse. There is plenty of time to \nread this. Don't believe that every word on every page is valuable, but \nlet's go through it carefully and make sure we understand completely \nwhat we are doing before we vote. That was the cloture vote we had \nearlier today.\n  When I went home over this weekend and called leaders in my State--I \ncalled the CEOs of two major corporations, I called the labor unions, I \ncalled the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and they were over the moon and \nhappy with the notion that we are finally going to come up with at \nleast a 3-year highway trust fund bill.\n  I will be reading this carefully. In the course of reading it, I hope \nI can come to the conclusion that this is the right answer to move us \nforward to build our infrastructure for the next generation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/21/senate-section/article/S5191-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5191-S5194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NUCLEAR AGREEMENT WITH IRAN\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, when President Obama came to office, he \nlooked out at the threats across America, and there were four hard-\ntarget threats: Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran. The situation in \nIran was particularly worrisome because there was a recurrent belief \nthat Iran was developing nuclear weapons. I have heard critics ask: \nWell, what difference would it make? How foolish would it be for Iran \nto launch a nuclear weapon against anyone? Every nuclear weapon that is \nlaunched has a return address, and that country will pay dearly for a \nreckless decision such as that. But the fear the President had and we \nshared was that if Iran developed a nuclear weapon in the Middle East, \nit would trigger an arms race, and many other countries in that \nvolatile region of the world would then seek to develop their own \nnuclear weapons and the potential conflagration was incredible.\n  There was also a concern that one of the first targets of Iran would \nbe our close ally and friend, the nation of Israel. It is easy to reach \nthat conclusion when you read and hear the rhetoric of the rightwing in \nIran, which will not even recognize Israel's right to exist. President \nObama set out to do something about it.\n  It was clear from our experience in Iraq and Afghanistan that sending \nin American troops was something that had to be thought about long and \nhard. We have the best military in the world, but let's face it, what \nwe faced in Iraq with roadside bombs maimed and killed so many American \nsoldiers that we realized this new world of asymmetric military \nconfrontation didn't guarantee that the best military in the world \nwould have an easy time of it.\n  We ended up with almost 5,000 casualties in Iraq and nearly 3,000 now \nin Afghanistan, and Afghanistan turned out to be the longest war in \nU.S. history. This President and the American people were reluctant to \nface another military confrontation.\n  This President made a decision. I have talked to him about it. He \ndecided every leader from every country who came in to see him would be \nasked to join in an effort to impose sanctions on Iran to bring them to \nthe negotiating table over the issue of their nuclear capability.\n  The President put together an incredible coalition because we learned \nlong ago unilateral sanctions are not worth much, but if you can bring \nmany nations around the world into a common purpose of putting the \npressure on a country, it can have a positive impact.\n  The coalition the President put together was amazing; witness the \nnegotiations themselves where China and Russia were sitting at the same \nside of the table as the United States and the European Union--England \nand France--and many other countries joined us in imposing these \neconomic sanctions when they had little to gain and a lot to lose when \nit came to the oil resources of Iran. The President's determination to \nput the sanctions on Iran was for the purpose of bringing them to the \nnegotiating table. That diplomatic gathering would literally have been \nthe first meeting in 35 years between Iran and the United States, \nrepresenting that period of time when our relationship with Iran had \nreached its lowest possible point. At this point, the goal of the \nnegotiation was very clear: stop Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.\n  How real was the threat that they were developing such a weapon? If \nyou go back in time and read the quotes from the Prime Minister of \nIsrael Benjamin Netanyahu, for years--more than 10 years--he has been \nwarning that the Iranians were close to developing a nuclear weapon. It \nwas a matter of weeks, months, a year at the\n\n[[Page S5192]]\n\nmost by most of his estimates. Of course, Israel, more concerned than \nmost about the nuclear threat, warned the world of what would happen if \nIran developed a nuclear weapon.\n  Last week, after lengthy negotiations, the President announced with \nIran and the others who sat at the table--P5+1, as they are known in \nshorthand--that they had reached an agreement with Iran.\n  It was interesting to watch the reaction of Members of Congress. \nThere were some Members of Congress who condemned that agreement before \nit was even released to the public. You see, 47 Members of the other \nside in the Senate had sent a letter to the Ayatollah in Iran during \nthe course of negotiations, before any agreement was reached, warning \nhim and his nation not to negotiate with this President of the United \nStates.\n  That was unprecedented. That had never happened before in American \nhistory--when a political party reached out to a sworn enemy of the \nUnited States and gave them advice not to speak to our leader. That \nletter went on to say that even though you think you reached an \nagreement between Iran and the United States, don't be misled; \nultimately, Congress would have the last word on that agreement.\n  It was no surprise in that environment that so many Senators and \nCongressmen from the other side of the aisle instantaneously condemned \nthis agreement. Some of us decided to take a little time and perhaps \nreflect on it, read it, and reach out to people who were involved in \nit.\n  I took last week to read the 100-plus pages of this agreement and to \ntalk further to our Nation's top experts, including the Secretary of \nEnergy Ernest Moniz, Secretary of State John Kerry, and others, about \nthis agreement, hoping I could come to understand exactly what was \nbeing offered by way of stopping Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.\n  I am under no illusions about the Iranian regime. Its support for \nterrorist groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas is well documented, its \nabysmal human rights record is well known, and its brutal suppression \nof its own people during the 2009 election in Iran is well documented.\n  Iran also continues to hold a number of Americans on outrageous \ncharges, including Amir Hekmati, Saeed Abedini, and the Washington Post \nreporter Jason Rezaian.\n  I joined a few years ago, in 2007, with Republican Senator Gordon \nSmith in introducing the Iran Counter-Proliferation Act--key components \nof which became the basis for a strict petroleum sanctions regime that \nhelped bring Iran to the negotiating table.\n  I voted for all the key sanctions bills against Iran, and I have \ntried to be a consistent voice for increasing military assistance to \nIsrael. When I chaired the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I was \nproud to double the Iron Dome funding request of Israel for their own \ndefense of their nation.\n  The agreement before us is a comprehensive solution to the nuclear \nweapons issue with Iran. Without a nuclear weapon to embolden Iran, the \nagreement allows the United States and its allies to better deter \nIran's destabilizing actions.\n  Let's take a reflective moment and look at the history--recent \nhistory--in the United States. Strong leaders and nations such as the \nUnited States meet and talk to their enemies and negotiate when it is \nin their national interest.\n  It was John Kennedy who said: ``We should never negotiate out of \nfear, but we should never fear to negotiate.''\n  These kinds of negotiations aren't an example of weakness but in most \ncases are an example of strength, and sometimes the benefits aren't \nobvious immediately; they are realized over time. It is simply common \nsense. It has been the practice of this Nation, America, for \ngenerations, regardless of who is President, to meet and try to \nnegotiate for a more peaceful world. Throughout our history, American \nleaders have successfully and aggressively used diplomacy, Presidents \nof both political parties.\n  In 1962, the Cuban Missile Crisis. We faced the prospect of a nuclear \nwar, a standoff with the nation, where we knew and they knew they had \nthe capacity to detonate a nuclear weapon in the United States. Few \nrealize how close we came to a nuclear confrontation.\n  There were many hawks in Washington during President John Kennedy's \nadministration who said let's take them on. Some even suggested a full \ninvasion of Cuba, but John Kennedy wisely pursued a careful balance of \nstrength and diplomacy, using a blockade and negotiations to bring us \nback from the brink.\n  Few people knew the Kennedy administration was secretly negotiating \nwith the Soviets while the Cuban Missile Crisis was unfolding, and \nultimately President Kennedy agreed to remove American nuclear-armed \nJupiter missiles from Turkey and Italy as part of an agreement that \nSoviet Premier Khrushchev remove Soviet nuclear missiles from Cuba.\n  Are we going to say now in reflection that John Kennedy should never \nhave negotiated during this crisis because the Soviets were out to \ndestabilize the world and to spread communism?\n  Let's not forget when John Kennedy entered into this negotiation, the \nSoviet Union had not only placed nuclear missiles in Cuba--they were in \nthe process of placing them--but it was occupying Eastern Europe and \ntrying to spread communism around the world. The bloody Korean war, \nwhere my two brothers served in the U.S. Navy, was a war in which the \nSoviets helped the North Koreans against the United States. Yet we sat \ndown and negotiated with the Soviet Union.\n  Fast forward a few years. In 1972, then-President Nixon traveled to \nCommunist Red China to begin establishing normalized relations. China \nwasn't a friend of the United States. It was a key supporter of the \nNorth Vietnamese, who were ruthlessly fighting and killing U.S. forces \nin Vietnam at that same time.\n  In fact, during Nixon's visit with then-Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai, \nChina was sending more weapons to the North Vietnamese. This was \nhappening even while Nixon was asking China to end its support for the \nNorth Vietnamese.\n  China's regime was also fomenting Communist revolutionary movements \nin Asia, including Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand--all against the \nU.S. interests.\n  Domestically, in China, Chinese leader Mao Zedong had persecuted \nmillions of his own people as part of the brutal Cultural Revolution. I \nrecognize, as President Nixon did then, that it is hard to enter into \nnegotiations with a regime as nefarious as China, and just as with Iran \ntoday, many conservatives denounced Republican President Nixon for \ndoing so. However, as China's sphere of influence grew and relations \nbetween the United States and the Soviet Union deteriorated, many in \nboth parties--including President Nixon--recognized it was time to \nchange.\n  Nelson Rockefeller, President Nixon's rival for the Republican \nnomination in 1968, called for more contact and communication. It was \nformer Vice President Hubert Humphrey, a Democrat, who proposed the \nbuilding of bridges to the people of mainland China. Then-Senator Ted \nKennedy recognized President Nixon's diplomatic efforts toward China as \na ``magnificent gesture.'' Other Members of the Democratic-controlled \nCongress agreed.\n  There was a time when foreign policy was bipartisan. There was a time \nwhen Democrats would speak up defending a Republican President, even \nwhen the most conservative Members of his own party were condemning \nhim.\n  Over time, President Nixon's decision paid dividends in America's \ninterest. China moderated its foreign policy and established better \nrelations with our country.\n  These relations aren't perfect, but we know we made progress and we \nare in negotiations. China sat with us on the same side of the table \ntrying to stop Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.\n  More recently in the late 1980s, President Ronald Reagan began \ndiscussions with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev on the possibility of \nnuclear arms reductions. It was inconceivable when those talks started \nin October of 1986 that they could really negotiate. Who would imagine \nthat these two countries, the United States and the Soviet Union, with \nthousands of nuclear warheads pointed at one another, could actually \nsit down and reach an agreement limiting the use of nuclear weapons? \nThe Cold War was far from over at that time.\n\n[[Page S5193]]\n\n  In 1979 Soviet forces invaded Afghanistan and continued to attempt to \nspread communism. That led President Carter to halt efforts to \nnegotiate the SALT II Strategic Arms Limitations Treaty. The list of \nSoviet aggression at that moment in time was lengthy. Yet it was \nPresident Ronald Reagan who said he would sit down and negotiate with \nthe Soviet Union.\n  I have an excerpt here from the January 17, 1988, New York Times \nabout the opposition Ronald Reagan faced in negotiating an arms \nagreement with the Soviet Union. It may sound familiar to what we are \nhearing today about President Obama's efforts in Iran.\n\n       Already, right-wing groups . . . have mounted a strong \n     campaign against the INF treaty. They have mailed out close \n     to 300,000 letters opposing it. They have circulated 5,000 \n     cassette recordings of Gen. Bernard Rogers, former Supreme \n     Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, \n     attacking it. And finally, they are preparing to run \n     newspaper ads this month savaging Reagan as a new Neville \n     Chamberlain, signing an accord with Hitler and gullibly \n     predicting ``peace for our time.''\n\n  These were conservative Republican critics of President Ronald \nReagan, who was negotiating with the Soviet Union to try to limit the \nspread of nuclear weapons and was being likened to Neville Chamberlain. \nDoes that sound familiar?\n  In May of 1987, the conservative National Review magazine had a cover \nwith the title ``Reagan's Suicide Pact.''\n  President Reagan eventually agreed with then-Secretary of State \nSchultz that arms control could and would improve U.S. national \nsecurity.\n  In December of 1987, Reagan and Gorbachev signed the Intermediate-\nRange Nuclear Forces Treaty, committing the two superpowers to \neliminate all of their nuclear and conventional ground-launched \nballistic and cruise missiles with ranges of 500 to 5,500 kilometers. \nThis treaty, the Reagan-Gorbachev Soviet Union arms control treaty, was \none of the first to rely on extensive onsite negotiations for \nverification.\n  Do you remember who coined the phrase ``trust but verify''? It was \nRonald Reagan in his negotiations with the Soviet Union. It took 5 \nmonths after Ronald Reagan reached this agreement for this Chamber to \nvote 93 to 5 in favor of that treaty at a time when the Democrats had a \nmajority. I could go through the long list of Democratic Senators who \nsupported President Ronald Reagan in his efforts to try to create a \nmore peaceful world.\n  Ultimately, because of that agreement, more than 2,000 short-,\nmedium-, and intermediate-range missiles were destroyed. Our \nrelationship with the Soviet Union didn't improve overnight, and we \ncertainly still have our problems with them today. But going back to \nwhat I said earlier, the Russians sat on the same side of the table as \nthe United States in this negotiation for this agreement to end the \nthreat, or at least delay the threat, of nuclear power and nuclear \nweapons in Iran.\n  Imagine if 47 Senators, during the course of Ronald Reagan's \nnegotiation with Gorbachev, had written in the middle of those \nnegotiations to Mr. Gorbachev and said: Ignore President Ronald Reagan; \ndon't negotiate with him because we are not going to accept it here in \nCongress. If that had happened, there would have been cries of treason \nfor sending that kind of letter. It didn't happen. Those were the days \nwhen there was a bipartisan approach to foreign policy in the United \nStates.\n  Today we have a chance and an opportunity with Iran that hasn't \npresented itself for more than 30 years--the opportunity to prevent \nIran from developing nuclear weapons. It is not going to solve all the \nproblems with Iran overnight, but it does solve, I believe, one \ncritical problem. The agreement retains U.S. freedom of action to \ncounter Iran in any part of the world.\n  After all, if Ronald Reagan didn't stop trying to counter Soviet \nactions after negotiating an arms treaty with Gorbachev, President \nObama will not and should not stop working to diminish Iran's influence \nafter this agreement.\n  I am under no illusions that for some period Iran did pursue a \nnuclear bomb. If that had happened, it would have been disastrous. And \nI am under no illusions that Iran lied in the past about these efforts. \nI know they did. But the agreement reached last week provides \nunprecedented safeguards and inspections to prevent Iran from building \nnuclear weapons now or in the future.\n  The United States and its allies are strong enough to enter into this \nagreement, not because Iran is suddenly trustworthy or an open \ndemocracy but because it serves our national security interests to do \nit.\n  Secretary of State John Kerry, Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz, and \nUnder Secretary of State Wendy Sherman negotiated this agreement with a \nsingle focus: Prevent Iran from getting any closer to obtaining a \nnuclear weapon. They achieved that goal, and that is why I am \nsupporting this effort by the President to bring a more stable and \npeaceful situation to the Middle East.\n  To appreciate the magnitude of their challenge, let's step back and \ntake stock of Iran's nuclear weapons program as it is today before this \nagreement goes in place. Iran currently has enough nuclear material to \nmake 10 nuclear weapons. It has more than 19,000 centrifuges, many of \nwhich are more advanced and powerful. Immediately prior to the interim \nagreement with the P5+1, Iran was enriching its uranium to 20 percent. \nThe breakout time--the time it would take for Iran to develop a nuclear \nweapon--was estimated to be 3 months. It was an incredibly large and \ndangerous nuclear capability, growing at a significant rate, and \nvirtually unconstrained. That is what this President inherited from the \nprevious administration.\n  But thanks to this effort, this agreement cuts off every single one \nof Iran's potential pathways to a bomb. It shrinks major portions of \ntheir nuclear infrastructure. It eliminates many parts of it. It \nextends the breakout time to at least 1 year. Should Iran renege on \nthis and decide they are going forward with a nuclear weapon, we \nbelieve that under this agreement it will take them at least a year to \nachieve it--a year in which we can put pressure and more, if necessary.\n  The agreement reduces Iran's uranium stockpile by 98 percent, cuts \nits number of centrifuges by more than two-thirds, and for the next 15 \nyears, caps its enrichment at 3.67 percent. It prevents Iran's \nunderground facility at Fordow from being used for uranium enrichment.\n  Iran is required to change its heavy water reactor at Arak so that it \ncan no longer produce weapons-grade plutonium. How will we know? \nBecause we are helping to design and to monitor the fuel in and out of \nthis facility and verifying it every step of the way.\n  All of us have deep suspicions about Iran's nuclear ambitions, and we \nshould. What if they try to build a secret facility? Well, our \nnegotiating team, led by an extraordinary man, Secretary of Energy \nMoniz, designed a verification plan with no exits. Our team thought \nlong and hard over the last 2 years about how we might be able to stop \ncheating. For every potential technique, they embedded a countermeasure \nin the text of the agreement.\n  This weekend Secretary Moniz explained that it would be ``virtually \nimpossible'' to hide nuclear activities under this agreement. It is the \nstrongest nuclear verification system ever imposed on a peaceful \nnation. Its end result is that Iran will not be able to do anything of \nsignificance without being caught. And going back to Ronald Reagan, our \ninspectors will be on the ground.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. This agreement requires the IAEA to have 24/7 access to \nall of Iran's declared nuclear facilities. This means in-person \ninspectors, remote cameras, tamperproof seals--all of the world's most \nsophisticated detection technologies. As one nuclear expert commented \nlast week, ``If a rat enters a nuclear facility [in Iran], we will know \nit.''\n  Critically, this intrusive monitoring goes all the way into the \nnuclear supply chain, from uranium mines to centrifuge production. We \ncover it all in this agreement.\n  It will allow IAEA inspectors to follow every ounce of uranium from \nthe ground to its final destination, and every piece of nuclear \ninfrastructure from its creation to its use. If Iran\n\n[[Page S5194]]\n\ntries to divert anything to a covert facility, we will know.\n  This agreement also sets up a dedicated procurement channel. Any \ndual-use item Iran wants to purchase from the international community \nmust go through this channel.\n  The U.S. and its allies have a veto over such purchases. It makes it \nalmost impossible for Iran to import anything of benefit to a nuclear \nweapons program.\n  Lastly, Iran must also abide by the Additional Protocol forever. This \nallows the IAEA to have access to non-nuclear sites in a timely \nfashion, in as little as 2 hours. The agreement also requires any \ndisputes over access to these non-nuclear sites to be resolved in short \norder. If not, Iran would be in violation of its commitments and \nsanctions could quickly snap back.\n  Critics have complained about the time period our nuclear experts \nnegotiated. But as Secretary Moniz and many others with Ph.D.'s have \npointed out, uranium has a half-life of 4.5 billion years. It doesn't \ndisappear like invisible ink. It cannot be cleaned up in a matter of \nweeks. If Iran cheats, we will know.\n  President Reagan was correct to negotiate with the Soviets when there \nwere strategic openings and President Obama is doing the same thing \nwith the Iranians. The potential benefits of this deal are too \nsignificant, and the costs of not doing so too high, to just walk away.\n  If we walked away, the international sanctions regime would crumble \nand Iran would have few if any restrictions on its program. Imposing \nmore sanctions or simply bombing Iran today would create an even \ngreater security risk to the region.\n  In fact, if we bombed Iran today, it would almost certainly withdraw \nfrom the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and kick out inspectors. As \nsoon as that happens, Iran's nationalistic backlash would almost assure \nthat the regime would build a nuclear bomb. Over the longer term, if \nIran were to fail or cheat despite its international commitment, we \nretain the right to use military force and we would be in a much better \nposition internationally to do so. And accepting this deal does nothing \nto stop the U.S. and allied efforts from countering Iran's behavior \nelsewhere in the world. Key sanctions on Iran's support for terrorist \ngroups will remain in place. Our support for regional allies will \nremain strong, if not stronger. And, critically, an Iran determined to \ndestabilize parts of the Middle East with a nuclear weapon in its \narsenal, will no longer be an option.\n  No doubt this is why some 60 of the most respected names in foreign \npolicy, Democrats and Republicans alike, recently wrote in support of \nthis agreement. Those signing included Secretary of State Madeleine \nAlbright; Secretary of Defense William Perry; Secretary of the Treasury \nPaul O'Neill; National Security Advisors Zbigniew Brzezinski and Brent \nScowcroft; Under Secretaries of State Nicholas Burns and Thomas \nPickering; U.S. Ambassadors Ryan Crocker and Stuart Eizenstat; U.S. \nSenators Tom Daschle, Carl Levin, George Mitchell, Nancy Landon \nKassebaum, and many others. We should do the same and support this \nagreement in the Senate.\n  I see the Senator from South Dakota is here, and I will wrap up.\n  Let me conclude. When I sat down to read this agreement--and I don't \nknow how many of my colleagues have--I was struck on the third page \nwith this statement in the agreement with Iran: Iran reaffirms that \nunder no circumstances will Iran ever seek, develop or acquire any \nnuclear weapon. That is quite a statement. It was our goal at this \nnegotiation. Do I believe it? Some, but I have my doubts. That is why \nwe had to have an inspections regime from the Iranian mines right \nthrough the production facilities. That is why we had to dramatically \ncut back on their capacity to build weapons-grade fuel, and that is why \nthis agreement is now--most of the countries believe--moving us in the \nright direction in Iran.\n  There are critics. We heard a lot of them here in the Senate. There \nisn't a single critic who has stepped up with a better idea. They said: \nWell, let's go back to the sanctions regime. The countries that joined \nus in that sanctions regime did it to bring Iran to the negotiating \ntable, and it worked. They now have an agreement they believe in and we \nshould believe in too. To think that we are going to renew sanctions or \nplace unilateral sanctions--that to me is not likely to occur if Iran \nlives up to the terms of this agreement.\n  I will add the other alternative. We know the cost of war. We know it \nin human lives, we know it in the casualties that return, and we know \nit in the cost to the American people. Given a choice between the \ninvasion of Iran or working in a diplomatic fashion toward a \nnegotiation so we can lessen this threat in the world, I think \nPresident Obama made the right choice.\n  I support this administration's decision to go forward with this \nagreement. I will be adding my vote to the many in the Senate in the \nhopes that we can see a new day dawning and in the hopes too that like \nPresident Nixon and President Reagan and even like other Presidents \nbefore us who have sat down to negotiate with our enemies, at the end \nof the day we will be a safer and stronger nation because of it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/21/senate-section/article/S5194-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5194-S5195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE HIGHWAY BILL\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I will speak about the Iran nuclear \nagreement in just a moment. But before I do that, I will briefly talk \nabout the legislation before us on the floor, and that is the \nreauthorization of the highway bill, which is something we have to do \non a fairly regular basis around here. Every so many years the \nauthority to spend out of the highway trust fund expires, and we can't \nfund the infrastructure needs that our country has in terms of roads, \nbridges, construction, maintenance, and all of those things that are so \nimportant to our competitive economy.\n  This week we have an opportunity to do something that hasn't been \ndone around here in a long time, and that is to fund a multiyear \nhighway bill. The reason that is important is because people who rely \nupon highway funding that comes through the highway trust fund need to \nbe able to make plans. State departments of transportation, those who \nare involved in the construction, such as contractors, and all the \npeople who are involved and the jobs that are associated with this \nprocess need the certainty that comes with a long-term bill.\n  Today I was told that there have been 33 short-term extensions over \nthe last few years since the last long-term highway bill was passed, I \nbelieve, somewhere around the 2005 timeframe. I was part of that. I was \na member of the Environment and Public Works Committee at the time. I \nworked on highway bills as far back as my days in the House of \nRepresentatives, when I served on the Transportation and Infrastructure \nCommittee. This is something that we have to do here on a regular basis \nif we are going to ensure that we have a competitive infrastructure in \nthis country suitable to moving people and goods in a way that keeps \nour economy moving forward and growing. That is why, in my view, when \nwe have an opportunity to get a multiyear bill, we shouldn't pass on \nit.\n  If we continue to pass 6-month and 1-year extensions, all we are \nsimply doing is kicking the can down the road. I would say that 33 \nshort-term extensions is not a very good way to run a railroad and \ncertainly not a very good way to run a highway program.\n  I know there are going to be differences. The committee that I chair, \nthe commerce committee, was involved with marking up portions of the \nhighway bill that pertained to highway safety and some railroad \nprovisions and other items that would be included in this bill. We \nworked on that through the weekend, and I think we addressed many of \nthe concerns that Members on both sides had, and I feel very good about \nwhere that part of the bill is. I worked as a member of the Finance \nCommittee and tried to find ways to pay for this.\n  If we can get a multiyear bill in place that provides the certainty, \nthe predictability, and the reliability that we need in our highway \nfunding process in this country, it would be a very good thing. As we \nall know, it is incredibly important to economic growth and to jobs. \nThe certainty that comes with a long-term bill is something that we all \nought to strive for.\n\n[[Page S5195]]\n\n  So I hope, notwithstanding the differences that exist in the vote we \nhad earlier, that tomorrow when we take up this legislation again we \nwill get the votes that are necessary to proceed to the bill and begin \nto move forward with the process in the hopes that we might get \nsomething to the House that they might be able to act on and then we \ncan get it to the President's desk. Then, at least for the foreseeable \nfuture, we can get this issue dealt with so we don't have to come back \nand do this every 6 months or every 3 months or whatever those 33 \nextensions have consisted of over the past few years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/21/senate-section/article/S5195-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5195-S5196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NUCLEAR AGREEMENT WITH IRAN\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, former President Jimmy Carter was recently \nasked about President Obama's successes on the world stage. He said in \nresponse:\n\n       I think they've been minimal. . . . [O]n the world stage, \n     just to be as objective about it as I can, I can't think of \n     many nations in the world where we have a better relationship \n     now than we did when he took over.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       If you look at Russia, if you look at England, if you look \n     at China, if you look at Egypt and so forth--I'm not saying \n     it's his fault--but we have not improved our relationship \n     with individual countries and I would say that the United \n     States influence and prestige and respect in the world is \n     probably lower now than it was six or seven years ago.\n\n  That is former President Jimmy Carter describing current President \nObama's foreign policies. Unfortunately, that is an accurate assessment \nof President Obama's rocky history on foreign policy.\n  Last week's deal with Iran does not look likely to improve the \nPresident's record of minimal success on the world stage. Last week the \nadministration announced that the United States--along with five other \nnations--had reached an agreement with Iran that the administration \nclaims will prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. The contents \nof the agreement, however, were met with skepticism and concern from a \nnumber of quarters.\n  Former Senator and Democratic Presidential candidate Jim Webb said \nthat the deal sends a signal that ``we, the United States, are \naccepting the eventuality that they will acquire a nuclear weapon.''\n  The senior Senator from New Jersey said, ``The bottom line is: The \ndeal doesn't end Iran's nuclear program--it preserves it.''\n  The Washington Post noted that Tehran ``fought for, and won, some \ntroubling compromises'' on inspections, especially considering Iran's \nrecord of violations. The Post also pointed out what many Republicans \nhave noted--that ``Mr. Obama settled for terms far short of those he \noriginally aimed for.''\n  Israel, the only functioning democracy in the Middle East, called \nthis deal a ``historic mistake,'' and neighboring countries like Saudi \nArabia expressed concern that this agreement may actually increase the \nthreat Iran poses to their security.\n  Then, of course, there was Iran's reaction. Iran's President hailed \nthe agreement, while Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei \npraised negotiators.\n  Lest anyone think this marked a softening of Iran's attitude toward \nthe United States, however, Khamenei emphasized that ``our policy \ntoward the arrogant U.S. government won't change at all.'' Echoing the \nchants coming from the people, he stated, ``You heard `Death to \nIsrael,' `Death to the U.S.' . . . we ask Almighty God to accept these \nprayers by the people of Iran.''\n  These are not the words of a reliable partner. These are the words of \nthe world's leading state sponsor of terrorism.\n  There is good reason to be concerned about this agreement. This deal \nnot only fails to provide reassurance that Iran will not acquire a \nnuclear weapon, it may actually enhance Iran's chances of acquiring a \nbomb.\n  For starters, this deal fails to include any adequate method of \nverifying that Iran is complying with the agreement. Time and time \nagain, Iran has made it clear that it cannot be trusted to comply with \nany deal. Iran has a history of building nuclear facilities in secret. \nThe enrichment facility at Fordow, which will remain in place as part \nof this agreement, is just one example of an enrichment facility that \nwas originally hidden from the outside world. The fact that Iran cannot \nbe relied on to follow the outlines of an agreement means that \nverification--specifically, ``anytime, anywhere'' inspections of \nsuspicious sites--is an essential part of any credible deal. But the \nfinal deal that emerged doesn't come close to ensuring anytime, \nanywhere inspections. It does provide for 24/7 inspections of Iran's \ncurrently known nuclear sites, but it forces inspectors to request \naccess to any other site they deem suspicious. Iran can refuse \nrequests, and appealing those refusals could take close to a month, \nleaving the Iranians plenty of time to hide evidence of suspicious \nactivity.\n  Forcing Iran to dismantle its nuclear infrastructure and halt uranium \nenrichment would have provided some assurance that Iran's quest for a \nbomb had been halted. But the nuclear agreement the administration \nhelped reach doesn't require Iran to dismantle any of its nuclear \ninfrastructure. The agreement does require Iran to take some of its \ncentrifuges offline, but they do not have to be removed or dismantled--\nsimply put into storage.\n  The agreement also explicitly allows Iran to continue enriching \nuranium. While it prohibits Iran from enriching uranium to the level \nrequired for a nuclear weapon, the restriction is of limited value \nconsidering that Iran retains the equipment and production capacity it \nwould need to build a bomb.\n  I haven't even mentioned other areas of concern with this agreement.\n  In exchange for Iran's agreeing to--supposedly--stop its effort to \nacquire a nuclear weapon, billions of dollars in Iranian assets will be \nunfrozen and the sanctions that have crippled the Iranian economy will \nbe lifted. Right now, despite its struggling economy, Iran manages to \nprovide funding and other support to Syria's oppressive government, to \nHezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in the Gaza Strip, to Houthi rebels in \nYemen, and to militias in Iraq. It is not hard to imagine what it will \ndo with the billions of dollars it will gain access to under this \nagreement.\n  The deal negotiators reached with Iran will also expand Iranian \naccess to conventional weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles, \nwhich are generally used as a vehicle for the delivery of nuclear \nweapons. While the deal does temporarily extend restrictions on the \nimport of these weapons, it does so for just 5 years in the case of \nconventional weapons and for just 8 years in the case of ballistic \nmissiles. That means that in as few as 8 years, Iran will be able to \npurchase a ballistic missile capable of delivering a nuclear warhead.\n  Obviously, there is a lot to be concerned about when it comes to this \ndeal, and after the agreement was released last week, both Democrats \nand Republicans expressed the desire to examine those provisions and \nhear from members of the administration. So what did the President do? \nHe declared that the agreement was a triumph of diplomacy and took \nimmediate action to send the bill to the United Nations for a vote. \nThat is right. The President didn't wait to hear from Members of \nCongress or the American people; he just went ahead and asked the \nUnited Nations for its approval. In other words, the President \nunilaterally committed the United States to supporting the deal without \nknowing whether the United States Congress or the American people are \nin favor of the agreement. This is especially disappointing considering \nthat just 2\\1/2\\ months ago, Democrats and Republicans in the Senate \nvoted overwhelmingly to require that the President submit full details \nof any nuclear agreement to Congress before it could be agreed to. The \nPresident signed this legislation--the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review \nAct--into law on May 22, but apparently he feels free to ignore the \nspirit, if not the letter, of the act.\n  When word emerged that the President was going to send a resolution \ndirectly to the U.N. without waiting for the American people or \nCongress to weigh in, both Democrats and Republicans asked the \nPresident to hold off. Democrats who requested that the President wait \nto submit the agreement included the leading Democrat on the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, who characterized the White\n\n[[Page S5196]]\n\nHouse's decision as ``somewhat presumptuous,'' and the Democratic whip \nin the House of Representatives, who said, ``I believe that waiting to \ngo to the United Nations until such time as Congress has acted would be \nconsistent with the intent and substance of the Nuclear Agreement \nReview Act.''\n  Circumventing elected Members of Congress to gain the U.N.'s approval \nbefore Congress has had a chance to review the agreement suggests that \nthe President has a higher regard for the United Nation's opinion than \nfor the opinion of the American people.\n  President Obama is apparently betting on the chance that in 10 years' \ntime, Iran's views toward the rest of the world will have changed and \nwill no longer be seeking death to Israel and America or furthering \nterrorism in the Middle East. It is a nice notion, but nothing in \nIran's history of terrorism, violence, and deceit suggests it is a \nscenario that is likely to come to pass. And if it doesn't happen, as a \nresult of this agreement, Iran will be in a much better position to \ndevelop a nuclear weapon than it is today, as even the supporters of \nthis deal acknowledge, not to mention that Iran will be in a position \nto purchase the missiles necessary to deliver nuclear weapons to \nlocations in the Middle East and beyond.\n  During negotiations on this deal, it became obvious that the \nPresident was determined to make reaching an agreement with Iran his \nlegacy. It is possible that he will get his wish, but it may not be the \nlegacy he wanted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as the Presiding Officer knows, as he \nhas suffered through a considerable number of them, this is the 107th \ntime I have come to the floor to urge my colleagues to wake up to the \nthreat of climate change. All over the United States, State by State by \nState, we are already seeing the real effects of carbon pollution. We \nsee it in our atmosphere, we see it in our oceans, and we see it in our \nweather, in habitats, and in species.\n  The American people see it. Two-thirds of Americans, including half \nof Republicans, favor government action to reduce global warming, and \ntwo-thirds, including half of Republicans, would be more likely to vote \nfor a candidate who campaigns on fighting climate change.\n  Polling from the Florida Atlantic University shows that more than 73 \npercent of U.S. Hispanics--a pretty key voting block--think global \nwarming is a serious problem. Sixty-two percent of Republican Hispanics \nare concerned about this. And I have said this before: If you ask \nRepublican voters under the age of 35, they will tell us that climate \ndenial is ``out of touch,'' ``ignorant,'' or ``crazy.'' Those are the \nwords they selected in the poll--not my words.\n  So we might expect Presidential hopefuls to incorporate climate \naction into their campaign platforms. We might expect the Republican \ncandidates to address this problem in an honest and straightforward \nmanner. But we would be wrong. What have we seen from the Presidential \nhopefuls? These candidates avoid any serious talk of climate change \neven as their own home States face climate and ocean disruptions.\n  So in the weeks ahead, I will take a look at the Presidential \ncandidates on climate change and what is up in their home States. Today \nI will look at Florida, home to 20 million Americans, including two of \nthe top Republican Presidential candidates.\n  A swing State with 29 electoral votes, Florida is a major political \nprize. Florida is also ground zero for climate change. With over 1,200 \nmiles of coastline, Florida is uniquely vulnerable, for instance, to \nsea level rise. So what do Florida's two Presidential candidates have \nto say about climate change? Well, it seems they are not sure.\n  ``I don't think the science is clear of what percentage is man-made \nand what percentage is natural. It's convoluted,'' says former Florida \nGovernor Jeb Bush.\n\n       ``[T]here's never been a moment where the climate is not \n     changing,'' says Florida's junior Senator. ``The question is: \n     what percentage of that . . . is due to human activity?''\n\n  Scientists tell us that warming is ``unequivocal''--that is a strong \nword for scientists to use, unequivocal--and that human activity is the \ndominant cause of the changes we have seen--indeed, the only plausibly \nvalid explanation.\n  Both Presidential hopefuls from Florida have invoked the now classic \ndenial line ``I am not a scientist.'' Well, good thing, then, that we \nare not elected to be scientists. We are elected to listen to them. And \nif these two Floridians were listening to their own best scientists, \nthey would learn a lot.\n  In fact, 42 scientists from Florida colleges and universities wrote \nan open letter to Florida State officials. ``It is crucial for \npolicymakers to understand,'' they wrote, ``that human activity is \naffecting the composition of the atmosphere which will lead to adverse \neffects on human economies, health and well being''--not so convoluted \nafter all.\n  The letter continued:\n\n       The problem of climate change is not a hypothetical. \n     Thousands of scientists have studied the issue from a variety \n     of angles and disciplines over many decades. Those of us \n     signing this statement have spent hundreds of years combined \n     studying this problem, not from any partisan political \n     perspective, but as scientists--seekers of evidence and \n     explanations. As a result, we feel uniquely qualified to \n     assist policymakers in finding solutions to adapt and \n     mitigate so we can protect the people of this state and their \n     enterprises and property.\n\n  So it is OK if we are not scientists. The scientists are there to \nhelp. They have offered to, and they understand this.\n  While my Senate colleague from Florida is unsure about his own home \nState climate science, he seems quite certain about the economics of \npolicies to curb carbon pollution, such as cap and trade. ``I can tell \nyou with certainty,'' he has said, ``it would have a devastating impact \non our economy.''\n  I would suggest that the Senator from Florida take a closer look at \nthe facts because his position on these two issues boils down to wrong \nand wronger. I know this because my home State is one of nine \nNortheastern States that require utilities to buy carbon emissions \nallowances. We are actually doing it. The proceeds are directed back \ninto the regional economy through things such as energy efficiency \ninvestments and renewable energy projects. And we have the results. The \nresults are in. Just from 2012 to 2014, the program generated $1.3 \nbillion in economic benefits for New England, and it saved consumers \nover $400 million in energy costs. This climate solution was a boost to \nthe economy, and it cut carbon dioxide emissions in the region by a \nquarter.\n  The Republican candidates from Florida are running against the facts \nand they are running against the opinions of experts and local leaders \nin their own home State. In a June 19 editorial, the Sun Sentinel \npraised Pope Francis's recent encyclical on climate change and its call \nto swift action, because of the threat climate change poses to South \nFlorida. The editors wrote that ``the Pope's declaration puts pressure \non [the candidates] . . . because they are Floridians . . . and because \nthey aspire to be national leaders.'' The editors continue: \n``Candidates who aspire to be inclusive, effective leaders cannot see . \n. . science through a political lens.'' That is the Sun Sentinel.\n  Archbishop Thomas Wenski of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Miami \nexplained Pope Francis's message to the Miami Herald. ``What the Pope \nis saying is, `Let's talk about this,' '' the archbishop said. ``And \nthat requires--whether you're a Democrat or Republican or left or \nright--it requires that you transcend your particular interest or \nideological lens and look at the issue from the common good.''\n  For Florida, that common good is imperiled by climate change. South \nFlorida has seen almost 1 foot of sea level rise in the last 100 years. \nThe Southeast Florida Regional Climate\n\n[[Page S5197]]\n\nCompact is a bipartisan coalition--Republicans and Democrats--of four \nSouth Florida counties. Those four South Florida counties predict that \nthe waters around southeast Florida could surge up to another 2 feet in \nless than 50 years. Our children will live to see that.\n  I visited Florida on my climate tour last year. I heard firsthand \nabout the threats climate change poses to the Sunshine State from Glenn \nLanders, senior engineer at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, \nEverglades Division. Engineer Landers has worked on water resources and \nrestoration projects in Florida for nearly 20 years. This is the map he \nused to show me what just 2 feet of sea level rise means for South \nFlorida. What it means for South Florida is there is a lot less of \nSouth Florida above water.\n  Florida is home to some of the country's top universities and \nresearch institutions. The Florida Climate Institute is a network of \nscientists and research programs from eight universities, including the \nUniversity of Florida, Florida State, and the University of Miami. The \nFlorida Climate Institute is dedicated to ``climate research in service \nof society.'' These are some of Florida's brightest minds.\n  Recognizing businesses' and communities' need for useful data and \nsolutions that are based on Florida's unique characteristics, the \nFlorida Climate Institute publishes research to help improve \nunderstanding of the increasing climate variability in Florida. If \nFlorida's leaders respond responsibly to the changing climate, writes \nthe group, ``Florida is well positioned to become a center of \nexcellence for climate change research and education and a test bed for \ninnovations in climate adaptation.''\n  Well, responsible officials in Florida are already taking action. My \nfriend the senior Senator from Florida took the Senate commerce \ncommittee to Miami Beach town hall to examine the dangers posed by \nrising seas. The Miami Herald said this about Senator Nelson's efforts \nto raise awareness about the threat to his State:\n\n       South Florida owes [Senator] Nelson its thanks for shining \n     a bright light on this issue. Everyone from local residents \n     to elected officials should follow his lead, turning \n     awareness of this major environmental issue into action. It \n     is critical to saving our region.\n\n  In Fort Lauderdale, Mayor Jack Seiler is working with NOAA and State \nand Broward County officials and the South Florida Regional Planning \nCouncil to protect his city from flooding and climate change. Yet on \nclimate change, Florida's own Presidential candidates have got nothing. \nZero. No plan.\n  Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine showed me the huge pumps his city has \ninstalled to pump out the floodwaters that come in on high tides from \nthe rising seas and with storms. Each pump can move 14,000 gallons of \nwater per minute. Imagine that. But Florida's Presidential candidates \nhave no plan.\n  The mayor of Monroe County, Sylvia Murphy, a Republican, has put \nclimate and energy policy at the heart of her 20-year growth plan for \nthe county. Why? Her county covers all of the Florida Keys and some of \nthe Everglades. She is going to lose a lot of it if we don't get ahead \nof this, and she also sees what is happening to her reefs offshore.\n  Yet, despite the overwhelming consensus of scientists in their own \nState, Florida's Republican Presidential candidates have got nothing. \nThe junior Senator from Florida even suggested that we should wait for \nChina to take action before we address this problem.\n  The junior Senator from Florida, on foreign policy, has spoken often \nabout the need for American leadership on issues of global importance, \nsaying, for instance, that America must ``continue to hold this torch'' \nof peace and liberty. Earlier this year, Jeb Bush echoed that \nsentiment, saying, ``American leadership projected consistently and \ngrounded in principle has been a benefit to the world.'' Well, fine \nwords, but where is their leadership on climate change? They got \nnothing.\n  It is our responsibility as a great nation to set an example for \nothers to follow, not to sit back and wait for others to act. Failing \nto act on climate change would both dim our own national torch and give \nother nations an excuse for delay. Failure, with the stakes this high, \nbecomes an argument for our enemies against our very model of \ngovernment. As Pope Francis said, ``The world will not forget this \nfailure of conscience and responsibility.'' We will own that.\n  The question is why Republican Presidential candidates refuse to \nengage on climate change. They ignore their own home State \nuniversities. They ignore their own home State mayors, local officials. \nThey ignore their own home State engineers. Why? Why, when the evidence \nis so plain? Why the pretense that climate solutions are bad for the \neconomy when actual experience proves that is not true? Why the \npretense? Why can't they credibly speak about America's responsibility \nto lead? Why would they have us ignore one of the most pressing \nnational and global issues of our time?\n  All I can hope, for their sake and for ours, is that they soon wake \nup.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I ask to speak for up to 5 minutes in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/21/senate-section/article/S5197-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5197-S5198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU\n\n  Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, 5 years ago today, President Obama signed \ninto law the Dodd-Frank Act. Following the 2008 financial crisis, \nWashington passed this 2,300-page bill, creating more burdensome \nregulations that did not solve the crisis, and, in many ways, made it \nworse. You are going to hear a lot about the failures of the Dodd-Frank \nAct over the next few years.\n  From what was intended to rein in five major banks who led us into \ntrouble in the 2008 crisis, has created unintended consequences today \nthat are affecting thousands of small town regional banks across our \ncountry. I rise today to speak about one agency created by the Dodd-\nFrank law, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or the CFPB. While \nmany Americans may not have heard of the CFPB before, they will in the \nfuture. This agency touches every aspect of people's lives, from credit \ncard records, mortgage applications, student loans, and car sales to \nmuch more.\n  The CFPB seemingly knows more about American consumers than we know \nabout the very agency that is supposed to be protecting them. According \nto a report by the Government Accountability Office, every month the \nCFPB scrubs data on credit card transactions, debit card transactions, \nconsumer mortgage loans, car loans, and hundreds of thousands of other \npersonal financial information. This leads to several questions. Why \nare they collecting this information in the first place? How does \ncollecting credit card statements help protect consumers? How secure is \nall of this data?\n  Unfortunately, we know very little about what the CFPB is doing with \nall of this sensitive information, except looking for additional \nopportunities to regulate. Remember, before 2009 we already had six \nprudential regulators mandated, among other things, to protect the \nconsumer. Yet as a result of 2008, instead of streamlining and \nconsolidating, we actually added a seventh prudential regulator charged \nwith consumer protection, the CFPB.\n  Today, the CFPB operates on top of the existing regulators, in \naddition to--not in replacement of--these agencies, and duplicating \nefforts among these other agencies. By design, Dodd-Frank ensured that \nthe CFPB does not have the same oversight control as other agencies. \nCurrently, Congress does not even have control over how the Bureau \nspends its funds or is even appropriated.\n  The CFPB operates outside the regular appropriations process of \nCongress, which other independent agencies, such as the Securities and \nExchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission, and others, are all subject to. Why would any \ngovernment agency with access to that much consumer data be \nunaccountable to Congress? Recently, I introduced legislation to help \nshed more light on this agency and bring the CFPB under the \nappropriations process of the Congress. The sheer volume of consumer \ndata being collected by the CFPB is concerning and ripe for abuse.\n\n[[Page S5198]]\n\n  In fact, the GAO and the Federal Reserve inspector general both have \nwarned about the need for increased security. Without full \ncongressional oversight, how can we be sure this consumer data is \nsecure? What kind of records does the CFPB keep? How would we know if \nit has been compromised? We have already seen the devastating effect of \ndata breaches all over our Federal Government, and the damage it is \ndoing to the American people across all sectors of our government, \nincluding the most recent OPM data breach, impacting millions of \nAmericans and some of our intelligence assets abroad.\n  We have seen the potential exposure of extremely sensitive national \nsecurity information. Also, we recently had a debate about privacy \nregarding the NSA metadata program. Many of my colleagues expressed \noutrage for the scope of the NSA program, even when the mission was \nprotecting national security. We are now talking about an agency \ncollecting massive amounts of personal consumer data, many times more \ndata than the NSA program.\n  The CFPB's goal claims to be consumer protection. For all we know, \nthis information they are collecting is even more susceptible to \nsecurity threats and security breaches. If there is one thing we can \nagree upon, we need to make sure all Americans' personal information is \nsafe and secure--especially from Washington. If some were upset about \nprivacy in the NSA debate, we should certainly be paying attention to \nwhat the CFPB is doing with this personal information today.\n  Getting the CFPB under congressional oversight should not be a \npartisan issue. In order to protect consumers, we need to know what is \ngoing on in the very government agency tasked with protecting them. \nThat is why we need to put in place more transparency--not less--more \ncontrol, and more oversight. We can start by bringing the CFPB under \ncongressional oversight immediately so we can actually protect \nconsumers and stop the potential for abuse, fraud or identity theft.\n  While this agency was originally designed to protect consumers, one \ncan only wonder how Washington's collecting so much personal \ninformation will actually protect us. I will be speaking much more on \nthis topic as the weeks go by. Let it be said tonight, though, that on \nthe fifth anniversary of Dodd-Frank, we are beginning to look at the \nunintended consequences of this rogue agency, the CFPB.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/21/senate-section/article/S5198-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5198-S5200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             DODD-FRANK ACT\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, first, I would like to thank the Senator \nfrom Georgia for his outstanding comments. He is truly a great addition \nto this body and to the Budget Committee, where I have watched him go \nthrough numbers. I once mentioned that he knew how to balance the \nbudget because he had been in business before, at which point he \ncorrected me and said: In business, you don't get to just balance the \nbudget. He is very correct on that.\n  We are at a point where we cannot afford to just balance the budget. \nWe have to start paying down some of the debt if we expect our kids to \never be able to afford the interest. So I thank him for his comments. I \nam going to pile on with some more comments about some of those same \nthings. I want to talk about what I have talked about several times \nover the past 5 years; that is the Dodd-Frank Act, which passed this \nbody 5 years ago today, July 21, 2010.\n  This mammoth bill, which totaled 2,300 pages, has, 5 years later, led \nto many thousands of pages of rules and regulations. It is estimated \nthat only 238 of the 390 rulemakings required by the law have been \ncompleted--millions of pages, and we still only have 238 of 390 \nrulemakings that the 2,300-page bill required. Theoretically, then, \ntens of thousands of pages of more regulations can be expected in the \ncoming years--regulations that do not fix too big to fail, regulations \nthat unduly burden our community banks and our credit unions, \nregulations that cover a host of industries that did not contribute to \nthe financial crisis. And it does compromise the privacy of Americans.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to expand on these ideas. First \nof all, I would like to point out that I actually read the whole bill. \nI read it. I highlighted it. I put in colored tabs in different \nsections so I could refer to them easily. Then I talked to my \ncolleagues, and I spoke on the floor to raise concerns about the bill \nroping in industries that did not cause the financial crisis, about the \nfact that it did not fix too big to fail. I raised a real ruckus about \nthe creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, known as the \nCFPB, when they were trying to just kind of gloss over it and its \nability to collect the financial information of American citizens \nwithout their consent.\n  I filed a simple amendment that would have required this Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau to obtain written permission from consumers \nbefore collecting their information. Of course, my amendment was not \nallowed a vote and now the CFPB is collecting massive amounts of \npersonal financial data. So here we are 5 years later, and hindsight \nhas proven that many of the concerns I raised during the consideration \nof this bill were valid.\n  I have often said that knee-jerk reactions to legislative form have a \nvery real danger of overcorrecting and causing a myriad of problems. In \nfact, some people say that if it is worth reacting to, it is worth \noverreacting to. That is exactly what happened here.\n  We did it through a comprehensive bill--2,300 pages. I do not like \ncomprehensive bills. The purpose of comprehensive bills is so that they \nare incomprehensible, so that people cannot understand them. The best \nway to legislate is to take things in logical pieces and solve that \nproblem in a way that all of America can come along with and \nunderstand.\n  Those problems are unintended consequences when they are in \ncomprehensive bills. In correspondence and conversation with folks from \nWyoming over the years, I have said that I treat all legislation the \nsame. I read it and I consider both intended and what might be \nunintended consequences of the legislation. What I am here to talk \nabout today are some of the consequences of the Dodd-Frank Act after 5 \nyears.\n  First, there is the too-big-to-fail question. The Dodd-Frank Act was \nsupposed to make it so American taxpayers would, according to President \nObama, ``never again be asked to foot the bill for Wall Street's \nmistakes. . . . there will be no more tax-funded bailouts--period.''\n  Dodd-Frank increased capital requirements, it increased liquidity \nrequirements, and it has been adding rules and new regulations steadily \nfor the last 5 years. Folks who support the law would say all of those \nthings are good things and make for a more secure financial sector. \nHowever, one of the contributors to too big to fail was the \nconsolidation of banks and the financial industry, a byproduct of which \nwas the reduction of the number of smaller community banks that serve \nsmall business owners, families, farmers, and ranchers, the people who \nactually know their customers. But thanks to the massive amount of \nrules and regulations, the Dodd-Frank has resulted in the compliance \ncosts for community banks and credit unions going up significantly, and \nit increased the likelihood of consolidation. That fails the consumer.\n  Smaller community banks struggled to keep up with the flow of \nregulations and compliance costs. For example, since the passage of \nDodd-Frank, the average compliance cost for larger institutions is \nabout 12 percent of operating costs. For community banks, the cost to \ncomply with the same regulations, a one-size-fits-all approach is 2\\1/\n2\\ times greater, or 30 percent of the operating costs. That is a big \nbite.\n  I was visiting some of those community banks and listened to them \ntalk about the different regulations they now had to comply with. One \nof them had made this magnificent chart so that all of their loan \nofficers could both follow along and make sure they got all of the \nparts of the procedure that this law had in regulation at that time. \nNow, they had to hire a compliance officer as well.\n  They had been able to handle that part themselves before. But after \nthey explained all of this to me, I said: Now, let's see. My wife would \nkind of like to\n\n[[Page S5199]]\n\nexpand the kitchen in our house. We have added onto it once before. If \nI wanted to get a loan from you, how long would it take me to get the \nloan? I said: I have a house in Gillette, and I have a house in DC, and \nI have both of them paid for. So we really do not have any outstanding \ndebt. How long would that take?\n  They said: A minimum of 77 days. Then, of course, there would have to \nbe an extra week so that if you decided it was not a good deal, you \ncould undo the loan.\n  I wanted the loan. I wanted it 77 days before. I had to wait that \nlong, and then there is a week for it. But here is another kicker that \nis in the bill. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has up to 150 \ndays to tell me that I made a bad loan and cancel it. Hopefully, the \nconstruction would already be started by that time.\n  Well, I remember when I wanted to do that addition on the house. I \nwent to my banker, and I explained to him what I wanted to do. It took \nme a whole day to get that loan--a whole day. Now, it is going to take \n77 days, plus 1 week, and then I guess we have to wait 150 days to see \nif the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is going to decide that \nthey know better than I know.\n  My State of Wyoming is one of the most rural in the country. We had \nmostly community banks in Wyoming. I can attest that every visit I have \nhad with banks in Wyoming since this law passed has had one main \nsubject that remains constant: We are being crushed under the weight of \nthese regulations. We are having to make tough choices about the \nservices we provide.\n  Some of these banks are starting to consolidate with larger banks and \nbecome branches. Credit unions are not faring any better. According to \nthe National Association of Federal Credit Unions, more than 1,250 \ncredit unions have disappeared since the passage of Dodd-Frank. Of that \nnumber, over 90 percent had fewer than $100 million in assets, and the \nNo. 1 reason they give for having to merge out of the business was the \ninability to keep up with the regulatory burden they face.\n  This is one unacceptable consequence of the Dodd-Frank law and one \nfolks on both sides of the aisle should be appalled by. Now, equally \nappalling--maybe more appalling--is the importance the Dodd-Frank Act \nafforded to the agency it created, which the Senator from Georgia just \ntalked about, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or the CFPB.\n  Now, this is an agency that really doesn't come under our \njurisdiction; it actually works under the Federal Reserve and gets, I \nthink it is up to 12 percent of the revenues of the Federal Reserve \nnow, plus inflation. They will get up to 15 percent, plus inflation. We \nhave no say over that. They don't report to us in any way, shape or \nform.\n  This agency has grown to over 1,450 employees. It has a facility \nwhose offices' renovation budget has spiraled to over $216 million and \nfaces almost no accountability to Congress. I don't have enough time \nallotted to talk about all the activities of the CFPB, but make no \nmistake, this agency's reach has increased exponentially over the past \n5 years to the point where it is now taking enforcement actions \ncovering telecommunications companies and has broadened its authority \nover the auto industry, which was specifically exempted from the CFPB \nin the Dodd-Frank bill.\n  Let me tell you how that happened. I did a bunch of speeches on the \nfloor. I was interested in that third section. The first section was \nabout the banks, the second was about hedge funds, and the third was \nabout the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that wasn't going to \nhave any control by anybody.\n  I found that little paragraph in there that said they have the \nability to cancel a loan up to 150 days after the bank and the person--\nor whomever they are borrowing the money from--and the person receiving \nthe money agreed to the loan. They can cancel it. I pointed that out in \nspeeches.\n  One group of people listened to me. It was the automobile dealers. \nThe automobile dealers flooded Washington with lobbyists, and they got \nan exclusion in the bill for automobile loans. That is the only \nexclusion in there. Of course, they are being retaliated against now \nfor that, and I will talk about that in just a minute too. The CFPB \nissued a final rule on June 10 that would allow it to supervise nonbank \ncompanies qualified as larger participants of a market for automobile \nfinancing, along with a separate rule defining certain auto leases as a \nfinancial product or service.\n  What does this mean? It means the CFPB has expanded its oversight \npowers by saying: Oh, yes, auto leases are a financial product. They \ndon't like what they did to us. It is a service, and we are allowed to \nregulate those. So we will just increase our level of oversight over \nthis industry.\n  In fact, they have even taken a look at some of the loans that have \nbeen resold by automobile dealers and said those were discriminatory \nbecause they weren't the same. Well, when you go to the bank to sell a \nloan, you don't get the same deal every day, so that is really not \ndiscrimination, but according to this group that doesn't have any \noversight over it, it is.\n  On the same day, the CFPB released its auto finance examination \nprocedures for CFPB examiners to examine both banks and nonbanks. Keep \nin mind this is one example of hundreds of rules, enforcement actions, \nand other activities this agency is involved in across industries. \nBeyond increasing its incredible oversight reach, the CFPB has also \nengaged in massive data collection dating back to 2011. I spoke about \nthis data collection, and the Senator from Georgia spoke about this \ndata collection. I spoke about the data collection before the \nconfirmation of Richard Cordray to be the Director of the CFPB on July \n16, 2013. I was the only Senator to speak before this vote, and I \nrepeated something I said during the debate of the Dodd-Frank Act that \nI think bears repeating again. On May 20, 2010, I said:\n\n       This bill was supposed to be about regulating Wall Street; \n     instead it's creating a Google Earth of your every financial \n     transaction. That's right--the government will be able to see \n     every detail of your finances. They can look at your \n     transactions from the 50,000 foot perspective or they can \n     look right down to the tiny details of the time and place \n     where you pulled cash out of an ATM.\n\n  I talked about some of the data we had at that time. I am, \nunfortunately, going to expand on those comments because the CFPB \ncontinues to collect massive amounts of data without consent of the \nconsumers.\n  The Government Accountability Office, GAO, is a nonpartisan, \nindependent agency that investigates how the Federal Government spends \ntaxpayer dollars. They released an extensive report on September 2014 \ndetailing the data collection of the CFPB. Here is what they found.\n  Of the 12 large-scale collections they reviewed, three included \ninformation that identified individual consumers. The CFPB said those \nthree collections weren't subject to the Dodd-Frank prohibition on \ncollecting personally identifiable information.\n  What? The CFPB is collecting information on 700,000 auto sales per \nmonth, 10.7 million consumer credit reports per month, 25 million to 75 \nmillion individual credit card accounts, 29 million active mortgage \nloans, and 173 million total loans, as well as one-time collections of \n5.5 million private student loans and 15 million to 40 million payday \nloans. This isn't the whole list, this is a sample rundown. Let's see, \nthey are into the automobile sales, everything with your automobile \nsales, your consumer credit reports, your credit cards, your mortgage \nloans, your total loans, your student loans--and, if you do it, payday \nloans. Again, that is just a sample rundown.\n  Let's take a minute to let these numbers sink in. The CFPB collects \ninformation on 25 million to 75 million credit card accounts on a \nmonthly basis. They want to be able to monitor 95 percent of all credit \ncard transactions by 2016. I don't know about you, but this is highly \ndisturbing, especially in light of the fact that the GAO report found \nthat CFPB did not employ sufficient security and privacy protections to \nmake sure this data remains safe.\n  In summary, the CFPB is collecting sensitive financial information on \nindividuals by name, on millions of Americans, some of which has \npersonally identifiable information that is supposed to be removed or \nnot used, and they don't have the appropriate safeguard to protect this \ninformation.\n  Considering the increase in cyber attacks faced across different \nsectors in\n\n[[Page S5200]]\n\nour country, including the Federal Government, this information is not \njust troubling, it is terrifying, especially because there is no way \nfor a single American to opt out of this collection or require \nnotification that their information is being collected and stored.\n  Let me assure you, it is, and not only that, there is no way for \nCongress to have a say to exert oversight to take a closer look at what \nthe CFPB is up to. One thing that is clear to me, every American \ndeserves better than this, and after 5 years, I think it is safe to say \nwe can do much better than this--and we better do much better than \nthis--or we will have what the book ``1984'' suggested is going to \nhappen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines).

Mr. President, the headlines in the past few months have \nbeen enough to paint a startling picture of how our Nation is handling \ntechnology and security these days.\n  Before I came to Congress, I spent 12 years working in the technology \nsector, but it doesn't take an extensive background in these fields to \nsee that in the ever-changing realm of technology and online \ncommunication, America's constitutional freedoms and civil liberties \nare at risk and our security as a nation is under attack.\n  When it comes to protecting American citizens' privacy and personal \ninformation, we as a nation need to respond to the new threats our \nenemies are posing and the new tactics they are using and demand equal \nvigilance from those in our government who claim they have American \nsafety at heart.\n  The modern battlefield is changing. We see it changing before our \nvery eyes, and America needs to adapt. With the incredible advantages \nthat modern technology offers, also with that come greater risks as \nwell as greater responsibility. Our enemies, America's enemies, are \nutilizing social media in particular to recruit others to their side to \nplot against our rights, our freedoms, our American way of life.\n  As Michael Steinbach, the Assistant Director at the FBI's \nCounterterrorism Division, said to the House Homeland Security \nCommittee just last month: ``The foreign terrorist now has direct \naccess into the United States like never before.''\n  We know for a fact that ISIS aggressively uses social media to spread \nits propaganda, to target individuals in our own country, and to urge \nthem to attack us on our own soil.\n  In March of this year, the New York Times reported that ISIS's use of \nsocial media, including Twitter and high-quality online recruiting \nvideos, has been ``astonishingly successful,'' and the speed at which \nmodern social media moves means America must move faster.\n  In fact, we read about the recently foiled terrorist attack in \nBoston, where Islamic extremists planned to behead law enforcement \nofficials. It shows us the importance of engaging these online \nterrorists, their propaganda machines, interpreting their encrypted \ncommunications, and cracking down on the spread of online terrorist \nnetworks--but how can we fight back against these cyber threats from \nabroad when our own government officials show themselves to be woefully \nincompetent?\n  We in this country spent months debating the National Security \nAgency's bulk collection of Americans' metadata, and in the meantime, \nwhile we are having this debate, Chinese hackers stole millions of \nAmericans' personal information. In fact, it is estimated now those \nChinese hackers broke into the Office of Personnel Management--\nbasically the HR system of the Federal Government--and stole over 20 \nmillion records of employees of the Federal Government.\n  This recent breach of Federal employees' information may possibly be \nrooted in a phishing email. In fact, in a recent article in Ars \nTechnica on June 8, they said:\n\n       It may be some time before the extent of the breach is \n     known with any level of certainty. What is known is that a \n     malware package--likely delivered via an e-mail ``phishing'' \n     attack against OPM or Interior employees--managed to install \n     itself within the OPM's IT systems and establish a back-door \n     for further attacks. The attackers then escalated their \n     privileges on OPM's systems to the point where they had \n     access to a wide swath of the agency's systems.\n\n  These hackers broke into the computers at the Federal Government's \nOffice of Personnel Management. They were downloading the very forms \nFederal employees use to gain national security clearances.\n  In fact, earlier this month USA TODAY said:\n\n       The hackers took millions of the forms used by people to \n     disclose intimate details of their lives for national \n     security clearances. The information could be used to unmask \n     covert agents or try to blackmail Americans into spying for \n     an enemy.\n\n  In fact, I was one of those millions of Americans--as were other \nMembers of Congress--whose personal information was compromised in this \nbreach, and I demanded accountability from the Director and others at \nthe OPM, but we also need to address the systemic problems with cyber \nsecurity in this country directly.\n  The outdated security systems at the OPM and other agencies of the \nFederal Government recently hacked show that America is not up to speed \nwith the kinds and the levels of cyber threats our country is facing. \nLet me give an example. In the publication Ars Technica of June 8, \n2015, it says:\n\n       The OPM hack is just the latest in a series of Federal \n     network intrusions and data breaches, including recent \n     incidents at the Internal Revenue Service, the State \n     Department, and even the White House. These attacks have \n     occurred despite the $4.5 billion National Cybersecurity and \n     Protection System program and its centerpiece capability, \n     Einstein. Falling under the Department of Homeland Security's \n     watch, that system sits astride the government's trusted \n     Internet gateways. Einstein was originally based on deep \n     packet inspection technology first deployed over a decade \n     ago, and the system's latest $218 million upgrade was \n     supposed to make it capable of more active attack prevention. \n     But the track flow analysis and signature detection \n     capabilities of Einstein, drawn from both DHS traffic \n     analysis and data shared by the National Security Agency, \n     appears to be incapable of catching the sort of tactics that \n     have become the modern baseline for state-sponsored network \n     espionage and criminal attacks. Once such attacks are \n     executed, they tend to look like normal network traffic.\n       Put simply, as new capabilities for Einstein are being \n     rolled out, they're not keeping pace with the types of \n     threats now facing federal agencies. And with the data from \n     OPM and other breaches, foreign intelligence services have a \n     goldmine of information about federal employees at every \n     level of the government.\n\n  And this just at a time when the threats to our Nation are at very \nhigh levels.\n  The article continues:\n\n       It's a worrisome cache that could be easily leveraged for \n     additional, highly-targeted cyber-attacks and other \n     espionage. In a nation with a growing reputation for state of \n     the art surveillance initiatives and cyber warfare \n     techniques, how did we become the ones playing catch up?\n\n  But this isn't just about being sloppy or being slow; this is a \nmatter of national security. America needs to get smart on cyber \nsecurity and tech issues and to hold officials accountable for their \nbehavior because there is just too much at stake if we fail. The \nAmerican people will pay the price for a failure to adapt to this \nrapidly changing world of technology, this rapidly changing world of \nmedia, this rapidly changing world of information gathering, and for \nsheer carelessness on the part of those in authority.\n  Private sector innovation and progress can help America compete. As a \nmember of the committee on commerce and having spent 28 years in the \nprivate sector--the last 12 years with a cloud computing startup which \nwe took public and which became a great cloud computing company, with \noffices all over the world but based in my home State of Montana--I \nadmit I had to smile when I saw that so many Congressmen want to \nregulate the private sector to protect the private sector from private \nthreats. Well, again, in 28 years of serving in the private sector, I \nnever once had my information breached. I never once had a letter from \nmy HR department saying my information had been comprised. It wasn't \nuntil I became a Federal employee, elected to Congress a few years\n\n[[Page S5201]]\n\nago, that my information was compromised. The private sector runs a \nwhole lot faster than the public sector.\n  I think the government needs to look within to make sure we can be at \nthe forefront of cyber technology and security, but these efforts will \nbe thoroughly wasted if the Federal Government does not take the \nnecessary precautions and procedures to protect the American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/21/senate-section/article/S5201-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5201-S5202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have come to the floor this evening \nto speak about our Nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, sometimes \nreferred to as the SPR. It is a national security asset that has come \ninto the news of late for a host of different reasons.\n  I am here this evening because of the concerns I have that others are \npotentially looking to our Strategic Petroleum Reserve--our strategic \nenergy asset--as nothing more than a piggybank to fund some of the \nneeds we have here in this Congress. I believe it is extremely \nshortsighted to raid our Nation's oil stockpile as an offset for the \nextension of the highway trust fund, and that is what we have had some \nconversation about today.\n  We had a vote earlier about whether to move forward on the highway \ntrust fund. But as we have looked to find pathways forward for a \nmultiyear highway trust fund reauthorization, which is something I \nsupport, it is important to know that not all pots of money are equal, \nthat perhaps some are truly national security assets for which perhaps \nwe need to show more considered respect.\n  I had an opportunity a few days ago--on Friday--to tour our Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve. I went to the Choctaw Bayou site near Baton Rouge, \nLA. It was an opportunity for me to get a firsthand look at some of the \nchallenges that currently face our four Strategic Petroleum Reserves \nthat we have down in the Louisiana, Texas area and to have a better \nunderstanding as to their operational readiness. Quite honestly, it is \na trip I wish more of our Members were willing to take because I think \nit would become clear to many the potential mistake we would be making \nin forcing the sale of billions of dollars of our emergency oil solely \nto pay for unrelated legislation. It is akin to selling the insurance \non your house in order to pave your driveway. It just doesn't make \nsense.\n  For some, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve may be a very unknown \nnational security asset. They do not really know what it is. But the \nSPR is our Nation's insurance policy against global energy supply \ndisruptions. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve was established by law \nback in 1975 under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, and its \nmission is twofold: to ensure U.S. energy security by reducing the \nimpacts of potential disruptions in U.S. petroleum supplies and \nsecondly to carry out U.S. obligations under the international energy \nprogram.\n  We have about 700 million barrels of oil that are tucked away in \nunderground salt caverns down in Louisiana and in Texas. We have a \ncouple refined product reserves in other parts of the country, but our \nStrategic Petroleum Reserves are there in Louisiana and Texas. So if we \nhave a major hurricane that takes out production in the Gulf of Mexico, \nas we saw with Hurricane Katrina back in 2005, we can turn to the SPR \nto help fill the gap. We did that in 2005. That is exactly the type of \nreason you would have the strategic asset.\n  But there are other times we have turned to the SPR. If there is a \nterrorist attack or a broader war disruption that alters the ability of \nother nations to send us oil, we can again turn to the reserve for \nhelp. We did this in 1991 with the Iraq war and then again in 2011 with \nthe Libya supply disruption. So, again, when there was an emergency and \nwe needed to ensure U.S. security, we had a ready reserve fund to turn \nto.\n  In the absence of policies that will allow our Nation to produce all \nof the oil it consumes every day, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is \nreally our best answer to the sudden absence of the energy we need, \nwhether it is driving to work, whether it is powering our ships or our \nairplanes, moving our goods, or whatever that reason may be.\n  With the discussion we had today in terms of how we pay for this \nmultiyear transportation bill, we are being asked to dramatically \ndiminish the size of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve based again on the \nneed to pay for the extension of the highway trust fund. It is totally \nunrelated--totally unrelated.\n  Those who would argue in favor of taking from the SPR, their argument \nis pretty simple. In fact, it is way too simple. They suggest that our \ninternational obligations require us to store enough petroleum to match \n90 days of net imports. That is true. And they will say that given the \ngrowth we have seen in domestic oil production, we have enough now that \nwe have a surplus within the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Some have \neven suggested that an SPR is not even necessary anymore.\n  Well, I would be the first among us to suggest that changes need to \nbe made to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Again, this was established \nback in 1975, and I think it is very fair to say the world has changed. \nIt has changed dramatically since the 1970s. The global environment in \nwhich we are operating has changed dramatically. And the Department of \nEnergy has said that today the impacts of an overall supply disruption \nof global oil markets would have the same effect on domestic petroleum \nproduct prices regardless of how U.S. oil import levels--or whether \nU.S. refineries import crude from disrupted countries.\n  So there is a recognition that we have to get to modernizing the SPR. \nWe have to ensure that we have right-sized it, that we are in alignment \nwhen it comes to moving oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at \nthose times we have determined are appropriate.\n  So I think it is important to know we are not just sitting still on \nthis. The Department of Energy has begun work on a comprehensive, long-\nterm strategic review of the SPR. We had good discussion about this \nwhen I was down in Louisiana on Friday with the Deputy Secretary of \nEnergy, Chris Smith, talking about what this review will entail. It is \nlooking at future SPR requirements regarding the size; regarding the \ncomposition of it; the geographic location--it has been suggested that \nperhaps there might be regional approaches; determining where we have \nchokepoints within the system in terms of distribution; how we move it; \ndetermining the impacts of what we see globally and what is happening \nwith our own domestic production; and again being smart in how we are \nmaking sure we have right-sized the SPR and, in fairness, modernized \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n  We have a committee, as you know, Mr. President, that likes to roll \nup our sleeves and get into the weeds on making sure our policies are \ncurrent and are relevant.\n  We need a deliberative process that will provide us with the proper \nunderstanding of the stakes and our options when it comes to how we \nhandle our Strategic Petroleum Reserve. What we do not need--what we do \nnot need--is an arbitrary process that picks a number. Right now, for \npurposes of the offset of what they are coming to the energy committee \nfor, they are picking a number of--let's sell 101 million barrels of \noil to fund a portion of the highway trust fund. Again, where is the \nconnection between ensuring that we don't erode our national energy \nsecurity assets?\n  I have said many times that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is not an \nATM. It is certainly not the petty cash drawer for Congress. We have a \nresponsibility. A decision to sell substantial volumes of oil will \nincrease our vulnerability to future supply disruptions at a time when \nwe are still importing oil. We are importing about 5 million barrels a \nday.\n  Think about this. Think about the timing of this. It simply could not \nbe worse. When you talk about volatility in the world, think about the \nnews you read about today, what is happening in Iran, Iraq, and Syria. \nNow is the time for us to say that our national energy security assets \nare not that important; it is OK to nibble around the edges or worse \nand take significant amounts to put out on the market?\n  Let's consider a few facts to put things into perspective. First of \nall,\n\n[[Page S5202]]\n\nyou talk about the market. It is a buyer's market out there. The \nInternational Energy Agency warns of a massively oversupplied balance \nsheet. The Energy Information Administration shares that assessment in \nits latest monthly outlook, noting that production continues to exceed \nconsumption across the globe. Of course, now as we are seeing the \noutcome from the negotiations with Iran, they are going to be in a \nposition soon to put their oil out onto the world market.\n  Oil prices are sitting right now around $50 a barrel. Think about it. \nNot all of the oil that is in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve was \nperhaps bought high, but think about it. Selling it now is the very \ndefinition of selling low.\n  We are at $50 a barrel right now. The sales that are envisioned in \nthis highway bill would shortchange taxpayers in terms of emergency \nprotection because you are eroding the fund, but think about the proper \nstewardship of taxpayer dollars. Effectively, we bought high and we are \ngoing to sell low.\n  Second, drawing down barrels from the SPR would put the Federal \nGovernment in a position of direct competition with domestic producers. \nThat may be temporarily defensible during a severe interruption, but \nlet's remember where we are right now. The midcontinent is already \nawash in crude. Our outdated ban on oil exports, which should be fully \nrepealed and fully repealed soon in my view, has not been repealed yet. \nIt is sitting there in place, and what it is doing is keeping oil that \nis trapped in the United States, threatening productions and jobs at \nthe same time.\n  What you are talking about with this proposal to sell off the oil \nfrom SPR is you are going to sell it first very low and then you are \ngoing to put it into a market that is already oversupplied.\n  I was in the Gulf of Mexico this weekend at a place called Port \nFourchon, where truly you think about the part of the country that is \nsupporting an oil and gas industry, robust, ready to go to work, but \nwhat we saw there were supply vessels that were sidelined and drill \nships that were waiting. You tell those hard-working men and women \nthere who aren't working as hard as they would like that perhaps \nsomehow it is a good idea that they should be taking money from our \nsavings account--taking the oil from our savings account and dumping \nthat into the market.\n  Third, our Nation's energy security cannot depend on commercial \nstocks alone. They rise and fall based on market expectations, not on \nthe strategic environment, and are not tethered to our Nation's energy \nsecurity. Since the passage of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act \nin 1975, there was a bipartisan consensus that maintained that it is \nthe Federal Government, not private industry, that will ensure that our \nobligations are met. Clearly, not much has changed in that calculation, \ncertainly in my mind.\n  Fourth, threats to global security continue to abound and they seem \nto worsen. As Iran, ISIS, and other threats destabilize the Middle \nEast, some 17 million barrels per day still flow through the Strait of \nHormuz. The Suez Canal and its accompanying pipeline carry just under 5 \nmillion barrels per day, despite a budding insurgency that fired a \nrocket at an Egyptian Navy vessel earlier this month. Instability in \nVenezuela, which produces about 2\\1/2\\ million barrels per day, would \nalso directly impact the major American refining center in the Gulf of \nMexico.\n  You have all of this volatility and instability, and this is the time \nagain that we are going to take our insurance policy and we are going \nto erode it? We are going to make us less energy secure? It makes no \nsense.\n  By way of comparison, the drawdown rate of the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve is about 4.4 million barrels a day, probably a little bit less. \nBut, seriously, any number of disruptions could arise and make those \nbarrels very precious. Secretary Moniz gave a speech about a month ago, \nand he stated that the distribution rate is probably much lower than \nour drawdown capacity of 4.4. The distribution rate is compromised \nbecause of some of the issues we talked about earlier, which are \nchanges in midstream, infrastructure, and congestions in the system. \nWhen you talk about our ability to respond, we are limited.\n  If Congress is going to sell any oil from the SPR--and I am not \nsuggesting this is a good idea--one of the things we must do is we \nshould agree that any proceeds would first be used to pay for upgrading \nthe reserve itself, pay for the modernization, help to ensure it has \nthe ability to do that which we have tasked it to do.\n  It needs significant modifications to preserve its long-term \nviability and to ensure that it can truly move the oil in the event of \nan emergency, whether it is a natural disaster or whether it is a \nterrorist threat or war. But it would be a travesty if we were to \ndramatically reduce the size of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve while \nwe continue to ignore its maintenance and its operational needs.\n  The Strategic Petroleum Reserve must be modernized for the 21st \ncentury. Its size, its geographic disposition, the quality of the oil \nit stores--right now it is about one-third to two-thirds distribution \nbetween sweet and sour crude--the desirability and understanding is we \nneed to move more into a refined product storage or holding instead of \nthe crude. These are all issues that merit further attention, but we \nneed to have a deliberative process. We need the review that the \nDepartment of Energy is conducting. We need the review that committees \nsuch as ours will advance and consider. What we do not need is a spur-\nof-the-moment deal that would sacrifice our energy security and perhaps \nmuch more.\n  I know this conversation will continue about how we move a highway \nbill forward. Count me as one who wants to ensure that we are doing \nright by our highway systems. Our infrastructure is key, but we also \nhave key energy infrastructure. Part of that key infrastructure lies \nwith the security asset, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve that we have. \nLet's focus on that word ``strategic'' before we move too quickly and \nin a manner that is shortsighted and will jeopardize our security and \nour inability to respond.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines).

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Marta Adams, who \nis retiring from her position as chief deputy attorney general for \nNevada. For more than 27 years, Marta has been serving Nevada; and \nthough many Nevadans may not know Marta, she has been working \ndiligently to keep them safe.\n  Soon after Marta graduated from the University of Wyoming College of \nLaw in 1977, she began practicing law in the Silver State. She quickly \ngained experience in environmental law, and her knowledge about the \nWest and its natural resources have contributed greatly to her \nsuccessful legal career.\n  Marta's persistence and commitment while representing the Nevada \nAgency for Nuclear Projects in opposing the Yucca Mountain project was \ninstrumental in our State's legal fight against efforts to force \nnuclear waste on Nevada. Since 2008, Marta has worked as chief deputy \nattorney general and maintained a strong voice for Nevada on all issues \npertaining to Yucca Mountain.\n  On behalf of Nevada, I thank Marta for her decades of dedicated \npublic service and wish her the best in her well-earned retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/21/senate-section/article/S5202-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5202-S5203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CAMERON AND DELEVAN, ILLINOIS, TORNADOES\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, for the third time this year, Illinois \ncommunities are assessing damage and cleaning up after tornadoes. One \ntwister struck the town of Cameron, in Warren County, on Thursday \nevening. Moments later, another struck the town of Delevan, in Tazewell \nCounty. The tornadoes were accompanied by storms with heavy rain and \nflooding.\n  The National Weather Service says both tornadoes were category EF-2. \nThat means that the winds blew up to\n\n[[Page S5203]]\n\n130 miles per hour. Homes in both small towns suffered severe damage. \nSeveral homes had roofs torn off, while others were completely \nflattened. The tornado that hit Delevan touched down without warning \nbecause tornado sirens lost power a few seconds after they began to \nsound.\n  Debris from homes and farms was scattered across the community. Many \nroads in the community were impassible due to down trees and power \nlines. Emergency responders wasted no time going house to house in both \ncommunities. I spoke with Warren County sheriff Martin Edwards on \nFriday afternoon. Thankfully, there were no fatalities or serious \ninjuries reported.\n  The communities are busy cleaning up today and utility companies are \nworking to get gas and electricity back on. Over the weekend, Sparky's \nSmokeshack set up a smoker on the edge of Cameron. The popular rib \njoint served up free meals to anyone who needed them. American Red \nCross volunteers also are providing food and water. As is so often the \ncase when a disaster like this strikes, first responders and friends \nand family members are helping people whose homes and businesses were \ndamaged. I thank the first responders and all of the members of these \ncommunities for their work.\n  The Illinois delegation and I stand ready to help in any way we can, \nparticularly if the Governor requests Federal assistance. I have no \ndoubt that the people in Cameron and Delevan will rebuild. Our thoughts \nare with the many people today who lost homes and other property.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/21/senate-section/article/S5203-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5203-S5204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               GUATEMALA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, with the Congress focused on the U.S.-Iran \nnuclear agreement, it is not surprising that recent developments in \nGuatemala have not received the attention they deserve, either here or \nin the international press. I want to speak briefly about this as it \nshould interest all Senators, particularly at a time when the \ngovernments of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras are seeking \nsignificant U.S. funding to support the Plan of the Alliance for \nProsperity in the Northern Triangle of Central America.\n  The Cold War history of U.S. involvement in Guatemala is not one we \ncan be overly proud of. The role of the United Fruit Company, the CIA, \nGuatemala's landholding elite, and others in orchestrating the removal \nof democratically elected President Jacobo Arbenz Guzman in 1954, the \ntraining and equipping of the Guatemalan military that carried out a \nscorched earth campaign against a rebel insurgency and the rural \nindigenous population in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, and policies \nfavoring the financial and political elite who perpetuated the racism, \nsocial and economic inequities, corruption, violence, and impunity that \npersist to this day, are all part of that collective experience.\n  One of the vestiges of that period is the continuing harassment, \nvilification, death threats, and even malicious prosecutions of human \nrights defenders and other social activists. It is regrettable that \nGuatemala's authorities have failed to condemn or take effective steps \nto stop this pattern and practice of threats and abuse of the justice \nsystem.\n  Yet while the 1996 Peace Accords that finally ended 36 years of armed \nconflict were, for the most part, not implemented, since then the \nUnited States has sought to help address the causes of poverty, \ninequality, and injustice in Guatemala. We have funded child nutrition \nand public health programs, bilingual education for indigenous \nchildren, efforts to reform and professionalize the police, prevent \nviolence against women, strengthen the institutional capacity of the \nPublic Ministry, locate and identify the remains of thousands of people \nwho disappeared during the war and ended up in mass graves, support \nreparations for victims of the Chixoy massacres, protect biodiversity \nand preserve pre-Columbian archeological sites in Peten. The results of \nthese efforts have been mixed, but they do signify a positive trend in \nour relations with Guatemala in recent years for which the Department \nof State, the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Inter-\nAmerican Foundation, the Inter-American Development Bank, and others \ndeserve credit.\n  President Perez Molina also deserves credit for supporting the \nagreement to finance the Chixoy reparations plan, which some in his own \ngovernment opposed. It is now essential that the agreement is \nimplemented so the communities who suffered losses are compensated.\n  The United States has also been a strong supporter of the \nInternational Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, otherwise known \nas CICIG, which, in collaboration with the Office of the Attorney \nGeneral, has played an indispensable role in investigations and \nprosecutions of cases of corruption, organized crime, and clandestine \ngroups, as well as crimes against humanity and other human rights \natrocities dating to the civil war. I commend the way CICIG \nCommissioner Ivan Velasquez and Attorney General Thelma Aldana are \nworking together to address these issues.\n  Each year since CICIG's inception in 2007, as either chairman or \nranking member of the appropriations subcommittee that funds U.S. \nforeign aid programs and as a former prosecutor and chairman or ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee, I have included a U.S. contribution \nto CICIG. I have also twice supported the extension of CICIG when it \nwas nearing the end of its mandate. Most recently, when President Otto \nPerez Molina indicated that he did not intend to renew CICIG's mandate, \nI argued that the weakness of Guatemala's justice system and the \ncontinuing high levels of corruption and impunity were compelling \nreasons to extend CICIG. I was gratified that earlier this year its \nmandate was extended until 2017.\n  While Guatemala's justice system remains fragile, the partnership \nbetween CICIG and the Public Ministry has played a critical role in \nadvancing the cause of justice in Guatemala. But Guatemala's problems \nare not unique. Honduras and El Salvador suffer from many of the same \nconditions--weak justice systems that lack credibility, rampant \ncorruption, threats and assassinations of human rights defenders, \njournalists, and even prosecutors, and a history of impunity. I hope \nthose governments look to CICIG as a model for how they could benefit \nfrom the technical expertise and independence of the international \ncommunity to help address these deeply rooted problems.\n  Simultaneous with President Perez Molina's decision to extend CICIG's \nmandate, the need for CICIG became even more apparent. As a result of \nits investigations, high-ranking officials in the Perez Molina \ngovernment, including Vice President Roxana Baldetti and one of her top \naides, as well as the President's chief of staff and other senior \nofficials, have either resigned or been arrested due to allegations of \nbribery and other corruption related to customs and social security. In \naddition, a leading Vice Presidential candidate of the Lider Party has \nbeen implicated. This may only be the tip of the iceberg, as it is \ncommon knowledge that corruption is widespread in Guatemala.\n  Such scandals involving powerful public figures are by no means \nunprecedented, as other Guatemalan officials--including a former \nPresident and Minister of Interior--have been implicated in such crimes \nand became fugitives from justice. But unlike in the past, these latest \nscandals have galvanized a diverse spectrum of civil society to join in \npeaceful public demonstrations over a period of several months calling \nfor an end to corruption and impunity and for the resignation of the \nPresident who would be replaced by a transition government in \naccordance with Guatemala's Constitution.\n  The timing of these protests is significant, as Presidential \nelections are scheduled for September 6 and speculation is rife as to \nwhether or not President Perez Molina will serve out his term.\n  The United States has a strong interest in democracy and justice in \nGuatemala, as well as a better life for the millions of Guatemala's \ncitizens, particularly indigenous and other historically marginalized \ngroups, who live in poverty. Many, with only a few years of formal \neducation and no reliable source of income, including victims of ethnic \ndiscrimination, gangs and violent crime, have risked life and limb in \nsearch of opportunities in the United States. It is our hope that the \nPlan of the Alliance for Prosperity, with complementary and balanced \ninvestments\n\n[[Page S5204]]\n\nin governance, prosperity, and security, will begin to provide the \neconomic opportunities and address these difficult social and law \nenforcement challenges in a sustainable way. I look forward to \ndiscussing these issues with our friends in the House of \nRepresentatives later this year.\n  More immediately, it is important that the United States carefully \ncalibrates its response to the popular demands for reform. What is \nhappening in Guatemala today is both unique and encouraging in the way \nit has inspired and united, for the first time in Guatemala's history, \nindigenous and non-indigenous, both rural and urban groups, poor and \nmiddle class who previously did not share a common agenda. This has \nenhanced the prospects for real change in a country that has been \nplagued for two decades by the divisive, tragic legacies of the war and \nby powerful forces in government and the private sector resistant to \nchange for generations.\n  In this context, civil society requires support and protection, \ntaking into account Guatemala's past history of repression and \nviolence. I urge U.S. officials to make clear that the United States \nunequivocally supports the aspirations of Guatemalan civil society that \nis now struggling for the right of all the Guatemalan people to have \ntransparent and accountable government, including honest and \nprofessional police and an independent judiciary.\n  Guatemala is a country with an extraordinarily rich culture, natural \nresources, and human potential. But without respect for human rights \nand the rule of law and real change that provides for equitable \neconomic opportunities and political representation, that potential \nwill remain unfulfilled. It is long past time for an end to impunity, \nincluding for public officials who misuse their office to enrich \nthemselves, their families, and their friends, and for a new era of \neffective governance, prosperity, and freedom from fear for all \nGuatemalans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/21/senate-section/article/S5204-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5204-S5205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO BRENDAN J. WHITTAKER\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to recognize \nBrendan J. ``Bren'' Whittaker, a distinguished public servant and \nrecognized leader in conservation efforts in the New England Northern \nForest region. In addition to his conservation work, Bren spent more \nthan 45 years in the Episcopal ministry, leading a full-time parish.\n  I know Bren first not as a priest, but as a dedicated public servant \nfor more than 40 years. Bren has held many titles at every level of \ngovernment, including town meeting moderator, town selectman, county \nforester, chairman of district 1 environmental commission, director of \nVermont State Energy Office, Vermont Secretary of Natural Resources, \nU.S. Department of Agriculture FSA State Committee member and more.\n  In addition to his schooling in theology, Bren studied forestry, and \nhe holds degrees in both disciplines. In the early 1990s, I worked with \nNew Hampshire Senator Warren Rudman to establish the Northern Forest \nLands Council, and Bren agreed to be part of that select group. He \nlater joined the Vermont Natural Resources Council as Northern Forest \nproject manager, and continues to work as a board member for \nconservation organizations in Vermont and New Hampshire. Bren served \neach post with distinction and has been deeply involved for nearly 40 \nyears in the vast changes taking place across the Northern Forest.\n  I have been pleased to continue working with Bren since his \nappointment to the USDA's Farm Service Agency State Committee in \nVermont. Bren continues to serve as a selectman in Brunswick, VT, and \noperates a vegetable farm, roadside stand and seasonal restaurant \nsupply business with his wife, Dorothy.\n  I have touched on Bren's State and Federal public service, but his \neven greater contributions to his community may be through his \nministry, as so eloquently enumerated in the article entitled Thanks to \na Mentor and North Country Champion, written by Rebecca Brown, a member \nof the New Hampshire legislature and a student and friend of Bren. It \nwas published in 2014 in the Littleton Courier. I ask unanimous consent \nthat Ms. Brown's article be printed in the Record as a tribute to \nBrendan J. Whittaker's decades-long and continuing service to his \nneighbors, community, the States of Vermont and New Hampshire, and to \nthe Nation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [Littleton New Hampshire Courier, Dec. 2014]\n\n             Thanks to a Mentor and North Country Champion\n\n                         (By Rebecca A. Brown)\n\n       This season of giving thanks and celebration, I want to \n     mark the final retirement of Brendan Whittaker from his \n     Episcopal ministry. ``Final'' because he retired from full-\n     time parish work many years ago, but has been serving in \n     various priestly roles until the Sunday before Thanksgiving.\n       I write because Brendan's effect on people and the \n     communities of the North Country have been (and I am \n     confident will continue to be) enormous, yet he has gone \n     about his work over the last couple of decades with little \n     fanfare or notoriety, but with his genuine and affecting \n     warmth. In this way he follows in the footsteps of one of his \n     mentors, Carleton Schaller, also an Episcopal priest who we \n     all lost earlier this year.\n       For much of his earlier career, Brendan was very much in \n     the public eye, especially when he was Secretary of the \n     Agency of Natural Resources for Vermont. Walk through \n     Montpelier or attend a conservation gathering anywhere in VT \n     with Brendan today, and you'll encounter many people who \n     still hold him in the highest regard. I do think he's one of \n     the best-loved people in Vermont. Years ago, he was named the \n     ``person from away'' (he was born and raised in \n     Massachusetts) who most deserved to be a genuine Vermonter.\n       Brendan and his wife Dorothy have farmed and managed their \n     woodlot in Brunswick, in northern VT along the Connecticut \n     River, for over 50 years. They arrived in the late 1950s, he \n     as a newly minted (UMass) forester working for Essex County. \n     But an additional call pulled at him, and he took a degree \n     from the Episcopal Divinity School in Boston. His first \n     parish work was in Brandon, VT starting in 1963. He later was \n     full-time rector at St. Paul's in Lancaster. He was also \n     rector at St. Mark's in Groveton, in Island Pond, Vt., and \n     the Church of the Epiphany in Lisbon, where he served his \n     last day.\n       Brendan's divinity school thesis was one of the earliest \n     church ``insider'' calls to link Christian faith and the \n     environmental movement. His writing foreshadowed his long \n     career as a professional forester and a working priest, and \n     helped move the Episcopal Church to embrace stewardship of \n     the earth as a moral obligation.\n       I first encountered Brendan from afar through his role in \n     the Northern Forest Lands Council, the pivotal group created \n     by Congress to address the alarming forestland changes in \n     northern New England and New York. Brendan represented \n     Vermont. As a young journalist new in the North Country and \n     exploring forestry, land use, and community issues, I studied \n     the Council's 1994 report ``Finding Common Ground'' very \n     closely and followed those involved with creating it. Around \n     that time, I noted the formation of the Forest Guild as a \n     progressive alternative to the Society of American Foresters, \n     with Brendan among the founders. I also encountered various \n     essays he'd written, and found him to be among the most \n     articulate writers and thinkers about our region, someone I \n     hoped to cross paths with someday.\n       We finally did cross paths in 2005 when I joined the staff \n     of the Connecticut River Joint Commissions, the VT-NH group \n     advising the two states on issues affecting the river and \n     watershed. Brendan was a VT commissioner. At that time \n     Brendan was filling in occasionally at the Lisbon church (Tod \n     Hall was the regular vicar), and from time to time would \n     leave me phone messages that he'd be preaching and inviting \n     me to attend. As someone who'd never gone to church save for \n     weddings and funerals, I did not jump at the opportunity. But \n     eventually I decided it would be the polite thing to do, and \n     with some trepidation agreed. The night before, he called to \n     explain what to expect, including taking communion, which \n     made me even more nervous. I knew that ritual only through \n     extended family occasions in the Catholic Church where \n     infidels like me could not and did not participate.\n       He assured me that taking communion could be considered a \n     symbolic breaking of bread together as a community, and did \n     not demand belief in the literal ``blood of Christ.'' This \n     was the first of many alternative insights to the Christian \n     traditions and liturgy to which he introduced me. As someone \n     whose understanding of Christian thought was arrested at the \n     kindergarten level of God as a bearded man in the sky, this \n     was an important awakening, and introduced me to a wide world \n     of spiritual thought.\n       With his guidance and lending of books from his library, I \n     read many of the now classic and radical theological texts of \n     the mid 20th century. I found an exciting, intellectually and \n     spiritually stimulating pantheon including Tillich, \n     Bonhoeffer, John Robinson, and more contemporarily, Alan \n     Watts and John Spong. At the same time, I found a wonderfully \n     accepting and warm band of people at the Lisbon church.\n       I enjoyed with Brendan post-church conversations (and many \n     while working in the\n\n[[Page S5205]]\n\n     woods or at the farm) about Christian--and increasingly on my \n     part, Buddhist--thought, and returning again and again to our \n     shared love of the environment and what all this meant for \n     activists and stewards. Eventually I left the Joint \n     Commissions and started working for the Ammonoosuc \n     Conservation Trust, a group I'd started. I asked Brendan if \n     he'd consider becoming an advisor to ACT--expecting him to \n     say no, for given his high level career (in addition to his \n     government work he'd been on the board of just about every \n     major New England environmental organization) why bother with \n     a little start up like ACT? But he graciously agreed. Now, \n     Brendan chairs the ACT Lands Committee, and regularly works \n     with us on forestry issues and with landowners who are \n     considering conservation.\n       Brendan is like one of his beloved stiff asters, the \n     unusual plant that grows near the liquor store in Groveton, \n     able to find nourishment in dry gravel, and subject of one of \n     his most memorable sermons. His calling was to work with the \n     underserved, and he found his parish in the great unruly life \n     of the North Country, independent and fiercely neighborly. He \n     also found his parish with the people working in \n     conservation, including the game wardens he directed as ANR \n     secretary and continues to have special regard for. He's done \n     great service for our land and people, and I am tremendously \n     grateful to have him as a friend, colleague, and mentor.\n       Former Courier Editor Rebecca Brown is director of ACT, and \n     serves as a NH State Representative.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/21/senate-section/article/S5205-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5205-S5206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MIKE DONOGHUE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to call the Senate's attention \nto the continued First Amendment advocacy of a Vermont journalist, Mike \nDonoghue of the Burlington Free Press. The Vermont Press Association \nhas presented Mike with the prestigious Matthew Lyon Award, for his \nstaunch advocacy of First Amendment rights.\n  Mike is a talented and seasoned reporter, and in more than 40 years \nas a staff writer at the Free Press he has covered local, State and \nnational news, as well as sporting events--all, with integrity and \nvigor. He has shown a steadfast commitment to truth-telling, to getting \nthe facts, and getting them right, for the people of Vermont.\n  While Mike has achieved noteworthy accomplishments and awards during \nhis tenure at the Free Press, it is, especially, his work as an \nadvocate and teacher of First Amendment protections that have drawn the \ndistinction of the Matthew Lyon Award. He served two terms as president \nof the Vermont Press Association, where he worked to expand the use of \ncameras in Vermont courtrooms. As a founder of the Vermont Coalition \nfor Open Government, he has provided testimony in front of the Vermont \nLegislature on a regular basis and on a variety of topics related to \nFirst Amendment rights. Mike not only is a veteran reporter and \nvolunteer advocate but a dedicated educator as well. He is an adjunct \nprofessor of journalism at Saint Michael's College in Colchester--my \nalma mater--and he has trained young journalists throughout Vermont and \nNew England as well as through the auspices of the New England Press \nAssociation, the New England Society of Newspaper Editors, and \nInvestigative Reporters and Editors. His commitment to teaching and \ndefending the tenets of the First Amendment led him to participate as a \ntrainer in Ireland after the country passed its Freedom of Information \nAct in 1997.\n  The Vermont Press Association each year offers the Matthew Lyon Award \nto an individual who has demonstrated an exceptional commitment to the \nFirst Amendment and to ``the public's right to know the truth in \nVermont.'' It is named for Congressman Matthew Lyon, one of the \nforemost defenders of the Bill of Rights. He served in the U.S. House \nof Representatives on behalf of Vermont, as well as Kentucky, beginning \nin the 5th Congress. Congressman Lyon is known for his time in jail--\nand subsequent reelection during his sentence--on charges of sedition \nin 1798 for his sharp criticism of President John Adams.\n  Throughout his career, Mike Donoghue has worked tirelessly to promote \naccountability of public officials, and transparency in government \nagencies. As an earlier recipient of this same award, I will always \nfeel a special kinship in these efforts with champions like Mike \nDonoghue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this announcement from the Vermont Press \nAssociation about Mike Donoghue's selection for this award be printed \ninto the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            BFP's Donoghue Wins VT Press 1st Amendment Award\n\n            (By The Vermont Press Association, July 6, 2015)\n\n       Montpelier.--Longtime journalist and educator Mike Donoghue \n     of South Burlington has been selected to receive the Matthew \n     Lyon Award for his lifetime commitment to the First Amendment \n     and the public's right to know the truth in Vermont.\n       The Vermont Press Association, which represents the \n     interests of 11 daily and about four dozen non-daily \n     newspapers circulating in Vermont, will honor Donoghue at its \n     annual meeting and awards banquet at noon Thursday, July 16 \n     at the Capitol Plaza in Montpelier.\n       Donoghue, an award-winning veteran news and sports writer \n     for the Burlington Free Press, is being recognized for \n     efforts in his spare time working as an adjunct professor of \n     journalism at St. Michael's College, as a longtime officer \n     with the Vermont Press Association and his volunteer efforts \n     with various groups including New England First Amendment \n     Coalition (NEFAC), New England Newspaper and Press \n     Association (NENPA) and the Society for Professional \n     Journalists (SPJ).\n       VPA President John Flowers said Donoghue has been on the \n     front lines in seeking greater public accountability through \n     a range of efforts, including that government officials and \n     courts ensure records are easily available to the public, and \n     that government meetings and court hearings are open to \n     Vermonters.\n       ``Mike's efforts in accountability journalism at the \n     Burlington Free Press are well documented over several \n     decades. But the Lyon award is focusing on his efforts in \n     educating students, the public, government officials, and \n     journalists--both for print and electronic media outlets. \n     Mike is called upon frequently to speak in classrooms, in the \n     community and at professional conferences from Vermont to \n     Ireland.''\n       His work has helped improve both the open meeting law and \n     public records law in Vermont, Flowers said. He noted it was \n     while serving as VPA President in the mid-1980s that Donoghue \n     helped lead the media efforts in successfully obtaining \n     approval for cameras in Vermont Courts.\n       St. Michael's College recruited Donoghue in 1985 to teach \n     as an adjunct professor in the journalism department, where \n     he still helps. He also served as an officer for the Vermont \n     Press Association for 35 years until he resigned as its \n     executive director earlier this year.

He was on the New \n     England Press Association Board of Directors and various \n     committees 1995-2001. The Society of Professional Journalists \n     appointed Donoghue in 1990 to serve as the Vermont chairman \n     for Project Sunshine, a nationwide First Amendment effort--a \n     volunteer hat he still wears.\n       The VPA solicits nominations from Vermonters each year for \n     the Lyon award, which honors people who have an unwavering \n     devotion to the five freedoms within the First Amendment and \n     to the principle that the public's right to know the truth is \n     essential in a self-governed democracy, Flowers said.\n       Donoghue has been named to five halls of fame. They include \n     induction as one of 35 charter members selected by the New \n     England Press Association for its Community Journalism Hall \n     of Fame in 2000. Three years later he was named one of three \n     charter members selected nationwide by the Society of \n     Professional Journalists and The National Freedom of \n     Information Coalition for their National Hall of Fame for \n     Local Heroes.\n       Other honors include the Yankee Quill Award in 2007 for a \n     lifetime commitment to outstanding journalism in New England \n     and beyond; selected the New England Journalist of the Year \n     for print or electronic media in 2013; and voted by Gannett \n     employees nationwide to receive ``Greater Good Award'' from \n     the company in 2013.\n       The Lyon Award is named for a former Vermont congressman \n     who was jailed in 1798 under the Alien and Sedition Act for \n     sending a letter to the editor, criticizing President John \n     Adams. While Lyon was serving his federal sentence in a \n     Vergennes jail, Vermonters re-elected him to the U.S. House \n     of Representatives.

Mr. President, it is clear to me that No Child Left \nBehind was broken and that it was not serving the best interest of \nchildren in Michigan or the rest of the country. That is why I voted to \nsupport the passage of the Every Child Achieves Act, which moves away \nfrom high stakes testing and puts decisions on education back in the \nhands of our States, school districts, parents, and the teachers, who \nare in the best position to make those decisions.\n  However, I continue to have reservations about the Every Child \nAchieves Act, particularly the changes to formulas that govern how \nresources are allocated. The bill as drafted will reduce the support \nthat Michigan schools have for recruiting teachers and school leaders \nat the same time as it reduces support for their professional \ndevelopment. It also cuts the future resources dedicated to the \neducation of the most vulnerable low-income children in Michigan, \nsending that money to other States, using a formula that effectively \nrewards States for investing less in education. It is wrong to take \nresources away from one set of children and give them to another, and \nthen call it equity.\n  While I appreciate the efforts of the Senator from North Carolina to \nchange his original amendment, the modified version would still have a \nnegative impact on the children of Michigan. This is the reason I voted \nno on this amendment.\n  As this bill continues to conference committee, I intend to continue \nto fight to ensure that every child in Michigan has the best possible \naccess to quality public education and that Michigan is treated fairly \nin the funding formulas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/21/senate-section/article/S5206-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          OLDER AMERICANS ACT\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I am very pleased to see that the Older \nAmericans Act reauthorization passed the Senate last week. This law, \nwhich turns 50 years old this month, provides critical services like \nhome-delivered meals, transportation, and elder abuse protections.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray \nfor their efforts to pass this bill. I would also like to acknowledge \nthe many organizations representing tens of millions of Americans who \nworked with me and my staff to get this bill passed, including the \nNational Council on Aging, Meals on Wheels America, AARP, the National \nAssociation of Area Agencies on Aging, and many others.\n  While this bill is a good step forward, I would have preferred that \nit go much further.\n  Older adults are the fastest growing segment of the U.S. population. \nShockingly, 1 in 5 seniors is living on an average income of $8,300 per \nyear. We learned from the Government Accountability Office last month \nthat nearly 4 million seniors experience food insecurity and do not \nknow where their next meal will come from. Fewer than 10 percent of \nlow-income seniors who need a meal delivered to their homes receive \none. There are seniors across the country who may not have enough money \nto eat dinner tonight.\n  For the generation that fought to defend democracy and built our \ngreat Nation, we must do everything we can to make sure that seniors do \nnot go hungry. Older Americans should not have to choose between buying \nmedicine or keeping a roof over their heads or having food on the \ntable.\n  Providing home-delivered meals--Meals on Wheels--for seniors is not \nonly the right thing to do, it makes good economic sense. Why is that? \nIf frail seniors do not get the nutrition they need, they are more \nlikely to fall and break a hip and wind up in the hospital emergency \nroom or in a nursing home. At the end of the day, investing in \nnutrition which keeps seniors healthy actually saves us money by \nkeeping them out of the hospital.\n  Since 2006 when the Older Americans Act was last reauthorized, the \nU.S. population over 60 has grown by about 30 percent. Has funding gone \nup by 30 percent? No. In fact, funding has been basically flat, and \nwhen you account for inflation, funding has actually decreased by about \n12 percent. I strongly believe we should significantly expand funding \nfor Older Americans Act programs.\n  The truth is that the priorities we hold--treating seniors with \nrespect, making sure seniors have the food they need--have the \noverwhelming support of the American people. These principles are among \nthe foundations of a just and fair society where people look forward to \ngrowing old. I thank my Senate colleagues for their support of this \nimportant reauthorization bill. I hope that my colleagues in the House \nof Representatives take up and pass this bill swiftly so that it can \nbecome law without any further delay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/21/senate-section/article/S5206-4", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5206-S5207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               INNOVATION SCHOOLS DEMONSTRATION AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am joined by the chair and ranking \nmember of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee to \ndiscuss one of my amendments, Whitehouse No. 2185, to the Every Child \nAchieves Act, which would establish an Innovation Schools Demonstration \nAuthority. I thank them for their leadership on this important \nlegislation and join them today to discuss the purpose of the \namendment.\n  Teachers and school leaders possess a unique understanding of the \nstudents and communities they serve. My amendment is intended to help \nschools address these unique needs through increased autonomy from \nlocal, State, and Federal regulations. In Rhode Island I have heard \nfrom school leaders who would like to extend the school day for \nstruggling students, take ownership over school budgeting and financing \nor manage their school's human resources but are unable to do so \nbecause existing rules and regulations get in the way. The prospects of \nmoving bureaucratic approaches at all three levels of government can be \ndaunting, but this measure is designed to clear a path.\n  Several States are already experimenting with increased school \nautonomy. In Massachusetts, where State law allows for innovation \nstatus, schools are already benefiting from regulatory flexibility. In \nRevere, MA, the Paul Revere Elementary School uses regulatory \nflexibility around staffing, budgeting, scheduling, and curriculum to \noperate a school model that emphasizes staff collaboration and \ndifferentiated instruction. In Falmouth, MA, the Lawrence School is \nusing regulatory flexibility to improve its governance and \ndecisionmaking structure in a way that emphasizes faculty input and \nsatisfaction. In addition to Massachusetts, States as diverse as \nColorado, Kentucky, Minnesota, and West Virginia have established State \nlaws that promote innovation through autonomy.\n  The Innovation Schools Demonstration Authority builds on these \nefforts by establishing a fast-track process to give public schools \nrelief from the local, State, and Federal regulations that can be \nbarriers to school-based innovation. The program is designed to serve \nexisting public schools, specifically those where teachers, parents, \nadministrators, and members of the community are working together to \nimplement new, evidence-based models of teaching, learning, and school \nadministration. When these existing schools are selected for innovation \nschool designation, they will be able to obtain expedited relief from \nregulations that would otherwise prevent them from implementing their \nschool vision.\n  A key element of this program is that the whole school community \nwants to participate. Innovation schools must demonstrate support from \nadministrators, parents, and at least two-thirds of the current \nteaching staff. They are encouraged to form advisory boards to bring \ncommunity\n\n[[Page S5207]]\n\nexpertise from businesses, higher education, and community groups, \namong others, into school planning, operations, and oversight. And, \nimportantly, innovation schools will remain part of their local \neducation authority, serving as laboratories for experimentation, the \nbenefits of which can serve as a model for other schools in the \ndistrict.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank Senator Whitehouse. As ranking member of the \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, I support this \namendment, which establishes a process for educators in traditional \npublic schools to pursue innovative, community-inspired strategies to \nimprove education. My home State of Washington has benefited from \neducator-initiated innovation through the Washington Innovative Schools \nProgram. I am proud to say that we now have almost thirty designated \ninnovative schools that are pursuing creative and innovative \neducational ideas with a high level of parent and community \ninvolvement. And while providing room for innovation is important, it \nis also essential that we maintain important Federal safeguards. This \nis why under this amendment, innovation schools must still comply with \npart B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, title VI of \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964, and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act \nof 1973. This program will ensure that we balance the need for \nflexibility while maintaining strong accountability.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank Senator Whitehouse for his work on this \namendment. The thinking behind the Innovation Schools Demonstration \nAuthority is consistent with the approach we have taken throughout the \nEvery Child Achieves Act: returning more decisionmaking authority back \nto our 100,000 public schools and promoting greater flexibility in \nachieving high standards. This pilot program would allow for the \ncreation of autonomous schools that would operate under the same \naccountability standards as other schools in the school district; \nhowever, these innovation schools would be granted flexibility to \nincrease student achievement in innovative ways to best serve the needs \nof their students. Through increased autonomy and flexibility, \ninnovation schools may see some of the same demonstrated successes as \ncharter schools.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank Ranking Member Murray and Chairman Alexander \nfor their support. I hope this measure will meet all of our \nexpectations and create great examples of innovative, student-centered \npublic schools.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/21/senate-section/article/S5207-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RECOGNIZING ST. MARY OF THE ASSUMPTION CATHOLIC CHURCH UPON ITS 150TH \n                              ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor St. Mary of the \nAssumption Catholic Church in the German Village neighborhood of \nColumbus, OH, as it celebrates its 150th anniversary. In 1865, St. Mary \ninitially operated under the leadership of Rev. Francis S. Specht in a \nbuilding that featured a one-room church, one-room school and second-\nstory rectory. In 1866, the parishioners began construction on a \nGerman-gothic inspired church. In 1893, the parishioners built the \niconic steeple, which rises to 197 feet and still stands tall today.\n  The parish is home to more than 500 families, with parishioners from \n5 different counties in Ohio. St. Mary also hosts more than 50 weddings \neach year and has approximately 230 students enrolled in \nprekindergarten through the eighth grade.\n  The parish mission is ``to be of one mind and heart with the Church \nby loving God with all our heart, all our mind, all our strength, all \nour soul; and by loving our neighbor as ourselves.'' St. Mary fulfills \nits mission by supporting the needs of its congregation, hosting \ncommunity activities, and educating its students. Nearly 95 percent of \nthe students at St. Mary have been fortunate enough to receive tuition \nassistance.\n  I am here today to honor St. Mary of the Assumption and its \ncongregation. I congratulate all who were involved in making its first \n150 years a success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/21/senate-section/article/S5207-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 F_____\n                                 \n\n          RECOGNIZING THE BOBBY FAMILY OF ROSCOE, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the Bobby \nfamily from Roscoe, SD, for their work in railroad service. Roger, \nDuane, Albert, Bill, and Dale--led by their late father La Vern Bobby--\nhave served a combined total of 232 years with the railroad industry. \nThe six men have worked with Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul, and Pacific \nRailroads, all serving in the Maintenance of Way department throughout \ntheir careers.\n  Following La Vern, who joined railroad service in 1955 after serving \non a U.S. Navy destroyer in World War II, the Bobby boys have dedicated \ntheir lives to the railroad. Their railroad service has spanned across \na variety of Midwestern States, including South Dakota, Minnesota, and \nIllinois. They have made many sacrifices, frequently traveling, moving, \nand leaving their families at home to fulfill their duties with the \nrailroad.\n  The entire Bobby family deserves recognition for their hard work \nethic, patriotism, and service to the railroad system. I extend my \nsincere gratitude and appreciation to the Bobby family for their \ndedication to an industry that is vital to our economy by connecting \nour country and transporting goods. I hope that the Bobby legacy will \ncontinue to thrive with the generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/21/senate-section/article/S5207-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/21/senate-section/article/S5207-4", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/21/senate-section/article/S5207-5", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5207-S5208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  REPORT RELATIVE TO THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH \n RESPECT TO SIGNIFICANT TRANSNATIONAL CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT WAS \n      ESTABLISHED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13581 ON JULY 24, 2011--PM21\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nwithin 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the \nPresident publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana memorializing the United States \n     Congress to eliminate the current ban on crude oil exports; \n     to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 94\n\n       Whereas, the efficient exploration, production, and \n     transportation of oil in Louisiana prevents waste of the \n     state's natural resources; contributes to the health, \n     welfare, and safety of the general public; and promotes the \n     prosperity of the state; and\n       Whereas, the tax revenues and economic prosperity deriving \n     from this Louisiana energy renaissance have greatly \n     benefitted Louisiana public schools, higher education, \n     critical infrastructure development, and public health and \n     safety programs; and\n       Whereas, improved technologies and abundant resources have \n     made the United States of America the world's leading oil and \n     natural gas producer, overtaking Saudi Arabia and Russia; and\n       Whereas, the 1970s-era federal law prohibiting crude oil \n     exports is a relic from an era of scarcity and flawed price \n     control policies; and\n       Whereas, allowing American crude oil exports will \n     strengthen U.S. geopolitical influence by giving our trading \n     partners a more secure source of supply, and allowing the \n     export of American crude oil will make our allies less \n     dependent on crude oil from Russia and the Middle East; and\n       Whereas, the world's other major developed nations allow \n     crude oil exports, making the U.S. the only nation that does \n     not take full advantage of trading a valuable resource in \n     what is an otherwise global free market; and\n       Whereas, crude oil exports will benefit the U.S.'s national \n     security interests by decreasing the likelihood that global \n     oil supply can be used internationally as a strategic weapon; \n     and\n       Whereas, numerous studies have found that allowing American \n     crude oil into the world's free market will benefit U.S. \n     trade and American consumers while creating more high-paying \n     jobs for Louisianians; and\n       Whereas, the U.S. is the largest exporter of refined \n     petroleum products and would benefit even more substantially \n     from the export of both crude oil and refined petroleum \n     products; and\n\n[[Page S5210]]\n\n       Whereas, at least seven independent studies have confirmed \n     that repealing the ban on American crude oil exports will \n     lower U.S. gas prices, benefitting Louisiana consumers and \n     businesses; and\n       Whereas, many small and large Louisiana businesses that \n     support oil and gas development will benefit from ongoing \n     production; and\n       Whereas, manufacturers will benefit from less volatility in \n     energy costs; and\n       Whereas, encouraging a global marketplace that is more free \n     from artificial barriers will economically benefit Louisiana, \n     the rest of the U.S., and our friends around the world: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to recognize that crude oil \n     exports and free trade are in the national interest and take \n     all necessary steps to eliminate the current ban on crude oil \n     exports; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-51.

A bill to require agencies to publish the categorization of \ncertain proposed and final rules, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Regulatory \nImpact Scale on the Economy Small Business Act, also known as the RISE \nAct. One of Congress's most fundamental responsibilities is to provide \noversight to its vast regulatory structure, particularly as it pertains \nto small businesses. However, Congress lacks the proper framework to \neffectively monitor the impact of regulatory activity on small \nbusinesses. Today, there is no transparent, standardized means to \nrealize the economic scale of regulatory rules, either proposed or \nfinalized, to frame their economic significance on a comparative basis. \nLikewise, the American public also has no means to effectively gauge \nand monitor the significance of regulatory rules. With the current lack \nof scale, there is no means to categorically delineate between a ``big \nregulation'' and a ``really big regulation,'' resulting in less \neffective oversight.\n  In addition, agencies wield tremendous discretionary power in \ndetermining whether required small business analysis applies. Today, \nregulatory flexibility analysis is triggered when a proposed rule is \ndetermined by the issuing agency to have a ``significant economic \nimpact'' on a substantial number of small entities. However,\n\n[[Page S5213]]\n\nCongress has provided no bright-line standard to determine what \nconstitutes significant economic impact, allowing agencies to exercise \nan unnecessary amount of leniency to bypass regulatory flexibility \nanalysis, which is meant to give special consideration to small \nbusinesses.\n  To improve both Congress and public's ability to provide regulatory \noversight, I recommend that Congress should require agencies to \ncategorize each proposed and final rule based on the following \ncategories of economic impact: category 1 between $100 million and $500 \nmillion; category 2 between $500 million and $1 billion; category 3 \nbetween $1 billion and $5 billion; category 4 between $5 billion and \n$10 billion; and category 5 at $10 billion and over. To disallow \nagencies from abusing broad discretionary power, Congress should \nestablish a bright-line standard for ``significant economic impact'' of \n$100 million. Providing such guidance will provide accountability and \nconsistency across the vast regulatory structure and provide \nefficiencies for Congress. I believe this important piece of \nlegislation will provide clarity and direction for our regulatory \nefforts, and I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1807\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Regulatory Impact Scale on \n     the Economy Small Business Act of 2015'' or the ``RISE Small \n     Business Act of 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Keeping \n     Internet access affordable promotes consumer access to this \n     critical gateway to jobs, education, healthcare, and \n     entrepreneurial opportunities, regardless of race, income, or \n     neighborhood.\n       (4) Small business owners rely heavily on affordable \n     Internet access, providing them with access to new markets, \n     additional consumers, and an opportunity to compete in the \n     global economy.\n       (5) Economists have recognized that excessive taxation of \n     innovative communications technologies reduces economic \n     welfare more than taxes on other sectors of the economy.\n       (6) The provision of affordable access to the Internet is \n     fundamental to the American economy and access to it must be \n     protected from multiple and discriminatory taxes at the State \n     and local level.\n       (7) As a massive global network that spans political \n     boundaries, the Internet is inherently a matter of interstate \n     and foreign commerce within the jurisdiction of the United \n     States Congress under article I, section 8, clause 3 of the \n     Constitution of the United States.\n       (c) Permanent Moratorium on Internet Access Taxes and \n     Multiple and Discriminatory Taxes on Electronic Commerce.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 1101(a) of the Internet Tax \n     Freedom Act (47 U.S.C. 151 note), as amended by section 624 \n     of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations \n     Act, 2015 (Public Law 113-235), is amended by striking \n     ``during the period beginning November 1, 2003, and ending \n     October 1, 2015''.\n       (2) Effective date.--The amendment made by this subsection \n     shall apply to taxes imposed after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2263.

FUTURE INTERSTATE STUDY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) a well-developed system of transportation \n     infrastructure is critical to the economic well-being, \n     health, and welfare of the people of the United States;\n       (2) the 47,000-mile national Interstate System is the \n     backbone to that transportation infrastructure system; and\n       (3) as of the date of enactment of this Act--\n       (A) many segments of the approximately 60- year-old \n     Interstate System are well beyond the 50-year design life of \n     the System and yet these aging facilities are central to the \n     transportation infrastructure system, carrying 25 percent of \n     the vehicle traffic of the United States on just 1 percent of \n     the total public roadway mileage;\n       (B) the need for ongoing maintenance, preservation, and \n     reconstruction of the Interstate System has grown due to \n     increasing and changing travel demands; and\n       (C) simple maintenance of the current condition and \n     configuration of the Interstate System is insufficient for \n     the System to fully serve the transportation needs of the \n     United States for the next 50 years.\n       (b) Future Interstate System Study.--Not later than 180 \n     days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary \n     shall enter into an agreement with the Transportation \n     Research Board of the National Academies to conduct a study \n     on the actions needed to upgrade and restore the Dwight D. \n     Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways \n     to its role as a premier system network that meets the \n     growing and shifting demands of the 21st century and for the \n     next 50 years (referred to in this section as the ``study'').\n       (c) Methodologies.--In conducting the study, the \n     Transportation Research Board shall build on the \n     methodologies examined and recommended in the report prepared \n     for the American Association of State Highway and \n     Transportation Officials entitled ``National Cooperative \n     Highway Research Program Project 20-24(79): Specifications \n     for a National Study of the Future 3R, 4R, and Capacity Needs \n     of the Interstate System'' and dated December 2013.\n       (d) Recommendations.--The study--\n       (1) shall include specific recommendations regarding the \n     features, standards, capacity needs, application of \n     technologies, and intergovernmental roles to upgrade the \n     Interstate System, including any revisions to law (including \n     regulations) that the Transportation Research Board \n     determines appropriate to achieve the goals; and\n       (2) is encouraged to build on the robust institutional \n     knowledge in the highway industry in applying the techniques \n     involved in implementing the study.\n       (e) Considerations.--In carrying out the study, the \n     Transportation Research Board shall determine the need for \n     reconstruction and improvement of the Interstate System by \n     considering--\n       (1) future demands on transportation infrastructure \n     determined for national planning purposes, including \n     commercial and private traffic flows to serve future economic \n     activity and growth;\n       (2) the expected condition of the current Interstate System \n     over the next 50 years, including long-term deterioration and \n     reconstruction needs;\n       (3) those National Highway System routes that should be \n     added to the existing Interstate System to more efficiently \n     serve national traffic flows;\n       (4) features that would take advantage of technological \n     capabilities to address modern standards of construction, \n     maintenance, and operations, for purposes of safety, and \n     system management, taking into further consideration system \n     performance and cost; and\n       (5) the resources necessary to maintain and improve the \n     Interstate System, including the resources required to \n     upgrade those National Highway System routes identified in \n     paragraph (3) to Interstate standards.\n       (f) Consultation.--In carrying out the study, the \n     Transportation Research Board--\n       (1) shall convene and consult with a panel of national \n     experts including current and future owners, operators, and \n     users of the Interstate System and private sector \n     stakeholders;

POSTHUMOUS PARDON.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) John Arthur ``Jack'' Johnson was a flamboyant, defiant, \n     and controversial figure in the history of the United States \n     who challenged racial biases.\n       (2) Jack Johnson was born in Galveston, Texas, in 1878 to \n     parents who were former slaves.\n       (3) Jack Johnson became a professional boxer and traveled \n     throughout the United States, fighting White and African-\n     American heavyweights.\n       (4) After being denied (on purely racial grounds) the \n     opportunity to fight 2 White champions, in 1908, Jack Johnson \n     was granted an opportunity by an Australian promoter to fight \n     the reigning White title-holder, Tommy Burns.\n       (5) Jack Johnson defeated Tommy Burns to become the first \n     African-American to hold the title of Heavyweight Champion of \n     the World.\n       (6) The victory by Jack Johnson over Tommy Burns prompted a \n     search for a White\n\n[[Page S5424]]\n\n     boxer who could beat Jack Johnson, a recruitment effort that \n     was dubbed the search for the ``great white hope''.\n       (7) In 1910, a White former champion named Jim Jeffries \n     left retirement to fight Jack Johnson in Reno, Nevada.\n       (8) Jim Jeffries lost to Jack Johnson in what was deemed \n     the ``Battle of the Century''.\n       (9) The defeat of Jim Jeffries by Jack Johnson led to \n     rioting, aggression against African-Americans, and the \n     racially-motivated murder of African-Americans throughout the \n     United States.\n       (10) The relationships of Jack Johnson with White women \n     compounded the resentment felt toward him by many Whites.\n       (11) Between 1901 and 1910, 754 African-Americans were \n     lynched, some simply for being ``too familiar'' with White \n     women.\n       (12) In 1910, Congress passed the Act of June 25, 1910 \n     (commonly known as the ``White Slave Traffic Act'' or the \n     ``Mann Act'') (18 U.S.C. 2421 et seq.), which outlawed the \n     transportation of women in interstate or foreign commerce \n     ``for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any \n     other immoral purpose''.\n       (13) In October 1912, Jack Johnson became involved with a \n     White woman whose mother disapproved of their relationship \n     and sought action from the Department of Justice, claiming \n     that Jack Johnson had abducted her daughter.\n       (14) Jack Johnson was arrested by Federal marshals on \n     October 18, 1912, for transporting the woman across State \n     lines for an ``immoral purpose'' in violation of the Mann \n     Act.\n       (15) The Mann Act charges against Jack Johnson were dropped \n     when the woman refused to cooperate with Federal authorities, \n     and then married Jack Johnson.\n       (16) Federal authorities persisted and summoned a White \n     woman named Belle Schreiber, who testified that Jack Johnson \n     had transported her across States lines for the purpose of \n     ``prostitution and debauchery''.\n       (17) In 1913, Jack Johnson was convicted of violating the \n     Mann Act and sentenced to 1 year and 1 day in Federal prison.\n       (18) Jack Johnson fled the United States to Canada and \n     various European and South American countries.\n       (19) Jack Johnson lost the Heavyweight Championship title \n     to Jess Willard in Cuba in 1915.\n       (20) Jack Johnson returned to the United States in July \n     1920, surrendered to authorities, and served nearly a year in \n     the Federal penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas.\n       (21) Jack Johnson subsequently fought in boxing matches, \n     but never regained the Heavyweight Championship title.\n       (22) Jack Johnson served the United States during World War \n     II by encouraging citizens to buy war bonds and participating \n     in exhibition boxing matches to promote the war bond cause.\n       (23) Jack Johnson died in an automobile accident in 1946.\n       (24) In 1954, Jack Johnson was inducted into the Boxing \n     Hall of Fame.\n       (25) Senate Concurrent Resolution 29, 111th Congress, \n     agreed to July 29, 2009, expressed the sense of the 111th \n     Congress that Jack Johnson should receive a posthumous pardon \n     for his racially-motivated 1913 conviction.\n       (b) Recommendations.--It remains the sense of Congress that \n     Jack Johnson should receive a posthumous pardon--\n       (1) to expunge a racially-motivated abuse of the \n     prosecutorial authority of the Federal Government from the \n     annals of criminal justice in the United States; and\n       (2) in recognition of the athletic and cultural \n     contributions of Jack Johnson to society.\n\n     SEC. 10206.
