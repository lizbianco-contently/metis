Mr. President, I thank the minority leader, and I rise \nthis morning to thank and to welcome Rabbi Yosef Greenberg from \nAnchorage, AK, who was introduced by the President pro tempore, the \nSenator from Utah.\n  This Senator thinks it is important to appreciate and realize that \ntoday there is a little bit of history being made. It is the first time \nwe have had a rabbi from the State of Alaska who has been willing and \nable to provide the morning prayer before the Senate.\n  The rabbi has led our State for two decades, beginning in 1991, not \nonly leading a small but vibrant Jewish community across the State but \nalso reminding us of the significance of the Jewish culture, the Jewish \nhistory, not only to Alaska but throughout the Nation. He has been \ninstrumental in the building of the Jewish cultural center and a museum \nthat recognizes that history and culture. Every year he is truly a \nleader in the broader community within Anchorage as he brings together \npeople from all faiths at the Jewish Cultural Gala, which is probably \none of our more preeminent social gatherings and which is for a good \ncause.\n  The leadership of Rabbi Greenberg is not only strong and recognized \nwithin the Jewish community but across all faiths within our very broad \nand inclusive State of Alaska. It is indeed a pleasure to be able to \nlisten to his words, reflect on his words, and thank him for his \nleadership in my State.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I thank the leaders.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/03/senate-section/article/S531-5", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as I recently mentioned, Speaker Ryan \nand I had an opportunity to discuss some important public health issues \nat the\n\n[[Page S532]]\n\nWhite House yesterday. One was the Zika virus. We know there is an \nincreasing amount of concern about the spread of this virus and what it \ncould mean for the United States as we head toward warmer summer \nmonths.\n  Given the public concern that followed the first Ebola case in our \ncountry, I think we could all benefit from having a better \nunderstanding of what preparations are being made to protect Americans. \nTo that end, I have asked Secretary Burwell and her team to come to the \nSenate to brief relevant committees and leaders in both parties. This \nbriefing will happen next week. I appreciate the Secretary's \nwillingness to meet this request in such a timely manner, and I know \nthe information will be useful to Members and their constituents.\n  Another public health issue we discussed is the opioid epidemic that \ncontinues to have such a profound impact on families and communities \nacross the State I represent and, of course, across the Nation as well.\n  Despite all of the important steps Kentucky has taken at the State \nlevel to address this epidemic, the Commonwealth still suffers from \nsome of the highest drug overdose rates in the country, driven by \nprescription drug pain killers, heroin, and more recently fentanyl, a \nsynthetic opioid that is more powerful than heroin. Republicans and \nDemocrats are working together to identify bipartisan solutions to this \nchallenge, and I look forward to seeing that collaborative work \ncontinue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/03/senate-section/article/S532-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ENERGY POLICY MODERNIZATION BILL\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we have seen bipartisanship work many \ntimes over the past year in this Senate. We have the latest example of \nit before us right now. The Energy Policy Modernization Act is the \nresult of months of hard work across the aisle. It passed the committee \nwith overwhelming bipartisan support. It is broad bipartisan energy \nlegislation that can help bring our energy policies in line with \ntoday's demands, while preparing us for tomorrow's opportunities. It \nwill help Americans produce more energy. It will help Americans pay \nless for energy. It will help Americans save energy. It will also give \nus the opportunity to strengthen America's long-term national security.\n  I thank the chair and ranking member of the Energy Committee for \ntheir hard work to develop this bill. I thank them for their hard work \nmanaging it on the floor. Thirty-eight amendments have been brought to \nthe floor so far and 32 amendments have been adopted already. Democrats \noffered some, Republicans offered some, and both parties have seen \namendments from their side adopted.\n  This is a robust, bipartisan energy debate, and it is providing the \nlatest example of a Senate that is back to work for the American \npeople. We are not finished yet, though, not at all. There will be more \nopportunities for debate and consideration as we move toward the finish \nline on this important bipartisan legislation. Let's keep working \ntogether as we have been. Let's pass another important policy the \nAmerican people deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/03/senate-section/article/S532-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I join in commending the managers of this \nbill that is on the floor, but before we rush off to a congratulatory \nphase of this legislation, there has to be an opportunity to work \nsomething out on Flint, MI, and the tremendous problems they have.\n  There are 100,000 people today who are afraid to drink the water. \nYesterday I had a picture showing the water, the yellow-green color of \nthe water. The water is so impure, so dirty, so nasty that General \nMotors, which manufactures automobile parts, had to suspend using the \nwater because it was corroding their instruments in their manufacturing \nfacilities. But during that period of time, people were still looking \nto drink the only water they could.\n  We have 9,000 children who have been badly affected by lead \npoisoning. These little boys and girls will never be what they could be \nbecause lead poisoning for children is irreversible.\n  I hope we can work something out on the Stabenow-Peters amendment \nbecause it is very important for the people of Michigan and an example \nof what we need to do to help the country with these problems we have \nwhen the Federal Government must step in.\n  The Governor of Michigan, who preaches about how bad government is, \nof course looked to us when the problems got so dire in Michigan.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my \nleader remarks the junior Senator from Maine be recognized for 10 \nminutes, and if he feels it appropriate, I will remain on the floor for \nhim following my remarks so that he could have a colloquy with me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/03/senate-section/article/S532-4", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S532-S533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              CLEAN ENERGY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in 1882 Thomas Edison invented the first \nelectricity grid. He, of course, had done electricity before that, but \nhe is virtually responsible for the modern-day electric grid. It was \nonly 4 years later that George Westinghouse improved upon Edison's \ninvention, and he gave us an electric grid that is almost identical to \nwhat we have today. That was 1882, and in 2016 we are doing it the same \nway we did back then. So the grid technology the utility companies rely \non today is 130 years old.\n  America's grid system makes money for utilities by generating \nelectricity at central powerplants and delivering power to customers \nthrough power lines. That is because of George Westinghouse and Thomas \nEdison's programs. Costs for the infrastructure are paid by all \ncustomers based on how much power they consume, and the more \nelectricity we use, the more we pay. This utility business model made \nsense for 130 years. It makes no sense anymore.\n  Utilities never imagined that families and businesses would be able \nto generate their own electricity for a price cheaper than the utility \npowerplants. Utilities never considered that consumers would rather pay \nto make their homes more efficient than pay for power they don't need \nand don't want. Utilities didn't expect Americans would grow to believe \nthat reducing climate-changing carbon pollution is a priority--and it \nis.\n  The big power companies were wrong. Americans have embraced renewable \nenergy and are investing in it more and more. I see it every time I go \nhome. The roofs of homes and businesses throughout Nevada are dotted \nwith solar panels. One can see them shining on the roofs. These houses, \noffice buildings, and hotels are generating much of their own clean \nenergy. It wasn't that way a decade ago. In 2005, only 7,000 American \nhomes and businesses had their own renewable energy systems. That same \nyear, after we passed the Energy Policy Act--one of its provisions \nencouraged States to adopt net metering provisions so that Americans \nwould and could install renewable energy systems on their homes and \nbusinesses. That means a family with solar panels receives a credit \nfrom the utility for the clean power they generate. As a result, 43 \nStates now have net metering. These net metering policies have been an \nincredible success. Today more than 500,000 American families and \nbusinesses have their own renewable energy system.\n\n  Less than 11 years ago, there were 7,000 solar installations in homes \nand businesses, today more than half a million. That is a 7,000-percent \nincrease over 11 years ago. Producing cleaner energy at home is \nmainstream today. Yet, in spite of all of this progress, there are \nthose who want to turn back time and take away Americans opportunity to \ngenerate their own clean, affordable energy.\n  Why are they doing this? Because they don't want competition from \nfamilies and businesses. They want to work the way they have for 130 \nyears. The Koch brothers and the fossil fuel pals have attacked our \nblossoming energy industry, the clean energy industry, at every turn. \nAny time we try to do something, they move in. They have\n\n[[Page S533]]\n\ndone it in State legislatures all over the country. They are doing it \ntoday on this amendment that Senator King and I have worked on.\n  They have turned loose their minions--their anti-consumer minions--\nand they are now out working, being paid to do whatever they can to \ndefeat whatever we are trying to accomplish. Utilities have joined with \nthe Koch brothers. Utilities are cheerleading this anti-competitive \nmeasure that will cost families more money and take away their \nopportunity to generate clean energy at home.\n  In Nevada, our utility proposed--and I say ``utility'' because \nbasically 95 percent of all electricity in Nevada is owned by one \ncompany. This big utility proposed, and regulators recently agreed to \nslash, the value of rooftop solar for customers and imposed those \nchanges retroactively. Can you imagine that? Contracts that had been \nlet, they suddenly said: Well, too bad. We are going to retroactively \npunch you economically. The entire episode was detailed in a recent \nedition of the New York Times. ``Nevada's Solar Bait-and-Switch.''\n  This could apply to Arizona. They are trying do the same thing there \nand other places in the country. I am not going to read the whole \ncolumn, but I am going to read a few things:\n\n       In late December, the state's Public Utilities Commission, \n     which regulates Nevada's energy market, announced a rate \n     change drastic enough to kill Nevada's booming rooftop solar \n     market and drive providers out of the state. Effective Jan. \n     1, the new tariffs will gradually increase until they triple \n     monthly fees that solar users pay to use the electric grid \n     and cut by three-quarters--\n\n  Seventy-five percent--\n\n     users' reimbursements for feeding electricity into [the \n     grid].\n\n  They already have a contract. That does not matter. The column goes \non to say:\n\n       More startlingly, the commission made its decision \n     retroactive. That means that the 17,000 Nevada residents who \n     were lured into solar purchases by state-mandated one-time \n     rebates of up to $23,000 suddenly discovered that they were \n     victims of a bait-and-switch. They made the deals assume \n     that, allowing for inflation, their rates would stay constant \n     over their contracts' 20- to 30-year lifetimes; instead, they \n     face the prospect of paying much more for electricity than if \n     they had never made the change, even though they're \n     generating almost all of their electricity themselves.\n\n  That is the power of utilities and Koch brother-like operations that \nare doing this. The Koch brothers are doing it through a number of \nbillions of dollars that they have invested in controlling America \nthrough an organization called ALEC, which is a phony front to work in \nState legislatures.\n  The utility in Nevada retroactively tore up the agreements that were \nmade with families and businesses that generate their own clean energy, \nas indicated in this New York Times column. Because of what the utility \ndid, at least three companies have left Nevada, and tens of thousands \nof families and businesses fear that their power bills will \nunexpectedly skyrocket because of the changes, and thousands and \nthousands of Nevadans have lost their jobs--not hundreds, thousands. No \none knows the exact number but nearing 10,000.\n  We should not be pulling the plug on clean energy at a time when more \nand more Americans are making it work. We should encourage \nindependence. Competition is putting more clean power on our electric \ngrid. We should support this growing solar industry, which is creating \njobs. Solar alone created over 35,000 new jobs in 2015, a 20-percent \ngrowth rate. With what we did in the omnibus and the tax extenders at \nthe end of the year, it is estimated that in the next 10 years there \nwill be about 350,000 jobs in the solar industry.\n  That is why Senator King and I have worked on amendment No. 3120, \nwhich would protect residential solar energy customers from the abuse \nthat we have just talked about here and as outlined in the New York \nTimes.\n  This amendment is good for consumers in Nevada and across the \ncountry. It will safeguard people who want to generate their own clean \nenergy from retroactive rule changes that could devastate their \nfinances. Unfortunately, monopoly utilities and ideological groups \nfunded by the Koch brothers are working hard to defeat any protections \nfor Americans who generate their own clean energy. Remember, the Koch \nbrothers use their money in a lot of different ways, not the least of \nwhich is in the fossil fuel business.\n  These anti-competitive individuals are fighting our efforts to \nprotect families and businesses from having their contracts torn up and \nhaving their bills skyrocket. My friend, the Senator from Maine is on \nthe floor with me. I appreciate his advocacy. He has been at the \nforefront of this issue, a person who has extensive experience in this \nwhole field, having been a Governor of the State of Maine when the \npower system there began to change.\n  He is the sponsor of this amendment. I have joined with him on this \namendment. He has been an unwavering advocate for solar energy \ncustomers. I hope our colleagues will follow his example and stand for \nconsumers and support each American's choice to install clean energy on \ntheir homes and protect them from retroactive rate hikes and abusive \nfees.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/03/senate-section/article/S533-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Democratic leader has just outlined the \nissue that is before us today. I want to put it into some context. The \nfirst thing I want to say is that what we are talking about today is \nthe most fundamental of American economic principles--free-market \ncompetition. Free-market competition is what we are talking about here.\n  Now, as the Democratic leader outlined, for 135 years, our electrical \nsystem worked basically in the same way that it works today. It has \nworked because of central powerplants, wires, distribution and \ntransmission systems, and homes. Homes and businesses and offices were \nthe passive receptors of electricity. The utilities have done a \nwonderful job. I have worked with them over the years. They have done a \ncomplex job where the power has to be there when the switch is thrown. \nThey have done a terrific job of serving the American public, but what \nthe American public wants is not necessarily electricity itself, it \nwants what electricity can do.\n  A friend of mine once said, for example, that in this country every \nyear, 5 million people buy quarter-inch drills, but nobody wants \nquarter-inch drills. What they want are holes. What the American people \nwant are microwaves and televisions and computers and electricity and \nhot water in their homes. How that power comes is really not what they \nare concerned with, but they do want options.\n  A revolution has occurred. Without a doubt this system served us well \nfor 130 years, but a revolution has occurred in the last 25 years. This \nchart dramatically shows what has happened. This is the price of a watt \nof solar energy. In the 1970s it was $76. Today it is 36 cents. This is \nrevolutionary. This is disruptive. This is change. What this has \nenabled is for us to now tap into that very large, fully permitted \nnuclear fusion device in the sky that delivers power wirelessly to \nevery city, town, village and hamlet on Earth.\n  That is what we are talking about. Why is this important? For a \nnumber of reasons. If you combine the cheaper solar power with smart \nappliances that can use their power only when it is the most \nefficacious for the grid--smart meters that many of our grids now have, \ndemand response that allows customers to diminish their demand at times \nof high demand on the grid, and new storage technologies, if you add \nall of those together, it is an entirely new world of electricity \ndevelopment. This is where we are today.\n  We still have central powerplants. We still have wires, but we have \nhomes and businesses making their own electricity and storing their own \nelectricity from that big nuclear fusion\n\n[[Page S534]]\n\nplant up in the sky. This is a good development. No. 1, it empowers \nconsumers. It empowers families.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  It is also true, is it not, as we speak, that there is tremendous \nwork being done on battery storage. That will change it even more; is \nthat right?\n  Mr. KING. That is absolutely correct. That I will touch on in a \nmoment. That potentially changes the relationship with utilities and \nwith the grid system. This is a good thing. This provides competition. \nOur whole system is based upon competition. Everybody here talks about \nthe power of the market. That is what we are talking about here.\n  It strengthens the grid by making it more resilient because power is \ngoing in two directions. We had a huge ice storm in Maine in 1998. The \npower went off. Everybody lost their power--600,000 people. The people \nwho had generators in their homes could make their own power, but those \nwere very few people. Now we are talking about a grid that is not \nwholly dependent upon a central powerplant but power goes in both \ndirections.\n  I am on the Intelligence and Armed Services Committees. This is a \nnational security issue. One of the great vulnerabilities of this \ncountry is a cyber attack on critical infrastructure. To the extent \nthis infrastructure is self-healing and distributed, it is less subject \nto a catastrophic attack.\n  It saves money because it saves money on distribution and powerplants \nif people are making their own investments and you don't not need the \nlevel of transmission and distribution wires. Of course it could \nsubstantially reduce our dependency upon fossil fuels. There are two \npossible reactions to this from the utility companies. One is to adopt, \nadjust, and reinvent themselves, as companies have done. I remember New \nEngland Tel. New England Tel is now Verizon. If they were still focused \nexclusively on landlines with the old black telephones, they would be \nlong gone. Instead, they reinvented themselves because of a change of \ntechnology, and now they are one of the Nation's leading wireless \nproviders. AT used to be Ma Bell. Now it is a leading wireless \nprovider because they adapted, and they changed their whole business \nmodel based upon new economic realities. That is one option.\n  There are utilities in the country that are adopting that option; \nthat are finding new business models, relationships with their \ncustomers, in order to participate in this system and be counselors and \nenergy providers and consultants to their customers in this new world. \nOn the other hand, they can fight, resist, and try to delay. That is \nwhat we are talking about here today. That is what has happened in \nNevada, imposing high fixed fees that ostensibly are to recover the \ncosts, but everybody knows the real purpose is to strangle this \nindustry in its infancy.\n  I think those companies should think about the examples of Packard, \nKodak, and Polaroid that failed to adapt, that failed to take account \nof new technological realities and ultimately failed. I don't think \nthat is the future these companies want. This amendment is not a \nFederal takeover of State utility regulations. It provides guidance. It \nuses the term ``take into account.'' All it says is that if you are \ngoing to change a net metering regime, or if you are going to impose \nfees, they have to be based upon data and analysis, not arbitrary fees \nthat are designed to strangle the industry. It is not a mandate for net \nmetering or any other kind of payment. Again, what we are trying to do \nis to make sure that the benefits to the grid from a home \ninstallation--whether it is demand, response, storage, whatever--are \nmeasured as well as the cost.\n\n  The issue is very simple. It is fair compensation to the customer for \nthe energy they produce or save and fair compensation to the utility \nfor maintaining the grid.\n  I know there are costs to the utility for maintaining the grid, and \nthey have to be fairly compensated. But the question is fair. What is \nthe right number? An arbitrary exorbitant fee that essentially makes \nthe development of solar or storage unfeasible is not the right number.\n  The Democratic leader mentioned storage, and this is really an \nessential part of the discussion. As storage technology improves, this \nis where the utilities are most exposed. In my view, utilities are in a \nrace with battery technology in order to determine who is going to \nprovide the backup to the solar, wind, and demand response facilities \nin the house. Who is going to provide the backup?\n  If the utilities insist upon high, unreasonable fees, eventually--and \nI think ``eventually'' is within 5 years; it is not 10 years, 20 years \nor 30 years--people are going to say: I am going to do my own storage, \nmy own backup in my basement, and cut the wires. Then the utility has \nlost the customer all together, and I don't think that makes any sense.\n  The real point is that change is coming anyway. The only question is \nwhether it happens fairly, deliberately, and expeditiously and is fair \nto the customers as well as the utilities or whether it goes through a \nlong series of individual fights State by State.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KING. I yield to the Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. I am wondering if my friend is aware of a couple of \nexamples. In Nevada there is Tesla and Elon Musk. It is a massive \ncompany. He is building batteries for his vehicles and other things.\n  The Tesla plant I toured a few months ago is under construction. As \nto the floor plan, the only place in America with a bigger \nmanufacturing facility is the Boeing plant in Washington. That is how \nhuge it is. The man who is running that plant for him indicated to me \nthat they had found that the price, as indicated by the Senator from \nMaine, was so cheap with solar that it is going to be basically mostly \nsolar, nothing else. Was the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. KING. Absolutely, and I think that is what has to be part of the \ndiscussion, because if the utilities insist on fighting and trying to \noverprice their storage, people are just going to say: I am going to \nbuy my own storage, put it in the basement, and cut the wire.\n  Mr. REID. And remember what he is manufacturing in this huge facility \nis batteries. So I would think Elon Musk, who has been sending people \nand cargo into space, is going to come up with an idea to make better \nbatteries.\n  I would also suggest to my friend that the example of Packard and \nKodak were very good examples. But more modern, I read a book a few \nmonths ago about Reed Hastings, the owner of Netflix, who had already \nbeen successful in another line of work when he went into Netflix. We \nall remember Blockbuster, where we would go to rent our movies. He went \nto Blockbuster and he said: I have an idea; here is what I would like \nto do.\n  They said: No, that is just a niche business. We are not interested.\n  Blockbuster is gone, and Netflix is every place. So the same thing is \ngoing to happen one way or another to these monopolies that have the \npower in our States. They should work something out to make sure they \nare ahead of the curve. Otherwise, they are going to be behind the \ncurve--and fairly quickly.\n  Would the Senator agree with that?\n  Mr. KING. I would agree, and that is exactly where I would conclude. \nI am not anti-utility. I am pro-customer. I am pro-competition. I am \npro-free markets. I believe the utilities have a tremendous opportunity \nhere to modify and adapt their business model to maintain their \nrelationship with their customers. But if they do not, then I am afraid \nthat technological changes such as storage are going to overtake them, \nand they could go the way of Kodak, Blockbuster, and Polaroid. I don't \nwant to see that happen because I think they have a tremendous value to \ncontribute to this discussion.\n  I conclude by saying that this amendment is really a modest one. It \nis not a takeover of the regulatory process. It simply urges and \nadvocates that the State public utilities commissions take into account \nthe positive factors of solar as well as the costs in order to reach a \nfair compensation agreement between utilities and their customers.\n  This is the future. It is going to happen. The only question is \nwhether it happens efficiently, fairly or by fighting. I would prefer \nthe former option. I think this is an important part of the future of \nthis country, and we have an important role to play in this body.\n\n[[Page S535]]\n\n  I urge support for this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, across the street at the Supreme Court, \nfour simple words are engraved on the face of the building: ``Equal \nJustice Under Law.'' That is supposed to be the basic premise of our \nlegal system: that our laws are just and that everyone--no matter how \nrich, how powerful or how well connected--will be held equally \naccountable if they break those laws.\n  But that is not the America we live in. It is not equal justice when \na kid gets thrown in jail for stealing a car while a CEO gets a huge \nraise when his company steals billions. It is not equal justice when \nsomeone hooked on opioids gets locked up for buying pills on the \nstreet, but banking executives get off scot-free for laundering nearly \na $1 billion of drug cartel money.\n  We have one set of law on the books, but there are really two legal \nsystems. One legal system is for big corporations, for the wealthy and \nthe powerful. In this legal system, government officials fret about \nunintended consequences if they are too tough. In this legal system, \ninstead of demanding actual punishment for breaking the law, the \ngovernment regularly accepts token fines and phony promises to do \nbetter next time. In this legal system, even after huge companies plead \nguilty to felonies, law enforcement officials are so timid that they \ndon't even bring charges against individuals who work there. That is \none system.\n  The second system is for everyone else. In this second system, \nwhoever breaks the law can be held accountable. Government enforcement \nisn't timid here. It is aggressive, and consequences be damned. Just \nask the families of Sandra Bland, Freddie Gray, and Michael Brown about \nhow aggressive they are.\n  In this legal system, the government locks up people for decades, \nruining lives over minor drug crimes because that is what the law \ndemands.\n  Yes, there are two legal systems--one for the rich and powerful and \none for everyone else.\n  Last Friday I released a report about the special legal system for \nbig corporations and their executives. The report is called ``Rigged \nJustice,'' and it lists 20 examples from last year alone in which the \ngovernment caught big companies breaking the law--defrauding taxpayers, \ncovering up deadly safety problems, stealing billions from consumers \nand clients--and then just let them off easy. In most cases the \ngovernment imposed fines and didn't require any admission of guilt. In \nthe 20 cases I examined, just 1 executive went to jail for a measly 3 \nmonths, and that case involved 29 deaths. Most fines were only a tiny \nfraction of the company's annual profits, and some were structured so \nthat the companies could just write them off as a tax deduction.\n  It is all part of a rigged game in Washington. Big businesses and \npowerful donors, with their armies of lobbyists and lawyers, write the \nrules to protect themselves. And when they don't follow the rules, they \nwork the system to avoid any real responsibility.\n  How can it be that corporate offenders are repeatedly left off the \nhook when the vast majority of Americans--Republicans, Democrats, and \nIndependents--want tougher punishment and stronger new laws for \ncorporate crimes?\n  Well, that is how a rigged system works. Giant companies win no \nmatter what the American people want.\n  Currently, we can see the rigged game in action. Republican \npoliticians love to say they are tough on crime. They love to talk \nabout personal responsibility and accountability when they are back \nhome in their districts. But when they come to Washington, they are \npushing to make it even easier for corporate criminals to escape \njustice.\n  This is one example. It starts, actually, with a great idea: \nreforming the criminal justice sentencing system to help some of the \nthousands of people who have been locked away for years for low-level \noffenses. Legislators in both parties have been working for years to \nslowly build bipartisan momentum for sentencing the reform. This is \nenormously important--a first step away from a broken system where half \nof our Federal jails are filled with nonviolent drug offenders. But \nnow, all of a sudden, some Republicans are threatening to block reform \nunless Congress includes a so-called mens rea amendment to make it much \nharder for the government to prosecute hundreds of corporate crimes--\ncrimes for everything from wire fraud to mislabeling prescription \ndrugs.\n  In other words, for these Republicans, the price of helping people \nunjustly locked up in jail for years will be to make it even harder to \nlock up a white collar criminal for even a single day.\n  That is shameful--shameful. It is shameful because we are already way \ntoo easy on corporate lawbreakers.\n  And that is not all. Tomorrow the House will be voting on another \nRepublican bill. This one would make it much harder to investigate and \nprosecute bank fraud. Yes, you heard that right. Tomorrow the House \nwill be voting on a Republican bill to make it much harder to \ninvestigate and prosecute bank fraud.\n  When the bankers triggered the savings and loan crisis in the late \n1980s, more than 1,000 of them were convicted of crimes and many got \nserious jail time. Boy, bankers learned their lesson. Now the lesson \nwas not ``Don't break the law.'' The lesson they learned was ``Get \nWashington on your side.'' And it worked.\n  After systemic fraud on Wall Street helped spark a financial crisis \nin 2008 that cost millions of Americans their jobs and their homes, \nFederal prosecutors didn't put a single Wall Street executive in jail. \nSpineless regulators extracted a few fines and then just moved on.\n  But I guess even those fines were just too much for the big banks and \ntheir fancy executives. So now they have gotten their buddies in \nCongress to line up behind a bill that would gut one of their main \nlaws, called FIRREA, which the Justice Department used to impose those \nfines.\n  It has been 7 years since the financial crisis. A lot of people in \nWashington may want to forget, but the American people have long \nmemories. They remember how corporate fraud caused millions of families \nto lose their homes, their jobs, and their pensions. They also remember \nwho made out like bandits, and they didn't send us here to help out the \nbandits.\n  The American people expect better from us. They expect us to \nstraighten out our criminal justice system and reform drug enforcement \npractices that do nothing but destroy lives and communities. They \nexpect us to stand against unjustified violence. But they also expect \nus to protect the financial system and to hold Wall Street executives \naccountable when they break the law. They expect us to hold big \ncompanies accountable when they steal billions of dollars from \ntaxpayers, when they rip off students, veterans, retirees or single \nmoms; or when they cover up health or safety problems, and people get \nsick, people get hurt or people die because of it.\n  The American people know that we have two legal systems, but they \nexpect us to fix it. They expect us to stand for justice. They expect \nus to once again honor the simple notion that, in America, nobody is \nabove the law. And anyone in Congress who thinks they can simply talk \ntough on crime and then vote to make it harder to crack down on \ncorporate criminals, hear this: I promise you--I promise you, the \nAmerican people are watching, and they will remember.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton).

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an urgent \nand truly tragic situation in Flint, MI, and ask my colleagues in the \nSenate to look very hard at what has happened here and to help us \naddress this issue.\n  This is a public health emergency on a massive scale. It is \nunprecedented. I don't know of any other American city where families \nin the entire city--in the entire city--can't drink their water, can't \ncook with their water, can't bathe their children with the water.\n  We need to be very clear. This morning, as every other morning now \ngoing on 2 years, people in Flint took showers by pouring bottled water \nover their\n\n[[Page S536]]\n\nheads. They didn't have the dignity of clean water coming out of their \ntaps. They had to use bottled water to drink, to make breakfast for \ntheir children, to make a pot of coffee--the things we all use water \nfor and the things that all of us take for granted every single day. \nThey will not have clean water until the pipes get replaced.\n  Up until now, we have had what we thought was a good series of \nnegotiations. We thought we had an agreement. I have been very hopeful \nabout the bipartisan discussions to help these families, and we have \nbeen incredibly flexible, Senator Peters and I. We just want to get \nthis done. We are not interested in the politics or making this \npartisan. We want to get something done for the people of Flint.\n  We understand that money doesn't grow on trees. Senator Peters and I \nare willing in fact to support a proposal that was less than half of \nwhat we originally requested in order to be able to immediately get \nsome help to the families of Flint. Now, we can't even get agreement on \nthat because we are hearing procedural excuses--procedural excuses that \nare overcome every single day on this Senate floor when we want to. \nLord knows, there were a whole bunch on the Transportation bill, all of \nwhich were waived because people wanted to fix the roads. I am left \nwondering what is going on. What is really going on here?\n  I am asking that we come together and understand that this is a \nserious, urgent issue and that we not accept procedural excuses. It is \nan urgent, severe, outrageous crisis, and we need to act now.\n  When we look at what has been said on the Senate floor, it is very \nconcerning to me. One Senator yesterday said we are putting the cart \nbefore the horse by asking for money even before the government knew \nwhat this was going to cost. But, in fact, the Governor in writing \nrequested from the President $766 million to replace the pipes in Flint \nand another $41 million in protective measures. So we are working \nwithin the numbers that the Governor of Michigan has identified and \nrequested. While we truly don't know the full cost until work begins, \nas with any project, we need to begin to get this done immediately.\n  I think what is most important is for us to focus on what is \nhappening to the children and families. No lead level is safe, and I \nhave to say I know a lot more about lead than I have ever known before. \nFrankly, hearing about the damage done to children and what can happen \nto individuals is really frightening. We should all be doing everything \nwe can to make sure we address this lead issue across the board.\n  The threshold set by the EPA and the Center for Disease Control is 15 \nparts per billion of exposure. The water filters that FEMA has provided \nto families in Flint are certified to protect lead up to 150 parts per \nbillion. In many places, when they are provided and used correctly, \nthat is making a real difference. But, unfortunately, we look at the \nseverity of this. Last week, a new round of tests showed that lead in \nsome homes in Flint range from 153 parts up to 4,000 parts per billion. \nIf they are saying 15 parts per billion is when we need to be worried, \nI can't even fathom 4,000 parts.\n  We are all looking at all the different numbers, but I heard one \ncommentator in the news say that the exposure to children and families \nin those particular homes is actually higher than a toxic waste dump. \nAnd this is after the city switched back to the Detroit water system \nbecause of the damage that was done to the pipes. So this is severe and \nurgent. We have to act now.\n  Unfortunately, the same Senator also suggested we are putting the \ncart before the horse because this was a local issue. Come on. I am \nreally glad that the people of the great State of Michigan didn't have \nthat attitude when a fertilizer plant in West Texas exploded and we \nspent millions of dollars in Federal funding on that town. That was \nalso a manmade disaster where safety procedures were lax. We all saw \nthe horror of that situation, and we stepped in as Americans to support \nthat community and those families. That is all we are asking. When \nfloods hit South Carolina and Texas last year, we came together with \n$300 million put in an omnibus for South Carolina and Texas for floods. \nAnd just last week, the same Member of the Republican leadership asked \nPresident Obama to grant a disaster declaration and funneled millions \nof dollars to his State.\n  We all know we have challenges in our States, and we need to be \nthoughtful. But we need to be supporting Americans around the country. \nThis is a disaster. This is a situation where we need to show that we \ncare about a group of people who did nothing. They did nothing, and \nthey are in a situation where their entire water system is unusable. We \nshould be lending a hand.\n  Right now, we have up to 9,000 children under the age of 6 in Flint--\n9,000 children--who are exposed to lead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I appreciate that I am running out of time. I will \nclose. I will be back a lot today. I would just indicate to the \nPresident and to others that we want this fixed. We have been working \nin good faith. We thought we had an agreement working within the \nframework given to us by the Republicans working on this issue. We are \nnot going to let procedural issues that are fixed every single day in \nthe Senate get in the way of what is happening. I am not going to tell \nfamilies, I am not going to tell children, I am not going to tell moms \nin Flint ``Sorry, we can't help you'' because of some bureaucratic \nprocedural issue that folks don't want to fix when they fix them every \nsingle day.\n  I yield the floor, and I will be back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/03/senate-section/article/S536-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S536-S537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ENERGY POLICY MODERNIZATION BILL\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, for the past week the Senate has been \ndebating the way that America produces and uses our energy. We have \ntalked about how these issues affect our economy, how they affect our \ncommunities, and how they affect the world--the world that we hope to \nleave to our children.\n  As Senators have come to the floor and offered their ideas, I have \ntried to keep one basic idea in mind, and that idea is that we want to \nmake energy as clean as we can, as fast as we can, as long as it \ndoesn't raise costs on American families. I think that is the goal of \nmany Members of the Senate with regard to this bipartisan legislation.\n  I want to talk today about two bipartisan ideas--ideas that some of \nus have offered to make this legislation even better. One of the first \namendments the Senate took up on this bill was an amendment I offered, \nalong with Senator Schatz, that passed by voice vote. He is a Democrat, \nI am a Republican, and it is something that both of us think is a very \ngood idea.\n  This amendment creates a prize system to encourage new technologies \nthat could remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and permanently \nsequester it. A lot of the Members of this body talk about reducing \ncarbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Some of them want to reduce this by \ncutting the amount of emissions of carbon dioxide; some want to do it \nwith a carbon tax; and some others want to do it by banning some of the \nenergy sources that we need today to power our economy. The problem \nwith that approach is that it severally reduces how much energy we as \nAmericans can use, and it raises the cost of energies on hardworking \nfamilies.\n  We just got the new economic numbers that are out in terms of \neconomic growth in America for the last quarter of last year--0.7 \npercent. That is the last quarter of 2015. That is nowhere near the \ngrowth that we need in this country for a healthy economy. It is \nnothing.\n  Cutting back on the types of energy resources Americans can use by \nsome of these proposals or by making energy much more expensive is not \ngoing to help our economy grow as we need it to in terms of having a \nhealthy, strong economy.\n  The amendment that Senator Schatz and I have introduced looks at this \nissue from a very different direction. It looks at the carbon that is \nalready in the atmosphere. The amendment says we should be looking much \nmore at finding a way to remove some of that carbon dioxide. To get \nthat done, America needs to invest more in developing new technology \nthat can accomplish it, not just through more spending or more \ngovernment research but by setting up a series of prizes for different \ntechnical breakthroughs. By doing that, we can turn to ingenuity\n\n[[Page S537]]\n\nand to innovation to solve the problem. That includes the private \nsector, universities, and even just someone out tinkering in their \ngarage and coming up with a great idea.\n  Prizes like this are not a new idea. Back in 1714 the British \nGovernment offered a big prize for the first person to invent a better \nway for measuring longitude. It was a clockmaker whose name was John \nHarrison. He won the prize, and his idea transformed the way that we \nsail the seas.\n  In 1927 Charles Lindbergh flew nonstop from New York to Paris. This \nhelped create the new modern aviation industry. He took the flight to \nwin a $25,000 prize-sponsored by a New York hotel owner.\n  The prize created by this amendment--and there is more than one. \nThere are several prizes. The prizes created by this amendment are \nmeant to encourage that kind of new thinking, that kind of bold action. \nSo that is one of the amendments, one of the bipartisan ideas.\n  Another amendment and idea that we have talked about, which is again \nbipartisan, is an amendment we voted on yesterday, amendment No. 3030. \nThis was an idea that had bipartisan support. My lead cosponsor was my \nfriend from North Dakota, Senator Heitkamp. This amendment would have \nexpedited the permit process for natural gas gathering lines on Federal \nlands, on Indian lands. Gathering lines are pipelines that collect \nunprocessed gas from oil and gas wells and then ship it to a processing \nplant. At the plant, the different kind of gases--methane, propane--are \nseparated from one another. Then they are shipped out again by other \npipelines to locations where they can be sold and used by people to \npower our country, to power our economy. That is what the producers \nwant to do. The problem is, we don't have enough of these gathering \nlines to gather up this gas and send it to the processing plants. So a \nlot of times there is only one option, and that is to flare or vent the \nexcess natural gas at the well. If there were more gathering lines, \nthen we would have a lot less waste.\n  You don't have to take my word for it. Last month, the Obama \nadministration proposed a new rule that restricts this kind of flaring \nof oil and gas operations on Federal land and on Indian land. In that \nrule, the administration admitted that the main way to avoid flaring \n``is to capture, transport, and process'' that gas for sale, using the \nsame technologies that are used for natural gas wells. It makes sense. \nThe administration said that the rate of energy production in some of \nthe areas outpaces the rate of development of this infrastructure to \ncapture the gas. The administration said the production had overwhelmed \nthe capacity of the gathering lines, and Senator Heitkamp and I were \ntalking about ways to deal with the problem. Even though the \nadministration seems to recognize and give voice to the problem, its \nproposed rule doesn't actually address the problem or provide a \nsolution, and Senator Heitkamp and I have a solution.\n  The rule doesn't do anything to speed up the permit process for \nnatural gas gathering pipelines. The President ignores that component. \nWhether you agree with this new rule or you disagree with it, the only \npractical way to reduce the venting or the flaring of natural gas is to \nbuild more of these gathering lines. The rule will not work without \nthem.\n  If we don't build the infrastructure to solve the problem, the \nadministration's rule will end up pushing oil and gas production off of \nFederal lands, off of Indian land, and this is completely unacceptable. \nIt is unworkable.\n  The Obama administration says this type of gas venting and flaring is \nbad for the environment. They say the government is losing royalty \nmoney because the gas isn't being sold. I agree. That is why the \nbipartisan amendment Senator Heitkamp and I sponsored would solve both \nof these problems at once. Even though we weren't able to get that \namendment adopted yesterday, this is an idea that all Republicans and \nDemocrats should be able to support. It would help Americans get the \nenergy we need and do it in a cleaner way and at a lower cost. That is \nthe goal.\n  I know Senators on both sides of the aisle are going to keep talking \nabout this idea, and we are going to keep trying to get it enacted into \nlaw. These are just two commonsense, bipartisan ideas Republicans and \nDemocrats have offered to solve the energy challenges America is \nfacing.\n  In my home State of Wyoming, people know we need to balance a strong \neconomy and a healthy environment. They are in favor of using our \nnatural resources responsibly. Part of that is remembering that these \nare resources and resources should be and can be used.\n  We should also recognize that the important resource we have in this \ncountry is American ingenuity. We should be investing in it. We should \nbe cutting through the redtape that holds back innovation. Abraham \nLincoln once said that when we face new and difficult challenges, we \nmust think anew, and we must act anew. Lincoln knew the importance of \nsetting a big goal, of unleashing the ingenuity of the American people \nto get it done. He had the vision for the transcontinental railroad. He \nalso signed the original charter for the National Academy of Sciences. \nWe must think anew; we must act anew.\n  It is not enough for environmental extremists to say that the \nresources have to stay in the ground. That is not realistic. That is \nnot responsible. America can do better, and the American people are \nready to be part of this solution. They are ready to make energy as \nclean as we can, as fast as we can, without raising costs on American \nfamilies. They need us to help show the way.

Mr. President, first of all, I am privileged and honored \nto commend Zippy Duvall, a great Georgian who just a few weeks ago was \nelected, in the 97th year of the American Farm Bureau, as its 12th \npresident. Zippy has been the president of the Georgia Farm Bureau \nsince 2006. He has been a leader in our State for decades, and I am so \nproud he will now represent agriculture throughout our country. He \nhimself is a cattleman. He raises hay. He raises broilers. He has run \nthe Farm Bureau and been a great advocate for agriculture and farming \nin our State.\n  He and his wife Bonnie have four children and three grandchildren. He \nserves on the Farmers Bank board. He serves as the president of the \nGeorgia Farm Bureau. He serves on the local electric membership \ncorporation board. He serves on the soil and water conservation board. \nHe is a total public servant, and he is an outstanding advocate for \nagriculture and an outstanding representative of our State.\n  The best example of Zippy Duvall that I know is, if you ride through \nSouth Georgia--the heart of agriculture country in my State--and you \nlook at all the bumper stickers on all the pickup trucks, you will see \na unique bumper sticker--not mine, not a Member of Congress's, not the \nGovernor's, but a bumper sticker that says very simply ``Ditch the \nRule.'' Zippy Duvall was one of the leaders in our country who took on \nthe EPA to stop from going into place the waters of the U.S.A. \nregulations that would hurt agriculture so desperately in our State. \nThat bumper sticker became a slogan for agriculture all over the \ncountry, and farmers worked together to advocate on behalf of better \nagriculture without an overly oppressive EPA effect.\n  I am proud to come to the floor today and recognize a member of my \nState, a great farmer in Georgia, and a great citizen of our country. \nHe will be the 12th president of the American Farm Bureau, and he will \nbe the best president of the American Farm Bureau. I commend him and \nhis family for all their sacrifice and effort. I wish him the very best \nof luck in his endeavors as president of the American Farm Bureau \nFederation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/03/senate-section/article/S537-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S537-S538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        75TH ANNIVERSARY OF USO\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise to recognize another organization \nthat is meaningful to all of us and in particular the Presiding \nOfficer. It is called the USO--the United Service Organization--a \nprivate organization\n\n[[Page S538]]\n\nchartered federally in 1941 by Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the \nCongress of the United States.\n  America was on the verge of world war, and the President knew it. We \nhad fragmented volunteer organizations to serve our troops but no \norganization to really give them the services they needed. The Congress \npassed a resolution creating and chartering the USO, consolidating \nthose organizations into one. Since that charter 75 years ago, that \norganization has served over 10 million American soldiers in uniform \nfrom the time they put it on until the time they take it off.\n  One need only go to their local airport, which, for me, is the \nHartsfield International Airport in Atlanta. Last year 100 million \npassengers went through that airport. Many of them were soldiers, a lot \nof them on the way to deployment in Afghanistan or the Middle East. \nWhen they go through the Atlanta airport, the first thing they see is \nthe USO booth, and the first thing they get is services from the USO to \nhelp them in their trip, their endeavors, and help them with their \nfamilies. The USO provides invaluable help to the men and women who \nprovide all of us the security we relish in this great Nation of ours \ncalled the United States of America.\n  On this 75th anniversary of the USO, I commend the volunteers--900 of \nthem in Georgia--who provide services to 150,000 Georgia soldiers a \nyear, for all they do on behalf of our country and on behalf of our \nservices. The USO is a great organization for a great country, serving \nthe greatest of all military in the United States of America and \nthroughout the world.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have two different amendments that are \ncoming to the floor. One deals with the Energy bill. One of them deals \nwith the Land and Water Conservation Fund. This bill does a permanent \nextension of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. My question on that \nhas been this: The money that is being allocated for the Land and Water \nConservation Fund to be able to purchase properties--are we also \nallocating money to be able to actually maintain those properties?\n  Currently, in the current existence of this bill, there is some money \nallocated to it in some future way, but I have a simple request: As \nmuch money as we allocate to dealing with purchasing new properties, we \nshould also focus in on maintaining what we already have because we \nhave billions of dollars in maintenance backlog. Right now one of the \nworst conservation things that can happen in many parts of the country \nto land is actually put it into Federal trusts because it is not being \ntaken care of once it actually goes into the Federal trust.\n  But that is not the prime issue I want to talk about right now. \nOklahoma is truly an ``all of the above'' energy State. Oil, gas, coal, \nwind, geothermal, hydroelectric, solar--we actually use all of those \nplatforms in a very diverse energy economy. A tremendous amount of wind \nenergy is produced in Oklahoma, used in Oklahoma, and exported to other \nStates around us. It is a very important energy source for us. It has \nbeen incredibly beneficial, and it is an important part of our \nportfolio of a diverse energy platform.\n  We have a challenge to deal with our tax policy. Just a few weeks \nago, this Congress--the House and the Senate--passed a change in the \nway the wind production tax credit will be handled. As a quick review \nfor this body, the wind production tax credit was put in place in 1992. \nIt was a short-term tax credit to give a little bit of help to a \nbrandnew wind energy and several other diverse energy portfolios, but \nit was especially targeted at wind to help a brandnew energy source get \nstarted.\n  Twenty-four years later, this temporary tax credit is still sitting \nthere. As of a few weeks ago, it was changed. It was changed so that in \n2015 and 2016 the full tax credit will still be there, but starting in \n2017 that tax credit will drop to 80 percent of what it is now, in 2018 \nit will drop to 60 percent, in 2019 it will drop to 40 percent, and in \n2020 it is left undefined.\n  I heard multiple individuals say this is a phaseout of the production \ntax credit--a phaseout. That is something many of us have pursued for \nmany years--how do we get out of this perpetual cycle? The problem is \nit wasn't a phaseout, it was a phasedown of the production tax credit \nbecause in 2020 the PTC is left undefined. Most people would say that \nis not a problem. It will just go away. It is left undefined. The \nproblem is 10 times in the past 24 years the production tax credit has \nbeen undefined for a future year assuming it would go to zero, and 10 \ntimes this Congress has gone back and retroactively put it back into \nplace--10 times. So to say in 2020 we are going to leave it undefined \nand it will go away is not a true phaseout. That is a phasedown, and it \nleaves it in the Tax Code.\n\n  My amendment is simple. A few weeks ago this body agreed that we \nwould phase out the production tax credit. The best way to do that is \nto remove that part from the Tax Code in year 2020 and then it would be \neliminated and would actually go away.\n  Why would I encourage that? I would encourage that for several \nreasons. It provides certainty in the industry. Several individuals I \ntalked to in the industry say they need certainty in their planning. \nThis would help with certainty in planning. It is assumed right now \nthat it goes away in 2020. I would like to make sure everyone \nunderstands it really does go away in 2020. It is eliminated from the \nTax Code. This is keeping everyone honest based on what they said they \nwanted to do, and we actually eliminate that production tax credit that \nyear. It provides that great certainty that industry needs to know for \ntheir own planning, for their investment, and for outside capital \nresources and how that money comes in. It is also because these \nextensions are extremely costly.\n  The extension that was just done in December by this Congress will \ncost $17 billion over the window--$17 billion. May I remind everyone \nthat we just had an extended argument over how we were going to fund \nthe Transportation bill last year when we needed to find $13 billion a \nyear to fund transportation, and we just did a production tax credit \nfor wind that is $17 billion.\n  If we are going to deal with a lot of our national priorities, I am \ngreat with having wind in our portfolio, but this is not a new industry \nthat continues to need support and provide the clarity that is needed \nto make sure we actually end this tax credit when we said we were going \nto end this tax credit. Let's remove it from the Tax Code in 2020 and \nmake sure it goes away, and the only way it can be renewed at that \npoint is to go through the normal tax process, create a new tax, and \nactually do it in the full sunlight rather than just say: Well, we are \ngoing to do another tiny extension again.\n  Wind has increased generation dramatically over the past 24 years, \nand I am glad. It is a good source. In our Nation, since 1992, wind \ngeneration has increased 3,000 percent. It is well developed, it is \neconomically stable, it is pulling its own weight in the system, and we \nshould allow it to continue to fly on its own. It is not as if wind \ngoes away if we don't provide a tax credit.\n  It is interesting to note that in 2014 we faced something very \nsimilar to this. In 2014 it was one of those years that the tax credit \nwas to go away and not exist anymore. It had expired. The problem was \nthat at the very end of 2014, Congress did a retroactive renewal of the \nproduction tax credit for the year 2014 in the last days of December. \nSo the whole year had gone by without the tax credit, and during the \nvery last days of 2014 Congress once again renewed the production tax \ncredit and did it retroactively. That year, 2014, the wind association \nnoted that there was $12 billion of private investment into wind that \nyear. The tax credit was only applied in the final days.\n  Wind is a good energy source, but it does not need additional Federal \ndollars to be able to compete in this market. We have made that \ndecision. Now it is time that we actually both trust\n\n[[Page S539]]\n\nand verify and that we reach out to this last year, when we said as a \nbody that wind energy would not get a production tax credit anymore, \nand remove it from the tax credit and verify for ourselves that, no, it \nis not going to happen.\n  One last thing. I came into this body 5 years ago and served in the \nHouse of Representatives. For the 4 years I served in the House of \nRepresentatives, I distinctly remember the first year, in 2011, when I \nsat down with some folks from wind energy and I asked: How much more \ntime do you need for the production tax credit because wind continues \nto increase its efficiency. They said: It is becoming much more \nefficient. If we had 3 more years, we could make it. Again, this was in \n2011. The discussion was that by doing a phasedown in 2011 they would \nneed just 3 more years and it would go away.\n  In 2014 I was in a hearing in the House of Representatives, and I \nasked those same individuals: How much more time do you need for a \nphasedown and phaseout of the production tax credit? The same person \nsaid to me: If I just had 4 more years, we could phase this out. I am \nconcerned, and I believe rightfully so, that in 2019 this body will \nhave lobbyists come into it and say: If we just have a few more years \nof the PTC extension, we could make it just fine. I would argue they \nare doing very well as an industry--and I am glad they are. Let's make \nit clear the PTC ends in 2020 and does not return.\n  With that, I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL.

Mr. President, I rise with sorrow and regret to pay \ntribute to SFC Matthew McClintock. Sergeant McClintock was a native of \nmy home State of New Mexico. He died on January 5 in Helmand Province, \nAfghanistan, from injuries sustained from small arms fire. He was only \n30 years old.\n  In answering the call to serve--a call he answered fearlessly \nmultiple times--Sergeant McClintock's brief time on this Earth ended \nfar too soon. It is difficult to imagine the grief his family and \nfriends are feeling, but I just want to say to them that the memory of \nthis American hero among those whose lives he touched, among those \nwhose lives he tried to protect, and in a nation's gratitude, his \nmemory will always endure.\n  Sergeant McClintock served in Iraq and Afghanistan. He joined the \nArmy in 2006 as an infantryman and was assigned to the First Calvary \nDivision in Iraq. He began Army Special Forces training in 2009 and was \nassigned to the First Special Forces Group. He was deployed to \nAfghanistan in 2012. He left Active Duty in 2014 and was later assigned \nto Alpha Company, First Battalion, 19th Special Forces Group of the \nWashington Army National Guard and was again deployed with his unit to \nAfghanistan in July of last year. That is the official record, but it \ndoes not begin to tell us the day-to-day risks, hardships, and \nchallenges Sergeant McClintock and his fellow soldiers encountered and \nthe remarkable bravery and determination they gave in return.\n  Our Nation has the finest military on Earth because of the dedication \nand true grit of Americans like Matthew McClintock. Words cannot take \naway the pain of those who grieve for Sergeant McClintock. Words cannot \nfully express the gratitude our Nation owes to this valiant soldier. We \ncan only remember--and must always remember--the sacrifice that SFC \nMatthew McClintock made in service to our country.\n  We should not forget or take for granted that our men and women in \nuniform continue to defend our Nation every day. They put their own \nsafety at risk to protect the safety of others. They stand watch in \nfaraway lands always at the ready.\n  Today we remember and we grieve that some of them, like Sergeant \nMcClintock, tragically do not come home. His watch is over, but his \nfellow soldiers and his family now stand it in his place.\n  President Kennedy said that ``stories of past courage . . . can \nteach, they can offer hope, they can provide inspiration. But, they \ncannot supply courage itself. For this, each man must look into his own \nsoul.''\n  In the face of great danger and great risk to himself, Matthew \nMcClintock went where his country sent him, time and again, and he \nserved with honor and distinction. I am inspired by his courage and the \nheroic actions of others like him.\n  MG Bret Daugherty, the commander of the National Guard, spoke for all \nus when he said:\n\n       Staff Sergeant McClintock was one of the best of the best. \n     He was a Green Beret who sacrificed time away from his loved \n     ones to train for and carry out these dangerous missions. \n     This is a tough loss . . . and a harsh reminder that ensuring \n     freedom is not free.\n\n  Sergeant McClintock leaves behind a wife, Alexandra, and a young son, \nDeclan. I hope they will find some comfort now and in the years ahead \nin Sergeant McClintock's great heart and great courage. He was truly a \nhero. He loved his country, and he made the ultimate sacrifice \ndefending it.\n  To his family, please know that we honor Sergeant McClintock's \nservice, we remember his sacrifice, and we mourn your loss.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 2012, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2012) to provide for the modernization of the \n     energy policy of the United States, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Murkowski amendment No. 2953, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n       Murkowski (for Cassidy/Markey) amendment No. 2954 (to \n     amendment No. 2953), to provide for certain increases in, and \n     limitations on, the drawdown and sales of the Strategic \n     Petroleum Reserve.\n       Murkowski amendment No. 2963 (to amendment No. 2953), to \n     modify a provision relating to bulk-power system reliability \n     impact statements.\n\n\n                           Building Consensus\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, yesterday the Speaker of the House and the \nmajority leader met at the White House with President Obama. This \nmeeting was the first time that these three leaders sat down together \nto discuss the Nation's business since the beginning of the new year \nand to look for some opportunities to advance bipartisan priorities \nduring President Obama's final year in office.\n  This Senator knows that some might view such a meeting with \nskepticism and say: What incentive do people have to actually work \ntogether when they come from such polar opposite points of view \npolitically and ideologically? But this Senator believes there is an \nopportunity to build on some of our success that we had in the Senate \nlast year.\n  While many eyes are focused on Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, \nand Nevada, I want to assure my constituents and anybody else who \nhappens to be listening, that we actually have been trying to get the \npeople's work done here in the U.S. Congress. Some people might not \nwant to hear that, some might not believe it when they hear it, but I \nwould hope that fair-minded people might look at the evidence and say: \nYes, there is actually some important work being done.\n  In the process, in 2015, we actually--I know this sounds improbable--\nreduced the role of the Federal Government in education and sent more \nof\n\n[[Page S540]]\n\nthat responsibility back where it belongs to parents, teachers, and \nlocal school districts in the States.\n  We reformed Medicare, which provides important health services to our \nseniors.\n  We provided for the long-term stability of our Nation's \ninfrastructure. We passed the first multi-year Transportation bill, I \nthink, in 10 years, after having made about 33 different temporary \npatches, which is a terribly inefficient way to do business. Where I \ncome from in Texas, since we are a fast growing State--and I expect \nmost States feel the same way--providing for transportation \ninfrastructure is important. It is important to our air quality, to \ncommerce, to our economy, and to public safety.\n  We also did something that this Senator is proud of: the first \nFederal effort to provide meaningful support to victims of human \ntrafficking, a bill that passed 99 to 0 in the U.S. Senate. One doesn't \nget more bipartisan and consensus-building than that.\n  The way these measures happened, as well as the other work we have \ndone, is by Republicans and Democrats working together. We are stuck \nwith each other whether we like it or not. Republicans can't get things \ndone by themselves. Democrats can't get things done by themselves. The \nlaws can't be passed under our constitutional framework unless both \nHouses of Congress pass legislation and it is actually signed by the \nPresident. We have to work together if we are going to make progress.\n  A lot of the credit for last year's production in the Senate should \nbe laid at the feet of the majority leader, Senator McConnell, who said \nthat after years of dysfunction where we were stuck in gridlock and \nnothing seemed to happen--he said: We are going to return to the \nregular functioning of the Senate. We are going to have committees \nconsider legislation. We are going to have hearings to figure out how \nto pass good legislation, which is going to be voted on in the \ncommittee before it comes to the Senate so that we can see what pieces \nof legislation have bipartisan support and thus might be able to be \npassed by the Senate. In the Senate we call this regular order, but all \nit means is that everybody gets to participate in the process.\n  It is important to all of us that we be able to offer suggestions, \nthat we be able to debate and offer amendments both in committee and on \nthe floor. It might seem like pretty basic stuff, and people may think \nthat happens as a matter of course. But, unfortunately, it didn't.\n  In 2014 the Senate had 15 rollcall votes. As the Presiding Officer \nknows, the Senate was stuck in a ditch and couldn't seem to get out. To \ngive a number to demonstrate how dramatically things have changed in 1 \nyear with the new majority leader, last year we had 200 rollcall votes \non amendments. There were 15 in 2014 and 200 in 2015. So we could talk \nabout the substance, but I think those numbers tell part of the story.\n  So I am glad there is open communication between our Congressional \nleaders and the President. I hope we can find some ways to get some \nthings done, because, again, no matter whether you are a conservative \nor a liberal, whether you are a Republican or a Democrat, we actually \nare not going to be able to get things done unless we find a way to \nbuild consensus. That is the way legislation is passed.\n  We have more work to do this year. So we need to keep our focus not \non what is happening in Presidential primaries but on our job here in \nCongress and continue to try to work in a bipartisan way and deliver \nfor our bosses, namely, the American people.\n  The bipartisan energy bill we are working on now is a good start to \n2016. I congratulate Senator Murkowski, the chair of the energy \ncommittee, and Senator Cantwell, the ranking member, for getting the \nbill this far. I think part of what demonstrates to me the wisdom of \nSenator Murkowski in handling this particular bill is that some of the \nmore controversial issues, such as lifting the ban on crude oil \nexports, were handled separately and dealt with at the end of last year \nrather than in this bill.\n  This bill does represent one with broad bipartisan support. Coming \nfrom an energy State, as the Presiding Officer does, we understand the \nimportance of energy to our economy. We produce more of it, we use it \nmore efficiently, and, hopefully, it benefits consumers in the process. \nThis bill will update our energy policies so that they reflect the \nenormous transformation we have observed in our energy sector. I have \nsaid it before, and I will say it again: I chuckle to myself when I \nheard people in the past talking about ``peak oil.'' That was sort of \nthe talk in the oil patch. People said: Well, we have discovered all of \nthe oil there is, and there is no more. So we are now going to be in a \nperiod of perpetual decline. We might as well get ready for that.\n  But thanks to the innovation in the energy sector with things like \nfracking--which has been around for 70 years but which some people have \njust discovered, it seems--along with horizontal drilling, what we have \nseen is this shale oil and gas revolution, which has been a boon to our \ncountry and particularly in places such as Texas, North Dakota, and the \nlike.\n  Now, because of the glut, literally, of oil being produced, natural \ngas prices are much lower, which actually benefits consumers. If you \nhave looked at the price of a gallon of gas lately, you have seen that \ngasoline is pretty cheap relative to historic levels.\n  Another important issue beyond energy that I think we need to deal \nwith this year is to get back to a regular appropriations process. We \nsaw at the end of last year--because our friends across the aisle \nblocked voting on appropriations bills, including funding our military, \nwhich I just found to be incredible and really disgraceful, frankly--\nthat we found ourselves in a position where in order to fund the \nfunctions of government, we had to do an Omnibus appropriations bill.\n  I have said before that you might call it an ``ominous'' \nappropriations bill. It is an ugly process. It is a terrible way to do \nbusiness because what it does is it empowers a handful of leaders to \nnegotiate something that Members of the Senate ought to be involved in \nthrough the regular process, through voting bills through the \nAppropriations subcommittees, through the Appropriations Committee, \nthrough the floor, where we have transparency in the process and where \nany Senator who has a good idea can come to the floor and offer an \namendment.\n  That is the way it ought to be done. We need to restore that sort of \nregular order this year so that each of the 12 separate funding bills \ncan be considered and voted on by the Appropriations Committee and then \nhere on the Senate floor and then matched up with the House bill before \nit is sent to the President. Again, this is legislation 101, pretty \nbasic stuff.\n  But unfortunately, the Senate and the Congress have not been \noperating as they should. That is something that we would like to \nchange. So last year, all 12 appropriations bills were sent out of \ntheir respective committees--the first time since 2009 that has \nhappened. But, again, because of the blocking of the legislation, we \nended up in a bad situation at the end of the year, where the only \nthing we could do was pass an Omnibus appropriations bill.\n  So now we look to the President's budget, which will be sent over \nhere in short order. We will take up that matter up through the Budget \nCommittee, and we will look at the appropriations process ahead of us. \nI would like to suggest to our Democratic friends that they have a \nchoice to make. They can try to force this Chamber back into the same \ndysfunction and the same sort of partisan bickering that has \ncharacterized it for years when they were in charge or they can decide \nto work with us--as we would like to do--to move forward principled \nlegislation, including appropriations bills, in a transparent, open \nprocess that allows every Senator--Republicans and Democrats alike--a \nchance to participate and allows our constituents to watch, as they go \nacross the floor, and to ask the appropriate questions, to raise \nconcerns if they have those concerns.\n  That is the way our democracy is supposed to work. Passing massive \nstopgap funding bills is not doing the best for the people we \nrepresent. It can be avoided, but it is going to take a little bit of \ncooperation. But I have to think that whether you are in the majority \nor the minority, most Senators like to work in a Senate that actually \nfunctions according to regular order, because, as the Presiding Officer\n\n[[Page S541]]\n\nknows, even being in the majority does not mean we have a chance to \nvote on amendments to legislation.\n  Indeed, for a period of time, his predecessor did not even have a \nchance to vote on an amendment--a rollcall vote on an amendment--\nnevertheless being in the majority party at the time. That is not the \nway this body is supposed to function. That is not doing our best to \nserve the interests of the people we represent. So we have a choice to \nmake. I hope we choose the higher ground and perhaps listen to the \nbetter angels of our nature rather than the other one on our shoulder \nto whom we should not pay attention.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise to address several amendments that \nI hope we will have an opportunity to vote on before this bill is \ncompleted.\n  The first amendment is amendment No. 3131, research and development \nfor secondary use and innovative recycling research of electric vehicle \nbatteries.\n  Electric vehicles, as folks generally understand, run almost entirely \non lithium ion batteries, which are commonly considered to have reached \nthe end of their useful life when the capacity diminishes by 20 to 30 \npercent. The range of the vehicle diminishes in a corresponding \nfashion. At that point, it is time for a new set of batteries. But the \nbattery still has a lot of useful life. It still has 70 to 80 percent \nof its original capacity. So it has the capacity to be utilized in many \nother potential roles, including, possibly, stationary electric \nstorage.\n  This amendment instructs the Department of Energy to conduct research \non possible uses of a vehicle battery after its use in a vehicle, to \nassess the potential for markets for those batteries, to develop an \nunderstanding of the barriers for the development of those markets, and \nto identify the full range of potential uses.\n  That would be very useful to diminish the flow of potential batteries \ninto recycling, to get the most out of the investment we have made in \nthem, and also to diminish the cost of batteries, because the residual \nuse means that they have residual value, and the overall initial cost \nwould reflect that. So that is an important research goal. It is \nclearly one of the strategies to enhance our activity from a fossil \nfuel industry to the utilization of more clean, renewable electricity.\n  Second, I want to turn to amendment No. 3178, the Federal fleet \namendment. The General Services Administration currently procures about \n70,000 vehicles a year for various agencies. The total inventory of the \nFederal fleet is now almost 700,000 vehicles. These Federal vehicles \nare used for a wide range of purposes, some of which may well be \nappropriate for electric vehicles and others that may not be.\n  But in order to consider the applied role, the General Services \nAdministration needs data on vehicle reliability and maintenance costs \nto understand what would be a fair and appropriate use and to calculate \nthe lease terms. So this amendment provides GSA with the authority to \nreach out to other agencies to collect the information on the vehicles \nthe agencies use, to do an inventory of what uses may be suitable for \ndifferent types of electric vehicles and the numbers that could \npossibly be deployed, and to use that information to develop a 10-year \nplan for GSA to submit a report back to Congress so that we can \nunderstand what the potential is and make sure that we well position \nour policies to exploit that opportunity.\n  The third amendment that I want to draw attention to is amendment No. \n3191, sponsored by myself, Senator Schatz, and Senator Markey. This is \na resolution of the sense of the Senate. It notes that global \ntemperature increases will lead to more droughts, more intense storms, \nmore intense wildfires, a rise in sea levels, more desertification, and \nmore acidification of our oceans, and that these impacts will result in \neconomic disruption to farming, fishing, forestry, and recreation, \nhaving a profound impact on rural America.\n  Now, we know this to be the case because we can already observe these \nimpacts on the ground right now. In my home State of Oregon, we have a \ngrowing red zone caused by pine beetles--pine beetles that previously \nwere killed off in colder winters that now survive in greater numbers \nand attack more trees. We have a longer forest fire season. It has \ngrown by 60 days over 40 years. The amount or the acreage consumed by \nforest fires is increasing. We have a diminishing snowpack in the \nCascades, which is resulting in smaller, warmer trout streams, as well \nas affecting our winter recreation industry. I know that anyone who \nloves to fish for trout does not want to have a smaller and warmer \nstream because of its adverse impact.\n  Over on our coast, we are having an impact on the baby oysters, which \nhave difficulty forming their shells in the more acidic Pacific Ocean, \nan ocean that is now 30 percent more acidic than it was before the \nIndustrial Revolution. This amendment simply points to the fact that \nalready we see all of this. But as the temperature rises, disruptions \nincrease. The impact on our farming, fishing, forestry, and recreation \nis greater, and it is doing a lot of damage to our rural economies and \na lot of damage overall to the United States of America, and it is \ndoing so throughout the world as well.\n  We must work together to transition to a clean energy economy. But \nthere are important first steps in place. Our future President, \nwhomever that might be, must work to build upon the foundation we have \nput in place with our Clean Power Plan, with increased mileage for our \nvehicles and increased mileage for freight transportation. Let's build \nupon those steps in order to work in partnership with the world to take \non this major challenge.\n\n  So I hope these three amendments have a chance to be debated and \nvoted on here on the floor. We are clearly in a situation where we are \nthe first generation to see the impacts of our fossil fuel energy \neconomy, see the destructive impacts on our forests, our fishing, our \nfarming, and our winter recreation. Therefore, we have a responsibility \nto work together to take this on. Our children, our children's \nchildren, may they not look back and say: What happened? Why did our \nparents and grandparents fail to act in the face of such a massive and \nimportant global threat?\n\n\n                    Our ``We the People'' Democracy\n\n  Mr. President, I am now shifting to my regular ``We the People'' \nspeech, a series of speeches in which I try to raise issues that go to \nthe heart of the framing of our Constitution and the vision of creating \na republic that has a government responsive to the concerns of citizens \nthroughout our Nation.\n  Our Founders started the Constitution with three powerful words, ``We \nthe People.'' They wrote them in a font 10 times the size of the \nbalance of the Constitution as if to say: This is what it is all about. \nThis is our goal, as President Lincoln summarized, a ``government of \nthe people, by the people, for the people.''\n  It was not the plan of our Founders in writing the Constitution to \nhave a government designed to serve the ruling elites. It was not the \ndesign of our Constitution to serve the titans of industry and \ncommerce. It was not the intention of our Founders to build a \ngovernment to serve the best off, the richest in our society--quite the \ncontrary. So I am rising periodically to address issues related to this \nvision, this beautiful Revolution, the American Revolution, that sought \nto have a form of government that served the people, not the elite.\n  This week I am using my speech to recognize the anniversary of two \nSupreme Court decisions, two decisions which have driven a stake \nthrough the heart of our ``We the People'' democracy. One ruling, \nBuckley v. Valeo, marked its 40th anniversary last Saturday on January \n30, and Citizens United marked its 6th anniversary on January 21. These \ntwo decisions have forever altered the vision of our government. They \nhave turned our government on its head. They have changed it from ``We \nthe People'' to ``We the Titans.'' It is my hope that visitors will \nrally together in this country, that Senators and House Members will \nrally together to defend the Constitution that they are sworn to uphold \nthat was not a ``We the Titans'' Constitution, it was a ``We the \nPeople'' Constitution.\n  Central to the promise of ``We the People'' is the right to \nparticipate in an equal footing, to contribute one's opinions and \ninsights on elections and on issues.\n  President Jefferson called this the mother principle. He summarized \nit as follows: ``For let it be agreed that a government is republican \nin proportion\n\n[[Page S542]]\n\nas every member composing it has his equal voice in the direction of \nits concerns . . . by representatives chosen by himself, and \nresponsible to him.'' Let me emphasize again, ``republican in \nproportion as every member composing it has his equal voice in the \ndirec-\ntion. . . . ''\n  The decisions of Buckley and Citizens United are a direct assault on \nthis fundamental understanding that to have a ``We the People'' \nrepublic, you have to have citizens participate in a roughly equal \nfooting.\n  These two decisions bulldozed the ``We the People'' pillar on which \nour government is founded.\n  President Lincoln echoed Jefferson's equal voice principle. He said: \n``Allow all the governed an equal voice in the government, and that, \nand that only is self-government.''\n  Is there anyone in this Chamber who believes that today all the \ngoverned have an equal voice in the government? I am sure no one among \nour 100 Senators would contend that principle--so eloquently laid out \nby President Jefferson, so resoundingly echoed by President Lincoln, so \ndeeply embedded in the founding words of our Constitution--is true \ntoday. It is not true because Buckley v. Valeo found that individuals \ncould spend unlimited sums to influence issues and the outcomes of \nelection. That decision and Citizens United destroyed the notion that \nall citizens get to participate on an equal footing. By green-lighting \nthe spending amount of unlimited sums in combination with the high cost \nof participating in the modern town square--that is, to secure time on \nradio, time on television, time or space on the Web--these decisions \ngive the wealthy and well-connected control of the town commons and the \nability to drown out the voice of the people.\n  Certainly a situation where the top 10 percent can overwhelm, can \ndrown out the 90 percent, is not ``We the People'' governance. \nCertainly a situation where the top 1 percent can drown out the 99 \npercent is not ``We the People'' governance. It is the opposite.\n  As President Obama said, ``Democracy breaks down when the average \nperson feels that their voice doesn't matter.'' That is how people feel \nwhen they are drowned out by the few under the framework established by \nBuckley v. Valeo and Citizens United.\n  The most basic premise of our Constitution is that influence over \nelections means influence over governance. That is the whole point. \nInfluence over elections is not limited just to being in the booth and \npulling a lever. When you enhance the voices of the wealthy relative to \neveryone else, you fundamentally shift the outcome of legislative \ndeliberations. Despite the arguments of the plaintiffs in Buckley v. \nValeo, the wealthy do not have the same concerns about this Nation, \nabout their lives that everyone else has. They don't have the same \nconcerns about the cost of college. They don't have the same concerns \nabout paid family leave. They don't have the same concerns about the \nsolvency and adequacy of Social Security. They are not worried. They \nare not staying up nights about the health of their child and concern \nover the cost and quality of health care, and they are not disturbed \nover policies that shift our manufacturing jobs overseas and eviscerate \nthe working middle class in America.\n  Yet here we have it. Buckley v. Valeo takes this small percentage of \nfolks who do not have concerns that reflect the vast majority of \nAmericans and gives them overwhelming power in elections and issues.\n  Let me ask you, is it any wonder that the middle class is doing \npoorly while the wealth of America has grown exponentially? Isn't that \nwhat one would expect in a system favoring the wealthy over the \nworkers? Are we, can we be a government of, by, and for the people if \nindividuals at the very top have vastly greater influence over \nelections and policy than others? Our Constitution says no. Our \nFounders said no, but Buckley v. Valeo and Citizens United said yes--\nand they are wrong.\n  With a campaign finance system that gives the most affluent massive \ninfluence over elections with concomitant control over laws, we don't \nhave a government that embodies President Jefferson's mother principle; \nthat is, one that reflects and executes the will of the people.\n  So it is time to change this. It is time to recapture the genius of \nAmerican governance, and it is time to restore the ``We the People'' \nprinciples so eloquently and powerfully embedded in the framing of our \nConstitution.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Islam\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about two \ntopics that often make this body and sometimes my side of the aisle \nuncomfortable. I want to talk about the fight that is on across the \nworld--or particularly in the Middle East for the soul of Islam and how \nit matters to the United States--and I want to talk about our \nrelationship with Saudi Arabia and the connection to the former issue.\n  We frequently hear this criticism of President Obama that he doesn't \nhave a strategy to defeat ISIS. I fundamentally don't believe that is \ntrue. He does have a strategy, and it is largely working when you look \nat the metrics on the ground. You see that ISIS's territory in Iraq and \nSyria have been reduced by about 30 percent over the course of the last \nyear. We have tightened our immigration policies here to make sure the \nbad guys don't get in. We have stood up a more capable fighting force \ninside Iraq. We have clamped down significantly on ISIS's sources of \nrevenue and financing. Listen, it is hard to win when only one \nspectacular and deadly strike can erase all of your good work, but the \nPresident does have a strategy on the ground right now inside Iraq and \ninside Syria.\n  The problem is that it is still a relatively short-term strategy. As \nwe debate how to defeat ISIS or groups like it, our strategic \nprescriptions are all relatively short term. We use military force. We \ntry to retake territory. We try to take out top terrorist leaders. We \nclamp down on sources of financing. These are necessary and important \nmeasures to combat a serious threat to the United States, but they \ndon't address the underlying decisions that lead to radicalism. \nAddressing those issues is the only way to ensure that the next \niteration of ISIS--whoever it is, whatever it is, wherever it is--\ndoesn't just simply emerge in its place.\n  So my argument is that one of the reasons no one has a particularly \ncredible long-term strategy is that it would involve engaging in some \nvery uncomfortable truths about the nature of the fight ahead of us and \nabout the imperfections of one of our most important allies in the \nMiddle East. To make this case to you, I want to first bring you to \nnorthwest Pakistan and ask my colleagues to imagine that you are a \nparent of, let's say, a 10-year-old boy. You are illiterate, you are \npoor, and you are getting poorer by the day. Unemployment in your \nvillage is sky high. Inflation is robbing you of any wealth you may \nhave. Your crop yields have been miserable, but one day you get a visit \nthat changes your perspective. A cleric from a nearby conservative \nmosque offers you a different path. He tells you that your poverty is \nnot your fault but simply a punishment handed down to you because of \nyour unintentional deviation from the true path of Islam. Luckily, \nthere is a way to get right to God, to submit your only son to Islam.\n  It gets even better. This cleric is going to offer to educate your \nson at his school. We call them madrassas. Not only will you not have \nto pay for the education, this school is going to actually pay you \nmaybe $6,000 just to send your son there. When your son finishes \nschool, this individual promises you that he will find him employment \nin the service of Islam. Your 10-year-old, previously destined to lead \na life that was perhaps more hopeless than your own, is now going to \nget free housing and meals, religious instruction, the promise of a job \nwhen he is older and you get money that you badly need and improved \nfavor with God.\n  For thousands of families in destitute places such as northwest \nPakistan, we can see how it is often a pretty easy choice. But as the \nyears go on, you lose touch with your son. The school cuts off your \naccess to him. And when you do get to see him every now\n\n[[Page S543]]\n\nand again, you see him changing. Then one day it is over. He is not the \nlittle boy you once knew. He is a teenager. And he is announcing to you \nthat the only way to show true faith with Islam is to fight for it \nagainst the infidels who are trying to pollute the Muslim faith or the \nWesterners who are trying to destroy it. He tells you that he is going \noff to Afghanistan, Syria, or Iraq with some fellow students and that \nyou shouldn't worry about him because God is on his side.\n  You start asking questions to find out what happened in the school \nand you start to learn. You discover the textbooks he read that taught \nhim a brand of Islam greatly influenced by something called Wahhabism, \na strand of Islam based on the earliest form of religion practiced \nunder the first four caliph. It holds that any deviation from Islamic \noriginalism is heresy. In school, your son was therefore taught an \nideology of hate toward the unbeliever--defined as Christians, Jews, \nand Hindus, but also Shiites, Sufis, and Sunni Muslims who don't follow \nthe Wahhabi doctrine. He is told that the crusades never end; that aid \norganizations, schools, and government offices are just modern weapons \nof the West's continuing crusade against his faith; and that it is a \nreligious obligation to do ``battle'' against the infidels.\n  I tell my colleagues this story because some version of it plays out \nhundreds of times every day in far-flung places, from Pakistan to \nKosovo, Nigeria to Indonesia, the teaching of an intolerant version of \nIslam to hundreds of millions of young people.\n  Think about this: In 1956 there were 244 of these madrassas in \nPakistan; today there are 24,000. These schools are multiplying all \nover the globe. Yet, don't get me wrong, these schools, by and large, \naren't directly teaching violence. They aren't the minor leagues for Al \nQaeda or ISIS. But they do teach a version of Islam that leads very \nnicely into an anti-Shia, anti-Western militancy.\n  I don't mean to suggest that Wahhabism is the only sect of Islam that \ncan be perverted into violence. Iran's Shia clerics are also using \nreligion to export violence as well. But it is important to note that \nthe vicious terrorist groups whom Americans know by name are Sunni in \nderivation and greatly influenced by Wahhabi Salafist teachings.\n  Of course, the real rub is that we have known this for a very long \ntime. Secretaries of State, ambassadors, diplomats, and four-star \ngenerals have all complained over and over again about it. Yet we do \nvery little to stop this long, slow spread of intolerance. We don't \naddress it because to do so would force us to confront two very \ndifficult issues.\n  The first is how we talk sensibly about Islam. Right now we are \ncaught between two extremes. Leading Republicans want to begin and end \nthis discussion with a debate over what we call terrorists. Of course, \nthe leading candidate for President often equates the entire religion \nwith violence. I think this debate over nomenclature is overwrought, \nbut I certainly understand the problem of labeling something ``radical \nIslamic terrorism'' because it gives purchase to this unforgivable \nargument that all Muslims are radicals or terrorists. So many \nRepublicans don't want to go any deeper into the conversation than just \nsimply labeling the threat. But Democrats, frankly, aren't that much \nbetter. The leaders of my party often do back flips to avoid using \nthese kinds of terms, but, of course, that forestalls any conversation \nabout the fight within Islam for the soul of the religion.\n  It is a disservice to this debate to simply brand every Muslim as a \nthreat to the West, but it is also a disservice to refuse to \nacknowledge that although ISIS has perverted Islam to a degree to make \nit unrecognizable, the seeds of this perversion are rooted in a much \nmore mainstream version of that faith that derives in substantial part \nfrom the teachings of Wahhabism.\n  Leaders of both parties need to avoid the extremes of this debate and \nenter into a real conversation about how America can help the moderate \nvoices within Islam win out over those who would sow the seeds of \nextremism. Let me give an example. Last fall, I visited the Hedayah \nCenter in Abu Dhabi, a U.S.-supported, Arab-led initiative to \ncounterprogram against extremist messaging. When I pressed the center's \nleadership on the need to confront Wahhabi teaching and the mainstream \nroots of extremism, they blanched. They said it was out of their lane. \nThey were focused on the branches of extremism, not the trunk. But, of \ncourse, by then it is probably too late.\n  America, frankly, doesn't have the moral authority or weight to tip \nthe scales in this fight between moderate Islam and less tolerant \nIslam. Muslim communities and Muslim nations need to be leading this \nfight. But America--and most notably, sometimes the leaders of my \nparty--also can't afford to shut its eyes to the struggle that is \nplaying out in real time.\n\n\n                              Saudi Arabia\n\n  That brings me to the second uncomfortable truth, and I present it to \nyou in a quote from Farah Pandith, who was President Obama's Special \nRepresentative to Muslim Communities. In a moment of candor, she \ncommented that in her travel to 80 different countries in her official \nposition, she said, ``In each place I visited, the Wahhabi influence \nwas an insidious presence . . . funded by Saudi money.''\n  The second uncomfortable truth is that for all the positive aspects \nof our alliance with Saudi Arabia, there is another side to that \ncountry than the one that faces us in our bilateral relationship, and \nit is a side we can no longer afford to ignore as our fight against \nIslamic extremism becomes more focused and more complicated.\n  First, let me acknowledge that there are a lot of good aspects in our \nrelationship with Saudi Arabia. I don't agree with cynics who say our \nrelationship is just an alliance to facilitate the exchange of oil for \ncash and cash for weapons. Our common bond was formed in the Cold War \nwhen American and Saudi leaders found common ground in the fight \nagainst communism. The unofficial detente today between Sunni nations \nand Israel is a product, in part, of the Saudi-led diplomacy. There \nhave been many high-profile examples of deep U.S.-Saudi cooperation in \nthe fight against Al Qaeda and ISIS. More generally, our partnership \nwith Saudi Arabia--the most powerful and the richest country in the \nArab world--serves as an important bridge to the Islamic community. It \nis a direct rebuttal of this terrorist idealogy that asserts that we \nseek a war with Islam.\n  But increasingly, we just can't afford to ignore the more problematic \naspects of Saudi policies. The political alliance between the House of \nSaud and the conservative Wahhabi clerics is as old as the nation, and \nthis alliance has resulted in billions of dollars funneled to and \nthrough the Wahhabi movement. Those 24,000 religious schools in \nPakistan--thousands of them are funded with money that originates in \nSaudi Arabia. So are mosques in Brussels, Jakarta, and Paris. According \nto some estimates, since the 1960s the Saudis have funneled over $100 \nbillion into funding schools and mosques all over the world, with the \nmission of spreading puritanical Wahhabism. As a point of comparison, \nresearchers suggest that the Soviet Union spent about $7 billion--a \nfraction of that--during the entire period of 1920 to 1991. Less well-\nfunded governments and other strains of Islam just can't keep up with \nthe tsunami of money behind this export of intolerance.\n  Rightfully, we engage in daily castigations of Iran for sponsoring \nterrorism throughout the region. But why does Saudi Arabia largely get \noff the hook from direct public criticism from political leaders simply \nbecause they are a few degrees separated from the terrorists who are \ninspired by the ideology their money helps to spread? Why do we say \nvirtually nothing about the human rights abuses inside Saudi Arabia, \nfueled by this conservative religious movement, when we so easily call \nout other countries for similar outrageous behavior?\n  Second, we need to have a reckoning with the Saudis about the effect \nof their growing proxy war with Iran. There is more than enough blame \nto be spread around when it comes to this widening Saudi-Iranian fault \nline in the Middle East. I would argue that the lion's share of the \nresponsibility lies with the Iranians, who have been a top exporter of \nterrorism and brutality for decades. It is primarily Iranian-backed \ngroups who have destabilized places such as Lebanon and Iraq. It is the \nIranians who are propping up a murderous regime in Damascus.\n\n[[Page S544]]\n\n  But in the wake of the Iran nuclear agreement, there are many in \nCongress who would have the United States double down in our support \nfor the Saudi side of this fight in places such as Yemen and Syria \nsimply because Saudi Arabia is our named friend and Iran is our named \nenemy. But the Middle East doesn't work like that anymore, and there is \ngrowing evidence that our support for Saudi-led military campaigns in \nplaces such as Yemen are prolonging humanitarian misery and, frankly, \naiding extremism.\n  Ninety billion dollars in U.S. arms sales money has gone to Saudi \nArabia during the Obama administration to help them carry out a \ncampaign in Yemen against the Iranian-backed Houthis. Our government \nsays its top priority in Yemen is defeating AQAP, which is arguably Al \nQaeda's deadliest franchise, but this ongoing chaos has created a \nsecurity vacuum in Yemen in which AQAP can thrive and even expand. No \nexpert would dispute that since the Saudi campaign began, Al Qaeda has \nexpanded in Yemen and ISIL has gained a new territorial and recruitment \nfoothold. To make matters worse, Saudi Arabia and some of their GCC \nallies are so focused on this fight against Iran in Yemen that they \nhave dramatically scaled back or in some cases totally ended their \nmilitary efforts against ISIS. Under these circumstances, how does \nmilitary support for Saudi Arabia help us in our fight against \nextremism if that is our No. 1 goal?\n  Here are my recommendations. The United States should get serious \nabout this. We should suspend supporting Saudi Arabia's military \ncampaign in Yemen, at the very least until we get assurances that this \ncampaign does not distract from the fight against ISIS and Al Qaeda or \nuntil we make some progress on the Saudi export of Wahhabism throughout \nthe region and throughout the world. And Congress shouldn't sign off on \nany more military sales to Saudi Arabia unless similar assurances are \ngranted.\n  If we are serious about constructing a winning, long-term strategy \nagainst ISIS and Al Qaeda, our horizons have to extend beyond the day \nto day, the here and now, the fight in just Syria and Iraq. We need to \nadmit that there is a fight on for the future of Islam, and while we \ncan't have a dispositive influence on that fight, we also can't just \nsit on the sidelines. Both parties here need to acknowledge this \nreality, and the United States needs to lead by example by ending our \neffective acquiescence to the Saudi export of intolerant Islam.\n  We need to be careful about not blindly backing our friend's plays in \nconflicts that simply create more instability, more political \ninsecurity vacuums which ISIS and other extremist groups can fill, such \nas what is going on in Yemen today.\n  We need to work with the Saudis and other partners to defeat ISIS \nmilitarily, but at the same time, we need to work together to address \nthe root causes of extremism. Saudi Arabia's counter-radicalization \nprograms and new anti-terrorism initiative are good steps that show \nSaudi leaders recognize some of these problems, but they need to do \nmore. Tackling intolerant ideologies, refusing to incentivize \ndestabilizing proxy wars--these are the elements of a long-term anti-\nextremism strategy, and we should pursue this strategy even if it on \noccasion makes us uncomfortable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to \nspeak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Iran\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, today I want to talk about the President's \nrecent dealings with Iran and the serious questions the \nadministration's actions have raised.\n  Let me begin by saying first of all that I welcome--as do all \nAmericans who have been watching this--the release of the three \nAmerican hostages who were wrongfully detained in Iran. We are all glad \nto see the return of Pastor Saeed Abedini, Jason Rezaian, and Amir \nHekmati. That they have been freed and that they have been reunited \nwith their families is important. Our prayers--my prayers and the \nprayers of so many Americans--remain with those families and with the \nfamily of Robert Levinson, a former FBI employee about whom we have not \nbeen given the kind of information we need to have. If he is alive, we \nshould demand his release. If he is not alive, we should demand and \nfind out what happened to Robert Levinson.\n  In return for these three hostages being released, the United States \nreleased seven Iranians or Iranian Americans who had been convicted of \ntransferring technology, which included nuclear dual-use technology, to \nIran. The administration also agreed to take 14 Iranians off the \nInterpol arrest list as part of this effort to get Americans unfairly \nheld back. If clearing the way for 21 convicted or indicted enemies of \nthe United States wasn't enough, then the United States, in my view, \nalso agreed to pay $1.7 billion to Iran. In everybody's view, they paid \nthat $1.7 billion at the time of the swap. The administration, I guess, \nwould want us to believe it is coincidental that the day after the \nAmerican hostages were released and the day after the Iran deal went \ninto effect, Secretary Kerry announced that the United States had \nsettled a claim at the World Court at The Hague dating back decades.\n\n  According to the Wall Street Journal, Iranian General Reza Naqdi \nsaid: ``Taking this much money back was in return for the release of \nthe American spies and doesn't have to do with the [nuclear] talks.''\n  Whether it had something to do with the nuclear talks or not, I don't \nknow how significant that is. I submitted an amendment when we were \ndebating the Iran agreement that it shouldn't be finalized in any way \nuntil all of these hostages were returned. In fairness, I didn't think \nit should be finalized in any way, no matter what, but I definitely \ncouldn't understand why we wouldn't insist that these innocently held \nAmericans were returned. It becomes more and more obvious all the time \nthat the Iranians had a plan. Not only did they want to further \nhumiliate the United States, but they simply wanted money.\n  Under this settlement at The Hague, the United States will be paying \nIran--and has already paid Iran--$1.7 billion. This is supposedly $400 \nmillion in principal stemming back to a former military sale before the \nfall of the Shah of Iran and then $1.3 billion in interest--$400 \nmillion in principal, and $1.3 billion in interest.\n  The timing of the swap and the announcement of the breakthrough in \nthe settlement--this had been at the World Court for 35 years, and we \nare supposed to believe that it is just another coincidence in the \nObama State Department.\n  Peeling back the details of this settlement is even more troubling \nbecause the money had already been spent. This was Iranian money from a \nforeign military sale that had been held in what is called the FMS \naccount--the foreign military sale account. It was originally placed in \nthat trust fund, but then it was spent.\n  Why was it spent? It was spent because the Congress in 2000 passed \nlegislation that the President signed that directed the Secretary of \nthe Treasury to use that money to compensate victims of Iranian \nterrorism. In cases like Flatow vs. Iran and four other related cases, \nIranian terror victims all received compensation from this fund, \neffectively wiping out the balance of the fund. The trust fund that the \nadministration is referring to has already been spent.\n  How do you give money back that has already been spent? You can't \ngive money back that has already been spent. I suppose you can take \ntaxpayer dollars, which is what happened here, suggest that somehow \nthis was money of the Iranians all the time and give those taxpayer \ndollars to Iran in return for, as their own general said, the release \nof the people he called the American spies.\n  Did the administration essentially agree to ransom to get these \nAmericans released? It certainly appears so.\n  I think you and I and every Member of the Senate should continue \npressing the administration for answers. If they want to spend taxpayer \nmoney, there may be some legal way they can do that, but there is \nreally no legal way they can say they are giving money back that the \nCongress already told them to do something else with, and they did.\n\n[[Page S545]]\n\n  In addition to that money we have now given to Iran, the Iranian \nagreement allows somewhere between $100 million and $150 million held \nby countries all over the world since the late 1970s to be returned to \nIran. Just last week, Secretary of State Kerry said that some of this \nmoney will ``end up in the hands of the [Iranian Revolutionary Guard \nCorps] or other entities, some of which are labeled terrorists.''\n  Well, of course that is where that money is going to wind up. There \nwas an argument made during the Iranian agreement that there are so \nmany needs in Iran that they are going to spend this on other more \nworthwhile things. But no matter how many needs there were in Iran, \nIran is, by the administration's own determination, the No. 1 state \nsponsor of terrorism in the world. Of course when you give them money \nback, they are going to use that money for what they are already using \ntheir money for. They are just going to have over $100 billion more at \ntheir disposal.\n  The world's largest state sponsor of terrorism--whether it is backing \nPalestinian terrorists in Gaza or supporting Hezbollah's attacks \nagainst Israel from Lebanon, the regime will now have more resources to \ndo that with. Iran, of course, has made no secret of its nuclear \nambitions nor of its willingness to flout the treaty obligations in \norder to achieve those ambitions. It recently launched two ballistic \nmissile tests in the past 3 months. It is a direct violation of the \nU.N. resolution which prohibits them from engaging in activities \nrelated to ballistic missiles capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, \nbut they have done it twice in the last 90 days. Even Members of the \nPresident's own party who have supported the Iran agreement have \ncriticized the administration's lack of response to these violations.\n  What is the world to think? What are the American people to think \nwhen we are transferring money at the time we get American hostages \nback, when we are allowing missiles to be launched near the U.S.S. \nHarry Truman, when we are allowing ballistic missile tests to occur, \nand acting as if we have made some great breakthrough with Iran?\n  The recent detention of U.S. sailors in Iran is another example of \nhow little we have gained in this Iranian policy agreement. The \nadministration has gone out of its way to accommodate the demands of \nthis regime that is hostile and sponsors terrorists. Enough is enough. \nIt is time that the Congress stood up, and I urge my colleagues in the \nSenate to utilize every tool at our disposal to hold the Iranian regime \naccountable.\n  One important step will be to secure Iranian assets owed to victims \nof terrorism who had been awarded judgments by our courts and other \ncourts. Why would we give money to Iran when there are Americans who \nare victims of terrorism that courts have said have a right to that \nmoney? They found Iran liable for sponsoring fatal attacks against \nAmerican citizens, including the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy and \nthe Marine Barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, and the 1996 bombing of the \nKhobar Towers in Khobar, Saudi Arabia.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, about $43.5 billion \nin unpaid judgments from Iran to Americans are due. Iran should not \nreceive any sanctions relief until those claims have been paid. We \nought to look at how we can secure Iranian assets to provide some \nmeasure of justice for victims of these terrorist activities. That \nshould include assets held by foreign countries, foreign companies, and \ncountries who do business in the United States.\n  The idea that the Iranian regime is now our partner is dangerously \nnaive and one that undermines our global leadership. It confuses our \nfriends, and it emboldens our enemies. I urge the President to quit \nbending to this regime and start putting the interests of the American \npeople and our allies first. I urge the Congress to continue to look at \nthis recent exchange of money for hostages.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                       Lead In Our Drinking Water\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the effort by \nSenator Stabenow and Senator Peters to amend S. 2012 for Federal \nresponse to the ongoing crisis in Flint, MI. We know about the lead in \nthe water supply, the fact that it was known, and the fact that many \nchildren today have suffered the consequences. It is incumbent that the \nFederal Government be a partner in finding a way to correct that \ncircumstance as soon as possible.\n  I come to the floor urging our colleagues to find a way that we can \nmove forward with such an amendment to help the families in Flint, MI. \nI congratulate my colleagues, Senator Stabenow and Senator Peters, for \ntheir leadership.\n  I hope we don't lose sight of the big picture, and that is that this \nis happening in cities and towns all across America. In Michigan, it is \nnot only Flint but parts of Grand Rapids, Jackson, Detroit, Saginaw, \nMuskegon, Holland, and several other cities that have seen high lead \nlevels in their children. Sebring, OH, just this week closed schools \nfor 3 days because of lead in their tap water. In Toledo, officials \nhave long treated the water with phosphates to prevent leaching of \nlead. Eleven cities and two counties in New Jersey had higher \npercentages of children with elevated lead levels than Flint, MI, State \nlawmakers and advocacy groups said on Monday of this week. Here in the \nNation's capital, in Washington DC, in the early part of the last \ndecade, lead leached into the water of possibly 42,000 children.\n  Let me talk about my State of Maryland. In the city of Baltimore, \nhigh lead levels in schools prompted officials to turn off drinking \nfountains and pass out bottled water instead in every school in \nBaltimore City. They are not hooked up to the fountains because it is \nnot safe. Across the State of Maryland, every 1- and 2-year-old in the \nentire State will be tested for lead--that is 175,000 children--because \nthey are at risk.\n  This is a national problem. In Flint, MI, it is estimated it cost \nabout $800 million for remedial costs alone. That is about two-thirds \nof what we currently appropriate every year for drinking water \ninfrastructure in the entire country. The amount we appropriate is \nwoefully inadequate.\n  Accord to the EPA's most recent estimates, more than $655 billion may \nhave been needed to repair and replace drinking water and wastewater \ninfrastructure nationwide over the next 20 years. This comes out to \nover $32 billion per year every year for the next 20 years. Yet \ncurrently we spend approximately $3 billion per year at the Federal \nlevel on combined drinking water and wastewater infrastructure State \nrevolving funds--one-tenth of the total amount that is needed in order \nto modernize our infrastructure.\n  The public expects that when they turn on the tap, the water is safe. \nThey expect that when they use their bathroom facilities, the \nwastewater is being treated appropriately. They expect that the Nation \nof the United States can deliver water in a manner that is efficient \nand safe. In reality, our water infrastructure is out of sight and is \nwoefully inadequate, as we have seen in Flint, MI.\n  I ask my colleagues: If it costs $800 million to fix the pipes in \nFlint, MI, are we going to come to an agreement that we need a \nsubstantial increase in the amount of funds appropriated for the clean \nwater and drinking State revolving funds to help all American cities? \nBecause the stakes could not be higher.\n  There are many things that went wrong in Flint, MI. First and most \ndirectly was the failure of the Governor and his appointed emergency \nmanagers to identify and address the problem as it grew more and more \napparent. They knew the problem, and yet they didn't do anything about \nit. Second, a declining and increasingly impoverished population, which \nhas gutted the tax base and eliminated the ability to pay back the \nloans the city might receive from the Federal Government to change out \ntheir pipes. It is also a matter of ability to actually afford the \ninfrastructure at the local level. That is why the State partnership \nthrough the Federal partnership through the State revolving funds is so \ncritically important.\n  This has never been a partisan issue. I have served on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee since I was elected to the \nSenate, and we have recommended authorization levels and changes in the \nformula so that we can modernize our water infrastructure in\n\n[[Page S546]]\n\nthis country. It has had nearly unanimous support in our committee.\n  As I said, there is not nearly enough money in these revolving loan \nfunds to keep up to date the drinking and wastewater infrastructure in \nthis country, even if the cities could pay back the loans. The list \ngoes on and on. This list is not limited to Flint. These demographic \nand fiscal physical characteristics are similar to many, many cities of \nevery size in the United States, in almost every State.\n  None of these things that have gone wrong in Flint are more \ndistressing than the possibility that children may have suffered \nirreversible damage in their developing brains from the exposure to \nlead. Exposure to even a low amount of lead can profoundly affect a \nchild's behavior, growth rates, and--perhaps most worrying--their \nintelligence over time. Higher levels of lead in a child's blood can \nlead to severe disabilities, eye-hand coordination problems, and even a \npropensity toward violence. Younger children and fetuses are especially \nvulnerable to even small exposures to lead--whether it be in tapwater, \nlead paint, lead in soil still left from the days of leaded gasoline, \nand lead in children's toys and jewelry. The list goes on and on and \non. There is not just one source of lead, and I understand that, but \nwhen we turn on the faucets, we do not expect to have water that \ncontains lead.\n\n  Further, it is impossible to gauge how a specific child will be \naffected because the developmental impacts of lead poisoning can take \nyears to become apparent. So you might have been poisoned 5 years ago, \nand the effects will take longer before it becomes apparent in the \nclassroom or the community. In fact, the health effects are so severe, \nour Nation's health experts have declared there is no safe level of \nlead in a child's blood--period, the end, zero.\n  I also want to highlight a quote from an article in the New York \nTimes on January 29 of this year.\n\n       Emails released by the office of [Michigan] Gov. Rick \n     Snyder last week referred to a resident who said she was told \n     by a state nurse in January 2015, regarding her son's \n     elevated blood lead level, ``It is just a few IQ points. . . \n     . It is not the end of the world.''\n\n  There has to be a greater sense of urgency in this country. We know \nevery child, if they work hard, should have an opportunity in this \ncountry. We shouldn't take away that opportunity by diminishing their \nability to achieve their objectives.\n  Dr. Hanna-Attisha, the doctor primarily responsible for bringing this \nissue in Flint to light, and others have studied lead poisoning and \nhave sharply different views of lead exposure for which there is no \ncure. Dr. Hanna-Attisha said: ``If you were going to put something in a \npopulation to keep them down for generations to come, it would be \nlead.''\n  This is devastating to the individual and devastating to our \ncountry's potential. The work of the institutions in the State of \nMaryland to combat lead exposure is exemplary. Baltimore's Coalition to \nEnd Childhood Lead Poisoning is a nonprofit organization dedicated to \nservices and advocacy on behalf of families affected by lead poisoning. \nThis organization started as a grassroots effort by Maryland parents \nwho saw a problem in their community and sought innovative solutions. \nThe coalition has grown nationally, founding the Green & Healthy Homes \nInitiative to provide a holistic approach for safer and greener living \nspaces for American families. The coalition has dozens of local \npartners, including Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and \nthe University of Maryland School of Law. Together, I am proud to say, \nthese Maryland institutions are paving the way to combat lead poisoning \nand researching innovative legal solutions to a tragic problem, but we \ncannot rely on the nonprofits to fix this problem for us. The stakes \nare too high and the solution too costly. We have a duty to these \nchildren to make sure their drinking water is safe. Make no mistake, \nmassive lead poisoning of an entire city's children from any source \nrobs our country of an entire generation of great minds--minds which \nare core to the futures of these most vulnerable communities.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to not only act responsibly with \nregard to Flint, MI--and we can do that today with the bill that is on \nthe floor--but to recommit ourselves to find a path forward to provide \nsafe drinking water not just for one city but for all American cities \nand all the people of this Nation.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I have raced to the floor simply because \nit has come to my attention that there are some Senators who are \nutilizing this Energy bill, which is for a very valued purpose, a \npurpose of energy efficiency. Some Senators are utilizing this \nlegislation for their own purpose by proposing amendments that will \nultimately threaten the environmental integrity off of Florida's gulf \ncoast and will threaten the U.S. military and its ability to maintain \nthe largest testing and training area for not only the United States \nbut for the world.\n  I want to refer to a map of the Gulf of Mexico and show you \neverything. Here is the tip of Florida. This is Pensacola, Naples, \nTampa, and down here are the Florida Keys and Key West. Everything in \nyellow in the Gulf of Mexico--and this is the law--is off-limits to \ndrilling until 2022. It happens to be a bipartisan law that was passed \nback in 2006. It was cosponsored by my then-fellow Senator from \nFlorida, a Republican, Mel Martinez. Why did the two of us make this a \nlaw? The drilling is over here, everything to the west. The first \nquestion is: Where is the oil? Mother Nature decided to have the \nsediments go down the Mississippi River for millions of years where it \ncompacted into the Earth's crust and became oil. The oil deposits are \noff of Louisiana, Texas, Alabama, and there is a little bit off of \nMississippi. There really isn't much oil out here.\n  In addition, why did we want this area kept from drilling? Take a \nlook at that. That is a marsh in Louisiana after the gulf oilspill \nwhich took place several years ago. We certainly don't want this in \nFlorida. You will notice that there are not many beaches off of \nLouisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. But what do you think Florida is \nknown for? It is known for its pristine beaches all the way from the \nPerdido River, which is along the Florida-Alabama line and goes down \nthe coast to Naples. This area not only includes the Keys, but it goes \nup the east coast of Florida. Florida has more beaches than any other \nState. Florida has more coastline than any other State, save for \nAlaska, and Alaska doesn't have a lot of beaches.\n  People not only visit Florida because of Mickey Mouse, but they visit \nFlorida in large part because of our beaches. The gulf oilspill turned \nthese white, sugary sands of Pensacola Beach black. Even though the oil \nspilled way over here, it drifted to the east and got as far as \nPensacola. A little bit more oil reached Destin, and there were just a \nfew tar balls on Panama City's beach. When Americans saw those white, \nsugary sand beaches black from oil, they assumed that had happened to \nthe entire coast of Florida, and as a result people didn't visit for \none whole season.\n  So what happened to Florida's economy? What happened to the dry \ncleaners, restaurants, and hotels that are all too happy to welcome \ntheir guests and visitors who didn't come? You get the picture of what \nhappened to our economy.\n  I am speaking about this as the Senator from Florida, but now let me \nspeak as the Senator who is the second-ranking Democrat on the Armed \nServices Committee. This area is known as the military mission line. \nEverything east of that line--indeed, almost all of the Gulf of \nMexico--is the largest training and testing area for the U.S. military \nin the world. Why do you think the training for the F-22 is at Tyndall \nAir Force Base in Panama City? Why do you think the training for the F-\n35 Joint Strike Fighter, both foreign pilots as well as our own, is at \nEglin Air Force Base? It is because they have this area. Why is the \nU.S. Air Force training, testing, and evaluation headquarters at Fort \nWalton, Eglin Air Force Base? Because they have 300 miles here where \nthey can test some of our most sophisticated weapons.\n  If you talk to any admiral or general, they will tell you that you \ncannot have oil-related activities when they are testing some of their \nmost sophisticated weapons. This is a national asset,\n\n[[Page S547]]\n\nand it is key to our national defense. So for all of those reasons, \nSenator Martinez and I put in law that this is off-limits up until the \nyear 2022, but now comes the Energy bill, with its sneaky amendments \ngiving additional revenue sharing to these States and upper States on \nthe Atlantic seaboard. It gives those States a financial incentive to \nget a cut of the oil revenue. What do you think that is going to do to \nthe government of the State of Florida in the future as an excuse to \nput drilling out here as well as to have drilling off the east coast of \nFlorida?\n  When I was a young Congressman, I faced two Secretaries of the \nInterior who were absolutely intent that they were going to drill on \nthe east coast of the United States from Cape Hatteras, NC, all the way \nsouth to Fort Pierce, FL, and the only way back then--in the early and \nmid-1980s--we were able to get that stopped, which this young \nCongressman had a hand in doing, was to explain that you can't have oil \nrigs off of Cape Canaveral, where we are dropping the first stages of \nall of our military rockets that are so essential for us so that we \nwill have assured access into space in order to protect ourselves with \nall of those assets.\n  Of course, in the early 1980s, I could talk about what was going to \nhappen for 135 flights of the space shuttle. You can't have oil-related \nactivities where the first stages--the solid rocket boosters on the \nspace shuttle--are going to be landing by parachutes in the ocean \nbecause you are going to threaten the launch facilities for the U.S. \nmilitary as well as NASA if you put oil-related activities out there.\n  So, too, in another 2 years we will be launching humans again on \nAmerican rockets, some of whose first stages will still be crashing \ninto the Atlantic and whose military defense payloads continue to \nlaunch almost every month, and those first stages splash down into the \nAtlantic. Yet an amendment that is suspected to be offered by a Senator \nis going to give incentive in the future--all the more pressure to try \nto pull oil out of here.\n  Ever since this Senator was a young Congressman, I have been carrying \nthis battle. This Senator supports oil drilling. This Senator supports \nit where it is environmentally sound, including fracking in shale rock, \nbecause look what it has done for us. But there are times when there is \ntradeoff. But in this case there is not going to be a tradeoff, in the \nfirst place because there is not any oil, in the second place because \nit would wreck the economy of Florida with our tourism and our sugary \nwhite beaches, but in the third place because it would threaten the \nnational security of this country if we eliminated this as our largest \ntest evaluation and training center.\n  I can tell my colleagues that this Senator is not going to let that \nhappen.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise to discuss amendment No. 3016. This \nis an amendment that would eliminate the corn ethanol mandate from the \nfuel standards that we have.\n  I wish to thank my cosponsors on this amendment, including Senator \nFeinstein from California and Senator Flake from Arizona. This is a \nbipartisan amendment. I think this is a really important issue.\n  What this amendment does is it eliminates the corn component of the \nrenewable fuel standard. The renewable fuel standard, as my colleagues \nknow, was created in 2007, and this is a Federal mandate that forces \ndrivers to burn, actually, billions of gallons of biofuels, the vast \nmajority of it derived from corn, in our vehicles, in our cars. It is \non the order of 100 billion gallons of corn ethanol, and because this \nmandate establishes specific and increasing quantities of ethanol that \nhas to be burned in our cars, when total gasoline consumption stays \nflat or declines, then it becomes an increasing percentage that we are \nall forced to buy.\n  Let me be clear about one thing. The amendment I am specifically \naddressing, amendment No. 3016, eliminates the corn portion of the \nrenewable fuel standard mandate, and that is 80 percent by volume. The \noptimal policy is to get rid of this whole thing. It was a well-\nintentioned but bad idea to begin with. It is now abundantly clear this \nis bad policy and we should get rid of the whole thing. But I \nunderstand we don't have as broad an interest in getting rid of the \nwhole thing as the interest we have in getting rid of at least the corn \ncomponent. And since that is, after all, 80 percent, this would be \nsignificant progress.\n  There is probably not an enormous universe of things on which I have \nagreed with Vice President Al Gore over the years, but he got this \nright. Vice President Gore has acknowledged that ethanol was a mistake \nin the first place.\n  It was created, as I say, with all good intentions. It was thought \nthat by forcing people to make ethanol mostly from corn and burn it in \nour cars, we would reduce air pollution. It was thought that it would \nreduce costs for families. It was thought that it might even be good \nfor the economy. All three are completely wrong. Factually, that is not \nthe case. The mandate has failed to achieve any of these goals. \nInstead, in fact, it increases air pollution, it increases costs for \nfamilies, and it is harmful to our economy.\n  Let me take the first one, because the real motivation for this was \nto do something to improve the environment. The real idea behind \nethanol--the impetus in the first place--was that somehow we would \nreduce air pollution if we are burning ethanol derived from corn rather \nthan gasoline. Well, unfortunately, it hasn't worked out that way. That \nisn't just my opinion. There is plenty of documentation.\n  In 2009, Stanford University predicted: ``Vehicles running on ethanol \nwill generate higher concentrations of ozone than those using gasoline, \nespecially in the winter . . .''\n  In 2011, the National Academy of Sciences observed: ``Projected air-\nquality effects from ethanol fuel would be more damaging to human \nhealth than those from gasoline use.'' That is the National Academy of \nSciences.\n  In 2014, Northwestern University researchers did a little research on \nthe real world. They went down to Sao Paulo, Brazil, where they had \nrecently required an increase in the use of ethanol, and what did they \nfind? A corresponding, significant increase in ground-level ozone, \nwhich we all know is a harmful pollutant at the ground level and causes \nsmog and other health problems.\n  So there is no dispute about this. There is no question about this. \nEthanol is harmful to our air quality and our environment.\n  The Environmental Working Group agrees. The Environmental Working \nGroup, a group of environmentalists, have said: ``The rapid expansion \nof corn ethanol production has increased greenhouse gas emissions, \nworsened air and water pollution, and driven up the price of food and \nfeed.''\n  I know that many of my colleagues are very concerned about carbon \nemissions. So separate and apart from ozone, CO2 that is \nbeing released into the atmosphere is a concern for a lot of people. \nStudies show that ethanol creates more carbon dioxide emission than \ngasoline. It is just a fact.\n  The Clean Air Task Force estimates that the carbon emissions from \ncorn ethanol, over the next 30 years at current projected consumption \nrates, would exceed 1.4 billion tons, which is 300 million tons more \nthan if we used gasoline instead of the ethanol.\n\n  So there really isn't any debate that I am aware of anymore about \nthis. Air quality is better if we are not using ethanol than when we \nare. But there are other impacts of this mandate. One is the higher \ncost on families.\n  The fact is that ethanol is more expensive to make per unit of energy \nthan gasoline. So we need to spend more for our cars to go the same \ndistance. The New York Times reported that ethanol increased costs to \ngasoline purchasers by billions of dollars in 2013. The Wall Street \nJournal estimated that in 2014 alone, the RFS mandate--this mandate \nthat we burn ethanol in our gas--raised the cost of gas by an average \nof anywhere from $128 to $320 per year for the average family.\n  So let's be very clear. This mandate is costing American families \nseveral hundred dollars a year of their disposable income because they \nare having to spend to buy the more expensive fuel to move their \nvehicles.\n  It is not just the direct effect of having to pay more when we gas up \nour cars. These ethanol mandates take a huge segment of our corn \nproduction off the market and they drive up the price of corn. Again, \nthis isn't just me\n\n[[Page S548]]\n\nsaying so. In 2008, USDA Secretary Ed Schafer and Department of Energy \nSecretary Samuel Bodman acknowledged that ethanol increases the food \nprice. Their estimate is just under 1 percent per year.\n  In 2012, a study by economist Thomas Elam observed that ethanol \nincreases food costs for the average family of four by just over $2,000 \nper year. So the increased food cost is actually multiples of the \nincreased gasoline costs when we fill up our tanks, and families are \nhit by both.\n  Of course, the food cost goes up not only because of the direct \neffect of higher corn--and many of us consume corn directly--but corn \nis the principal feed for all livestock. So the price of meat and \npoultry is very much correlated to the cost of the feed, and we make \nthat feed much more expensive than it needs to be because of the \nethanol mandate.\n  There is another way in which this mandate is harmful to consumers \nand to families, and that is that it increases engine maintenance \ncosts. The EPA acknowledges that ethanol is harmful to engines. They \nsay: ``Unlike other fuel components, ethanol is corrosive and highly \nwater soluble.'' Gasoline is not. So gasoline doesn't have this \nphysical property; it doesn't damage engines. But ethanol does. The \nmoisture that is dissolved in ethanol is corrosive.\n  In fact, the EPA warns that fuel blends containing as little as 15-\npercent ethanol--which, by the way, this year there will be gas \nstations selling gasoline that is 15-percent ethanol--should not be \nused in any motorcycle, schoolbus, transit bus, delivery truck, boat, \nATV, lawnmower or older automobile because of the damage that we know \nthe ethanol will do to these engines.\n  AAA warns that raising ethanol content--just rising it above 10 \npercent, which is where we are--will damage 95 percent of the cars that \nare on the road today. How can this possibly be good for a family to be \nsystematically degrading the engines in their vehicles?\n  There are other ways in which this is damaging to our economy. I \nmentioned that part of the reason that food prices for families are \nhigher as a result of the ethanol mandate is because corn is such an \nimportant source of food for livestock. Well, in fact, the Federal \nReserve and the USDA estimate that the ethanol mandate alone has \ncontributed to a 20- to 30-percent increase in corn prices, and that \nhas had a terrible impact on livestock operations and the dairy \nindustry.\n  It is also bad for American refineries. There are 137 oil refineries \nthat operate in 28 States and employ thousands of people with good \nfamily-sustaining jobs, but because the oil refiner has to either blend \nin ethanol with the gasoline they make or they have to go out and pay a \nfine--a penalty, essentially--if they don't, it diminishes jobs in the \nrefining sector. Again, this isn't just my opinion. I got a letter from \nthe Philadelphia AFL-CIO business manager Pat Gillespie, and I will \nquote from the letter because he lays it out very clearly. He says:\n\n       Our resurrected refinery in Trainer, Pennsylvania . . . \n     once again needs your intercession. The impact of the \n     dramatic spike in costs of the RIN credits--\n\nthe system by which EPA enforces the ethanol mandate--\n\n     from four cents to one dollar per gallon will cause a \n     tremendous depression in . . . [our refinery's] bottom line. \n     . . . Of course at the Building Trades, we need them to have \n     the economic vitality to bring about the construction and \n     maintenance projects that our Members depend on. And the \n     steel workers, of course, need economic vitality so they \n     can maintain and expand their jobs with the refinery. . . \n     . We need your help with this matter.\n\n  I completely agree. This is disastrous policy.\n  Just to summarize, corn ethanol--ethanol generally but corn ethanol \nin particular--is just bad policy. It is bad for the environment, it \nincreases air pollution, it raises costs for families to drive their \nvehicles and to put food on the table, and it costs us jobs. It is bad \nfor the economy. Let's end this practice. Let's end this mandate. It \nwas well-intentioned at the time, but now it is clear it is doing harm, \nnot doing good.\n  I will close on one other point. We in Congress, in Washington, \nshould not be forcing taxpayers and consumers to subsidize certain \nindustries at the expense of others. That is what is going on here. The \nmagnitude of the consumption of ethanol is entirely driven by the \nmandate Congress has required the EPA to impose. That is why this is \nhappening.\n  We use the power of the government to force consumers to pay more \nthan they need to pay to drive their car and to buy their food. This \nmakes no sense at all.\n  It seems to this Senator that a big part of what we are hearing on \nboth sides of the aisle in this very unusual and raucous Presidential \nelection cycle is voters who are disgusted with Washington. They don't \ntrust Washington. They don't have a very high opinion of Congress. Part \nof it is because they are convinced that Congress goes around doling \nout special favors for special industries, special groups, and the \npolitically well-connected. Well, guess what. They are right, and this \nis an egregious example of that. It is a clear example where the \ntaxpayer and consumer get stuck with the bill so as to benefit a select \npreferred industry that has a lot of political clout. It is outrageous. \nThe American people are right to be angry and tired of this.\n  Mr. President, we should end the renewable fuel standard entirely. As \nI say, it started with good intentions, but the evidence is in and \nthere is no mystery anymore: This policy is bad for the environment, \nbad for families, bad for budgets, and bad for our economy. There is no \nreason we should be continuing this, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this and any other effort to completely eliminate the renewable \nfuel standard, and if we can't do that, at least take the 80 percent \nout that is comprised of the corn component.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n              Second Amendment right to Keep and Bear Arms\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a document titled ``Just the FACTS'' at the conclusion of \nmy remarks.\n  Mr. President, the problem of gun violence is real, but too many of \nthe proposed responses to this problem would not only represent unwise \npolicy but would also violate a fundamental constitutional right--the \nSecond Amendment right to keep and bear arms.\n  What does this mean to you and to me as Americans? It means that the \nright to bear arms falls into the same category as our other most \nclosely held individual rights: the right of free speech, the right of \nfreedom of religion, and the right of due process of law. Basically, \nwhat I am saying is that one cannot separate out any one of the Bill of \nRights or any of the other constitutional rights that come under the \n14th Amendment, as an example. You can't separate the right to bear \narms from those because, and this is not emphasized enough, the Second \nAmendment, the right to bear arms, is an individual, fundamental \nconstitutional right. Maybe a lot of us believed that over decades, but \nit has been only within the last 5 to 8 years and in a couple of \ndecisions that the Supreme Court has made that entirely clear, that it \nis an individual, fundamental constitutional right.\n  With that firm foundation, I want to straighten out some of the \nrampant misinformation that is used to advocate for stricter gun \ncontrol. Correcting these myths is essential so that the issue can be \nproperly deliberated and properly addressed. Unfortunately, many of \nthese myths were reiterated over the past 2 weeks during prime time, \nnationwide Presidential media appearances.\n  First, let's debunk the quote ``gun show loophole.'' Were you to \nclick on your TV, pick up a newspaper, or read certain mailers, you \nwould be left with the impression that if you buy a firearm at a gun \nshow, you are not subject to a background check. In fact, all gun show \npurchases made from commercial gun dealers require a background check. \nThese commercial gun dealers--or, as they are called, Federal firearms\n\n[[Page S549]]\n\nlicensees--typically make up the majority of the gun vendors at gun \nshows.\n  Let's be very clear. If someone goes to a gun show and at that gun \nshow purchases a firearm from a commercial gun dealer, that individual \nor those individuals are subject to a background check, period. So then \nwho are these people we hear the President and others speak about who \nare not subject to a background check? If you are an individual and you \nwant to sell your gun to another individual, you may do so, assuming \nyou don't know or have reasonable cause to believe that such person is \nprohibited from owning a gun. It is quite common sense that the \ngovernment does not dictate where this sale takes place. It is peer-to-\npeer. You can sell your hunting rifle to your neighbors, and you can \nmake that sale in your home, driveway, or parking lot. You can also \nmake that sale to another individual at a gun show. That is what is \nreferred to as a peer-to-peer transaction--simply two adults engaged in \na personal transaction. Just as there is no background check required \nin your driveway, there generally is no background check required when \nthat private, peer-to-peer sale happens to occur at a gun show. Very \nclearly, this is not a loophole in the pejorative sense of the word; \nthis is simply an American lawfully selling their property to another \nwithout the Federal Government involved.\n  In this same vein, to hear the President discuss it, you would assume \nthat these gun shows were lawless free-for-alls for felons to obtain \ntheir newest illegal weapon. In fact, local, State, and Federal law \nenforcement are often present at gun shows, both in uniform and \ncovertly in plain clothes. These law enforcement officers monitor and \nintervene in suspected, unlawful firearm sales such as straw \npurchasing, attempted purchases by prohibited individuals, and the \nattempted sale of illegal firearms.\n\n  As the Washington Times reported last Wednesday, law enforcement \narrests at gun shows hit new highs last year. I recently attended a gun \nshow in Iowa, and there was a robust law enforcement presence. So I \nwant to go on to another point beyond the supposed gun show loophole \nthat I just showed isn't much of a loophole.\n  The second point is that we have been repeatedly told by President \nObama, as recently as a couple of weeks ago, that firearms purchased on \nthe Internet don't require a background check. I have seen media \nreports to that same effect. Once again, this is a blatant inaccuracy \nand that is an inaccuracy that needs to be corrected. So that is why I \nam here.\n  An individual cannot purchase a firearm directly over the Internet. A \ngun purchaser can pay for a firearm over the Internet, but, if \npurchased from a firearms retailer, the firearm must then be sent to a \nbrick-and-mortar location. When the purchaser picks up the gun, a \nbackground check is performed. Assuming the purchaser passes the \nbackground check, he or she may obtain physical possession of that \nfirearm.\n  In addition, an individual cannot lawfully purchase a firearm on the \nInternet from an individual who lives in another State. Any interstate \nsale of a firearm--even between two individuals online--must go through \na gun store which, after charging a fee and running a background check \non the purchaser, provides the purchaser with the firearm that they \nbought from another individual on the Internet.\n  These are two clear instances where Internet purchasers require a \nbackground check.\n  The one exception where a firearm can be lawfully purchased using the \nInternet without a background check is when two individuals living in \nthe same State establish the terms of a purchase over the Internet and \nthen meet in person to transfer the firearm.\n  If the firearm is a rifle or a shotgun, a resident may use the U.S. \nPostal Service to mail the firearm intrastate to another individual, \nbut he may not do so if the item being purchased is a handgun. A \nhandgun can only be mailed intrastate via a contract carrier and, as \nyou can see, once you blow away the smoke and pull down the mirrors, \nthe statement that there are no background checks on Internet purchases \nrings hollow.\n  A third point is that with great fanfare President Obama has stated \nunequivocally that firearms enforcement has been a priority with his \nadministration. This is simply not true. That can be backed up with \nstatistics.\n  The Obama administration chose to focus its criminal justice \nresources elsewhere rather than cracking down on illegal gun sales. \nFederal firearms prosecutions are down at least 25 percent under this \nPresident.\n  In addition, he suspended successful programs specifically designed \nto thwart firearms offenses. Unfortunately, as has so often been the \ncase with the Obama administration, the rhetoric just does not match \nthe action. As I have repeatedly called for, we need greater \nenforcement of the existing law, which simply has not happened under \nthis administration.\n  A fourth point, to set the record straight on the President's \nstatements, is that despite condemnation from both sides of the aisle \nand even from publications that regularly support increased gun \ncontrol--such as the LA Times, for example--we have once again heard \nthe President call for tying America's fundamental Second Amendment \nrights to the terrorist no-fly list. As we all know in this body, the \nno-fly list is actually multiple lists generated in secret and \ncontrolled by the executive branch bureaucrats. The no-fly list is \nintended to thwart suspected terrorists from flying. Flying is not a \nconstitutional right like the Second Amendment is. So the people who \nare put on these lists are not given the chance to challenge their \ninclusion on those lists. However, it is blatantly unconstitutional to \ndeny a fundamental constitutional right without any type of due process \nsuch as notice and the opportunity to be heard.\n  The fact that the President continues to call for use of the no-fly \nlist as it relates to a fundamental right calls into question his \nrepeated assurances that he fully supports the Second Amendment.\n  Given unprecedented Executive actions regarding sanctuary cities and \na refusal to enforce immigration laws as enacted by this body, we \nshould not be surprised at those statements. But let me state \nunequivocally that using a secret document--which by its nature and \npurpose will often be overinclusive or contain errors as a basis for \ndenying Americans their Second Amendment right--is clearly \nunconstitutional.\n  The fifth point against the President's position is that on multiple \noccasions the Obama administration has condemned semiautomatic weapons. \nSo let's get it straight right here and now. As any gun owner knows, a \nsemiautomatic firearm is simply a gun that shoots one round with each \npull of the trigger. This encompasses the type of shotgun most often \nused for duck hunting and the type of rifle often used for target \nshooting. A semiautomatic firearm does not equate to the fabled assault \nweapon and, of course, it is not a machine gun. We should be concerned \nwhen this administration makes proposals on guns that fail to reflect \nknowledge of even elementary elements of their operation.\n  I have additional myths that need to be dispelled that I will \nsubmit--and I have had permission from the Presiding Officer to submit \nthat--but I want to be mindful of other people's times, and I now wish \nto respond directly to one of President Obama's challenges.\n  So let's talk for a moment about bipartisan efforts regarding gun \ncontrol. Senator Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Democrat in \nleadership, and I are working on drafting a bill on which we hope we \ncan reach agreement and introduce shortly, which prohibits all aliens--\nwith the exception of permanent legal permanent residents and those who \nfall under a sporting exception--from acquiring firearms. In addition, \nour bill reinstitutes residency requirements for those noncitizens \nattempting to purchase a firearm.\n  The bipartisan legislation we hope we can agree to introduce would \nclose real and actual loopholes, such as those that currently permit \nrefugees or asylees or those from visa-waiver countries to acquire \nfirearms.\n  I look forward to the opportunity to work on this issue in a \nbipartisan manner. But if we are going to deliberate and debate the \nissue, we must clear up the misconceptions and avoid erroneous rhetoric \nthat seems to be dominating the news out there with all the\n\n[[Page S550]]\n\nfalse positions and false interpretations of the law, which I have \ndiscussed in a few minutes with my colleagues.\n  So I am going to end where I started. The Second Amendment right to \nbear arms is a fundamental right, and any legislative or Executive \naction under any President must start and finish with the recognition \nof the fact that the Second Amendment is as important as other \namendments to the Constitution of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Just the Facts\n\n       The President's Executive Actions on Firearms and Other \n     Common Myths.\n       Myth #1: Firearm purchases at gun shows do not require a \n     background check due to the ``gun show loophole.''\n       Facts:\n       When the President and others refer to the ``gun show \n     loophole,'' they imply that there are no background checks \n     being done at gun shows. As a result, much of the public has \n     been misinformed and are led to believe that individuals who \n     purchase firearms at gun shows are not subject to a \n     background check.\n       In reality, there is no ``gun show loophole.'' If an \n     individual wants to purchase a firearm from a licensed \n     firearms retailer, which typically makes up the majority of \n     vendors at gun shows, the individual must fill out the \n     requisite federal firearms paperwork and undergo a National \n     Instant Criminal Background Check System (``NICS'') \n     background check.\n       The only firearms that are being purchased at gun shows \n     without a background check are those being bought and sold \n     between individuals, peer-to-peer, as opposed to buying a \n     firearm from a gun dealer. These private sales are no \n     different from selling a personal hunting rifle to the \n     owner's niece or nephew down the road. It is a private sale \n     and no background paperwork is required. The gun is private \n     property and the sale is made like a sale of the family's \n     good silver. The one difference is that the locus of a gun \n     show is being used to make the private sale.\n       Under current law, an individual is permitted to \n     occasionally sell part, or all, of their personal firearms \n     collection. These private sellers, however, cannot be \n     ``engaged in the business'' of selling firearms. ``Engaged in \n     the business'' means they can't repeatedly sell firearms with \n     the principal objective of earning funds to support \n     themselves. Some of the individuals who wish to sell a \n     portion, or all, of their personal firearms collection do so \n     at the show and might display their wares on a table. These \n     ``private table sales,'' however, are private, peer-to-peer, \n     sales and, therefore, do not require a background check. The \n     President cannot change criminal statutes governing \n     requirements for which sellers must conduct background \n     checks. His new actions don't do so and don't claim to do so.\n       In a peer-to-peer, private firearms transaction, it is \n     already illegal to sell a firearm to another individual if \n     the seller knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the \n     buyer meets any of the prohibited categories for possession \n     of a firearm (felon, fugitive, illegal alien, etc).\n       Myth #2: Gun shows lack any law enforcement presence and \n     are a free-for-all for felons and other prohibited \n     individuals to obtain firearms.\n       Fact:\n       Local, state, and federal law enforcement are often present \n     both in uniform and/or covertly in plain clothes to monitor \n     and intervene in suspected unlawful firearms sales such as \n     straw purchasing, purchases made by prohibited individuals, \n     including non-residents, and the attempted sale of any \n     illegal firearms.\n       Myth #3: Individuals who purchase firearms on the internet \n     are not subject to background checks.\n       Facts:\n       An individual cannot purchase a firearm directly from a \n     firearms retailer over the internet and have that firearm \n     shipped to them directly. An individual can pay for the \n     firearm over the internet at websites and online sporting \n     goods retailers. The firearm, however must be picked up from \n     a federal firearms licensee (``FFL'') such as a gun store. In \n     many cases, this is the brick and mortar store associated \n     with the website where the gun purchase was made. Once at the \n     retail store, the internet purchaser must then fill out the \n     requisite forms, including ATF Form 4473, which initiates the \n     NICS background check process. Thus, an internet purchase of \n     a firearm from a firearms retailer does require a background \n     check.\n       Individuals, from the same state, are able to advertise and \n     purchase firearms from one another and use the internet to \n     facilitate the transaction. It is unlawful, under current \n     law, to sell or transfer a firearm to an individual who is \n     out-of-state. Any internet sale, even between individuals, \n     that crosses state lines would have to utilize a federal \n     firearms licensee (``FFL''), such as a gun store, and the \n     purchaser would be required to fill out the requisite state \n     and federal paperwork and would undergo a background check.\n       Myth #4: President Obama's January 5, 2016, executive \n     action on gun control represents landmark change regarding \n     gun control.\n       Facts:\n       With few exceptions, President Obama's executive action on \n     firearms is nothing more than rhetoric regarding the status \n     quo. Many senators have long argued for better and more \n     robust enforcement of existing laws that prohibit criminals \n     from owning guns.\n       It is the current law of the land that anyone engaged in \n     the business of selling firearms must have a federal firearms \n     license. The President's action does not change current law, \n     but merely restates existing court rulings on the meaning of \n     ``engaged in the business.''\n       Myth #5: The Obama Administration has made firearms \n     enforcement a priority.\n       Facts:\n       The Obama Administration has used its limited criminal \n     enforcement resources to focus on clemency for convicted and \n     imprisoned felons, the investigation of police departments, \n     and on civil rights cases. The latter two categories \n     represent important work, but the Department of Justice lost \n     track of one of its core missions of enforcing criminal law: \n     prosecuting violent criminals, including gun criminals.\n       The Obama Administration is only now making firearms \n     enforcement a priority. Clearly, enforcing the gun laws is a \n     new initiative, or one of the President's actions would not \n     have been informing all of the 93 U.S. Attorneys about it.\n       Proof of this lack of enforcement is revealed in the \n     decline of weapons related prosecutions during the Obama \n     administration. As data obtained from the Executive Office of \n     United States Attorneys, through a Freedom of Information Act \n     (``FOIA'') request, reveal, firearms prosecutions are down \n     approximately 25 percent under the Obama administration \n     versus the last year of the Bush administration.\n       Myth #6: Mental health has nothing to do with gun control.\n       Facts:\n       People with certain levels of mental illness are not \n     permitted to own guns. Many of the recent mass killings were \n     committed by mentally ill individuals. One of the keys to \n     preventing further mass shootings and violence committed with \n     firearms is addressing the issue of mental health.\n       Background checks to prevent the mentally ill from \n     obtaining guns can only work if states provide mental health \n     records to the NICS system. Too many states have failed to do \n     so. Many of the worst offenders are states with the most \n     stringent gun control laws. For multiple years now, many \n     members of Congress have repeatedly called for and introduced \n     legislation that would provide incentives for states to \n     submit their mental health records for inclusion in the NICS \n     database.\n       Myth #7: President Obama's executive action on gun control \n     will thwart criminals' ability to obtain firearms.\n       Facts:\n       The President's executive action regarding firearms is \n     focused primarily on individuals who attempt to purchase \n     firearms through the background check process.\n       Criminals, however, obtain firearms in myriad illegal ways, \n     including home invasion robbery, trading narcotics for \n     firearms, burglary of homes, vehicles, and businesses, as \n     well as straw purchasing.\n       Grassley legislation, SA 725, was specifically designed to \n     combat the straw purchasing of firearms as well as firearms \n     traffickers who transfer firearms to prohibited individuals \n     and out-of-state residents.\n       Myth #8: There is a general consensus in America that \n     greater gun control is needed to prevent mass shootings in \n     the United States.\n       Facts:\n       Despite the President's statement to the contrary, polls \n     have shown that the majority of Americans do not believe that \n     stricter gun control would reduce the number of mass \n     shootings in the United States.\n       The American public does not believe that making it harder \n     for law abiding Americans to obtain guns makes America safer. \n     In fact, polls have shown that a majority of Americans thinks \n     the United States would be safer if there were more \n     individuals licensed and trained to carry concealed weapons. \n     A majority opposes re-imposition of the ``assault weapons'' \n     ban.\n       Myth #9: The terrorist ``no-fly'' list is a proper \n     mechanism to bar Americans from purchasing firearms.--\n     President Barack Obama, January 5, 2016\n       Facts:\n       The no-fly list is actually multiple lists, which are \n     generated in secret and controlled by executive branch \n     bureaucrats. The Second Amendment right to bear arms has been \n     determined by the U.S. Supreme Court to be a fundamental \n     right. This puts the right to bear arms in our most closely \n     guarded rights similar to the right to free speech and \n     freedom of religion. It is unconstitutional to deprive an \n     American citizen of their Second Amendment right without \n     notice and an opportunity to be heard.\n       Myth #10: Gun retailers need to step up and refuse to sell \n     semi-automatic weapons.--President Barack Obama, January 5, \n     2016\n       Facts:\n       There is nothing unlawful about a semi-automatic firearm. A \n     semi-automatic firearm simply means that a round is \n     discharged with each pull of the trigger. These include most \n     shotguns used for waterfowl hunting and rifles commonly used \n     for target shooting.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S551]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3140, as Modified\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join some of my \ncolleagues today to speak about the key role woody biomass can play in \nhelping to meet our Nation's renewable energy needs.\n  Last night an amendment that several of us offered was adopted by a \nvoice vote. I thank the sponsors of that amendment who have joined with \nme--Senator Klobuchar, Senator King, Senator Ayotte, Senator Franken, \nSenator Daines, Senator Crapo, and Senator Risch--all of whom worked \nhard to craft this important amendment.\n  There has been a great deal of misinformation, regrettably, \ncirculated about the amendment, which I hope we will be able to clarify \nthrough a colloquy on the floor today. I know the lead Democratic \nsponsor of the amendment, Senator Klobuchar, would like to speak on it \nand has an engagement, so I am going to yield to her before giving my \nremarks. I thank her for her leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I thank Senator Collins for her \nleadership and for her illuminating the rest of the Senate. Maybe not \neveryone has as many trees as we do, and biomass. I appreciate what she \nhas done.\n  I was proud to cosponsor this bill and be one of the leads on it, \nwith Senator King. This amendment moves us forward in really \nrecognizing the full benefits of the use of forest biomass as a \nhomegrown energy solution. I also thank Senator Cantwell and Senator \nMurkowski for their work on this Energy bill and the inclusion of this \namendment--an amendment that encourages interagency coordination to \nestablish consistent policies relating to forest biomass energy.\n  We have often talked about how we don't want to have just one source \nof energy, whether hydro, nuclear--you name it. So we want to recognize \nthe importance of this forest biomass energy and talk a little bit \nabout it today.\n  I sent letters to the EPA and have spoken with administration \nofficials, urging them to adopt a clear biomass accounting framework \nthat is simple to understand and implement. Without clear policies that \nrecognize the carbon benefits--and I will say that again: the carbon \nbenefits--of forest biomass, private investment throughout the biomass \nsupply chain will dry up and the positive momentum we have built toward \na more renewable energy future will be lost.\n  Supporting homegrown energy is an important part in an ``all of the \nabove'' energy strategy. Biomass energy is driving energy innovation in \nmany rural communities. The forest industry in my State and those who \nwork in that industry are already playing a significant role in the \nbiomass energy economy. There is always room to do more.\n  I appreciate the discussions between my colleagues yesterday on the \nlanguage of this amendment and am pleased we ultimately--including \nSenator Boxer's help and others'--found a solution that moves us \nforward. I know there is interest in continuing these conversations, \nand I look forward to doing so.\n  I thank Senator Collins.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota for \nher leadership.\n  I, too, want to thank the two floor managers of this bill, the \nchairman, Senator Murkowski, and her partner, Senator Cantwell, for \nworking so closely with us.\n  The fact is that biomass energy is a sustainable, responsible, \nrenewable, and economically significant energy source. Many States, \nincluding mine, are already relying on biomass to help meet their \nrenewable energy goals. Renewable biomass produces the benefits of \nestablishing jobs, boosting economic growth, and helping us to meet our \nNation's energy needs. Our amendment supports this carbon-neutral \nenergy source as an essential part of our Nation's energy future.\n  The amendment, which was adopted last night, is very straightforward. \nIt simply requires the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of \nAgriculture, and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \nAgency to jointly ensure that Federal policy relating to forest \nbioenergy is consistent and not contradictory and that the full \nbenefits of forest biomass for energy, conservation, and responsible \nforest management are recognized.\n  It concerns me greatly that some have suggested that our amendment \nwould somehow result in substantial damage to our forests and the \nenvironment. Nothing could be further from the truth. Forests in the \nUnited States are robust and sustainably managed, and climate science \nhas consistently and clearly documented the carbon benefits of \nutilizing forest biomass for energy production. Moreover, healthy \nmarkets for biomass and forest products actually help conserve forest \nland and keep our working forests in this country.\n  Our amendment also echos the principles outlined in a June 2015 \nbipartisan letter that was led by Senator Merkley and myself and was \nsigned by 46 Senators from both sides of the aisle. Our letter stated: \nOur constituents employed in the biomass supply chain deserve federal \npolicy that recognizes the clear benefits of forest bioenergy. We urge \nyou to ensure that federal policies are consistent and reflect the \ncarbon neutrality of forest bioenergy.\n  In response to our letter, the administration noted that ``DOE, EPA, \nand USDA will work together to ensure that biomass energy plays a role \nin America's clean energy future.''\n  That is precisely the importance of our amendment, to make sure that \nhappens.\n  The carbon neutrality of biomass harvested from sustainably managed \nforests has been recognized repeatedly by numerous studies, agencies, \ninstitutions, and rules around the world.\n  Carbon-neutral biomass energy derived from the residuals of forest \nproducts manufacturing has climate benefits. Scientists have confirmed \nthat the ongoing use of manufacturing residuals for energy in the \nforest products industry has been yielding net climate benefits for \nmany years. These residuals, such as bark and sawdust, replace the need \nfor fossil fuels and provide significant greenhouse gas benefits, which \nsome scientists have estimated to be the equivalent of removing \napproximately 35 million cars from the roads.\n  As forests grow, carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere \nthrough photosynthesis. This carbon dioxide is converted into organic \ncarbon and stored in woody biomass. Trees release the stored carbon \nwhen they die, decay, or are combusted. As the biomass releases carbon \nas carbon dioxide, the carbon cycle is completed. The carbon in biomass \nwill return to the atmosphere regardless of whether it is burned for \nenergy, allowed to biodegrade, or lost in a forest fire.\n  In November of 2014, 100 nationally recognized forest scientists, \nrepresenting 80 universities, wrote to the EPA stating the long-term \ncarbon benefits of forest bioenergy. This group weighed a comprehensive \nsynthesis of the best peer-reviewed science and affirmed the carbon \nbenefits of biomass.\n  A literature review of forest carbon science that appeared in the \nNovember 2014 ``Journal of Forestry'' confirms that ``wood products and \nenergy resources derived from forests have the potential to play an \nimportant and ongoing role in mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) \nemissions.''\n  So Federal policies for the use of clean, renewable energy solutions, \nincluding biomass, should be clear and simple and reflect these \nprinciples.\n  We should not have Federal agencies with inconsistent policies when \nit comes to such an important issue. Again, I want to thank the \nsponsors and cosponsors of my bill, my amendment, as well as the \nchairman and the ranking member of the Energy Committee for their \ncooperation in getting the amendment adopted last night.\n  I would like to yield to my colleague from Maine Senator King, who \nmade this a tripartisan amendment when we offered it.\n\n[[Page S552]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, as usual, my senior colleague from Maine has \noutlined this issue exceptionally well and covered the important \npoints. I wish to add and amplify a few.\n  The first thing I would say is that I yield to no person in this body \nin terms of their commitment to the environment, their commitment to \nending our dependence upon fossil fuel, and our facing of the challenge \nof climate change. This biomass discussion is a way of helping with \nthat problem rather than hindering it. The important term in all of \nthis discussion is the word ``fossil.''\n  The issue we are facing now with climate change and with increased \nCO2 in the atmosphere is because we are releasing \nCO2. We are releasing carbon that has been trapped in the \nEarth's crust for millions of years, and we are adding to the carbon \nbudget of the atmosphere.\n  Biomass is carbon that is already here. It is already in the \nenvironment. It is in the trees. It is simply being circulated, and \nthere is no net addition of carbon to the atmosphere because of the use \nof biomass. I have been in the renewable energy business now for more \nthan 30 years and have worked in hydro, biomass, energy conservation on \na large scale and wind power. So I have some background in this. A \nbiomass plant typically burns fuel that would not otherwise enter into \nthe economic stream of timber. It is often bark, mill waste, ends of \nlogs, branches--the kind of thing that otherwise lies on the forest \nfloor, dies and decays and releases carbon. There is no net addition of \ncarbon.\n  To be intellectually honest, you have to say that burning it releases \nthat carbon so much sooner than it would otherwise be released, but in \nthe overall term we are talking about a renewable resource.\n  In New England and I suspect around the country--I know in Maine--\nthere are substantially more trees in the forest today than there were \n150 years ago because of the number of farms that have been returned to \ntheir natural state of forestry. That has given us an opportunity to \ndevelop an energy source that is a lot more safe and supportive of the \nenvironment than the other fossil fuel elements we have seen that have \ncontributed to the CO2 problem in this country.\n  I think this is a commonsense amendment. It basically tries to get \nthe Federal Government on the same page on this issue consistently \nacross the agencies. It makes the point that as long as we are talking \nabout sustainable management, we are talking about what amounts to a \ncontinuous renewable resource. We are not adding to the carbon burden \nof the atmosphere, and therefore I think this is a commonsense \namendment that will not set back our efforts with regard to climate \nchange but will actually advance them.\n  I am happy to support this amendment, to support my colleague from \nMaine. I think this is the kind of commonsense amendment that actually \nbelongs. It is a very important part of this bill. It strengthens it \nconsiderably, in my view. I want to again thank my senior colleague for \nbringing this bill forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nMaine. He has enormous expertise in the area of renewable energy, and I \nvery much appreciate his adding his expertise to this debate.\n  Before I yield the floor, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record a letter dated June 30, 2015, and signed by 46 Senators, on \nthis very issue, that was addressed to the Administrator of the EPA, \nthe Secretary of Energy, and the Secretary of Agriculture.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         United States Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 30, 2015.\n     Hon. Gina McCarthy,\n     Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Dr. Ernest Moniz,\n     Secretary, U.S. Department of Energy,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Tom Vilsack,\n     Secretary, U.S. Department of Agriculture,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Administrator McCarthy, Secretary Moniz, and Secretary \n     Vilsack: We write to support biomass energy as a sustainable, \n     responsible, renewable, and economically significant energy \n     source. Federal policies across all departments and agencies \n     must remove any uncertainties and contradictions through a \n     clear, unambiguous message that forest bioenergy is part of \n     the nation's energy future.\n       Many states are relying on renewable biomass to meet their \n     energy goals, and we support renewable biomass to create jobs \n     and economic growth while meeting our nation's energy needs. \n     A comprehensive science, technical, and legal administrative \n     record supports a clear and simple policy establishing the \n     benefits of energy from forest biomass. Federal policies that \n     add unnecessary costs and complexity will discourage rather \n     than encourage investment in working forests, harvesting \n     operations, bioenergy, wood products, and paper \n     manufacturing. Unclear or contradictory signals from federal \n     agencies could discourage biomass utilization as an energy \n     solution.\n       The carbon neutrality of forest biomass has been recognized \n     repeatedly by numerous studies, agencies, institutions, \n     legislation, and rules around the world, and there has been \n     no dispute about the carbon neutrality of biomass derived \n     from residuals of forest products manufacturing and \n     agriculture. Our constituents employed in the biomass supply \n     chain deserve a federal policy that recognizes the clear \n     benefits of forest bioenergy. We urge you to ensure that \n     federal policies are consistent and reflect the carbon \n     neutrality of forest bioenergy.\n           Sincerely,\n         Susan M. Collins; Jeff Merkley; Kelly Ayotte; Roy Blunt; \n           John Boozman; Richard Burr; Shelley Moore Capito; Bill \n           Cassidy; Thad Cochran; John Cornyn; Tammy Baldwin; \n           Sherrod Brown; Robert P. Casey, Jr.; Joe Donnelly; \n           Dianne Feinstein.\n         Al Franken; Tim Kaine; Angus S.

Risch; Jeff Sessions; \n           John Thune; Thom Tillis; David Vitter; Jon Tester; Mark \n           R. Warner; Tim Scott; Richard C. Shelby; Patrick J. \n           Toomey; Roger Wicker.\n         United States Senators.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I am delighted to join the two Senators \nfrom Maine--Senator Collins and Senator Angus King--in this dialogue, \nas well as Senator Klobuchar. I believe a few other Senators may join \nus.\n  Senator Collins has been a great leader in advancing the debate or \nthe conversation recognizing the carbon benefits of biomass. Her State \nand of course Senator King's State is so much like Oregon. If you fold \nthe map of the United States in the middle and put east and west on top \nof each other, Oregon and Maine end up closely associated. We have \nsimilar coastlines. We have shellfish industries. We have timber \nindustries. We have salmon runs. We having similar initiative systems \nand our largest cities are named Portland.\n  I know that when I had the pleasure to visit Maine--and I went there \nwith my wife and children to visit friends from many walks of our two \nlives, my wife's life and my life--we went from town to town visiting \nthese friends who moved to Maine. We picked up a newspaper, and we felt \nlike we were right at home in Oregon. The same initiatives were being \ndone at that time in the State as we had on the front page back home.\n  This issue of biomass is close to our hearts in the forests of the \nNortheast and in the forests of the Northwest. When I first came to the \nSenate and the conversation was going forward about renewable energy, \nSenator Dorgan from North Dakota--now retired--said that his home State \nwas the Saudi Arabia of wind energy. I heard Senator Reid from Nevada \nsay Nevada is the Saudi Arabia of solar power. There was a county \ncommissioner from Douglas County--the county I was born in--which has \nthe largest concentration of Douglas fir trees, its enormous biomass \narea--who referred to how Douglas County can be the Saudi Arabia of \nbiomass energy. I thought, with all these Saudi Arabians in the United \nStates, why are we still importing oil from Saudi Arabia? But indeed \nthese efforts to develop an alternative to pivot from fossil fuels to a \nclean energy economy should include solar, should include wind, and \nshould include biomass.\n\n[[Page S553]]\n\n  When I came to the Senate, I undertook the project of helping the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency recognize that you have to look at the \nlife cycle. You can't simply look at the moment of combustion. You \ncan't compare coal being burned in a coal furnace or oil in an oil \nfurnace and say that is equivalent to wood being burned in a biomass \nfurnace because, indeed, as you take that biomass, that wood, you are \nengaged in a life cycle that doesn't involve bringing more carbon out \nof the Earth and adding it to the cycle of ground. Our colleague, Angus \nKing from Maine, was referring to that difference earlier in his \ncomments.\n  It has been an effort to make sure our government takes account of \nthis significant contribution of forest biomass. In the Northwest, the \nbiomass is the potential for a win-win as a renewable source and \nimproving forest health, and Senator Collins was referring to the goals \nof responsible forest management and conservation.\n  Indeed, if you drive along the roads in our national forests in my \nhome State, you will see slash piles. These piles are there because as \nwe go through for forest health, we thin the trees. If they are good \nsaw logs, we take them off to the mill, but the debris remains, and we \nput them into piles. The goal is to remove those piles, but often there \nis no economical way to remove those piles, and then you have to burn \nthem in the forest.\n  A couple of months ago I was in the forest in Southern Oregon with a \ntorch, lighting fire to these piles. In this case it was an area where \nthere is often a temperature inversion and you get smog from the smoke. \nThey only can be burned a couple days a year. It is a big challenge. \nIsn't it so much better to be able to take those piles of biomass and \nput them to work instead of burning them in the forest? Burn them in a \nsituation that produces heat and electricity. That is a win-win \noutcome.\n  So when you hear people in the Northwest talk about forest biomass, \nthere is a lot of excitement about how to grow this market, a market \nthat has the means of improving the health of our forests while \nproviding renewable energy. On private lands a growing domestic biomass \nmarket also has the potential to create a new value stream for our \nforest landowners. By adding another value stream for forest \nlandowners, biomass can create incentives to keep forestland as forests \nand avoid conversion to a nonforest use.\n  The modification made to Senator Collins' amendment reflects this \ndynamic, that one of the contributions to emissions in the forest \nsector is actually the conversion of forestland and nonforest use \nbecause trees are no longer there to sequester carbon. So if we can \nhelp prevent this, that is a beneficial side effect of this overall \neffort on biomass, to amplify the role of the forest, not to remove \nthem.\n  The most important example that has been brought up as a concern that \ndoesn't fit this model of conservation or burning the byproducts is \nwhether entire forests might be ground up and used to create pellets \nand so forth. I believe--and I certainly will be corrected if I am \nwrong--that certainly is not the framework in which this amendment is \ncrafted with the dedication to enhancing the health of our forests and \nenergy and forest conservation.\n  I think this amendment sends a clear signal to EPA that in many cases \nforest biomass is carbon neutral and should be treated as such. It \nreinforces the conversation we have been having since I came here over \nthe last 7 years and earlier with Senator Collins' hard work.\n  When EPA takes regulatory action, it should reflect the opportunities \nwhere biomass is carbon neutral. In fact, policies like the Clean Power \nPlan should provide an incentive for forest biomass that is carbon \nneutral.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on this topic \nbecause this is a very significant win-win opportunity for energy, for \nthe environment, and those are the type of opportunities we should \nseize.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate passed an \namendment from Senators Collins and Klobuchar to promote biomass \nenergy.\n  I would like to take a couple minutes to express my support for \nbiomass energy.\n  Using biomass to create energy can be significantly better than using \ncoal. I think it is great that people use wood to heat their homes, \ninstead of heating with fossil fuels--like oil--particularly, when they \ndo so with clean-burning, EPA-certified wood stoves or pellet stoves, \nparticularly, when the stoves are produced by great companies--like \nQuadraFire, based in Colville, WA.\n  Professors at University of Washington have emphasized the need for \nsuch an amendment to encourage the development of new emission-reducing \nenergy facilities that use the types of biomass that will achieve our \ncountry's renewable energy and climate mitigation goals.\n  Last October, EPA recognized that the use of some biomass can play an \nimportant role in controlling increases of CO2 levels in our \natmosphere. EPA stated that the use of some types of biomass can \npotentially offer a wide range of environmental benefits, aside from \nthe important carbon benefits.\n  We have a wildfire problem in this country, and we need to encourage \nmarkets for the small trees, slash, and brush that we want to remove \nfrom our most at-risk forests. According to the EPA, the growth in U.S. \nforests offsets 13 percent of total U.S. CO2 emissions \nannually. But the Global Climate Change Office at USDA has reported \nthat increasing wildfires are transforming our forests from ``carbon \nsinks'' to ``carbon sources.'' We clearly need to treat some of our \nforests, and we should use the biomass that is generated. We also know \nwe also need energy.\n  But I think we need to continue to look at the ``highest and best \nuse'' philosophy when talking about biomass. Clearly, trees filtering \nwater and providing wildlife habitat is a best use. Clear-cutting our \nforests and burning whole trees for electricity is not a good use. But \nburning industrial or harvesting waste for energy is a good use.\n  I am excited that EPA is currently developing a world leading \naccounting framework for biomass-generated emissions, and we are \ncounting on them to finish this.\n  I also want to say that cross-laminated timber is a particularly \nimportant ``good'' use of biomass. Building with wood uses less carbon \nthan concrete, and CLT explicitly stores carbon, which in terms of our \ncarbon balance is better than simply burning it.\n  We agree that some biomass is clearly ``carbon neutral'' and some \nbiomass is not ``carbon neutral.'' A study by the National Council for \nAir and Stream Improvement showed that mills using biomass residuals \navoid 181 million tons of CO2 emissions. That is equivalent \nto removing 35 million cars from the road.\n  When we modified the amendment yesterday, we did so to make clear \nthat the direction to the agencies was to establish biomass energy \npolicies that are carbon neutral. Regrowing trees to replace those cut \nto produce energy is ``carbon neutral.''\n  But clear-cutting forests and burning them in power plants can lead \nto increases in atmospheric carbon levels for decades--especially when \nowners then sell their cut forests for housing developments, this is \nclearly not ``carbon neutral.'' The trees need to grow back and the \nforest to stay working in order to replace the carbon taken. That is \nwhy we specifically modified the amendment, prior to voting on it, to \nensure we are encouraging forest owners to keep their lands in forests.\n  Senator Markey is another leading voice in our carbon conversation, \nand I am looking forward to hearing his remarks.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Cantwell for her \ntireless work on this Energy bill and for her help in improving the \nbiomass amendment that the Senate adopted last night.\n  Biomass energy is already contributing to the U.S. energy mix in ways \nthat help reduce carbon pollution that causes global warming.\n  There are great examples of electricity generation coming from wood \nresidues like at the Fort Drum Army installation in New York and the \nGainesville Renewable Energy Center in Florida. Both of these projects \nhave included efforts to ensure that their biomass material promotes \nland stewardship and responsible forestry practices. Projects like \nthese are generating biomass electricity, jobs, and economic value in \ntheir local communities.\n\n[[Page S554]]\n\n  These are the type of projects that we need to encourage to meet the \nclimate change challenge.\n  But not all biomass energy is created equal. I understand the \namendment's intent to support biomass energy that is determined to be \ncarbon neutral.\n  I appreciate the modifications made to the amendment to ensure that \nU.S. bioenergy policy is not encouraging conversion of forest lands to \nnon-forest uses. This protection is important to acknowledge.\n  But it is also important to acknowledge that the timeframe for any \nclimate benefits from biomass energy can vary. In many instances that \ntimeframe can be very long--on the order of 50 to 100 years.\n  Some practices like clear-cutting forests and burning whole trees for \nenergy should never be considered carbon neutral.\n  That is why it is critical to incorporate what science tells us about \nforests and their interaction with the global carbon cycle into \npolicies governing biomass energy.\n  EPA has a scientific advisory board working on this issue of \nbioenergy carbon accounting right now. They will have a meeting in \nApril to hear from stakeholders about their experience in using biomass \nto reduce carbon pollution. The results of the advisory board's work \nwill be crucial to inform policy across agencies.\n  It is important to have agencies working together on cross-cutting \nissues like this one. But efforts to make policies more consistent \nacross Federal agencies shouldn't interfere with individual agency's \nstatutory responsibilities. The amendment should not be interpreted as \nenabling one agency to block another agency's rulemaking or guidance.\n  I want to thank Senators Collins, Klobuchar, King, and the other co-\nsponsors of the amendment for working with other concerned Senators \nlike myself on modifications to improve the amendment. I look forward \nto continuing working with them to ensure that the United States has a \nsmart, sustainable, and scientifically backed policy for biomass \nenergy.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the U.S. Senate is currently considering \nsweeping legislation to modernize the Nation's energy sector. Despite \nits laudable goals, it leaves one area unaddressed. The bill does \nnothing to stop corporate bad actors, including those in the energy \nsector, from simply writing off their egregious misconduct as a cost of \ndoing business. Today I am submitting a commonsense amendment to close \na tax loophole that forces hard-working Americans to subsidize \ncorporate wrongdoing.\n  Under current law, a corporation can deduct the cost of court-ordered \npunitive damages as an ``ordinary'' business expense. For the victims \nwho have already paid the price for extreme corporate misconduct, there \nis nothing ``ordinary'' about this at all. It is simply wrong. It \noffends our most basic notions of justice and fair play. Punitive \ndamage awards are designed to punish wrongdoers for the reprehensible \nharm that they cause and to deter would-be bad actors from repeating \nsimilar mistakes. Today a company can simply hire a team of lawyers and \naccountants to deduct this punishment from the taxes the company owes. \nMy amendment would end this offensive practice with a simple fix to our \nTax Code.\n  Let us not forget that our energy sector has been plagued with \ncompanies that have recklessly destroyed environments and harmed \ncommunities with impunity. In 1994, a jury awarded $5 billion in \npunitive damages against Exxon for the Valdez spill in Alaska. This oil \nspill devastated an entire region, the livelihoods of its people, and a \nway of life. After Exxon paid white-shoe law firms to fight these \ndamages in the courts for 14 years, it successfully brought its damages \ndown to $500 million. Then, adding insult to injury, Exxon used the \nFederal Tax Code to write off its punitive damages as nothing more than \nan ``ordinary'' business expense.\n  In 2010, the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded, and 11 \nAmericans were killed in the worst oil spill in American history. That \nsame year, an explosion in the Upper Big Branch Mine in West Virginia \nclaimed the lives of 29 miners. If forced to pay punitive damages for \ntheir misconduct, these companies could also write off that expense.\n  The Obama administration has requested eliminating this tax deduction \nin its budget proposals. Our very own Joint Committee on Taxation has \nestimated that closing this loophole would save taxpayers more than \n$400 million over 10 years. If we don't change the law, our deficit \nwill grow by nearly half a billion dollars because we allowed taxpayers \nto subsidize the worst corporate actors. By failing to act, we are \nsending the message that pillaging our environment is an encouraged, \ntax-deductible behavior. This amendment makes fiscal sense, and it is \ncommon sense.\n  Vermonters and Americans are tired of seeing giant corporations \ngetting special treatment under the law--and paying for their reckless \nmistakes. It should shock the conscience to know that current law \ncompels taxpayers to effectively subsidize the malfeasance of the worst \ncorporate actors. My amendment would change this unacceptable status \nquo. I urge Senators to support my amendment.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I wish to speak on my amendment No. 3197, \nto increase the protection of our critical infrastructure in the \nelectric sector from a debilitating cyber attack. I am pleased to have \nSenators Mikulski and Hirono join me as cosponsors.\n  Critical infrastructure refers to entities that are vital to the \nsafety, health, and economic well-being of the American people, such as \nthe major utilities that run the Nation's electric grid, the national \nair transportation system that moves passengers and cargo safely from \none location to another, and the elements of the financial sector that \nensure the $14 trillion in payments made every day are securely routed \nthrough the banking system.\n  The underlying bill includes several provisions that I support to \nimprove the cyber posture of the U.S. electric grid. These include \ngiving the Secretary of Energy new authority to take actions to protect \nthe grid in the event of an emergency and establishing new programs to \nreduce vulnerabilities and improve collaboration among the Department \nof Energy, national labs, and private industry.\n  The underlying bill, however, makes no distinction between the vast \nmajority of local or regional utilities and the very few entities that \nare so key to the electric grid that they could debilitate the U.S. \neconomy and our way of life if they were attacked.\n  The Department of Homeland Security has identified the critical \ninfrastructure entities at greatest risk of resulting in catastrophic \nharm if they were the targets of a successful cyber attack.\n  While the entire list includes fewer than 65 entities across all \nsectors of the economy, it warrants our special attention because there \nis ample evidence, both classified and unclassified, that demonstrates \nthe threat facing critical infrastructure, including our energy sector.\n  Indeed, the committee report accompanying this bill notes that one-\nthird of reported cyber attacks involve the energy sector.\n  The amendment I have filed to this energy policy bill would only \naffect those entities on the list that are already subject to the \noversight of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, known as FERC.\n  Our amendment would require FERC to identify and propose actions that \nwould reduce, to the greatest extent practicable, the likelihood that a \ncyber attack on one of these entities would result in catastrophic \nharm.\n  By ``catastrophic harm,'' the Department of Homeland Security means a \nsingle cyber attack that would likely result in 2,500 deaths, $50 \nbillion in economic damage, or a severe degradation of our national \nsecurity. In other words, if one of these entities upon which we depend \neach day were attacked, the results would be devastating.\n  The Director of National Intelligence, Jim Clapper, has testified \nthat the greatest threat facing our country is in cyber space and that \nthe number one cyber challenge concerning him is an attack on our \nNation's critical infrastructure.\n  His assessment is backed up by several intrusions into the industrial \ncontrols of critical infrastructure. Since\n\n[[Page S555]]\n\n2009, the Wall Street Journal has published reports regarding efforts \nby foreign adversaries, such as China, Russia, and Iran, to leave \nbehind software on American critical infrastructure and to disrupt U.S. \nbanks through cyber intrusions.\n  Multiple natural gas pipeline companies were the target of a \nsophisticated cyber intrusion campaign beginning in December 2011, and \nSaudi Arabia's oil company, Aramco, was subject to a destructive cyber \nattack in 2012.\n  In an incident that is still not fully understood, 700,000 Ukrainians \nlost power in December due to an attack that Ukrainian authorities and \nmany journalists have ascribed to Russian hackers.\n  In a hearing of the Intelligence Committee last summer, I asked \nAdmiral Rogers, the Director of the National Security Agency, which is \nresponsible for cyber space, how prepared our country was for a cyber \nattack against our critical infrastructure. He replied that we are at a \n``5 or 6.''\n  Last month, the Deputy Director of the NSA, Richard Ledgett, was \nasked during a CNN interview if foreign actors already have the \ncapability of shutting down key U.S. infrastructure, such as the \nfinancial sector, energy, transportation, and air traffic control. His \nresponse? ``Absolutely.''\n  When it comes to cyber security, ignorance is not bliss. The \namendment we have filed would take the common sense approach of \nrequiring the Federal agency responsible for the cyber security of the \nelectric grid to collaborate with the entities that matter most and to \npropose actions that can reduce the risk of a catastrophic attack that \ncould cause thousands of deaths, a devastating blow to our economy or \nnational defense, or all of these terrible consequences.\n  Congress has previously missed opportunities to improve our Nation's \ncyber preparedness before a ``cyber \n9/11'' eventually occurs. We should not repeat that mistake.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this vital, bipartisan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I would be remiss if I didn't rise during \nthis debate on energy to address the administration's continuing \nefforts to wear down America's coal industry. As the Senate considers \nreform of our Nation's energy infrastructure, the importance of coal to \nAmerica's energy portfolio simply cannot be understated, and \nunfortunately neither can this administration's deliberate attempts to \nuse Executive power to put the coal industry out of business.\n  This administration has made no secret of its disdain for fossil \nfuels and has unleashed a series of policies intended to subvert \nreliable, affordable, traditional energy sources, such as oil and \nnatural gas, in favor of valuable but more expensive and less reliable \nrenewable resources.\n  We have a lot of wind in Wyoming. In fact, the first wind turbines \nwere put in and the rotors blew off until they discovered they couldn't \nturn them into the wind at 80 miles an hour. But even though we have a \nlot of wind--I guess Wyoming could be called the Saudi Arabia of wind \nand solar, coal, oil, natural gas, and uranium--we have found that \nsometimes the wind doesn't blow, and we have found that sometimes the \nSun doesn't shine and sometimes the wind doesn't blow when the Sun \nisn't shining, and that creates a problem unless you have alternate \nfuels.\n  Coal is at the center of that regulatory battle. The war on coal is \nnot only an affront to coal producers in my home State of Wyoming but \nto energy consumers across America. Let me explain how the \nadministration's war on coal affects Americans across the country with \nthis chart.\n  According to the Energy Information Administration, 39 percent of the \nelectricity in the United States was generated by coal in 2014. The \nonly other energy source that comes close to coal for energy production \nis natural gas, at 27 percent. We need to ask ourselves: If we allow \nthe administration to kill the coal industry, what energy source is \ngoing to take its place and provide our constituents with the energy \nthey need? It is actually the only stockpilable resource we have.\n  This issue hits close to home for me because approximately 40 percent \nof the country's coal is produced in my home State of Wyoming. \nActually, 40 percent is produced in my home county of Campbell County, \nWY. According to the National Mining Association, coal supports more \nthan 27,000 jobs in my State. Now, 27,000 probably doesn't sound like a \nlot in California, Washington, DC, New York, or even Texas, but that is \n9 percent of our state's workforce. Nine percent of our workforce has \njobs related to coal, and they are good-paying jobs. These jobs pay an \naverage of about $81,500 a year. Multiply that by 27,000 jobs, and we \nare talking about billions. Let me be clear. This isn't just an issue \nfor Wyoming or other coal-producing States. The Wyoming Mining \nAssociation reported that in 2014, 30 States received coal from \nWyoming's mines.\n  The area depicted in red on this chart are the States that receive \nWyoming coal, but that doesn't mean some States don't also receive \nelectricity produced in Wyoming from coal. Those States include \nCalifornia, Utah, and Idaho. And, of course on this carbon issue, \nWyoming is forced to account for the carbon that produces the energy \nthese other states consume.\n  The second chart shows that if you represent Texas, Illinois, or \nMissouri, you should be worried about the coal industry because in 2014 \neach of those States received more than 10 percent of Wyoming's coal. \nWisconsin, Iowa, Kansas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Michigan each got \nabout 5 percent of Wyoming's coal. Wyoming's coal was also distributed \nto Nebraska, Georgia, Alabama, Colorado, Louisiana, Tennessee, \nMinnesota, Oregon, Washington, New York, and Arizona. If I didn't list \nyour State, don't think the stability and success of the coal industry \ndoesn't affect you. Ten other States and foreign entities also received \nWyoming's coal.\n  All of these numbers and stats boil down to this: Most of America's \nenergy is powered by coal, and policies that raise the price of coal \nwill hurt industries and households across the country. They will cost \njobs in our country and will cause people to have higher utility bills. \nUnfortunately, the administration is either oblivious or unconcerned \nwith this correlation, as evidenced by the Department of Interior's \nrecent announcement that they will block most new Federal coal leases \nin order to conduct a programmatic environmental impact statement on \ncoal development on Federal lands.\n  About 40 percent of our Nation's coal is produced by the Federal coal \nleasing program. Under that program, which is managed by the Department \nof Interior, private entities compete for the right to lease and mine \nthe coal mineral estate owned by the Federal Government. After a \nrigorous multiyear application and land-use planning process, lessees \nare given an opportunity to mine coal on public land. Again, that is a \nrigorous, multiyear application process that can and does drag on for \nyears. In return, those companies pay BLM a bonus bid, which is an \nupfront fee for the right to mine. Besides that, they also pay an \nannual land rental payment and they pay an additional royalty on the \nvalue of the coal after it is mined. Surface mines pay a royalty of \n12.5 percent and underground mines pay a royalty of 8 percent. These \nrevenues are shared by the Federal Government and the States in which \nthe coal was mined.\n  This program, which began in 1920, has been a tremendously successful \nway to provide affordable energy to the Nation, provide jobs in places \nsuch as Wyoming's Powder River Basin, where 85 percent of all Federal \ncoal is mined, and it provides value to the government. According to \nthe BLM--the Bureau of Land Management--the Federal coal leasing \nprogram has generated well over $1 billion a year for the last 10 \nyears: $7.9 billion in royalties and an additional $4 billion in rent, \nbonus bid payments and other fees. Again, that is money that coal \nleasing earns for the Federal Government--a stark contrast to most \nFederal programs. That doesn't even mention the taxes that are paid by \nthe workers who mine the coal, but if we eliminate their jobs, that \nmoney is not coming in either.\n  This administration has announced plans to halt new Federal coal \nleases while it takes years to study the value and efficacy of the \nprogram. This Department of Interior rule has the potential to \neconomically devastate my home State of Wyoming and send energy prices \naround the country through the roof.\n\n[[Page S556]]\n\n  The BLM laid the foundation for this farce last summer when it staged \na series of listening sessions. I went to the session in Gillette, WY, \nand based on the administration's recent announcement, I don't think \nthe BLM was listening very closely. If they were, they would know that \nAmerican taxpayers are already receiving a fair return on coal \nresources.\n  One gentleman, who told the BLM his story, moved to Wyoming to be a \ncoal miner. He spoke with pride about his job. He was worried that the \njob that has allowed him to raise three children will no longer exist \nif the BLM raises royalty rates.\n  The owner of a small business not directly related to the coal \nindustry told her story. She was worried about the ripple effect \nraising royalty rates would have on Campbell County and the State of \nWyoming. As a mom, she also told the BLM about the direct support coal \ncompanies provide her community through social service agencies, \ncommunity events, and youth activities. She didn't want to see her kids \nlose that support.\n  The benefits she referenced are a reflection of the $1.14 billion in \ntax and fee revenues the State of Wyoming collected from the coal \nindustry in 2014. This is money which the State critically relies on to \nfund things such as schools, highways, and community colleges across \nthe State. Wyoming state lawmakers are going through a process right \nnow to try to figure out how to make up for the lost revenue just from \nlast year. They are making drastic budget cuts which we wouldn't even \nconsider here at the Federal Government even though the State of \nWyoming is in better financial shape than the Federal Government.\n  I mentioned the Gillette woman who is the owner of a small business \nthat is not directly related to the coal industry. She said her \nbusiness is down by 60 percent. That is almost two-thirds less revenue \nthan what she would have had, which means, of course, that it affects \nsome other jobs in the community. So there is a huge ripple effect to \nall of this.\n  Despite these and dozens of similar stories, the administration \nannounced that they need to shut down Federal coal leases and conduct a \nstudy to determine if taxpayers are getting a fair return on the \nFederal coal leasing program. For quite a while now, the resulting \nrevenue coal producers and companies got to keep was less than what \nthey were paying in taxes. If the BLM would have truly listened to the \nfolks in Gillette last summer, they would already know the answer to \nthis. Instead, they have gone forward with a plan to cripple the coal \nindustry and make energy more expensive. In the words of Wyoming's \nGovernor Matt Mead, ``Not only will [Interior's new rule] hurt miners \nand all businesses that support coal mining, it will take away the \ncompetitive advantage coal provides to every U.S. citizen.'' When it is \npart of the energy mix, it affects the other energy prices as well.\n  As we debate energy policy reforms in the coming days, it isn't just \nthe fate of coal that should concern us. Interior's Federal coal \nleasing review is just the latest in a string of regulations aimed at \ndriving fossil fuel industries out of business. The administration has \nalso proposed a new methane flaring rule aimed at discouraging oil and \ngas leasing on Federal lands.\n  This Chamber has spoken clearly in rejecting rules such as the Clean \nPower Plan and the Waters of the United States, but the administration \ncontinues its regulatory war on energy. As we consider energy policy \nreforms, we need to make sure we are protecting the resources that have \nand can continue to power America, and that has to include coal.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Upon my completion, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nHeller be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Prescription Drug Abuse\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak for the millions of \nAmericans impacted by prescription drug abuse, particularly those in my \nhome State of West Virginia, where 600 lives are lost every year to \nopioids. I believe the FDA must start taking prescription drug abuse \nseriously, and that will not happen without a cultural change in the \nagency.\n  The Presiding Officer and I are taking on this issue in the drug \nprevention caucus and addressing how opioids have affected South \nCarolina, West Virginia, and the effect the epidemic has had on all of \nAmerica. We have seen too many examples of the FDA standing in the way \nof efforts to address the opioid abuse epidemic.\n  If you look at this chart, you can see the rise in deaths over the \nlast 15 years and what it has done to our country and our States. It is \nunbelievable and unacceptable. We have been able to face and cure every \nother epidemic in this country. We seem to be keeping this one out of \nsight and out of mind.\n  The FDA delayed for years before finally agreeing to reschedule \nhydrocodone. My first 3 years in the Senate were consumed by getting \nthe FDA to come around on this important step. Since the change went \ninto effect, we have seen a number of prescriptions for combination \nhydrocodone products, such as Vicodin and Lortab, fall by 22 percent. \nThat is over 1 billion pills not being put on the market.\n  After finally taking that step, to add insult to injury after taking \nso long to reschedule this from a schedule III to a schedule II, the \nFDA approved the dangerous drug Zohydro even after its own experts \nvoted 11 to 2 against it. This drug has 10 times the hydrocodone of \nVicodin and Lortab and has the capability of killing an individual with \njust two tablets. Can you imagine? Just recently, the FDA outrageously \napproved OxyContin for use for children as young as 11 years old. This \ndecision means that Pharma is now legally allowed to advertise \nOxyContin to pediatricians under certain circumstances. We have seen \nthis story before. We have seen the devastating impact of this type of \nadvertising, and we have years of evidence that shows that drug use at \nan early age will make a child more likely to abuse drugs later in \nlife. These decisions by the FDA are horrifying examples of the \ndisconnect between the FDA's actions and the realities of this deadly \nepidemic.\n  Leaders at the FDA, including the director of the division that \noversees opioids, are now actively working against the Centers for \nDisease Control's efforts to reform prescribing guidelines, which \nrepresents a reasonable, commonsense approach to help doctors take into \naccount the very real and prevalent danger of addiction and overdose \nwhen prescribing opioids. We have found out there is very little \neducation done. Doctors aren't required to cover this as they go \nthrough medical school. Most will tell you they have less than 1 week \nof schooling for this.\n  That is why last week I announced that I will filibuster any effort \nto confirm Dr. Robert Califf. This is a good man with a stellar \nreputation, but he just comes from the wrong end of this crisis for \nwhich we have to make the changes that need to be made. That is all I \nhave said: Give us someone who is passionate about the change. The \nchange must come from the top of the FDA.\n\n  We need a cultural overhaul of the FDA. When we have the FDA fighting \nthe CDC--the CDC is making recommendations for new guidelines of how \ndrugs are prescribed and how we should protect the public, and the FDA \nis really taking the position that, no, what pharmaceuticals are \nputting out is something that we need as a product. It is a business \nplan. I am sorry, I cannot accept that, and I truly believe there needs \nto be a cultural change, and that starts at the top.\n  Over the past week my office has been absolutely flooded with stories \nfrom West Virginians who want their voices to be heard. And, as I said, \nwe need to make this real, and it will not be unless I can bring to my \ncolleagues the real-life stories of the tragedies that people are \nenduring because of the prescription abuse that goes on.\n  These letters have come from children who have seen their parents die \nfrom an overdose; grandparents who have been forced to raise their \ngrandchildren when their kids went to jail, rehab, and the grave; and \nteachers and religious leaders who have seen their communities \ndevastated by prescription drug abuse. These people need help\n\n[[Page S557]]\n\nfrom the FDA. They count on this regulatory committee--the Federal Drug \nAdministration--to do what should be done to protect millions of \nAmericans across the United States, as well as those who have been \naffected.\n  I am going to read a story and basically bring a person's life to my \ncolleagues--an opportunity to see what happens in a daily situation in \nan abusive scenario. The first story I wish to read comes from a West \nVirginian by the name of Haley. Haley lives in Princeton, WV, which is \nin the southern part, and she is a teacher in Beckley, WV. She is \nmarried and has a baby who is about to turn 1. This is Haley's story:\n\n       Prescription drug addiction destroyed my childhood. Thanks \n     to prescription drug abuse, I grew up much too quickly and \n     still have trust issues today. My mom's one true love was \n     Xanax and I will always come in second or after that, no \n     matter what.\n       When I was in fifth grade, my mom went to rehab two hours \n     away from me. My parents are divorced and my step dad worked \n     on the road, so I stayed with my grandparents. We visited my \n     mom on the weekends and I didn't really understand why she \n     was there. None of it made any sense to me and I just wanted \n     my mom. One day, we received a phone call stating that she \n     had checked herself out and we had no idea where she was for \n     about 24 hours. This wasn't the first time my mom had \n     unsuccessfully tried rehab and it would not be her last.\n       There were times when I would get home from school and have \n     no idea where my mother was, so my grandma and I would have \n     to drive around and search for her. We would eventually find \n     her passed out at one of her ``friends'' houses.\n       There is one particular memory that traumatized me and is \n     forever engrained in my memory. I was 10 years old when we \n     found my mom. She was too high to even walk on her own. My \n     70-year-old grandmother and I had to virtually carry her to \n     the car. When she got home, I took her shoes off so I could \n     put her to bed. I remember being sick to my stomach with \n     worry when I took off her shoe to find a sock completely \n     soaked with blood. She had apparently stepped on glass and \n     hadn't even felt the cut because she was too high on pain \n     pills. This is something no one, especially an innocent 10-\n     year-old, should have to deal with.\n       My 12th birthday was the worst birthday of my entire life. \n     I was supposed to have a pool party, but my mom did not show \n     up to pay for it, so my 16-year-old sister had to step in. \n     There was no food or drinks because my mom was supposed to \n     handle all of that for me. When she finally showed up at the \n     end of my party, equipped with her unbelievable excuses, her \n     eyes were bloodshot and rolling around in her head. I was \n     hurt, but I was mostly embarrassed that people felt so sorry \n     for me. Everyone knew my mom was a drug addict and everyone \n     always pitied my sister and me for the life we had to live. \n     Yet again, my mother chose her beloved high over me.\n       My mom's battle with drug addiction did not stop there. She \n     went on to rehab again and jail several more times. When she \n     wasn't home, I would search her room and find Xanax, Lortab, \n     Oxycodone, and many other unknown pills. Nearby, I would \n     always find cut up straws or even parts of a tampon \n     applicator. She was creative, to say the least. When I was in \n     9th grade, my mom went to jail for stealing. She would get \n     super high and then go into stores and steal ridiculous \n     things like hair scrunchies, makeup, and whatever else she \n     could get her hands on. I didn't know she was going to jail \n     until two days before she left. She had been depressed and in \n     her bed sick (probably going through withdrawal) for several \n     days. She finally told me that she would be going to jail the \n     day after Christmas. Once again, I would be without a mom. \n     She was in jail the remainder of my 9th grade year until the \n     end of my 10th grade year. I don't know how I passed the 9th \n     grade. I failed almost every class except English and I would \n     have failed that one too if it hadn't been for such an \n     amazing teacher who helped me overcome so much.\n       My mom went to jail for stealing again while I was in \n     college, and my ex boyfriend had to bail her out of jail. I \n     had a baby via C-Section less than a year ago. My mom and I \n     were starting to have a relationship for the first time in my \n     entire life, but drug addiction would soon ruin it for the \n     millionth time. I was given pain medicine after having my \n     baby and I was terrified to take it because of what I have \n     lived through. I only took it when I absolutely had to, but I \n     was in so much pain. My mom had just been to visit and I \n     never thought to move my pain medication because it was in my \n     bedroom out of sight. The next day I was lying in bed with my \n     two week old baby and I was having terrible pains due to my \n     incision. I reached to the end of the table for my pain \n     medicine. When I opened the bottle, there was only one pill \n     left. I had 8 pills when my mother came to visit and she took \n     7. My mom finally admitted to stealing my medicine and I \n     refused to talk to her for months.\n       In November, I received a phone call from my sister telling \n     me the neighbor called and my mom was having a heart attack. \n     When the paramedics arrived they couldn't find a pulse or a \n     temperature. They flew her to the closest town and they had \n     to shock her because her heart stopped. They found narcotics \n     in her system and I will forever believe that years of using \n     drugs is the reason for her heart attack. She spent a month \n     in the hospital. I believe she may be drug free now, but I \n     will never fully trust her. I can't. Each time I call and she \n     doesn't answer, I picture her high somewhere stumbling \n     around.\n       I could give endless anecdotes and examples of how drug \n     addiction ruined my life, but I don't think I can ever \n     adequately describe what prescription drugs robbed me of. The \n     only thing worse than not having a mother at all is having a \n     mother who chooses drugs over you. Something needs to be done \n     in West Virginia, where the prescription drug abuse is only \n     going to get worse. All addicts have to do is go to a pain \n     clinic and fool the doctors to receive medication. I know too \n     many people who have easy access to drugs because of corrupt \n     doctors in the area and because the pain clinics are not \n     effective. I can only pray the problem is addressed and that \n     my son doesn't have to grow up in an area so overtaken by \n     drug abuse.\n       Sincerely, a drug addict's daughter.\n\n  I know the Presiding Officer has received these same letters, these \nsame circumstances we live with every day. If someone doesn't rise up \nand say ``Enough is enough; we have to stop this abuse,'' it is going \nto be an epidemic that is going to ruin this country.\n  I go to schools and tell them, there is not another country in the \nworld that believes they can take on the United States of America \nmilitarily or economically. We are the greatest Nation. We are the hope \nof the world. Guess what. They don't believe they have to. They are \ngoing to sit back and watch. If we don't have education and we don't \nhave skill sets because of a lack of education attainment, and if we \nare addicted, if we don't have a clean society, we are not going to be \nable to be the superpower.\n  We can't let this generation down. We can't let it fail. I will be \ncoming here every chance I get to read letters from West Virginians to \nlet my colleagues know the epidemic that is going on, the ravaging that \nis happening in my State and taking away precious lives, whether \ndirectly or indirectly, through a child or a parent.\n  I am hoping we can all change the FDA's direction, that we can get \nsomebody in there that will change the culture of the FDA that will \nprotect us and fight for us and not for the business plan of \npharmaceuticals.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor to my good friend from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the bill before \nus.\n  Energy and mineral development has been one of the central pillars of \nthe Nevada economy, even before it joined the Union. The discovery of \nthe Comstock Lode transformed the State as miners rushed in and boom \ntowns like Virginia City and Austin were born.\n  Today we are a world leader in mineral production while being at the \nforefront of national efforts to implement a 21st century ``all of the \nabove'' energy strategy. The Silver State produces over 80 percent of \nthe gold and nearly 25 percent of the silver mined domestically. Mining \ncontributes more than 13,500 jobs in Nevada alone, adding $6.4 billion \nfor our State's gross domestic product annually.\n  Nevada's renewable energy resources are among the best our Nation has \nto offer. Over 2,300 megawatts of renewable energy projects have come \nonline, roughly enough electricity to power over 4.6 million homes. In \ntotal, more than 23 percent of the State's total electricity generation \ncomes from renewables.\n  Our State is not only leading the way on clean energy production, it \nis a hot bed for the research and development on energy efficiency and \nother alternative technologies that are critical to our Nation's energy \nfuture. Tesla's development of its battery gigafactory at the Tahoe \nReno Industrial Center and Faraday Future's recent announcement to \nbuild its automotive manufacturing facility in North Las Vegas ensure \nthat our State will be at the forefront of energy storage technologies \nand electric vehicles for years to come.\n  Energy is not only one of Nevada's but, overall, one of our Nation's \ngreatest assets. But Congress has not enacted comprehensive energy \nlegislation in a decade, so it is time to reform Federal policies to \nreflect the energy and natural resource challenges of the 21st century.\n\n[[Page S558]]\n\n  I commend the majority leader and the chairman of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee who have made energy policy modernization a \nfocus for the 114th Congress. In our first week, we advanced the \nKeystone XL Pipeline legislation and energy efficiency legislation. In \nthe final days of 2015, we enacted a tax deal which included important \npolicies I fought for and which facilitated renewable energy production \nwhile lifting the crude oil export ban. And this week we are focusing \non a bipartisan Energy Policy Modernization Act.\n  I appreciate the hard work of the bill managers, Energy and Natural \nResources Committee Chairman Murkowski and Ranking Member Cantwell, who \nhave put the time in to bring this proposal to the Senate floor. My \ncolleagues all have a wide range of ideas on energy and environmental \npolicy, and often these debates can become bitterly partisan. So both \nSenators should be commended for approving a bill out of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee by a bipartisan vote of 18 to 4.\n  In the committee process, I worked with both Senators to incorporate \na couple of my stand-alone bills focused on streamlining mine \npermitting and the exploration of geothermal resources, the Public Land \nJob Creation Act, S. 113, and the Geothermal Exploration Opportunities \nAct, S. 562, into this bill. I thank them for that, and I hope to \ncontinue to process amendments that modernize Federal energy policy.\n  I have filed a variety of amendments aimed at spurring innovation, \nboosting job creation, increasing domestic energy and mineral \nproduction, and rolling back some of these burdensome regulations. One \nhas already passed the Senate, and I hope the others will be included \nas well.\n  I have put forth two bipartisan proposals with my colleague from \nRhode Island, Senator Jack Reed, focused on energy storage. \nTechnological developments in energy storage have the potential to be a \ngame changer for the electric grid, benefiting the reliability and \nefficiency of the overall system. Our first amendment simply adds \nenergy storage systems to a list of strategies that States should \nconsider in an effort to promote energy conservation and promote \ngreater use of domestic energy. The second, which passed the Senate by \nvoice vote on Monday night, enhances the Department of Energy's ability \nto use existing research dollars to develop state of the art technology \nthat can make our electricity grid faster and much more reliable. \nEnergy storage will play an important role in our Nation's long-term \nenergy strategy.\n  My Public Lands Renewable Energy Development amendment, which I filed \nalong with Senators Heinrich, Gardner, Risch, Tester, Wyden, Udall, and \nBennet, is an initiative I have been working on for many years. It \nrecognizes that in our Western States, there are millions of acres of \npublic lands suitable for the development of renewable energy projects, \nbut uncertainty in the permitting process impedes or delays our ability \nto harness their potential. In a State like Nevada, where over 85 \npercent of our land is controlled by Federal landlords, improving this \npermitting process is vitally essential.\n  Our amendment does just that. It streamlines and improves the \npermitting process for utility-scale geothermal, wind, and solar energy \non Federal lands so that the West can continue to lead the Nation in \nclean energy production.\n  To advance this amendment, Senator Heinrich and I had to drop one of \nthe important components of the proposal--provisions that would \nrepurpose revenues generated by these projects to ensure our local \ncommunities benefit and to support conservation projects that increase \noutdoor recreation activities such as hunting, fishing, and hiking.\n  In the West, where Federal lands are not taxable and outdoor \nrecreation is an important part of our way of life, these provisions \nare vital, and I hope we can find a path forward for this concept in \nthe near future.\n  While recent developments on battery storage, renewable energy \nproduction, and alternative fuel vehicles is exciting, I want to remind \nmy colleagues that without a domestic supply of critical minerals like \ngold, silver, copper, and lithium, they all would not be possible. Far \ntoo often we take for granted that we need these important resources to \nmanufacture those technologies and devices that are now part of our \neveryday lives, such as our smartphones, our computers, and our \ntablets.\n  I have worked with Chairman Murkowski and others on comprehensive \nmining legislation over the past few years, and I believe it is key to \nour economy and our Nation's security that those policies are part of \nthis comprehensive package. I appreciate that our American Mineral \nSecurity Act is one of the titles of the bill that is now before the \nSenate.\n  One of the biggest issues facing domestic mining--not just mining but \nall natural resource development--is overly burdensome regulations. If \nour Nation is truly going to capitalize on our domestic production \npotential, we need to rein in the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  Outside of the IRS, the two Federal agencies that draw the most ire \nfrom my constituents are the EPA and the BLM. Under this \nadministration, the EPA is continuing down a path of destroying the \nbalance between appropriate environmental oversight and overreaching \nregulations that lead to further economic gridlock. That is why I put \nforth an amendment that would block the EPA from finalizing one of \ntheir biggest attacks on domestic resources production, a rule to \nimpose new financial assurance fees.\n  If implemented, these requirements would further deincentivize \ncapital investment in the domestic mining industry. New Federal \nrequirements would be duplicative of financial assurance programs \nalready in place at both the State and Federal level.\n  The EPA has made it clear that their push on hard rock mining is the \nfirst of many of its plans to develop on various natural resources \nindustries, such as chemicals, coal, oil, and gas development. My \namendment would prohibit the EPA from developing, proposing, \nfinalizing, implementing, enforcing or administering new financial \nassurance regulations on natural resources development.\n  I have also teamed up with my friend and colleague, Environment and \nPublic Works Committee Chairman Jim Inhofe, on my EPA accountability \namendment. This amendment mirrors a bill that I introduced in the first \nweeks of this Congress and was adopted by voice vote as part of the \nHouse Energy bill--the North American Energy Security and \nInfrastructure Act.\n  The EPA often ignores longstanding statutes that require them to \nimprove their own regulatory coordination, planning, and review. Simply \nput, my amendment asks the EPA to abide by its own rules. Without \noversight, the EPA has the authority to issue unprecedented regulations \nthat could wreak havoc on our energy policy and prices. Energy costs \nseep into every aspect of American life, and it is past time we stopped \nthe EPA in its tracks.\n  Again, I want to thank Leader McConnell. I want to thank Chairman \nMurkowski and Ranking Member Cantwell for working with me on my \ncomprehensive Energy bill policies. I hope we can take up these \namendments and have them included in the final version of the bill, \nwhich I am confident will pass the Senate. These commonsense \ninitiatives will go a long way toward ensuring an affordable, secure, \nand reliable energy supply for our country.\n  Mr. President, thank you, and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n             Unanimous Consent Requests--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take this time as the ranking Democrat \non the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to bring to the attention of \nmy colleagues the number of nominees in important foreign policy areas \nthat have been acted on by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee but \nhave not been acted on by the floor of the Senate.\n\n[[Page S559]]\n\n  There are currently 15 nominees that have been recommended favorably \nby the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and in most of these cases, \nthey were unanimous votes in the Committee. I am confident to say that \nin each of these cases there has been no question raised as to the \nqualifications of the individuals to fill these particular positions. \nWe are talking about senior members of the State Department diplomatic \nteam. We are talking about Ambassadors in countries around the world. \nWe are talking about people who have extremely important positions with \nregard to our national security. These positions are critically \nimportant to our country, and they have remained vacant in some cases \nfor over a year. It has been a long period of time that we have not \nacted on these nominations.\n  The reason we have not acted on these nominations, quite frankly, is \nbecause there is a Member in the Senate, or more than one Member of the \nSenate, who has put what is known as a hold on these nominations. What \nthat means is that a Senator has indicated that he or she is going to \nobject to the consideration of the nomination on the floor. That is \nnormally done in order to get a little bit of attention on an issue, \nand it is my understanding that in each of these cases, these holds \nhave nothing to do with the qualifications of the person for the \nposition to be filled, but it is to give the Member an opportunity to \nget some help on other issues or to raise other concerns.\n  Here is the problem. In some cases these holds have been in place for \nover a year. In some cases we are talking about several months that a \nposition has gone unfilled because of the hold.\n  How can we overcome that? We can overcome that by a Senator releasing \nthe hold, allowing a nomination to come to the floor for a vote. In \nmany cases, I expect, it will be by unanimous consent, since there has \nbeen no objection raised, and we can move forward with the nomination.\n  Quite frankly, it is the majority leader--the Republican leader--who \ncontrols the agenda of the floor of the Senate. The majority leader can \nmove to executive session, file a cloture motion, and if 60 Members of \nthe Senate want to move forward with the nomination--and I expect that \nin each one of these cases we are probably talking about almost \nunanimous votes in the Senate for these nominations--we would pass a \ncloture motion. After the hours have passed, we would have an up-or-\ndown vote on the nomination.\n  If the majority leader were to announce that we would have a cloture \nvote on a Thursday or Friday and we would stay in over a weekend in \norder to finish a nomination, which is typically the case here, we \nwould get it resolved before we left for the weekend. As you know, we \nhave been completing our work on a Thursday. There is plenty of \nopportunity to take up nominations. We have extensive periods of time \nthat we are in State work periods. There are plenty of opportunities \nfor us to take up nominations on the floor for votes. All we need to do \nis say: Look, by this date certain, if we don't have your answers, we \nare going to a cloture vote. It would certainly move a lot of these \nnominations.\n  This Senator thinks it is unacceptable that 15 of our positions right \nnow are going unfilled because of holds by Members of Congress. I think \nwe have a responsibility to act. I am talking about positions on OPEC. \nI am talking about the IMF. I am talking about Ambassadors to the \nBahamas, Trinidad and Tobago, Mexico, Norway, and Sweden. I am talking \nabout the U.S. representative to the IAEA. I am talking about the Under \nSecretary of State. I am talking about Ambassadors to Luxembourg and \nBurma. There is a whole list of nominations that have gone unfilled.\n  What does this mean for our country? Well, if you don't have the \nUnder Secretary of State for Political Affairs--that is the No. 4 \nperson in the State Department. That is the person directly responsible \nfor all the regional bureaus--for Europe, the Middle East, East Asia \nand the Pacific, for our hemisphere, for Africa. We don't have the \nprincipal person in the State Department confirmed for those regional \nconcerns. That is a national security risk by not having a confirmed \nperson for Under Secretary of State.\n  My colleagues are quick to be critical if they don't believe the \nadministration is responding quickly enough to certain concerns. For us \nnot to respond for months on critical positions, to me, is compromising \nour national security.\n  But it goes beyond that. In bilateral relationships with countries, \nthe fact that they don't have a confirmed ambassador speaks volumes to \nthat country's belief as to how important we think that relationship \nis.\n  So if we are talking about a U.S. businessperson from South Carolina \nor Maryland who is trying to do business in Trinidad and Tobago and \nthere is no confirmed ambassador, that person is at a disadvantage by \nnot having a confirmed ambassador in that situation. If we are talking \nabout a family member who is trying to deal with a family issue in \nNorway and we don't have a confirmed ambassador, that makes it more \ndifficult for us to be able to represent our constituents because our \nNo. 1 person, our head of mission, has not been confirmed. So it \naffects our ability to strengthen bilateral relations, it affects our \nnational security, and it is absolutely wrong.\n  I want to make one thing clear. It is an honor to serve on the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, and it is an honor to be the ranking \nDemocrat. Senator Corker, the chairman of that committee, and I work \nvery closely together. I am proud of the record of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee under Senator Corker's leadership. We have reported \nout these nominations in a timely manner. We have gathered information \nabout the person's qualifications. We have questioned the person. We \nhave gone through the confirmation process to make sure this body \ncarries out its constitutional responsibility to approve Executive \nnominations. We take our work very seriously, but we do it in a timely \nway. We act in a timely way. Senator Corker was responsible for these \nnominations getting out of the committee promptly, but until the Senate \nacts, the person can't take on the responsibility.\n  Now it is the responsibility of the Senate. That is why I call upon \nmy colleagues who have made objections to withdraw those objections. \nThey have been there for months. Let's move forward. If they don't, I \nwould ask that the majority leader give us time for a cloture vote or \nat least announce a cloture vote. If we did that, I would think these \nnominations would comfortably move forward.\n  Some of my colleagues are on the floor, and they are going to talk \nabout specific nominees. I will yield to them shortly, but if I might, \nI am going to raise 2 of the 15 today. I will do others at other \npoints, but I am going to talk about two of the nominees and I could \ntalk about a lot more.\n  I want to talk about Tom Shannon for Under Secretary of State for \nPolitical Affairs. I want to tell the American people more about the \nqualifications of Ambassador Tom Shannon and the important post for \nwhich he has been nominated.\n  The Under Secretary for Political Affairs is the State Department's \nfourth-ranking official, responsible for the management of the six \nregional bureaus of the Department as well as the Bureau of \nInternational Organization Affairs. This is a tremendously important \nleadership post on key national security issues.\n  Ambassador Tom Shannon, a career member of the diplomatic corps--he \nis a career diplomat, serving under both Democratic and Republican \nadministrations--is held in universal respect and esteem by his \ncolleagues and has been nominated to this position. He is strongly \nsupported by both Democrats and Republicans on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee.\n  I have twice spoken on the floor to ask for unanimous consent for \nAmbassador Shannon, and I am proud to again ask for his confirmation \nbecause few diplomats have served our Nation under both Republican and \nDemocratic administrations with as much integrity and ability as \nAmbassador Shannon.\n  In his current role as Counselor with the Department, he provides the \nSecretary with his insight and advice on a wide range of issues. His \nprevious service is formidable. He was our Ambassador to Brazil, was \nAssistant Secretary of State and Senior Director on the National \nSecurity Council staff for Western Hemisphere Affairs, and also\n\n[[Page S560]]\n\nserved in challenging posts in Venezuela and South Africa, among \nothers. He is a career diplomat, giving his life to the Foreign \nService. As I said, he has served different Presidents for over 30 \nyears. He should be confirmed today.\n  Mr. Shannon has been waiting on the floor of the Senate for \nconfirmation for 125 days.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session to consider the following nomination: Calendar No. \n375, which is Thomas A. Shannon, Jr.; that the Senate proceed to vote \nwithout intervening action or debate on the nomination; that if \nconfirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon \nthe table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, on behalf of the junior Senator from Texas, I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, let me now bring to the Chair's attention \nJohn Estrada to be our Ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago. John Estrada \nhas been waiting for confirmation on floor of the Senate for 217 days.\n  The Republic of Trinidad and Tobago in the Caribbean has been used as \na way station for drug smugglers who are shipping their products to the \nUnited States, which has caused steadily increasing violence and drug \nactivity. We all talk about the War on Drugs. We need a confirmed \nambassador if we are going to have all hands on deck in our campaign to \nkeep America safe. In 2015, the State Department gave the island nation \nthe crime rating of ``critical.''\n  We need an American of impeccable standing who commands wide respect \nboth here and in the United States and in Trinidad and Tobago itself to \neffectively represent our interests there. We are very fortunate that \nthe President has nominated John Estrada, a leading business executive \nand a former 15th sergeant major of the Marine Corps.\n  Mr. Estrada has a compelling American story. He was born in Trinidad \nand Tobago and immigrated to the United States when he was only 12 \nyears of age. Mr. Estrada served in the U.S. Marine Corps for 34 years. \nIn 2003 he was made sergeant major of the Marine Corps. I want to make \nsure my colleagues understand just what an honor that is. It is the \nninth highest enlisted rank in the Marine Corps. The sergeant major is \nthe senior enlisted adviser to the Commandant of the Marine Corps and a \nsingular honor. Only one marine is chosen every 4 years to serve as \nsergeant major. For Mr. Estrada to be chosen as the 15th sergeant major \nof the Marine Corps is a testament to the degree of trust and \nconfidence the Marine Corps has in his abilities and skills. Mr. \nEstrada truly exemplifies the Corps' bedrock values of honor, \ncommitment, and courage.\n  While such virtues are their own rewards, Mr. Estrada's achievements \nhave been repeatedly recognized over the course of his military \nservice. He received the Distinguished Service Medal in 2007, the \nBronze Star Medal in 2003, and the Meritorious Service Medal in 1998, \n2000, 2001, and 2003. There are over 50 more honors he earned that I \ncould tell my colleagues about.\n  The qualification of this highly accomplished nominee remains \nunchallenged, nor has any objection been advanced due to his experience \nfor the post he is to take. He has twice been favorably reported from \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee by unanimous support. I have \nexpressed my disappointment and confusion as to why we have not moved \nforward with Mr. Estrada.\n  We all speak whenever we can to say thank you to the men and women \nwho have worn the uniform of this country to preserve the freedom of \nAmerica. Here is an individual who has devoted his entire life to \ndefending America, his entire life to defending our country. He has \naccomplished extraordinary results as a member of the Armed Forces and \nnow is prepared to serve our country in a very difficult position where \nlaw enforcement is desperately needed. It is for that reason that I \nwould hope that after 217 days, my colleagues would be prepared to vote \non this nominee.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session to consider the following nomination: Calendar No. \n329, John L. Estrada to be Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary \nof the United States of America to the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago; \nthat the Senate proceed to vote without intervening action or debate on \nthe nomination; that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, on behalf of the junior Senator from Texas, I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I acknowledge that Senator Klobuchar is on \nthe floor. I know she has nominations that she wants to bring to the \nattention of our colleagues. I thank Senator Klobuchar for being on the \nfloor. She has been very much involved in our nominees, particularly \nfor Norway but also Sweden. I thank her for her leadership in bringing \nthese nominations to the attention of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee and for the work she has done to advance these nominations. \nShe has been steadfast in the need for us to act on these nominations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I thank Senator Cardin and Senator \nCorker for their leadership and their bipartisan work to get these \nnominees through the Senate, as well as Senator McConnell and Senator \nReid, who have been supportive of getting this done.\n  In fact, both of the nominees I am going to talk about for the \nimportant allies of Norway and Sweden may be a little bit of a surprise \nto everyone in the Chamber. The 11th and 12th biggest investors in the \nUnited States of America come from companies in Norway and Sweden, \nwhich are two of our biggest allies.\n  What is going on here? Well, this is actually the third time I have \ncome to the floor this year urging Senator Cruz to remove his hold on \nthese two nominees so that the Senate can move forward and fill these \ntwo vital diplomatic vacancies. Various reasons have been raised by \nhim, both to colleagues and then publically.\n  I was hopeful. I know negotiations are going on, so I always give \nroom for that. But this is not related to these two countries or these \ntwo people. I think that is important to remember. Often, our fights \nare about a particular post because of the post or a particular \nnominee. That is not what this is, so I am hopeful that this gives us \nmore room to negotiate.\n  So what is going on here? Well, Norway has been without a confirmed \nambassador for 859 days. There was an original nominee who did not work \nout, was withdrawn by the administration. Then this new nominee was put \nin and went through the committee without a problem, unlike the first \nnominee. It still remains that when you are in Norway--and a lot of \nNorwegians know about this--you haven't had an Ambassador from the \nUnited States of America for 859 days. You have ambassadors from \nRussia, China, but not from the United States of America. In the case \nof Sweden, it has been 468 days since the President nominated Azita \nRaji to be ambassador--again, someone who came through our committee \nwithout controversy. It is past time to get these nominees confirmed.\n  We need a U.S. Ambassador in Norway who is deeply committed to \nstrengthening the relationship between our two countries. Sam Heins is \nour nominee. He is from Minnesota. He is the right person for the job, \nin addition to being an accomplished lawyer. He has demonstrated his \ndevotion to leadership in the cause of advancing human rights. He \nfounded, organized, and served as the first board chair of the \nAdvocates for Human Rights, which responds to human rights abuses \nthroughout the world. Obviously, this is something Norway cares a lot \nabout, so he is a good fit for this country, not to mention that he is \nfrom Minnesota, the home of 1.5 million people of Norwegian descent, \nmore than any other place in the world next to Norway.\n  Now we go to Sweden. Azita Raji is also an incredibly qualified \nnominee. She is a philanthropist, a community\n\n[[Page S561]]\n\nleader, and a former business leader. She served as a member of the \nPresident's Commission on White House Fellowships, director of the \nNational Partnership for Women and Families, and a member of the \nBretton Woods Committee, an organization that supports international \nfinance institutions.\n  These are qualified nominees, but you don't have to take my word for \nit. Here is what Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican colleague of the \nPresiding Officer's, said about Sam Heins and Azita Raji:\n\n       I believe both [nominees] are qualified . . . and we have \n     significant interests in Scandinavia. My hope is that both \n     nominees receive a vote in the Senate sooner rather than \n     later.\n\n  He said this in part because for a while he had a hold. He resolved \nthose issues. Senator Cotton has said he thinks these two nominees are \nno problem. As we know, the other Republicans on this committee have \nnot raised any objections. They are right. We have significant \ninterests in Scandinavia, and leaving these key positions vacant is a \nslap in the face to Sweden and Norway, which are two of our best \neconomic and military allies.\n  In a December New York Times op-ed, former Vice President Walter \nMondale--himself of Norwegian descent--highlighted the U.S. national \nsecurity interest in confirming these nominees, saying: ``[I]n a time \nof dangerous international crises, we need to work with friends and \nallies, using all the tools of diplomacy.'' Vice President Mondale \nunderstands that now is not the time to forsake a 200-year-old \ndiplomatic relationship.\n  Norway and Sweden share a vital security partnership. Norway is one \nof our country's strongest and most dependable international allies, a \nfounding member of the NATO alliance, and its military works with the \nUnited States. This is key to my colleagues who care about the \naggression of Russia.\n  Norway works with us in standing up to Russia's provocations in the \nUkraine and in countering ISIS, the spread of violence, and Islamic \nextremism. May I say that Norway actually has a portion of its border \nthat it shares with Russia.\n  Norway is also playing an important role in addressing the Syrian \nrefugee crisis. It expects to take in as many as 25,000 refugees this \nyear. It has already provided more than $6 million to Greece to help \nrespond to the influx of refugees seeking a way to enter Europe.\n  I would also add from a military standpoint that Norway recently \npurchased 22 more fighter planes--22 more fighter planes, bringing \ntheir total to over 50--from Lockheed Martin, based in Senator Cruz's \ndistrict in Fort Worth. That is where these planes are being built, and \nthey are worth nearly $200 million apiece. That is what Norway is \ninvesting in the United States. They deserve an ambassador.\n  Sweden, like Norway, plays an important role in our national \nsecurity. Sweden is a strong partner in our fight against ISIS, in our \nattempts to curb North Korea's nuclear program, in supporting Ukraine \nagainst Russian aggression, and in promoting global democracy and human \nrights.\n  Sweden is also on the front lines of the Syrian refugee crisis. More \nthan 1,200 refugees seek asylum in Sweden every day, and Sweden accepts \nmore refugees per capita than any other country in the EU.\n  All of us on both sides of the aisle have talked about the importance \nof a strong Europe during this very difficult time. Yet every other \nmajor nation in Europe has an ambassador except for Sweden and Norway.\n  So I ask my friends and colleagues on the other side who are not \nobstructing these nominations to help us work this out with Senator \nCruz because this has gone on for far too long. This isn't a joke. \nThese are two major allies.\n  We also have economic relationships. As I mentioned, Norway \nrepresented the fifth fastest growing source of foreign direct \ninvestment in the United States between 2009 and 2013--that is in the \nworld--and is the 12th largest source of foreign direct investment in \nthe United States overall. Maybe they are too quiet about it and people \ndon't realize it. We would never think of blocking an ambassador to \nEngland or to France, but right now the ambassadors to these two \ncountries are being blocked.\n  There are over 300 American companies with a presence in Norway. By \nnot having an ambassador in Norway, we are sending a message to one of \nthe top investors in the country: Sorry, you are not important enough \nto us to have an ambassador in your country. But all the other major \nnations have an ambassador. In October, as I mentioned, they reiterated \ntheir commitment by buying all those fighter planes from the State of \nTexas, from Lockheed Martin.\n  Norwegian Defense Minister Espen Barth Eide said Norway's F-35 \npurchase marks ``the largest public procurement in Norwegian history.'' \nIt has been 30 years since Norway ordered new combat planes, and \ninstead of choosing a European manufacturer, whom did they choose? They \nchose a manufacturer in the United States, right in Texas. Do you think \nthose other European countries don't have Ambassadors in Norway? They \ndo. I hope Senator Cruz and his friends are listening to this right now \nbecause they chose to buy those planes from the United States, right \nfrom his home State of Texas.\n  Sweden, like Norway, is also one of the biggest investors in the \nUnited States. Sweden is the 11th largest direct investor in the United \nStates. Swedish foreign direct investment in the United States amounts \nto roughly $56 billion and creates nearly 330,700 U.S. jobs. The United \nStates is Sweden's fourth largest export market, with Swedish exports \nvalued at an estimated $10.2 billion. Sweden, like Norway, deserves an \nambassador.\n  Scandinavian Americans are understandably frustrated by the fact that \nSenator Cruz is obstructing these nominees. As the Senator from a State \nthat is home to more Swedish Americans and Norwegian Americans than any \nother State, I know it because I hear it every day. I hear it from \npeople across the country, and most importantly, I hear it from the \nForeign Minister and others in countries who are waiting to get an \nambassador.\n  So, again, we have an ambassador in France, we have one in England, \nand we have one in Germany. We have an ambassador in nearly every \nEuropean nation but not in these two key Scandinavian countries.\n  There is really no doubt about the important relationship between our \ncountry and Norway and Sweden. We need to confirm Sam Heins and Azita \nRaji immediately.\n  I do appreciate the support of nearly every Republican Senator for \nthese nominees, the support of the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, Senator Corker, the great leadership of Senator Cardin, the \nleadership of Senator Reid and Senator McConnell on these issues, and \nthe leadership of my colleague Senator Franken whom we will hear from \nshortly. It is time to get these done.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session \nto consider the following nomination: Calendar No. 263; that the Senate \nproceed to vote without intervening action or debate on the nomination; \nthat if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid \nupon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, on behalf of the junior Senator from Texas, I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I note that Senator Lee, as I assume he did with the \nother objections, was making this objection on behalf of Senator Cruz \nand that, secondly, that was the Ambassador to Norway whom I asked \nconsent for.\n  I now ask unanimous consent for the Ambassador to Sweden.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session \nto consider the following nomination: Calendar No. 148; that the Senate \nproceed to vote without intervening action or debate on the nomination; \nthat if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid \nupon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, on behalf of the junior Senator from Texas, I \nobject.\n\n[[Page S562]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I believe we will now hear from Senator Franken, my \ncolleague from the State of Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, that is too bad. There is no one else in \nthis body who believes that Sam Heins shouldn't be Ambassador to Norway \nor that we shouldn't be sending an ambassador to Norway, and/or that \nAzita Raji wouldn't be perfect to be Ambassador to Sweden. This is \nreally a shame. It is another sad moment, frankly.\n  Let me talk a little bit about Sam Heins. Sam is from Minnesota, home \nof more Norwegian Americans than any other State. I think we have more \nSwedish Americans, as well, than any other State. Norway is an \nimportant NATO ally, as Senator Klobuchar so ably put it. We coordinate \non important security issues. We have important collaborations in \nMinnesota among our universities and in the private sector in this \ncountry on research projects, renewable energy, health care, and other \nareas.\n  Confirming an ambassador to Norway--especially such a highly \nqualified ambassador--is especially important to the people in my \nState. More than 20 percent of Minnesotans trace their ancestry to \nNorway. There are more Norwegian Americans living in Minnesota than any \nother State.\n  Sam Heins is a very distinguished Minnesotan who has worked on behalf \nof women's rights, human rights, and victims of torture. We have a \ncenter in Minnesota for victims of torture. It is a shining example of \nour State and of our country.\n  Sam has been nominated to serve as our next Ambassador to Norway. He \nis being blocked, unfortunately, for reasons that are totally unrelated \nto his qualifications. I believe that blocking this nominee from \nconfirmation is completely irresponsible. As I said, Norway is an \nimportant ally, and it is in our mutual interests to have an ambassador \nto Norway who represents the United States. I hope the next time we do \nthis, we can get unanimous consent.\n  This is unfortunate, and I think it has not been done in a way that \nis consistent with the protocol of the Senate in terms of Senators \ncreating conditions for the lift of a hold and then changing what that \nposition is. I think that is too bad.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am here to join my colleagues because \nI share the concerns they have expressed so eloquently about the \nfailure of this body to act on the nominees whom they have been talking \nabout. But the other nominees, particularly the 27 national security \nnominees who are pending on the floor of the Senate--these nominees are \nnot being held up due to concerns about their qualifications or their \nexperience. As my colleagues have said, they are being held up for \npolitical reasons--political reasons that are often wholly unrelated to \nthe nominee, and in most cases they are being held up by just one \nMember of this body.\n  I find it particularly ironic that, in many cases, they are being \nheld up by a Member of this body who is out on the campaign trail, \ncampaigning for President. He is not here dealing with the work of this \ncountry and not here fighting to address the national security of this \ncountry by making sure that we confirm these nominees. So I am \ndisappointed that, once again, we see my colleague from Utah here on \nhis behalf to object to our efforts to move forward with these \nunanimous consent requests for Tom Shannon, John Estrada, Azita Raji, \nand Samuel Heins.\n  As Senator Cardin noted, I want to begin with Ambassador Shannon, \nbecause Ambassador Shannon would fill one of the most senior positions \nat the State Department as the Under Secretary for Political Affairs. \nHe would be responsible for working with the Europeans on \nimplementation of the Iran agreement, on coordinating the G-7 to combat \nRussian aggression, as well as providing daily oversight and direction \nto all of the Department's regional bureaus.\n  We had a hearing this morning before the Foreign Relations Committee, \ntalking about the strains on the European Union and the implications \nfor American foreign policy. One of the things our witnesses who were \ntestifying on behalf of the majority and the minority discussed was the \nchallenges we are facing from Russian aggression. I am sure we all \nappreciate that in this body. The fact that we are holding up \nAmbassador Shannon, who would be responsible for coordinating the G-7 \nresponse to Russian aggression, is just hard to fathom. I don't get it. \nI don't understand why anybody in this body would want to hold up the \nappointment of one of the key leaders of the team to fight Russian \naggression.\n  Ambassador Shannon is clearly qualified for the job. He is a career \nForeign Service officer. He has served with distinction in five \nadministrations--two Democratic and three Republican. He was nominated \nfor this position in September. He had his confirmation hearing in \nOctober. He was unanimously approved by the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, and now he has been waiting 98 days for the full Senate to \nact on his nomination.\n  There isn't much I can add to the outrage and eloquence of my \ncolleagues from Minnesota, Senator Klobuchar and Senator Franken, who \ntalked about their frustration at the holdup in confirming Azita Raji, \nwho has been waiting 398 days--over a year--to be Ambassador to \nSweden; Samuel Heins, who has been waiting 265 days to be Ambassador to \nNorway.\n\n  Again, I would go back and point to the hearing we had this morning \nbefore the Foreign Relations Committee, where one of the issues that \nour witnesses testified to was the importance of working with our \nScandinavian allies as we look to combat Russian aggression. Here we \nare. And I said: So, what does it mean to Sweden and Norway that we \nhave been holding up the nominees to be Ambassadors to those two \ncountries--one for over a year and one for almost a year? And they \nsaid: It sends a very bad message to Europe, at a time when Europe is \nchallenged, that we don't care what is going on in Sweden and Norway.\n  In 1914, Norway, a NATO ally, scrambled their F-16 fighters 74 times \nto intercept Russian warplanes. They are there on the frontlines \nhelping to fight Russian aggression. Where are we in the Senate? We \ncan't even confirm the Ambassador to Norway because we have one person \nin this body who doesn't care enough about the national security of \nthis country to be here to help make sure this person gets confirmed. \nThat is not acceptable.\n  I also want to talk about two other nominees whose qualifications are \nunquestioned. Yet they remain unconfirmed. Brian Egan is the \nPresident's nominee to be a principal advisor to the State Department \nand the Secretary of State on all legal issues, domestic and \ninternational. This role includes assisting in the formulation and \nimplementation of the foreign policies of the United States and \npromoting the development of law and institutions as elements of those \npolicies. It is something that is very important, especially as we look \nat some of the countries that are being threatened now by Russian \naggression--Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova.\n  Mr. Egan's qualifications to hold this position are clear. He began \nhis career as a civil servant and government lawyer in the office of \nSecretary of State Condoleezza Rice. He subsequently worked at \nTreasury, at the National Security Council, and as a Deputy Assistant \nto the President.\n  He was nominated more than a year ago--384 days to be exact. He was \nunanimously approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in June. \nYet he is still in this ``hold'' position because of one or two \nindividuals in this body for reasons unrelated to his qualifications.\n  Mr. President, at this time I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination: \nCalendar No. 204, Brian James Egan to be Legal Advisor of the \nDepartment of State; that the Senate proceed to vote without \nintervening action or debate on the nomination; that if confirmed, the \nmotion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, on behalf of the junior Senator from Texas, I \nobject.\n\n[[Page S563]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Again, that is disappointing. Again, it is unfortunate \nthat somebody who has served so honorably in both Republican and \nDemocratic administrations is being held up for reasons totally \nunrelated to his qualifications and to the job he would do at the \nDepartment of State.\n\n\n           Unanimous Consent Request--Presidential Nomination\n\n  I know that many Republicans in this body are as outraged as we are \nabout the holdup. I hope they will act with us to move these nominees. \nOne of those people is still being held up, this time by the Banking \nCommittee, which has refused to schedule a vote on the nomination of \nAdam Szubin to be the Treasury Department's Under Secretary for \nTerrorism and Financial Crimes. This position leads to policy, \nenforcement, regulatory, and intelligence functions of the Treasury \nDepartment aimed at identifying and disrupting the lines of financial \nsupport to international terrorist organizations, proliferators of \nweapons of mass destruction, narcotics traffickers, and other actors \nwho pose a threat to our national security or foreign policy. This \nposition is critical, as we look at legislation that we are talking \nabout taking up next week with respect to sanctions on North Korea, \nwith respect to continued sanctions on Iran, on Russia, to other bad \nactors, to terrorists who are out there. Mr. Szubin is extremely well \nqualified for this position. He has served in both Republican and \nDemocratic administrations.\n  He was nominated 294 days ago. Yet even Banking Committee Chairman \nShelby called Szubin ``eminently qualified'' during his September \nconfirmation hearing. The fact that the committee has not held a vote \nand the Senate has not confirmed him lessens his ability to influence \nour allies and to undermine our enemies around the world, which is what \nwe want to happen. If we are worried about our ability to enforce \nsanctions, if we are worried about the national security of this \ncountry and one of the weapons that we have to use to protect this \ncountry, then we ought to be confirming Adam Szubin.\n  It is very disappointing that my Republican colleagues continue to \nobject and that my colleague from Utah is here on behalf of Senator \nCruz from Texas, objecting to moving forward. Even though I understand \nthat he is going to object, I am going to put forward another unanimous \nconsent motion because I think we need to come back here every day from \nnow until the end of this session and ask unanimous consent to move \nforward on these nominees because it is unacceptable that we are still \nhere at this time without confirming these people.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session and the Banking Committee be discharged from further \nconsideration of PN371, the nomination of Adam J. Szubin to be Under \nSecretary for Terrorism and Financial Crimes; that the Senate proceed \nto its consideration and vote without intervening action or debate; \nthat if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid \nupon the table with no intervening action or debate; that no further \nmotions be in order to the nomination; that any statements related to \nthe nomination be printed in the Record; that the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate then resume \nlegislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, on behalf of the senior Senator from Alabama, \nI object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Again, it is very disappointing that the objection has \nbeen made, this time on behalf of the Senator from Alabama, who is \nhere, so it is disappointing that he is not on the floor to talk about \nwhat his objections to Adam Szubin are. I believe that refusing to move \nthese nominations does a profound disservice not only to these \nAmericans who have sacrificed to serve this country but to the national \nsecurity of the United States.\n  I call on the majority leader to schedule votes on these nominees and \nother pending national security nominees to let the Senate do its job \nat a time when the world is facing national security challenges on a \nnumber of fronts. When nations are looking to the United States for \nleadership, we cannot afford to sideline ourselves by failing to \nconfirm these important nominees.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Flint, Michigan, Water Crisis\n\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to come together as we continue to seek a bipartisan \npath forward to help the people and the children living in the city of \nFlint, MI. Nearly 2 years ago, an unelected emergency manager appointed \nby Michigan's Governor changed the city of Flint's water source to the \nFlint River in an attempt to save money while the city prepared to \ntransition to a new regional water authority.\n  After switching away from clean water sourced from the Detroit Water \nAuthority, Flint residents began to receive improperly treated Flint \nRiver water, long known to be contaminated and potentially very \ncorrosive. The result of the State government's actions was and \ncontinues to be absolutely catastrophic. Flint families were exposed to \nlead and other toxins that will have lasting effects for generations. \nThe ultimate cost of this misguided, dangerous decision will not be \nknown for decades, but we now have a chance to begin to make it right.\n  Last week, Senator Stabenow and I introduced an amendment that would, \none, provide water infrastructure funding for Flint; two, create a \nCenter of Excellence to address the long-term public health \nramifications of lead exposure; three, forgive Flint's outstanding \nloans that were used for water infrastructure that has now been damaged \nby the State's actions; and four, require the EPA to directly notify \nconsumers instead of going through State and local regulators if their \ndrinking water is contaminated with lead.\n  We have spent the last week working with Senator Murkowski and \nSenator Cantwell to find common ground and a path forward to provide \nsome relief to the people of Flint as we consider this bipartisan \nenergy legislation. These discussions are ongoing. They are happening \nas we speak now. But now is not the time to use procedural roadblocks \nto justify inaction.\n  Throughout the United States history, when a natural or manmade \ndisaster strikes, the Federal Government has stepped in to help those \nin need. Hurricanes, superstorms, earthquakes, flooding, and a \nfertilizer plant explosion--those types of activities or incidents all \nacross the Nation have received Federal assistance as communities come \ntogether to rebuild.\n  While the cause of this crisis and the ultimate responsibility to fix \nit lies with the State Government, we need to bring resources from all \nlevels of government to bear to address the unprecedented emergency \nthat we face. This is why I urge my colleagues to work with us as we \ncontinue efforts to make a down payment on the years of rebuilding and \nhealing that Flint needs.\n  I was in Flint earlier this week, and while volunteering with the Red \nCross to deliver bottled water from house to house, I heard directly \nfrom impacted residents. Months after the public became aware of the \ndepth of this crisis, families still have questions: Can I use my \nshower? When will the water be safe? Will the pipes ever get replaced?\n  My question for this body is very straightforward. Who will stand up \nfor the children of Flint? These children have been impacted the most \nby this crisis and through no fault of their own. I know we all have \npriorities that we care about in this Energy bill, but I simply cannot \nagree to move forward on action on this bill until we deal with Flint \nand help Flint rebuild to provide safe, clean drinking water.\n  This should not be a Republican or a Democratic issue. Clean water \nis, quite simply, a basic human right. Let's together show the American \npeople that when a crisis hits any city in this country, we will stand \nwith them.\n\n[[Page S564]]\n\nAmerica is a great country, and it is great because at times of \ndifficulty, we all stand together as one people.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, later today, at around 5:30 p.m., DC time, \nU.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman and representatives from 11 \nother countries will meet at a ceremony to sign the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership, or TPP, Agreement. It is no secret that the TPP Agreement \nhas the potential to do a lot of good for our country.\n  Taken as a whole, the 12 countries involved in this agreement had a \ncombined GDP of $28.1 trillion in 2012, nearly 40 percent of the \nworld's total economy. In that same year, our goods and services \nexports to TPP countries supported an estimated 4 million jobs here in \nthe United States.\n  According to the International Monetary Fund, the world economy will \ngrow by more than $20 trillion over the next 5 years and nearly half of \nthat growth will be in Asia. This agreement, if done right, will give \nthe United States a distinct advantage in setting the standards for \ntrade in this dynamic and strategically vital part of the world.\n  It is also no secret that many stakeholders and Members of Congress, \nincluding myself, have some doubts as to whether the agreement meets \nthe high standards necessary to gain congressional approval. I have \nexpressed those concerns many times here on the floor and elsewhere. I \nwon't go into any more detail about them today. Instead, I want to talk \nabout what will happen after the agreement is signed.\n  Even though there is a signing ceremony in New Zealand today, that is \nnot the end of the process for TPP in the United States. In fact, in \nmany ways, we are really just beginning.\n  In the coming months, we will have ample opportunity to debate the \nmerits of each and every provision of this agreement and to consider \nhow it will impact workers and job creators in our country and how it \nwill affect the health of our economy.\n  Today I will focus on the process by which Congress will consider and \ndebate this agreement. I want to do so in part because I believe it is \nimportant that our people--including Members of Congress, the \nadministration's stakeholders, and the media--have a full understanding \nof how this is going to work. All too often when a trade agreement is \nconcluded or signed, the pundits, commentators, and lobbyists in this \ntown immediately jump to one question: When will Congress vote on it? I \nget asked that question almost every day. While I have offered my own \nopinions and occasional speculation about when would be the best time \nto have the vote, the fact of the matter is I don't know exactly when \nthe vote will take place and no one else does either.\n  As we all know, last year Congress passed and the President signed \nlegislation renewing trade promotion authority, or TPA, and setting out \na series of timelines for Congress to consider and eventually vote on \nsigned trade agreements. While I am quite sure that interested parties \nand observers have already pored over the text of the TPA statute to \nadd up all the statutory timelines and have tried to calculate the \nexact date when Congress will vote on the agreement, that exercise is \nunlikely to yield an accurate result. Let me take a few minutes to \nexplain why that is the case.\n  Under the TPA process, there are a number of milestones, checkpoints, \nand associated timelines that begin at the outset of negotiations, long \nbefore any agreement is reached. With regard to TPP, we have gone \nthrough several of those already. President Obama has determined--\ndespite some concerns expressed by a number of sources--to take the \nnext step in the process and sign the agreement.\n\n  Under the TPA statute, once an agreement is signed, the President has \n60 days to provide Congress with a description of changes to U.S. law \nthat he believes would be required under the deal. That is one of the \nmore specific deadlines in the law. That 60 days is a maximum time \nperiod imposed on the administration, not on Congress.\n  Assuming the agreement does in fact get signed today, that \ninformation must arrive no later than April 3. On top of that, the \nstatute requires the International Trade Commission--or ITC--to compile \nand submit a report on the likely economic effects of a signed trade \nagreement. That report must be completed within 105 days--another \nspecific deadline of the signing date. For a deal signed today, that \ndeadline is May 18.\n  So far I have just talked about deadlines or maximum time periods for \ncompiling and submitting specific documents and materials, but once \nagain those maximum timelines are imposed on the administration, not on \nCongress. After Congress receives the President's description of \nlegislative changes and the ITC's economic analysis, the administration \nis required to provide to Congress the final text of the agreement and \na detailed plan on how they intend to administer it. The exact date and \ntiming by which the administration has to submit the final text of the \nagreement is not set out in the statute. Under established practices, \nthe timing of that submission, like other relevant decisions in this \nprocess, is generally determined after close collaboration and \nconsultation with leaders in Congress.\n  However, the TPA statute is clear that the final text of the \nagreement and the detailed administrative plan must be provided to \nCongress at least--and those two words are very important--at least 30 \ndays before formally submitting legislation to implement the agreement.\n  This is one of the more important timelines in the statute, and it \nnotably provides a floor, not a ceiling. It sets a minimum timeframe to \nensure Congress has at least--there are those two words again--30 days \nto review all necessary information and documents before the \nimplementing legislation is formally submitted to Congress.\n  I would like to point out that this minimum 30-day window is a new \nrequirement. We included this requirement for the first time in the \nmost recent TPA statute to provide increased transparency and ensure \nadequate consideration and debate in Congress. There are many \nadditional steps that take place once Congress has all of the required \ninformation and before the implementing bill is formally submitted, and \nthose steps each take time.\n  First, Congress, in consultation with the administration, has to \ndevelop a draft implementing bill for the agreement. Then the \ncommittees of jurisdiction will hold hearings to examine both the \nagreement and the draft legislation. Following these hearings, another \nvery important step occurs: the informal markups in the Senate Finance \nand House Ways and Means Committees. Most people call this process \n``the mock markup.'' The mock markup--which once again occurs before \nthe President formally submits the trade agreement to Congress--is \nsimilar to any other committee markup. The committee reviews the draft \nlegislation and has votes on amendments, if any are offered. If the \nFinance and Ways and Means Committees end up with different versions of \nthe draft implementing bill, they can proceed to a mock conference to \nwork out the details and reconcile any differences.\n  The mock markup process is well established in practice and is an \nessential part of Congress's consideration of any trade agreement. It \nis the best way for Congress to provide direct input--complete with \nvote tallies and on-the-record debates--to the President to demonstrate \nwhether the implementing bill meets the criteria set out in the TPA \nstatute and whether there is enough support in Congress for the \nagreement to pass.\n  After those steps are taken, a final implementing bill may be \nintroduced in the House and Senate. Only after the final implementing \nbill is introduced is Congress under any kind of deadline to vote on \nthe agreement. The votes must take place within 90 session days. You \nwill notice the word ``session.'' Of course, in this case I am using \nthe word ``deadline'' pretty loosely. The vote doesn't have to occur \nwithin 90 calendar days. It must take place within 90 session days, and \nonly Congress can\n\n[[Page S565]]\n\ndecide when it is and is not going to be in session. Long story short, \nno one should be under any illusions that because the TPP is being \nsigned today, an up-or-down vote on the agreement is imminent or that \nour oversight responsibilities are at an end.\n  If history has taught us anything, it is that this process can, and \noften does, take a very long time to complete. In fact, it is not an \nexaggeration or even all that remarkable to say that it can take years \nto get an agreement through Congress after it is signed. Historically \nspeaking, the shortest period of time we have seen between the signing \nof an agreement and the introduction of the implementing legislation, \nwhich once again triggers a statutory deadline for a vote in Congress, \nis 30 days. That was with our bilateral trade agreement with Morocco. \nNeedless to say, that agreement is an outlier and quite frankly it \nisn't a useful model for passing an agreement as massive as the TPP.\n  Other trade agreements, like our agreements with South Korea, \nColombia, and Panama, took more than 4 years to see an implementing \nbill introduced in Congress, and that was 4 years from the time the \nagreement was signed, which is what is happening today with the TPP, \nand the time the clock started ticking for a vote in the Senate. Our \ntrade agreement with Peru took 533 days or about a year and a half. Our \nagreement with Bahrain took just over a year. All of these, while \nsignificant in their own right, were bilateral agreements and paled in \ncomparison to the size and scope of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n  The closest parallels to the Trans-Pacific Partnership we have in our \nhistory--and they are not really that close at all--are the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, and the Dominican Republic-\nCentral America Free Trade Agreement, or DR-CAFTA, both of which took \nmore than 10 months. Once again, that wasn't 10 months between the \nsigning day and the vote. That was 10 months between the day the \nagreement was signed and the introduction of the implementing bill, \nwhich triggers a required-yet-fluid timeline for a vote in Congress.\n  Of course, none of these timelines for previous trade agreements are \nall that illustrative because the TPP is nothing like our other \nagreements. By any objective measure, the TPP is a historic trade \nagreement without a comparable precedent. Its approval would be a \nsignificant achievement. That is all the more reason to ensure it gets \na full and fair consideration in Congress, however long that process \ntakes. All of us--on both sides of the aisle, on both sides of the \nCapitol, and on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue--should be careful \nwhen we talk about timelines and deadlines for votes.\n  I am quite certain the President wants to get a strong TPP agreement \npassed as soon as possible. I personally share that goal, but Congress \nhas a history of taking the time necessary to consider and pass trade \nagreements, and the process set out under TPA demands that we do so. \nDespite a number of claims to the contrary, Congress does not \nrubberstamp trade agreements, and we will not do so in this case. We \ncannot short circuit the process. With an agreement of this \nsignificance, we must be more vigilant, more deliberative, and more \naccountable than ever before. We need to take the necessary time to \ncarefully review the agreement and engage in a meaningful dialogue with \nthe administration.\n  If that occurs and if the administration is prepared to engage with \nour TPP partners to address new concerns, I am confident the TPP \nagreement can be successfully approved by Congress. That may take more \ntime than some would like, but the process of achieving favorable \noutcomes in international trade is a marathon, not a sprint. There are \nno shortcuts. To get this done, we have to do the work and lay a strong \nfoundation in Congress.\n  As I have said many times, the TPP is an extremely important \nagreement, and we need to get it done, but given that importance, we \nneed to focus more on getting it right than getting it done fast.\n  Mr. President, millions of Americans depend on coal energy to heat \ntheir homes, power their electronics, and keep their businesses \nrunning. Coal is an indispensable asset in our Nation's energy \nportfolio. It accounts for nearly one-third of U.S. energy production \nand generates half of all our electricity today. Quite literally, coal \nkeeps the lights on, but the Obama administration's war on coal could \npull the plug on an industry essential to our energy needs.\n  America's coal miners have no greater antagonist than their own \nPresident. Ever since President Obama took office, he has deliberately \ntargeted coal producers, subjecting them to onerous, job-destroying \nregulations that threaten our economic future. The administration's \nrecently announced decision to halt coal leasing on Federal lands is \njust the latest assault in a calculated campaign to cripple the coal \nindustry.\n  The President's moratorium on new coal leases undermines our ability \nto produce one of the least expensive and most reliable fuel sources at \nour disposal. The long-term consequences of this rule will be \ndisastrous not only for coal companies and all of their employees but \nfor any industry that depends on coal for its energy needs.\n  Beyond the economic costs of this extraordinary action, consider the \nhuman toll. The U.S. coal industry directly employs more than 130,000 \npeople. These individuals are more than a mere statistic. They are real \npeople with mortgages, car payments, and children to feed. They are \nhonest men and women whose very livelihood depends on the future of \ncoal.\n  Sadly, the President's moratorium puts their jobs in danger. As the \njunior Senator from Wyoming observed, the administration's action \neffectively hands a pink slip to thousands of hard-working individuals \nacross the Mountain West who work in coal production.\n  As Members of the legislative branch, we have a constitutional duty \nto check Executive overreach. With the amendment I have introduced, we \nhave the opportunity to rein in the President's actions and protect \nhard-working American families from overly burdensome Federal \nregulations.\n  My amendment reasserts the authority of Congress in this matter by \nprohibiting the Secretary of the Interior from halting coal leases on \nFederal land without congressional approval. It also requires the \nSecretary to begin leasing Federal assets immediately pursuant to the \nMineral Leasing Act of 1920.\n  If the Secretary wishes to enforce a moratorium on coal leasing, she \nmust first provide a reasonable justification for doing so. To that \nend, my amendment requires the Secretary to submit to Congress a study \ndemonstrating that a moratorium would not result in a loss of revenue \nto the Treasury. The study must also examine the potential economic \nimpacts of a moratorium on jobs and industry. Once the House and Senate \nhave had the opportunity to review this study in full, the Department \nof the Interior may suspend coal leasing on Federal lands if and only \nif Congress approves the action.\n\n  Mr. President, my amendment not only protects middle-class Americans \nfrom harmful government regulations, it also rightly restrains the \nPresident and his abuse of Executive power by restoring authority to \nthe duly-elected Members of Congress, not unelected bureaucracies. I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment as we continue \nconsideration of the legislation at hand.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Flint, Michigan, Water Crisis\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I want to talk again about the complete \ndisaster, the catastrophe that has befallen a community in Michigan \ncalled Flint, MI, through no fault of their own.\n  We assume that when we turn on the faucet, we can make coffee, take a \nshower, make breakfast, take care of our children or our grandchildren, \nand that we are going to have safe, clean water. That has been a basic \nright in America. If you own a business, a restaurant, you assume you \nare going to be able to turn on the water and make the food and serve \nyour customers. If you are a barber, you can turn on the\n\n[[Page S566]]\n\nfaucet and clean water comes out. That is basic in our country.\n  For 100,000 people in Flint, MI, the dignity of being able to turn on \na faucet and have clean water has been ripped away. It started 20 \nmonths ago. They were lied to. They were told the water was safe. \nFinally, we are told it was not safe. People told them that somehow \nthis brown water that smelled was safe--clearly not.\n  We now know that about 9,000 children under the age of 6 have been \nexposed in some cases to astronomical lead levels. There was one story \nabout a home that was tested where the lead levels were higher than a \nnuclear waste dump. How would you feel if that were your house and \nsomebody told you your children had been exposed to that? I can only \nimagine. I know how I would feel.\n  A little while ago I met with some pastors from Flint who are here \ndesperately trying to get beyond this. They don't want partisanship; \nthey don't want political fighting; they just want some help. They \nsaid: We are not interested in the back-and-forth of all this; we just \nwant clean water, and we want to be able to provide good nutrition for \nthese children who are already impacted.\n  The scary thing about this lead is that it stays in your body \nforever. I am learning more about lead than I ever wanted to know, and \none of the things we know is that it does not leave. There is no magic \npill. It is nutrition, so you have to give them more iron and milk and \ncalcium and vitamins. There is a whole range of things I am working on \nnow. I am grateful for the support from the Department of Agriculture \nto help us do that.\n  We have too many children--if anyone saw Time magazine--we have \nchildren with rashes, babies, people losing their hair. I met with \npastors, and after that I met with another group of citizens from \nFlint: moms who are trying to figure out a way to avoid mixing this \nwater with their baby formula. I had been told by the Michigan State \ndepartment of WIC that they were giving ready-to-feed formula, and I \njust met with a group of moms who said that was not true.\n  We are talking about children whose brains are being developed and \nright now whose futures are being snatched away from them. They didn't \ncause it. Their moms didn't cause it. Their dads didn't cause it. \nOthers caused it, and we can debate who that is. I am happy to have \nthat discussion. Right now I just want to help those people.\n  I want people to see the people of Flint. They have not been seen or \nheard on this issue for almost 2 years. The folks who were supposed to \ncare, who were supposed to see them, didn't. We have a chance to say to \nthem: We see you. We hear you. We know that you as Americans have a \nright, if there is a catastrophe in Flint, to have the same sense of \nurgency, of support that we give to other things, such as a fertilizer \nexplosion in West Texas, where we brought in millions of dollars, or \nhurricanes in Texas and South Carolina--emergency spending, I \nunderstand. We all know that something can happen beyond the control of \ncitizens, and they look to us.\n  I know we all have other issues around aging pipes. We all have \ninfrastructure issues, and frankly, we should be addressing those. \nThere are very positive bipartisan proposals to address water and sewer \ninfrastructure, and I support those. I want to do what we can, and \nhopefully this will serve as an impetus for that, but nowhere in \nAmerica do we have an entire city's drinking water system shut down \nfrom usage.\n  We have other situations in other parts of Michigan. I am not \nasking--although I would love to provide help in all the cities in \nMichigan, I understand that is a broader issue we have to address \ntogether. But this is about a catastrophe, a crisis, something that we \ndo emergency spending on when there is a situation where we see lead \nlevels in some parts of this community that are higher than a toxic \nwaste dump.\n  Even in areas now where it is OK, we have small businesses--it just \nbreaks your heart. Downtown Flint has been doing a great job of \nrebuilding the downtown. Everyone focuses on the exciting things in \nDetroit, but Flint also has done great things, bringing great \nrestaurants downtown. Even when folks invest in their own water system \nso they are absolutely sure their water is safe, people won't come in \nbecause now it is Flint, MI. Nobody believes any of the water is safe. \nIt is now a joke: If you go to Flint, don't drink the water. So we have \nbusinesses closing. We have a community collapsing that needs help, and \nthe bottom-line help they need is to fix the pipes.\n  Senator Peters and I are not suggesting that it is entirely a Federal \nresponsibility. In fact, it is a joint responsibility. In fact, we \nwould argue that more of the responsibility be on the State than the \nFederal Government. But we do have a shared responsibility to step in \nand help and give some immediate help to be able to get this going. \nThat is what we are asking for.\n  Up until yesterday afternoon, we thought we had a bipartisan \nsolution. I appreciate the work that has been done by the chair and the \nranking member. We thought we were there. We found a source to pay for \nit. Even though we don't always pay for other emergencies, we found a \nway to do it. We go to the Congressional Budget Office. We find there \nare a couple of technical things. Lord, help us, we love the CBO. There \nis a technical thing that doesn't affect the Senate called a blue slip \nto deal with. We do it all the time--another issue around scoring that \nwe are working hard around. Suddenly, everything stops over procedure, \nover bureaucracy and procedure.\n  I know that when we did a transportation bill, we waived every single \npoint of order because we wanted to do it. I wanted to do it. I \nsupported it. But now when we are talking about helping an important \ncommunity in the State of Michigan be able to get some help out of a \ndisaster, all of a sudden, no, no, no; there are all kinds of \nprocedures and reasons. I don't buy it for a second. I don't buy it for \na second. When we want to help Americans, we help Americans. That is \nwhat we do. It is our job to do those things.\n  One of the things that I now find such an insult, such a slap in the \nface--I don't know if this means that folks aren't--we are still trying \nto work this out, Mr. President, and I am hopeful that we will so there \ncan be an energy bill. But now there is an amendment that has been \nfiled to pay for helping Flint by taking dollars away from new \ndevelopment of technologies for automobiles--something Senator Peters \nand I have been champions of. Back in the 2007 Energy bill, I was able \nto get a provision in, when we raised CAFE standards, to support \ncompanies to create that new technology here in America so the jobs \nwouldn't go overseas, they would be here. It is work that has made a \nreal difference, that brought jobs back from other countries.\n  Senator Cassidy and I have been working on a provision to expand that \nbecause of trucks because they are getting CAFE standard increases and \nso on. I had a commitment and we had a commitment to actually do that \non the floor, to get that done, but now, all of a sudden, the money \nfrom that is being proposed to pay for fixing the drinking water system \nin Flint.\n  Flint is the home of the automobile industry. Flint, MI, is where \nmuch of this started, where the middle class started, where the auto \nindustry started. General Motors is still there, although they won't \nuse the water because it corrodes their auto parts. So they won't use \nthe water.\n  But now we are hearing in an amendment for the people of Flint: Well, \nyou have a choice. You can either drink the water and have safe water \nor you can have a job.\n  Well, that is an insult. I personally feel it is an insult. It is \nbeing done to just jam us and trying to embarrass us--that we don't \ncare about the people of Flint because we are not willing to spend \nmoney from a new technology source that is being used to create new \njobs.\n  I don't buy it. That is certainly not going to be getting support. \nWhen we are trying to work in good faith to get this done, I am amazed \nthat this would be offered, which is clearly just an effort to jam us.\n  I don't know where we are. I still am a very positive person. I tend \nto spend most of my time working behind the scenes to get things done--\nI am very proud of that--and so does my colleague Senator Peters. We \nare people who like to get results. We are not into demagoguing about \nthis. Lord knows it is ripe for it. We want to do something that will \nhelp people who need help.\n\n[[Page S567]]\n\n  So we are going to continue to do that. We are going to continue to \nwork to try to do that. We are not going to stop, and we are not going \nto support moving forward until we have something that is a reasonable \nway that we can tell the people of Flint that we have done something to \nhelp them.\n  At this point in time, I can't look at this child or his mom in the \nface--or any other children or parents--and not tell them we did \neverything humanly possible to be able to make sure we could help them \nas quickly as possible to stop using bottled water and be able to \nactually give their kids a bath, cook for them, and have the dignity of \nwhat every one of us has--the gift of clean water, which is a basic in \nthe United States, or should be.\n  So we are meeting, and we are doing everything we can. We have agreed \nto cut in half the original request we have asked for. We have agreed \nto a structure proposed by the Republican majority. We have said we are \ngoing to be flexible here, but we are not willing to walk away from \nFlint. We will not walk away from Flint. Too many people in the State \nof Michigan have done that for too long, and we are not going to do \nthat. We are going to continue to do everything we can to fix this \nproblem.\n  If clean water in America is not a basic human right, I don't know \nwhat is. I hope in the end we are going to be able to stand up and say \nin a bipartisan basis that we did this. That is all we are asking for--\nthat we actually do something to fix this problem.\n  I see that face and the face of other children every night before I \ngo to bed. Every morning when I get up I think about what is happening \nthis morning, what is happening tonight, what is happening tomorrow in \nFlint. We are going to do everything we can to make sure other people \nremember and are willing to step up and treat them with the dignity and \nrespect they deserve as American citizens.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about the \nEnergy bill and, particularly, a very important and missing part of the \nEnergy bill. But before I turn to that subject, I want to particularly \nnote, with our colleague Senator Stabenow on the floor this afternoon, \nthat I think she is doing extraordinary work on behalf of Flint and the \npeople of Flint. I commend her and also her colleague Senator Peters \nfor trying to tackle this issue.\n  It seems almost unconscionable that in this age, when there is all \nthis information and technology at our fingertips, a community is put \nat risk the way Flint has been put at risk. The idea that innocent \nchildren would suffer this way is why it is so important that we move \nnow to address this issue. This is urgent.\n  There are questions we deal with in the Senate that if we take \nanother few months or a half a year even, Western civilization isn't \ngoing to exactly change, but what my colleague from Michigan has said \nis that what we know about youngsters--and particularly brain \ndevelopment--if we don't get there early and we don't get there \nquickly, we play catchup ball for years and years to come, everything \nwe know about neurological development. My friend knows that my wife \nand I are parents of small kids. We are so lucky they are healthy and \nhave what a lot of youngsters in Flint aren't going to have. They are \nnot going to have the kinds of problems that my colleague has brought \nto light here.\n  I saw one report in the news--it is almost beyond comprehension--that \na State nurse told a Flint patient, ``It's just a few IQ points. . . . \nIt is not the end of the world.'' The idea that a health professional--\nwho I guess has been in a number of the national publications--just \nhighlights how important it is that this Congress move, and move now.\n  My colleague and Senator Peters, who is also doing a terrific job on \nthis, have indicated there are some procedural and constitutional \nquestions for the Finance Committee on which my colleague serves so \nwell. I want her to know I am with her and the people of Flint every \nstep of the way--not just this week and this month. This is going to be \na challenge that is going to go on for some time. I just so appreciate \nwhat my colleague is doing. I am with her every step of the way.\n  Mr. President, I turn now to the Energy bill before us. I also want \nto commend the chair, Senator Murkowski, and the ranking member, \nSenator Cantwell, who have put together a bipartisan bill in the Energy \nCommittee, which is something I know something about because I was the \nchair of the committee. I think my chairmanship began and ended before \nwe had the opportunity to work more directly with the Presiding \nOfficer, the Senator from Colorado. I look forward to working with him \nin the committee and very much appreciate our colleagues putting \ntogether this important package.\n  If there is one backdrop to this debate, it is the extraordinary \nchallenge of climate change. In order to meet that challenge and beat \nback the threat of irrevocable damage that has climate scientists \nringing such loud alarm bells, there are going to have to be some \nserious changes in energy policy. The legislation in this bipartisan \nbill moves in that direction, the details of which I intend to get into \nin a minute.\n  I do want to first discuss a part of this bill that frankly is \nmissing. It is missing to this debate. That is because the reality is \nthe heart of America's energy policy is in the Federal Tax Code. The \nlast big energy tax proposal to become law passed in 2009. According to \nthe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 5 of the 7 hottest \nyears in recorded history have come since then. On the books today is \nan outdated, clumsy patchwork of energy tax incentives that in my view \nis anti-innovation and nothing short of a confusing, incomprehensible \npolicy that does our country a disservice at a time when we have these \ngreat challenges.\n  There are 44 different energy tax breaks, and they cost about $125 \nbillion each decade. Some industries--the oil and gas industry in \nparticular--have some certainty about their taxes with permanent \nprovisions. The fact is, renewable energy sources don't have that \ncertainty. Some technologies get a lot of support. Others get little or \nnone. It is a disjointed system that has far outlasted its sell-by \ndate, and it is ripe for simplification.\n  The amendment Senators Cantwell, Bennet, and I submitted replaces \nthis tattered quilt of tax rules with a fresh approach, an approach I \nhope will appeal to colleagues on both sides of the aisle. The \nPresiding Officer and I have talked about energy policy being more \nmarket oriented. The kind of proposal we have made here does just that. \nIt supports innovators with fresh, creative ideas. Particularly, I hope \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle, because we talked about \nit often when I was chairman of the committee and also on the Finance \nCommittee--concern about subsidies, a big concern about subsidies, and \nI am very concerned about that as well. The amendment we will be \noffering cuts the $125 billion pricetag in half. So when colleagues say \nwe ought to be cutting back on tax subsidies, that is exactly what this \nproposal does. It replaces wasteful tax rules with a new, simple group \nof incentives that have just three goals: cleaner energy, cleaner \ntransportation, and greater energy efficiency. Gone would be the system \nwhere oil companies get a direct deposit out of the taxpayer account \neach year while expired renewable incentives just sort of hang in \nlimbo. For the first time, fossil fuel-burning plants would have a big \nfinancial reason to get cleaner by investing in high-tech turbine or \ncarbon-capture technology. So that means everybody benefits by getting \ncleaner. Everybody in the energy sector--renewables, fossil fuel \nindustries, everybody gets the incentive to be cleaner under the \namendment I am offering.\n  The amendment is all about harnessing the market-based power of the \nprivate economy to reward clean energy, promote new technologies, and \nattack climate change. My view is this Congress ought to be doing \neverything it can to fight the steady creep toward a hotter climate. \nWhen we have legions\n\n[[Page S568]]\n\nof scientists lining up to warn the American people about the dangers \nof climate change, and when we have policymakers, business leaders, and \ninvestors worldwide saying that clean energy is the 21st century gold \nrush, this is a bold energy policy transformation. The proposal I offer \nwith Senators Bennet and Cantwell ought to become law.\n  This may not happen in the context of the Energy Policy Modernization \nAct. I think we all understand the rules of the Senate, but I am very \nmuch looking forward to working with my colleagues to build support for \nthis proposal in the days ahead. In my view the lack of tax provisions \nin this legislation is unfortunate. They ought to be in there. Tax \npolicy is right at the heart of energy policy, but it certainly doesn't \nundermine my support for a great deal of what is in the overall \npackage. That includes several provisions I authored and my colleagues \nand I on the Energy Committee included.\n  One focuses on geothermal energy. It is a proposal that is all about \nbringing the public and private sectors together to figure out where \ngeothermal has the most potential in getting the projects underway. \nAnother proposal in the package is the Marine and Hydrokinetic \nRenewable Energy Act, which says that with the right investments and \ninnovations, our oceans, rivers, and lakes ought to be able to power \nmillions of homes and contribute to the low-carbon economy. Note those \nwords because we talk a lot in the Energy Committee about these issues. \nMy view is there is an awful lot of bipartisan support for a lower \ncarbon economy in this country, particularly one that grows jobs in the \nprivate sector, and this legislation does that.\n  In addition to promoting low-carbon sources of energy, the \nlegislation will help communities be significantly more energy \nefficient. It will spur the development of a smarter electric grid that \ncuts waste, stores energy, and helps consumers save money on their \nutility bill. Finally, it will permanently reauthorize the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund, and that in my view is a win-win for the rural \ncommunities of my State and rural communities across this country. The \nLand and Water Conservation Fund brings more jobs and more recreation \ndollars to areas that need an economic boost, and it ensures that \nfuture generations of Americans are going to be able to enjoy our \ntreasures for years and years to come.\n  I noted my concern about help for the city of Flint. I think it is so \nimportant that in the days and months ahead, when we come back to talk \nabout important public health legislation--because that is really what \nthis is, a public health crisis--I hope what we will say is we made a \nstart, we made a beginning. We said it was too important to just delay \nmoving ahead to address these enormous concerns that the families and \nthe children of Flint are dealing with this evening. We have to ensure \nthat this Congress takes action on this public health crisis quickly. I \nam committed to working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and \nas a member of both the Finance Committee and the Energy Committee I \nwill have two opportunities to do it. I think we need to make this bill \nbipartisan and bicameral as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, the Senate is still at work crafting a \npackage of energy legislation that can earn the support of a broad \nmajority and potentially become this body's first comprehensive energy \nefficiency legislation since 2007.\n  This is my 126th weekly call to arms to wake us up to the duty we owe \nour constituents and future generations of Americans, not only to \nunleash the clean energy solutions that will propel our economy forward \nbut also to stave off the devastating effects of carbon pollution.\n  I commend Energy Committee Chairman Murkowski and her ranking member \nSenator Cantwell for bringing us a bipartisan bill that builds upon \nsome of the best ideas of the energy efficiency legislation championed \nnot long ago by Senators Shaheen and Portman. According to a report \nassessing the emissions reductions related to Shaheen-Portman done by \nthe American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, the cumulative \nnet savings of these provisions would reach around $100 billion over \nthe years 2014 to 2030, along with a reduction of about 650 million \nmetric tons of carbon dioxide emissions over that 15-year period.\n  While these are welcomed reductions, they are a fraction of what we \nexpect just from the clean energy tax credit extensions that were \nincluded in the end-of-year omnibus. Those 5-year incentives for wind \nand solar will yield cumulative emissions reductions of over 1 billion \nmetric tons of CO2. And even then, we are still far from \nwhat we need to do to stem our flood of carbon pollution into the \natmosphere and oceans.\n\n  Last year, the ranking member of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, Senator Cantwell, offered an ambitious legislative vision \nfor growing our clean energy economy while tackling the growing climate \ncrisis. Her Energy bill outlines achievable reductions in carbon \npollution. It would repeal oil subsidies and level the playing field \nfor clean energy. Estimated carbon reductions under her plan would be \n34 percent below 2005 levels by 2025, which would help us achieve our \ninternational climate commitment. Our goals in the legislation now \nbefore us should be just as ambitious.\n  Of course, the big polluters always shout that any steps to reduce \nemissions will invariably hobble the economy. They have the nerve to \nsay this while they are sitting on an effective subsidy every year, \njust in the United States, of $700 billion, according to the \nInternational Monetary Fund. It really takes nerve to complain while \nsitting on that big of a public subsidy.\n  In the bill before us, I was glad to add an amendment with my \ncolleague from Idaho, Senator Crapo, with the bipartisan support of \nSenators Risch, Booker, Hatch, Kirk, and Durbin, to strengthen the \ndevelopment of advanced nuclear energy technologies in partnerships \nbetween the government and our national labs and the private sector. \nThe Holy Grail here is advanced reactors that could actually consume \nspent fuel from conventional reactors and help us draw down our nuclear \nwaste stockpile.\n  I know that many of my Republican friends have supported commonsense \nclimate action in the past. Senator McCain ran for President on a \nstrong climate change platform. Senator Collins coauthored an important \ncap-and-dividend bill with Senator Cantwell. Senator Kirk voted for the \nWaxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill in the House. Senator Flake has \nwritten an article in support of a carbon tax that reduces income \ntaxes. And there are more. So I hold out some hope, but it is hard.\n  There is a whole climate denial apparatus that helps manufacture \ndoubt and delay action. The fossil fuel industry players controlling \nthis machinery of denial use a well-worn playbook--the same tactics \nemployed by the tobacco industry and the lead industry: Deny the \nscientific findings about the dangers their product causes, question \nthe motives of the scientists they oppose, and exaggerate the costs of \ntaking action. They tend to look only at the costs to them of having to \nclean up their act. They tend never to look at the cost to the public \nof the harm from their product. If accountants looked at only one side \nof the ledger like that, they would go to jail.\n  In each case, tobacco, lead, climate change, and other sophisticated \ncampaigns of misinformation were used to mislead the public. So this is \nwhy I have submitted an amendment declaring the sense of the Senate \ndisapproving corporations and the front organizations they fund to \nobscure their role that deliberately cast doubt on science in order to \nprotect their own financial interests and urging the fossil fuel \ncompanies to cooperate with investigations that are now ongoing into \nwhat they knew about climate change and when they knew it.\n\n[[Page S569]]\n\n  I have also pressed to have the political contributions of these same \npolluters made transparent to the American people. The Supreme Court's \nawful Citizens United decision flung open the floodgates of corporate \nspending in our elections, giving wealthy corporate interests the \nability to clobber, and perhaps even more important, to threaten to \nclobber politicians who don't toe their line.\n  My Republican colleagues have refused to shine the light on this \nspending, so since the amendment failed, Americans will remain in the \ndark about who was trying to influence their elections and how.\n  The Koch brothers-backed political juggernaut, Americans for \nProsperity, has openly promised to punish candidates who support curbs \non carbon pollution. The group's President said if Republicans support \na carbon tax or climate regulations, they would ``be at a severe \ndisadvantage in the Republican nomination process. . . . We would \nabsolutely make that a crucial issue.'' The threat is not subtle: Step \nout of line, and here come the attack ads and the primary challengers, \nall funded by the deep pockets of the fossil fuel industry, powered up \nby Citizens United.\n  Unfortunately, a large portion of the funding behind this special \ninterest apparatus is simply not traceable. Money is funneled through \norganizations that exist just to conceal the donor's identity. The \nbiggest identity-laundering shops are Donors Trust and Donors Capital \nFund. Indeed, these are by far the biggest sources of funding in the \nnetwork or web of climate-denial front groups. These twin entities \nreported giving a combined $78 million to climate-denier groups between \n2003 and 2010. Dr. Robert Brulle of Drexel University, who studies this \nnetwork of fossil fuel-backed climate-denial fronts, reports that the \nDonors Trust and Donors Capital Fund operations are the ``central \ncomponent'' and ``predominant funder'' of the denier apparatus, and at \nthe same time, they are what he calls the ``black box that conceals the \nidentity of contributors.''\n  The denial apparatus runs a complex scheme to delegitimize the \nhonest, university-based science that supports curbing carbon emissions \nand to intimidate officials who would dare cross this industry. And, \nregrettably, it is working.\n  Since Citizens United let loose the threat of limitless dark money \ninto our elections, a shadow has fallen over the Republican side of \nthis Chamber. There is no longer any honest bipartisan debate on \nclimate change, nor is there a single serious effort on the Republican \nside of the Presidential race.\n  So, anyway, I have submitted the amendment to require companies with \n$1 million or more in revenues from fossil fuel activities to disclose \ntheir hidden spending on electioneering communications, to bring them \nout of the dark. The amendment is cosponsored by Senators Markey, \nDurbin, Sanders, Shaheen, Baldwin, Leahy, Murphy, Blumenthal, and \nMenendez.\n  Corporate and dark money, and particularly fossil fuel money, is now \nwashing through our elections in what one newspaper memorably called a \n``tsunami of slime.'' All my amendment would have done is show the \nAmerican people who is trying to sway their votes from behind the dark \nmoney screen. It is a pretty simple idea. It is, in fact, precisely the \nsolution prescribed by the Supreme Court Justices in the Citizens \nUnited decision. Moreover, it is an idea the Republicans have over and \nover again supported in the past. But now that dark money has become \nthe Republican Party's life support system, all the opinions have \nchanged.\n  Well, I believe fossil fuel money is polluting our democracy, just as \ntheir carbon emissions are polluting our atmosphere and oceans. It \nought to be time to shine a light on that dark money. In a nutshell, we \nhave been had by the fossil fuel industry, and it is time to wake up.\n\n\n                           Student Loan Debt\n\n  Mr. President, if I may change topics for a moment, we had a meeting \nthis morning with a number of students from around the country who came \nin to share with us their concerns about the growing burden of student \nloan debt in this country, which I would argue has now reached a point \nof crisis.\n  Time and again, we tell young people that the path to the American \ndream runs through a college campus. Young people get this, and they \nrespond to it. They overwhelmingly want to go to college, and they work \nhard to get there.\n  But the cost can be more than many students bargain for, especially \nonce they leave school, with a degree or without, and get hit with \nstudent loan payments. Young people are graduating with more debt than \never before. For the past several years, as springtime rolls around and \ngraduates get ready to cross the stage, we hear reports that average \ndebt loads have increased yet again. Each new class seems to set a new \nrecord. The average graduating senior in the class of 2014 held $28,950 \nin student loan debt. Indeed, over the past decade, student loan debt \nhas quadrupled. Total outstanding student loan debt held by 40 million \nAmericans is now over $1.3 trillion. That makes student loans the \nsecond highest type of consumer debt after home mortgages. Student \nloans are more than both credit card debt and car loans. Rhode \nIslanders alone owe upward of $3.6 billion. Students who graduate from \n4-year colleges and universities in Rhode Island emerge with an average \nof $31,841 in student loan debt.\n  I asked my colleagues, most of whom graduated many decades ago, can \nyou imagine starting out in your life that deep in the red? This is the \nreality for so many Americans today. It is the reality for so many \nRhode Islanders I have met with.\n  Tammy is a childcare provider from Warwick, RI. She spoke at a \nroundtable discussion Senator Reed and I held in Rhode Island to hear \nfirsthand from our constituents about the challenges they face in \nrepaying student loan debt. Tammy has a master's degree in child \ndevelopment and early childhood education. The original principal \nbalance on her student loan was $43,530.56. But even with a master's \ndegree in child development and early childhood education, the pay has \nnot been great. We went through that Wall Street-caused financial \ncrisis and now, 16 years later, her balance has grown to $88,000. \nInstead of making headway on her debt, she slips further into the red.\n  Danielle from Narragansett, RI, racked up roughly $60,000 in student \nloan debt between her undergraduate and master's degrees from the \nUniversity of Rhode Island. Now, she says, the burden of that debt is \naffecting the decisions her son, Talin, is making about his own college \neducation. When a parent works and studies to make a better life for \nher child, the last thing she expects is for the cost of her education \nto limit her son's opportunities.\n  Ryan, also from Warwick, is a special education teacher. He was my \nguest at the State of the Union Address. He is going back to graduate \nschool to become an even better educator. ``I've made a conscious \nchoice,'' he says, ``to invest in my education and my ability to make a \ndifference in the lives of my students as a teacher.'' But his loans \nare a heavy burden on his finances. He works a second job on top of his \nteaching job to help cover his expenses and pay down his loans. His \ndebt is affecting his life decisions about things like marriage or \nbuying a home. Why should becoming a better teacher mean postponing the \ndreams of adulthood?\n  Young people should enter the workforce ready to get their lives \nstarted--to earn, to create, to invest. College should be a path to \nopportunity, not a decades-long sentence of debt and instability, not \ndeferred dreams of starting a family or buying a house.\n\n  The average age of the Senate today is just over 60, meaning most \nSenators were in college about 40 years ago. So we have no idea. \nBetween then and now, the cost of college has increased more than 1,000 \npercent. According to Bloomberg Business, from 1978, when the records \nbegan, through 2012, the costs have increased by twelvefold--1,120 \npercent. Going to college in the seventies generally didn't leave \nstudents with insurmountable debt. Today it is a fact of life. We must \nwork not just to stop but to reverse these trends.\n  It is because of this crisis in college affordability that my \nDemocratic colleagues got together to create the Reducing Education \nDebt Act, or the RED Act. This important bill would do three vital \nthings:\n  First, it would allow students to refinance their outstanding student \ndebt\n\n[[Page S570]]\n\nto take advantage of lower interest rates. That would put billions of \ndollars back into the pockets of people who invested in their \neducation. Refinancing would help an estimated 24 million borrowers \nsave an average of almost $1,900.\n  Second, the RED Act would make 2 years of community college tuition-\nfree, helping students earn an associate's degree, the first half of a \nbachelor's degree, or get the skills they need to succeed in the \nworkforce, all without having to take on so much debt. Free tuition at \ncommunity college would save a full-time student an average of $3,800 \nper year and could help an estimated 9 million college students.\n  Third, the RED Act would help ensure that Pell grants--named for our \ngreat Rhode Island Senator Claiborne Pell--keep up with the rising \ncosts by indexing part of the Pell grant to inflation permanently. By \nindexing the Pell grant, compared to current law, the maximum Pell \ngrant award would increase by $1,300 for the 2026-2027 school year, \nresulting in larger awards for over 9 million students, helping to \nreduce their debt.\n  We think the RED Act is a critical step toward an essential goal: \ndebt-free college.\n  The American middle class was built in part on the opportunity \nprovided by higher education. Believe it or not, it was once common to \nbe able to go to college and graduate with no debt. We owe it to \ntoday's college students to be able to leave college and begin to build \ntheir lives free of debt and ready to achieve their dreams.\n  We look forward to bipartisan participation on this issue in the \nSenate, although regrettably it has virtually never appeared in the \nRepublican Presidential debates as an issue. There are 40 million \nstudents with $1.3 trillion in debt--not interested, not compared to \nBenghazi. So I am hoping we will do better than those candidates in \nthis Chamber and be able to pull a bipartisan solution together that \nwill relieve that burden of debt on our next generation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I see the senior Senator of Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, first, I commend Senator Whitehouse, my \ncolleague from Rhode Island, for his very thoughtful leadership on this \nissue of education and particularly the situation where so many young \npeople are so deeply in debt after a college education.\n  It was Senator Whitehouse who organized a meeting in Rhode Island. I \nwas there and I listened to the story he just related. It is \nastounding, the debt these young people and in some cases middle-aged \npeople are shouldering. We have to do something. I would like to \ncommend and thank him for his leadership and urge a bipartisan effort \nin this regard.\n  Mr. President, I was on the floor last week, and I spoke about a \nseries of two amendments that I was working with Senator Heller on, and \nthey are all focused on enhancing energy storage. I thank Senator \nHeller for his efforts in so many ways but particularly this bipartisan \neffort to enhance the Energy bill that is before us. Indeed, earlier \nthis week, we were able to pass one of these amendments, No. 2989, that \nwe introduced together to improve coordination of Department of Energy \nprograms and authorities in order to maximize the amount of money that \ngoes toward energy storage research and development.\n  Let me particularly thank Energy and Natural Resources Committee \nchairperson Lisa Murkowski and ranking member Maria Cantwell for their \ngreat efforts overall and particularly for their help in getting the \nReed-Heller amendment through. They have done an extraordinary job on \nthis legislation.\n  As I have indicated, we have two amendments. I have also joined \nSenator Heller on another amendment. He is the lead author. This \namendment would amend the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act--or \nPURPA, as it is known--to require industry and State regulators to \nconsider energy storage when making their energy efficiency plans. By \nencouraging energy storage usage by public utilities, we will help \nexpand the reach of this needed technology.\n  There are many technical, financial, and security benefits to energy \nstorage, including: improving grid utilization by storing and moving \nlow-cost power into higher priced markets, thereby reducing the amount \nwe all pay on our utility bills; increasing the value and the amount of \nrenewable energy in the grid, thereby reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions; and enhancing the security of the grid, thereby ensuring \ncritical access to power in an emergency. We are all each day much more \ncognizant of the threat not just through natural disasters but through \nparticular cyber intrusions which could affect our energy grid. This \nwould be another way in which we could not only protect ourselves but \nrespond more quickly in the case of any of these natural or manmade \ndisasters.\n  I want to conclude by again thanking my colleague and friend Senator \nHeller and urge our colleagues to work with us in a bipartisan fashion \nto adopt this amendment.\n  With that, Mr. President, I thank you.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/03/senate-section/article/S570-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 757\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \ncongratulate the United Service Organizations, commonly known as the \nUSO, on its 75th anniversary. Since February 4, 1941, the USO has been \nserving alongside our men and women in uniform.\n  Ahead of our entry into World War II and having witnessed the morale \nissues among the ranks during World War I, Army Chief of Staff General \nGeorge C. Marshall called for an effort that would bring together \nprivate, civilian organizations to provide recreational activities and \nentertainment for the troops. As President Franklin D. Roosevelt \nstated, ``not by machines alone will we win this war,'' and so he \ndirected the newly formed USO to keep servicemembers in touch with the \ncomforts of home, no matter where they were deployed.\n  Initially led by the YMCA, YWCA, the Salvation Army, the National \nJewish Welfare Board, the National Catholic Community Service, and the \nTraveler's Aid Society, the USO provided\n\n[[Page S572]]\n\nservicemen with wholesome recreation and entertainment. According to \nWalter Hoving, one of the original directors of the USO, ``this is not \nonly vital to military morale but also from the standpoint of the \nfuture of our youth as peacetime citizens.''\n  Seventy-five years later, the USO continues to adapt to meet the \nneeds of our men and women in uniform and their families. From USO \ncenters at or near military installations across the United States and \naround the world, to their airport centers that offer around-the-clock \nhospitality for traveling servicemembers, to their trademark tours that \nbring America's celebrities to entertain our troops, to their support \nfor military kids, wounded warriors and their caregivers, and families \nof the fallen, the USO has answered the call to serve those who serve \nour Nation.\n  The USO remains a private organization, relying on the generosity of \nindividuals, communities, and corporations and 30,000 dedicated \nvolunteers. As General Eisenhower wrote many decades ago, ``the USO \nserved also in providing a channel through which more than a million \ncivilian men and women were able to help effectively in the war \neffort.'' The same holds true today.\n  I would like to thank the many men and women of the USO who give so \nmuch to bring a bit of home to our servicemembers all over the globe. I \ncongratulate the USO on 75 years of strengthening America's military by \nkeeping servicemembers connected to family, home, and country wherever \nthey go.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/03/senate-section/article/S572-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING ANITA ASHOK DATA\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the life of \nan extraordinary woman named Anita Ashok Data. She was a mother, a \ndaughter, a sister, and a dear friend to those who knew her.\n  Anita was born in Pittsfield, MA, and was raised in Flanders, NJ. She \nwas a graduate of Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health \nand School of International and Public Affairs, where she attained a \nmaster's in public health and a master's in public administration. At \nthe time of her death, Anita was a resident of Takoma Park, MD.\n  Anita dedicated her life to helping others. She was an international \npublic health expert and development worker who traveled the world, \nworking tirelessly in pursuit of one powerful goal: to improve the \nlives of those less fortunate.\n  Anita began her career in the Peace Corps, where she volunteered for \na 2-year tour in Senegal, a country in a part of the world that she had \ncome to love so much.\n  After graduating from Columbia University, Anita moved to the \nWashington, DC, area where she continued her career as an international \ndevelopment worker.\n  In addition to her day job, Anita helped found the not-for-profit \nTulalens, an organization dedicated to connecting low-income women in \nunderserved communities to quality health services.\n  But out of all of her many accomplishments, Anita was most proud of \nher son, Rohan. Rohan was the light of her life. Anita loved working to \nmake the world a better place for him.\n  Anita's inspiring life was cut short on November 20, 2015, in a \nsenseless act of violent terrorism in Bamako, Mali.\n  But Anita and her life--and the lives of the thousands of people she \ntouched--are far bigger than the tragic event that occurred on that \nday.\n  Anita's love, spirit, and dedication to making the world a better \nplace will have a lasting effect. The world is a better place because \nof Anita and the work that she did.\n  I extend my deepest, heartfelt sympathies to Anita's family and \nfriends--especially to her son, Rohan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/03/senate-section/article/S572-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO EDWARD JOHNSON\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN.

On the cusp of your retirement, I want \n     to acknowledge your leadership, management, and business \n     acumen, which directly and significantly contributed to the \n     Department of Homeland Security's financial management \n     success.\n       You have been a tireless leader in the Department's senior \n     leadership cadre, providing sage advice on a wide range of \n     issues and challenging convention as a valued member of the \n     DHS Chief Financial Officer Council. I am particularly \n     thankful for your most recent efforts at the Federal \n     Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), in building a Planning \n     Programming Budgeting and Execution structure, which \n     championed a disciplined resource management paradigm as a \n     foundational element of the Agency's strategic plan. As part \n     of FEMA's leadership team, you revamped the Agency's Program \n     and Budget Review system, instituting Quarterly Resource \n     Reviews and chartering a senior leadership council \n     responsible for making all resource management \n     recommendations for the Agency. Your steadfast work yielded \n     tangible, positive results in the development of FEMA's \n     yearly budget submission and in ensuring the most effective \n     and efficient use of scarce resources.\n       Thanks to your leadership, FEMA also made significant \n     strides in the financial system modernization arena. FEMA is \n     now in the forefront amongst federal agencies as we rapidly \n     advance the replacement of unsustainable legacy financial \n     systems that bring together diverse equities in an effort to \n     save taxpayer dollars while making government more \n     streamlined and efficient. Simply put, you were the right \n     leader to pull this complex set of financial system needs \n     together and move them into the future. As a result of these \n     and other accomplishments, you were recognized as one of the \n     Federal 100 by FCW, a public sector trade publication.\n       Prior to joining our team at FEMA, you served DHS in a \n     number of capacities where you were continuously recognized \n     as one of the top civil servants. From your service as \n     Director of the Burlington Finance Center for the U.S. \n     Immigration and Customs Enforcement to your tenure at the \n     U.S. Citizens and Immigration Services, you worked tirelessly \n     to advance the Department's mission in service to the \n     American people.\n       On behalf of FEMA's leadership team, our entire workforce \n     and a grateful nation, I want to wish you and your wife Donna \n     good luck and good health as you enter this new chapter in \n     your lives.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 50th \nanniversary of REAL Services, an organization that works to support \nindependence and higher quality of life for the elderly, disabled, and \nlow-income Hoosiers in northern Indiana.\n  In 1966, Lester J. Fox founded REAL Services to create a service \nnetwork for seniors in St. Joseph County. With the help of a Federal \ngrant from the U.S. Administration on Aging, REAL Services developed \nprograms to address the housing, health, employment, and legal needs of \nthose aging in St. Joseph County.\n  REAL Services expanded its reach in 1981 to include assistance \nprograms for poverty-stricken Hoosiers. In 2013, REAL Services merged \nwith the Alzheimer's and Dementia Services of Northern Indiana. Today \nREAL Services assists more than 30,000 elderly, disabled, and destitute \nHoosiers annually in 12 northern Indiana counties through more than 20 \nprograms. This would not be possible without those who volunteer their \ntime to further REAL Services's reach and mission. On average, REAL \nServices has 2,000 volunteers each year.\n  The effectiveness of REAL Services's commitment to preserving the \nself-sufficiency and life quality of elderly, disabled, and low-income \nHoosiers has been highly praised over the years. In May 1974, then-\nGovernor of Indiana, Otis R. Bowen, designated REAL Services as the \nArea Agency on Aging for five counties in northern Indiana. A little \nover a decade later, then-Governor Robert D. Orr designated the \norganization the Community Action Agency in northern Indiana.\n  In 2005, REAL Services was designated by the Federal Government as\n\n[[Page S573]]\n\nan Aging and Disability Resource Center. REAL Services was one of two \nIndiana organizations to pilot this designation, which was funded \njointly by the Federal Administration on Aging and the Center for \nMedicine and Medicaid Services. REAL Services continues its work as an \nAging and Disability Resource Center.\n  Additionally, REAL Services created the first Nutrition Site in the \nUnited States, a program that provides the elderly with meals, \neducational courses, and a sense of community. This model served as an \nexample for nutrition programs instituted across the country as part of \nthe Older Americans Act. It is clear that over the past five decades \nREAL Services has helped make our State and our country a better place \nfor thousands of Hoosiers and Americans.\n  On behalf of the citizens of Indiana, I thank REAL Services for the \nhard work they do every day for the people of our great State who need \nour help the most, and I congratulate them on an important milestone. \nFrom its inception, REAL Services has demonstrated a dedication to \nthose they serve and continues to promote human dignity. I commend REAL \nServices for exemplifying the beliefs we hold as Hoosiers: recognition \nof the value of all people and a willingness to lend a hand to those in \nneed.

Res. 360\n\n       Whereas the National Association of State Departments of \n     Agriculture (referred to in this preamble as ``NASDA'') was \n     established in 1916 to provide a cohesive, science-based \n     voice for State perspectives in discussions on national \n     agriculture policy issues;\n       Whereas the first meeting of NASDA was held on May 4, 1916, \n     in the hearing room of the Committee on Court of Claims of \n     the Senate;\n       Whereas since 1916, NASDA has provided exemplary \n     nonpartisan representation of the departments of agriculture \n     in all 50 States and 4 United States territories in order to \n     promote sound public policy and programs in support of United \n     States agriculture;\n       Whereas NASDA has become a national leader in growing and \n     enhancing agriculture through the forging of partnerships to \n     achieve sound policy outcomes among State departments of \n     agriculture, the Federal Government, and stakeholders;\n       Whereas NASDA has successfully amplified the voices of all \n     State departments of agriculture by achieving consensus on a \n     breadth of issues, including food safety, agriculture labor, \n     international trade, and the environment; and\n       Whereas 1 century later, NASDA continues its deep \n     commitment to promoting the interests of the farmers and \n     ranchers of the United States, both domestically and \n     worldwide: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate congratulates the National \n     Association of State Departments of Agriculture on the \n     celebration of the 100th anniversary of its founding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/03/senate-section/article/S578-3", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S578-S579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 361--URGING ROBUST FUNDING FOR HUMANITARIAN RELIEF \n                               FOR SYRIA\n\n  Mr. CORKER (for himself, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Perdue, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \nMurphy, Mr. Markey, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Coons, Mr. Udall, Mr. Kaine, and \nMr. Menendez) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 361\n\n       Whereas the conflict in Syria, which is in its fifth year, \n     has taken the lives of over 250,000 Syrians and displaced \n     millions more;\n       Whereas the humanitarian needs for Syria are overwhelming \n     and require a sustained, tangible response from the entire \n     international community to ensure that the short- and long-\n     term needs of the Syrian people are addressed;\n       Whereas as the short- and long-term needs of the Syrian \n     people increase, the availability of basic services for the \n     almost 4,600,000 Syrians sheltering in Jordan, Lebanon, and \n     other neighboring countries, which are already under severe \n     strain, is diminishing;\n       Whereas addressing the humanitarian situation in Syria and \n     in Syrian refugee-hosting countries is an essential component \n     to providing stability to the region;\n       Whereas the Government of Kuwait, notably, hosted pledging \n     conferences in 2013, 2014, and 2015 to raise funds for United \n     Nations humanitarian appeals for Syria;\n       Whereas the pledges to previous United Nations humanitarian \n     appeals for Syria have failed to meet the humanitarian needs \n     of the Syrian crisis, as determined by the United Nations;\n       Whereas not all pledges are fully converted into donations, \n     further adding to the difficulty in meeting the humanitarian \n     needs of Syria;\n       Whereas on February 4, 2016, the Governments of the United \n     Kingdom, Germany, Kuwait, and Norway will host a fourth Syria \n     conference in London to raise funds and support for the \n     United Nations humanitarian appeal for Syria;\n       Whereas the fourth Syria conference aims to significantly \n     increase funding--\n       (1) to address the immediate and long-term needs of \n     individuals affected by the Syrian conflict; and\n       (2) to maintain pressure on parties to the conflict to \n     protect civilians affected by the conflict;\n\n       Whereas as of February 2016, the United States is the \n     largest single humanitarian donor to the Syrian crisis and \n     has given over $4,500,000,000 in humanitarian relief for \n     Syria; and\n       Whereas the United Kingdom, Kuwait, Germany, and Norway are \n     allies of the United States and have demonstrated commitment \n     to addressing the humanitarian crisis in Syria: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends the Governments of the United Kingdom, Kuwait, \n     Germany, and Norway for their efforts to address the \n     humanitarian crisis in Syria, including the substantial \n     financial commitments made by the Governments of the United \n     Kingdom, Kuwait, Germany, and Norway;\n       (2) encourages the international community to act with \n     urgency--\n       (A) to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Syria and in \n     Syrian refugee-hosting countries in the region; and\n       (B) to support the upcoming Syria conference in London by \n     joining the United States and other countries with \n     substantial pledges of assistance; and\n       (3) urges each donor country to fulfil the United Nations \n     pledging commitments to Syria to address the short- and long-\n     term humanitarian needs of the Syrian people.\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, Senator Corker and I are submitting a \nresolution today that urges all nations to contribute in order to \naddress the humanitarian crisis in Syria. On February 4, in London, the \nBritish, German, Kuwaiti, and Norwegian governments will join with the \nUnited Nations to host the ``Supporting Syria and the Region'' \nconference.\n  The numbers are well known, but bear repeating. The international \ncommunity has a responsibility to help the 13.5 million vulnerable and \ndisplaced people inside Syria, and the 4.2 million Syrian refugees in \nneighbouring countries. We must step up our efforts.\n  Current pledges to the 2015 UN appeal have not even reached last \nyear's levels--$3.3 billion against an appeal of $8.4 billion. Even \nthis figure still masks the fact that not all pledges are met, building \nup needs for future years. The world must do more, and now is the time \nto act.\n  The United States is already the largest donor to Syria, giving more \nthan $4.5 billion to date, and Congress\n\n[[Page S579]]\n\nhas been instrumental and bipartisan in its support of humanitarian \nrelief for Syria. We must maintain this effort, as the need has never \nbeen greater. But we also need the entire international community to \nstand up on this issue. It cannot just be the responsibility of the \nusual generous donors to meet the needs of Syria.\n  The humanitarian crisis in Syria is a stain on the conscience of the \nworld, and the whole world needs to be part of the solution. This is \nnot just a moral question, although it ought to be. We need to bring \npeace to Syria, food to Syrians, and safety to Syria's children. \nWithout these basic elements, we are allowing a breeding ground for \ndisillusionment, extremism, and indeed terrorism to grow. So this is \nalso about our shared national security interests. Every nation should \ntherefore step up to the plate: all responsibility cannot and should \nnot fall on Syria and its neighbours.\n  We urge all nations to participate in the conference in London on \nFebruary 4, prepared to make significant donations that meet the UN \nappeal. We hope that senior-level representation and contributions by \ndonor states will redefine the nature of this conference to prepare for \nlong term humanitarian support to Syrians.\n  Five years into the Syrian conflict, it is easy for donor fatigue to \nset in. But this is nothing compared to what Syrian refugees are \nexperiencing daily. Whether they have been displaced inside Syria, \nwhether they are building lives in refugee camps in Turkey and Jordan, \nwhether they are trying to integrate into a new city, or whether they \nare risking their lives in crossing open seas, refugees are facing \ndaily challenges to their very existence. Our resolve to alleviate the \nhardships and suffering this conflict has caused must, at a minimum, \nequal theirs.\n  The February 4 conference in London is an opportunity for nations to \nmeet this crisis with the resources and determination necessary to \naddress the short and long term needs of the Syrian people. The \nbipartisan resolution Senator Corker and I are putting forward \nencourages the international community to act with urgency to alleviate \nthe humanitarian crisis in Syria and in Syrian refugee-hosting \ncountries in the region. It encourages nations to not only fulfill \ntheir previous pledges, but to commit to doing more.\n  We must find ways to reduce the barriers preventing refugees from \nrebuilding their lives. Granting refugees the right to work and access \nbasic services, and funding integration programs, are important goals \nin that respect.\n  Education is also key. We must ensure that all children and young \npeople affected by the conflict have access to a safe and quality \neducation by both strengthening national education systems and \ninvesting in alternative learning pathways. When parents can't find \neducational opportunities for their children, they move away or put \ntheir children into the workforce. Without education, we risk losing a \ngeneration of young people.\n  The United States, which has been the largest single humanitarian \ndonor to date, will continue to lead in this effort, along with our \npartners. We will continue to lead because addressing the humanitarian \ncrisis is part and parcel of achieving a political resolution to the \nconflict.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``United States-Jordan Defense \n     Cooperation Act of 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) As of January 22, 2015, the United States Government \n     has provided $3,046,343,000 in assistance to respond to the \n     Syria humanitarian crisis, of which nearly $467,000,000 has \n     been provided to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.\n       (2) As of January 2015, according to the United Nations \n     High Commissioner for Refugees, there were 621,937 registered \n     Syrian refugees in Jordan and 83.8 percent of whom lived \n     outside refugee camps.\n       (3) In 2000, the United States and Jordan signed a free-\n     trade agreement that went into force in 2001.\n       (4) In 1996, the United States granted Jordan major non-\n     NATO ally status.\n       (5) Jordan is suffering from the Syrian refugee crisis and \n     the threat of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant \n     (ISIL).\n       (6) The Government of Jordan was elected as a non-permanent \n     member of the United Nations Security Council for a 2-year \n     term ending in December 2015.\n       (7) Enhanced support for defense cooperation with Jordan is \n     important to the national security of the United States, \n     including through creation of a status in law for Jordan \n     similar to the countries in the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization, Japan, Australia, the Republic of Korea, \n     Israel, and New Zealand, with respect to consideration by \n     Congress of foreign military sales to Jordan.\n       (8) The Colorado National Guard's relationship with the \n     Jordanian military provides a significant benefit to both the \n     United States and Jordan.\n       (9) Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh was brutally murdered \n     by ISIL.\n       (10) On February 3, 2015, Secretary of State John Kerry and \n     Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh signed a new \n     Memorandum of Understanding that reflects the intention to \n     increase United States assistance to the Government of Jordan \n     from $660,000,000 to $1,000,000,000 for each of the years \n     2015 through 2017.\n       (11) On December 5, 2014, in an interview on CBS This \n     Morning, Jordanian King Abdullah II stated--\n       (A) in reference to ISIL, ``This is a Muslim problem. We \n     need to take ownership of this. We need to stand up and say \n     what is wrong''; and\n       (B) ``This is our war. This is a war inside Islam. So we \n     have to own up to it. We have to take the lead. We have to \n     start fighting back.''.\n\n     SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       It should be the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to support the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in its \n     response to the Syrian refugee crisis;\n       (2) to provide necessary assistance to alleviate the \n     domestic burden to provide basic needs for the assimilated \n     Syrian refugees;\n       (3) to cooperate with Jordan to combat the terrorist threat \n     from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) or other \n     terrorist organizations; and\n       (4) to help secure the border between Jordan and its \n     neighbors Syria and Iraq.\n\n     SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) expeditious consideration of certifications of letters \n     of offer to sell defense articles, defense services, design \n     and construction services, and major defense equipment to the \n     Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan under section 36(b) of the Arms \n     Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2776(b)) is fully consistent \n     with United States security and foreign policy interests and \n     the objectives of world peace and security;\n       (2) Congress welcomes the statement of King Abdullah II \n     quoted in section (2)(11); and\n       (3) it is in the interest of peace and stability for \n     regional members of the Global Coalition to Combat ISIL to \n     continue their commitment to, and increase their involvement \n     in, addressing the threat posed by ISIL.\n\n     SEC. 5. ENHANCED DEFENSE COOPERATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--During the 3-year period beginning on the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the Hashemite Kingdom of \n     Jordan shall be treated as if it were a country listed in the \n     provisions of law described in subsection (b) for purposes of \n     applying and administering such provisions of law.\n       (b) Arms Export Control Act.--The provisions of law \n     described in this subsection are--\n       (1) subsections (b)(2), (d)(2)(B), (d)(3)(A)(i), and (d)(5) \n     of section 3 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2753);\n       (2) subsections (e)(2)(A), (h)(1)(A), and (h)(2) of section \n     21 of such Act (22 U.S.C. 2761);\n       (3) subsections (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(6), (c), and (d)(2)(A) \n     of section 36 of such Act (22 U.S.C. 2776);\n       (4) section 62(c)(1) of such Act (22 U.S.C. 2796a(c)(1)); \n     and\n       (5) section 63(a)(2) of such Act (22 U.S.C. 2796b(a)(2)).\n\n     SEC. 6. MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING.\n\n       Subject to the availability of appropriations, the \n     Secretary of State is authorized to enter into a memorandum \n     of understanding with the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan to \n     increase economic support funds, military cooperation, \n     including joint military exercises, personnel exchanges, \n     support for international peacekeeping missions, and enhanced \n     strategic dialogue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3279.

Sec. 1331, the Congressional \n           Accountability Act of 1995, as Amended (``CAA'').\n\n                                Summary:\n\n       The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, PL 104-1 \n     (``CAA''), was enacted into law on January 23, 1995. The CAA, \n     as amended, applies the rights and protections of thirteen \n     federal labor and employment statutes to covered employees \n     and employing offices within the legislative branch of the \n     federal government. Section 210 of the CAA provides that the \n     rights and protections against discrimination in the \n     provision of public services and accommodations established \n     by Titles II and III (sections 201 through 230, 302, 303, and \n     309) of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 \n     U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 12131-12150, 12182, 12183, and 12189 \n     (``ADA'') shall apply to legislative branch entities covered \n     by the CAA. The above provisions of section 210 became \n     effective on January 1, 1997. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(h).\n       The Board of Directors, Office of Compliance, after \n     considering comments to its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking \n     (``NPRM'') published on September 9, 2014 in the \n     Congressional Record, has adopted, and is submitting for \n     approval by the Congress, final regulations implementing \n     section 210 of the CAA.\n       For further information contact: Executive Director, Office \n     of Compliance, Room LA 200, John Adams Building, 110 Second \n     Street SE, Washington, D.C. 20540-1999. Telephone: (202) 724-\n     9250.\n\n                       Supplementary Information:\n\n     Background and Summary\n       Section 210(b) of the CAA provides that the rights and \n     protections against discrimination in the provision of public \n     services and accommodations established by the provisions of \n     Titles II and III (sections 201 through 230, 302, 303, and \n     309) of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 \n     U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 12131-12150, 12182, 12183, and 12189 \n     (''ADA'') shall apply to specified legislative branch \n     offices. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(b). Title II of the ADA prohibits \n     discrimination on the basis of disability in the provision of \n     services, programs, or activities by any ``public entity.'' \n     Section 210(b)(2) of the CAA defines the term ``public \n     entity'' for Title II purposes as any of the listed \n     legislative branch offices that provide public services, \n     programs, or activities. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(b)(2). Title III \n     of the ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of \n     disability by public accommodations and requires places of \n     public accommodation and commercial facilities to be \n     designed, constructed, and altered in compliance with the \n     accessibility standards.\n       Section 210(e) of the CAA requires the Board of Directors \n     of the Office of Compliance to issue regulations implementing \n     Section 210. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(e). Section 210(e) further \n     states that such regulations ``shall be the same as \n     substantive regulations promulgated by the Attorney General \n     and the Secretary of Transportation to implement the \n     statutory provisions referred to in subsection (b) of this \n     section except to the extent that the Board may determine, \n     for good cause shown and stated together with the regulation, \n     that a modification of such regulations would be more \n     effective for the implementation of the rights and \n     protections under this section.'' Id. Section 210(e) further \n     provides that the regulations shall include a method of \n     identifying, for purposes of this section and for different \n     categories of violations of subsection (b), the entity \n     responsible for correction of a particular violation. 2 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1331(e)(3). On September 9, 2014, the Board \n     published in the Congressional Record a NPRM, 160 Cong. Rec. \n     H7363 & 160 Cong. Rec. S5437 (daily ed., Sept. 9, 2014). In \n     response to the NPRM, the Board received four sets of written \n     comments. After due consideration of the comments received in \n     response to the proposed regulations, the Board has adopted \n     and is submitting these final regulations for approval by \n     Congress.\n\n[[Page S625]]\n\n  \n\n     Summary of Comments and Board's Adopted Rules\n       A. Request for additional rulemaking proceedings.\n       One commenter requested that the Board withdraw its \n     proposed regulations and ``create'' new regulations. The \n     commenter suggested that the Board's authority to adopt \n     regulations does not include the authority to incorporate \n     existing regulations by reference and also suggested that the \n     Board would be adopting future changes to the incorporated \n     regulations unless it specified that the regulations in \n     existence on the adoption date were the ones being \n     incorporated rather than the regulations in existence on the \n     issuance date (which was proposed in the NPRM and occurs \n     after Congress has approved the regulations). The Board has \n     determined that further rulemaking proceedings are not \n     required because the publication requirements of Section \n     304(b)(1) of the CAA, which requires compliance with 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 553(b), is satisfied by incorporating ``material readily \n     available to the class of persons affected'' by the proposed \n     regulation. See, 5 U.S.C. Sec. 552(a)(1)(E). Nonetheless, in \n     response to this comment, the Board has modified the proposed \n     regulation to incorporate the regulations in existence on the \n     adoption date rather than the issuance date. In addition, to \n     further avoid any confusion, the adopted regulations require \n     that the full text of the incorporated regulations be \n     published on the Office of Compliance website.\n       B. General comments regarding proposed regulations.\n     1. Compliance with both Titles II and III of the ADA.\n       Several commenters questioned whether it was necessary to \n     adopt regulations under both Title II and Title III when \n     Title II typically applies only to public entities and Title \n     III typically applies only to private entities. Section 210 \n     of the CAA can be confusing because it requires legislative \n     branch offices (which are ``public entities''') to comply \n     with sections of the ADA that are part of both Title II and \n     Title III. Ordinarily, as the commenters suggested, the major \n     distinction between Title II and Title III of the ADA is that \n     Title II solely applies to public entities while Title III \n     solely applies to private entities that are considered public \n     accommodations. In contrast, under the CAA, the legislative \n     branch offices listed in Section 210(a) must comply with \n     Sections 201 through 230 of Title II of the ADA and Sections \n     302, 303 and 309 of Title III of the ADA. 42 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1331(b)(1). For purposes of the application of Title II \n     of the ADA, the term ``public entity'' means any of these \n     legislative branch offices. 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(b)(2). For \n     the purposes of Title III of the ADA, the CAA does not \n     incorporate the definitions contained in Section 301 of Title \n     III, which limits the application of Title III to private \n     entities which own, operate, lease or lease to places of \n     public accommodation. Consequently, since the CAA expressly \n     applies Title III to legislative branch offices that are \n     ``public entities,'' those offices must at all times provide \n     services, programs and activities that are in compliance with \n     Title II of the ADA and, when those services, programs, \n     activities or accommodations are provided directly to the \n     public (as in places of public accommodations), they must \n     also comply with Sections 302, 303 and 309 of Title III of \n     the ADA. In other words, services, programs and activities \n     that involve constituents and other members of the public \n     must comply with both Titles II and III of the ADA, while \n     those services, programs and activities that are not open or \n     available to the public must only comply with Title II (and \n     Title I when employment practices are involved).\n       As noted in the NPRM, Congress applied provisions of both \n     Title II and Title III of the ADA to legislative branch \n     offices to ensure that individuals with disabilities are \n     provided the most access to public services, programs, \n     activities and accommodations provided by law. To that end, \n     the NPRM proposed an admittedly simple rule for deciding \n     which regulation applies when there are differences between \n     the applicable Title II and Title III regulations: the \n     regulation providing the most access shall be followed. In \n     response to the concerns expressed by the commenters, the \n     Board has further reviewed the Title II and III regulations \n     and determined that, when the regulations address the same \n     subject, compliance with the applicable Title II regulation \n     will be sufficient to meet the requirements of both Title II \n     and Title III. For this reason, and to eliminate the \n     potential confusion expressed by the commenters, the Board \n     has adopted only the DOJ's Title II regulation when the DOJ's \n     Title II and Title III regulations address the same subject.\n     2. Providing services, programs, activities or accommodations \n         directly to the public out of a leased space.\n       Several commenters raised questions regarding how the \n     regulations would be applied when a legislative branch office \n     is leasing space from a private landlord. Under the ADA \n     regulations (both Title II and Title III), the space being \n     leased, the building where it is located, the building site, \n     the parking lots and the interior and exterior walkways are \n     all considered to be ``facilities.'' If the facility is being \n     used to meet with members of the public, under the CAA, the \n     facility is a place of public accommodation operated by a \n     public entity and therefore the office must meet the \n     obligations imposed by those sections of Titles II and III of \n     the ADA applied to legislative branch entities under the CAA. \n     Because the private landlord is leasing a facility to a place \n     of public accommodation, the private landlord will also have \n     to comply with the DOJ's Title III regulations, subject to \n     enforcement by the DOJ or by an individual with a disability \n     through legal action. The private landlord is not covered by \n     the CAA.\n       Under the DOJ regulations that are incorporated by the \n     adopted regulations, the obligations imposed by Title II and \n     Title III differ depending upon when the leased facility was \n     constructed. Entities covered by either Title II or Title III \n     of the ADA (or both) must have designed and constructed their \n     facilities in strict compliance with the applicable ADA \n     Standards for Accessible Design (ADA Standards) if they were \n     constructed after January 26, 1992. This means that both \n     landlords and tenants are legally obligated to remove all \n     barriers to access in such leased facilities caused by \n     noncompliance with the applicable ADA Standards. Alterations \n     made after January 26, 1992 to facilities constructed before \n     January 26, 1992 must also be in compliance with the ADA \n     Standards to the maximum extent feasible, and any alterations \n     made to primary function areas after this date trigger a \n     separate obligation to make the path of travel to those areas \n     accessible to the extent that it can be made so without \n     incurring disproportionate costs. If barriers to access exist \n     in these alterations and in the path of travel to altered \n     primary function areas, both the landlord and the tenant are \n     legally obligated to remove those barriers. The regulations \n     allow consideration of the provisions of the lease to \n     determine who is primarily responsible for performing the \n     barrier removal work; \\1\\ however, because the legal duty is \n     jointly imposed upon both of the parties, legal liability for \n     any violation cannot be avoided by a private contract.\\2\\\n       All entities covered by Title III of the ADA who are \n     lessors or lessees of facilities that were both constructed \n     after January 26, 1992, and not altered since that date, must \n     remove access barriers if such removal is ``readily \n     achievable.'' 42 U.S.C. Sec. 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv), 28 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 36.304. The phrase ``readily achievable'' means ``easily \n     accomplishable and able to be carried out without much \n     difficulty or expense.'' 42 U.S.C. Sec. 12181(9); 28 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 36.304(a). Examples of ``readily achievable'' steps for \n     removal of barriers include: installing ramps; making curb \n     cuts in sidewalks and entrances; repositioning shelves, \n     furniture, vending machines, displays, and telephones; adding \n     raised markings and elevator control buttons; installing \n     visual alarms; widening doors; installing accessible door \n     devices; rearranging toilet partitions to increase \n     maneuvering space; raising toilet seats; and creating \n     designated accessible parking spaces. 28 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 36.304(b).\n       Because legislative branch offices are ``public entities'' \n     that must always comply with Title II of the ADA, these \n     offices must also operate each of their services, programs \n     and activities so that the service, program or activity, when \n     viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable \n     by individuals with disabilities. 28 C.F.R. Sec. 35.150(a). \n     While this requirement does not usually require a public \n     entity to make each of its existing facilities accessible and \n     usable by individuals with disabilities [28 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 35.150(a)(1)], a public entity must ``give priority to \n     those methods that offer services, programs, and activities \n     to qualified individuals with disabilities in the most \n     integrated setting appropriate'' when choosing a method of \n     providing readily accessible and usable services, programs \n     and activities. While structural changes in existing \n     facilities are not required when the public entity can show \n     that other methods are effective in meeting this access \n     requirement, when a public entity is renting solely one \n     facility in a locality, the only practical method of \n     providing accessibility is to make sure that this leased \n     facility is readily accessible. When a legislative branch \n     office has only one facility in a particular locality and \n     uses that facility to conduct meetings with constituents, it \n     can be difficult, if not impossible, for that office to show \n     that each of its programs, services and activities meet the \n     accessibility requirements of 28 C.F.R. Sec. 35.150 when that \n     facility is not readily accessible. Constituents using \n     wheelchairs who are unable to attend meetings at a local \n     Congressional office because the facility is not readily \n     accessible do not find that each of the office's services, \n     programs or activities, when viewed in its entirety, is \n     readily accessible or usable by them. Offices are usually \n     placed in a locality so that staff can meet personally with \n     constituents who live nearby. Nearby constituents using \n     wheelchairs who find that they cannot personally participate \n     in such meetings upon reaching the facility are effectively \n     being denied the access being provided to other constituents.\n       Because the adopted regulations adequately explain the \n     rights and responsibilities of the parties involved in \n     leasing facilities to public entities or public \n     accommodations, the adopted regulations contain no changes \n     based upon these comments.\n     3. Access requirements in rural and urban areas.\n       One commenter suggested that the Board should recognize \n     that the access requirements in rural areas differ from those \n     in urban areas and should therefore adopt regulations that \n     recognize this distinction. The ADA is a civil rights statute \n     and not a building code, although it is sometimes mistakenly \n     viewed as one. While alterations and\n\n[[Page S626]]\n\n     construction in rural areas may not be regulated by local \n     building codes, under the ADA, the individuals with \n     disabilities living in those areas are entitled to the same \n     rights and protections as those living in urban areas. This \n     means that public entities and public accommodations must \n     comply with the same applicable ADA access requirements \n     regardless of their location. For this reason, following the \n     DOJ and DOT, the Board has not made any changes in the \n     proposed regulations to reflect distinctions between rural \n     and urban areas.\n       4. Accessibility requirements for leased facilities.\n       In the NPRM, the Board proposed adoption of an Access Board \n     regulation based on 36 C.F.R. Sec.  1190.34 (2004) which \n     since July 23, 2004 has been incorporated into the Access \n     Board's Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Guidelines \n     (``ABAAG''). This regulation provides that buildings and \n     facilities leased with federal funds shall contain certain \n     specified accessible features. Buildings or facilities leased \n     for 12 months or less are not required to comply with the \n     regulation as long as the lease cannot be extended or \n     renewed.\n       The Access Board's leasing regulation implements a key \n     provision of the Architectural Barriers Act (``ABA'') which \n     Congress originally passed in 1968 and amended in 1976. The \n     ABA was originally enacted ``to insure that all public \n     buildings constructed in the future by or on behalf of the \n     Federal Government or with loans or grants from the Federal \n     Government are designed and constructed in such a way that \n     they will be accessible to and usable by the physically \n     handicapped.'' S.Rep. No. 538, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., \n     reprinted in 1968 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News 3214, 3215. \n     Prior to being amended in 1976, the ABA covered only leased \n     facilities that were ``to be leased in whole or in part by \n     the United States after [August 12, 1968], after construction \n     or alteration in accordance with plans and specifications of \n     the United States.'' Pub. L. No. 90-480 Sec. 1, 82 Stat. 718 \n     (1968). In 1975, the GAO issued a report to Congress entitled \n     Further Action Needed to Make All Buildings Accessible to the \n     Physically Handicapped which found that ``leased buildings \n     were consistently more inaccessible [than federally-owned \n     buildings] and posed the most serious problems to the \n     handicapped'' and further found that ``[s]ince the Government \n     leases many existing buildings without substantial \n     alteration, the [ABA's] coverage is incomplete to the extent \n     that those buildings are excluded.'' Comptroller General, \n     Further Action Needed to Make All Buildings Accessible to the \n     Physically Handicapped (July 15, 1975) at 25, 28. In response \n     to the GAO Report, Congress amended the ABA by deleting the \n     phrase ``after construction or alteration in accordance with \n     plans and specifications of the United States'' thereby \n     providing coverage for all buildings and facilities ``to be \n     leased in whole or in part by the United States after \n     [January 1, 1977].'' The House Report accompanying the bill \n     that became law described the purpose of the 1976 Amendments \n     as being to ``assure more effective implementation of the \n     congressional policy to eliminate architectural barriers to \n     physically handicapped persons in most federally occupied or \n     sponsored buildings.'' H.R. Rep. No. 1584--Part I, 94th \n     Cong., 2d Sess. 1 (1976). The hearings on the bill also make \n     it clear that Congress amended the ABA in 1976 to close the \n     loophole through which inaccessible buildings and facilities \n     were leased without alteration. See, Public Buildings \n     Cooperative Use: Hearings on HR 15134 Before the Subcommittee \n     on Public Buildings and Grounds of the House Committee on \n     Public Works and Transportation, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 107 \n     (1976) (statement of Representative Edgar).\n       Consequently, since 1976, a hallmark of federal policy \n     regarding people with disabilities has been to require \n     accessibility of buildings and facilities constructed or \n     leased using federal funds. Although, in the CAA, Congress \n     required legislative branch compliance with only the public \n     access provisions of the ADA rather than the Rehabilitation \n     Act of 1973 or the ABA, the ADA itself was enacted in 1990 to \n     expand the access rights of individuals with disabilities \n     beyond what was previously provided by the Rehabilitation Act \n     and the ABA. One of the sections of the ADA that Congress \n     incorporated into the CAA is Section 204. Section 204 \n     requires that the regulations promulgated under the ADA with \n     respect to existing facilities ``shall be consistent'' with \n     the regulations promulgated by the DOJ in 28 C.F.R. Part 39. \n     42 U.S.C. Sec. 12134(b). Under 28 C.F.R. Sec. 39.150(b), a \n     covered entity is required to meet accessibility requirements \n     to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of \n     1968, as amended, and any regulations implementing it.\n       As several commenters noted, when the DOJ promulgated its \n     ADA regulations in 1991, it stated in its guidelines that it \n     had intentionally omitted a regulation that required public \n     entities to lease only accessible facilities because to do so \n     ``would significantly restrict the options of State and local \n     governments in seeking leased space, which would be \n     particularly burdensome in rural or sparsely populated \n     areas.'' 29 C.F.R. Pt. 35, App. B Sec. 35.151. In these same \n     guidelines, however, the DOJ also noted that, under the \n     Access Board's regulations, the federal government may not \n     lease facilities unless they meet the minimum accessibility \n     requirements specified in 36 C.F.R. Sec. 1190.34 (2004) (and \n     now in ABAAG Sec. F202.6). This is true even if the facility \n     is located in rural or sparsely populated areas. None of the \n     commenters provided any specific examples of how complying \n     with a regulation regarding leased facilities otherwise \n     applicable to the federal government would be unduly \n     burdensome. Since the supply of accessible facilities has \n     increased during the past twenty-four years through \n     alterations and new construction, the burdensomeness of this \n     regulation is certainly much less than it was in 1991.\n       A commenter also noted that under the current House rules a \n     Member may not use representational funds to obtain \n     reimbursement for capital improvements and this might affect \n     the removal of barriers in facilities that are inaccessible. \n     However, the proposed regulation does not require that any \n     Member specifically pay for capital improvements. Instead, \n     prior to entering into a lease with a Member for a facility \n     that is in need of alterations to meet the minimum \n     accessibility requirements, the landlord is obligated to make \n     the needed alterations as a condition of doing business with \n     Congress. While it is likely that the landlord will recover \n     some of the costs associated with these alterations by \n     increasing the rent paid by federal tenants, Congress \n     determined when it amended the ABA to provide coverage for \n     all leased facilities that the increased cost associated with \n     requiring the federal government to lease only accessible \n     facilities would be minimal and well worth the benefit gained \n     by improving accessibility to all federal facilities. H.R. \n     Rep. No. 1584--Part II, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 9, reprinted in \n     1976 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News 5566, 5571-72. In the \n     NPRM, the Board noted that the most common ADA public access \n     complaint received by the OOC General Counsel from \n     constituents relates to the lack of ADA access to spaces \n     being leased by legislative branch offices. Given the \n     frequency of these complaints and the clear Congressional \n     policy embodied in the ABA requiring leasing of only \n     accessible spaces by the United States, the Board found good \n     cause to propose adoption of the Access Board's regulation \n     formerly known as 36 C.F.R. Sec. 1190.34 (2004) and now known \n     as Sec. F202.6 of the ABAAG and the ABAAS. Because, under CAA \n     Sec. 210(e)(2), the OOC Board of Directors (``the Board'') is \n     authorized to propose a regulation that does not follow the \n     DOJ regulations when it determines ``for good cause shown and \n     stated together with the regulation, that a modification of \n     such regulations would be more effective for the \n     implementation of the rights and protections under this \n     section,'' the Board has decided to require the leasing of \n     accessible spaces as required in Sec. F202.6 of the ABAAS.\n       5. Regulations regarding the investigation and prosecution \n     of charges of discrimination and regarding periodic \n     inspections and reporting.\n       Several commenters suggested that the regulations in Part \n     2, regarding the investigation and prosecution of charges of \n     discrimination, and in Part 3, regarding periodic inspections \n     and reporting, describe powers of the General Counsel that \n     are beyond what is provided in the CAA. These commenters \n     suggested that, under the CAA, the General Counsel does not \n     have the discretion to determine how to conduct \n     investigations and inspections nor the authority to act upon \n     ADA requests for inspection from persons who request \n     anonymity or persons who do not identify themselves as \n     disabled.\n       Section 210(d) of the CAA requires the General Counsel to \n     accept and investigate charges of discrimination filed by \n     qualified individuals with disabilities who allege a \n     violation of Section 210 of the CAA by a covered entity. The \n     CAA provides no details regarding how charges shall be \n     investigated. Similarly, while Section 210(f) of the CAA \n     requires that the General Counsel, on a regular basis, at \n     least once each Congress, inspect the facilities of covered \n     entities to ensure compliance with Section 210 of the CAA and \n     submit a report to Congress containing the results of such \n     periodic inspections, the statute provides no details \n     regarding how the inspections are to be conducted.\n       ``The power of an administrative agency to administer a \n     congressionally created . . . program necessarily requires \n     the formulation of policy and the making of rules to fill any \n     gap left, implicitly or explicitly, by Congress.'' Morton v. \n     Ruiz, 415 U.S. 199, 231, 94 S.Ct. 1055, 1072, 39 L.Ed.2d 270 \n     (1974) (cited with approval by Chevron v. Nat'l Resources \n     Defense Council, 467 U.S. 837, 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 \n     L.Ed.2d 694 (1984)). When Congress expressly leaves a gap for \n     the agency to fill, there is an express delegation of \n     authority to the agency to elucidate the statute. Id. at 844.\n       The OOC General Counsel has been conducting ADA inspections \n     since January 23, 1995, when the CAA authorized commencement \n     of such inspections. The OOC General Counsel has been \n     investigating charges of discrimination since January 1, \n     1997, the effective date of Section 210(d). Since the \n     creation of the office, the General Counsel has endeavored to \n     conduct these inspections and investigations in a manner that \n     is not disruptive to the offices involved and has not \n     received complaints or comments indicating that its ADA \n     investigations or inspections have ever been disruptive. The \n     regulations merely propose that the General Counsel conduct \n     investigations and inspections in the manner that they have \n     always been conducted.\n       Due to the lack of inspection resources, the General \n     Counsel is unable to conduct\n\n[[Page S627]]\n\n     ADA inspections of all facilities used by the covered \n     entities at least once each Congress. The General Counsel is \n     unable to inspect all of the facilities located in the \n     Washington, D.C. area, much less all of the facilities used \n     by the district and state offices that are also covered by \n     Section 210 of the CAA. In light of the General Counsel's \n     limited resources and the large number of facilities that are \n     covered by the CAA, the General Counsel must prioritize its \n     ADA inspections. The proposed regulations allow the General \n     Counsel to continue its practice of giving priority to \n     inspection of areas that have raised concerns from \n     constituents. By allowing anyone to file a request for \n     inspection and by allowing requestors to remain anonymous to \n     the covered office (the requestor is required to provide his \n     or her identity to the General Counsel), the General Counsel \n     is better able to identify and examine potential access \n     problems and then pass this information on to the covered \n     offices who are in the best position to address these \n     potential issues. The General Counsel has found that, without \n     exception, covered offices have been very responsive to the \n     access concerns raised by constituents through the request \n     for inspection process and are usually appreciative of \n     information concerning constituent access issues of which \n     they might otherwise be unaware.\n       Under the proposed regulations, requests for inspection \n     filed anonymously or by persons without disabilities are not \n     considered ``charges of discrimination'' that could result in \n     a formal complaint being filed by the General Counsel against \n     the covered office. Unlike Section 215 of the CAA, relating \n     to occupational safety and health (``OSH'') inspections and \n     investigations, Section 210 of the CAA does not authorize the \n     General Counsel to initiate enforcement proceedings unless a \n     qualified individual with a disability has filed a charge of \n     discrimination. But like Section 215, Section 210 of the CAA \n     does authorize the General Counsel to inspect any facility \n     and report its findings to the covered offices and to \n     Congress. The proposed regulations merely recognize the \n     General Counsel's long standing and common sense approach \n     that concentrates limited inspection resources on the areas \n     of most concern to constituents.\n       The other concern mentioned in the comments is that the \n     proposed regulations define the General Counsel's \n     investigatory authority in a manner that is broader than what \n     Section 210 provides. Section 210 directs the General Counsel \n     to investigate charges of discrimination without specifying \n     how those investigations are to be conducted. To fill this \n     gap, the proposed regulations allow the General Counsel to \n     use modes of inquiry and investigation traditionally employed \n     or useful to execute the investigatory authority provided by \n     the statute which can include conducting inspections, \n     interviewing witnesses, requesting documents and requiring \n     answers to written questions. These methods of investigation \n     are consistent with how other federal agencies investigate \n     charges of discrimination. There is nothing in this proposed \n     regulation that is contrary to the statutory language in \n     Section 210. For this reason, the Board has not made any \n     changes in the adopted regulations in response to these \n     comments.\n       6. Request to create new regulations relating to safety and \n     security.\n       One commenter suggested that the Board use these \n     regulations to recognize the Capitol Police Board's statutory \n     authority relating to safety and security and create new \n     regulations defining this authority with respect to Section \n     210 of the CAA. In response, the Board does not find any \n     statutory language in the CAA which would allow it to define \n     the authority of the Capitol Police Board by regulation and \n     therefore does not find good cause to modify the language of \n     the DOJ or DOT regulations in the manner requested.\n       7. Comments to specific regulations.\n       a. Sec. 1.101--Purpose and Scope. One commenter suggested \n     that, when describing how the CAA incorporates sections of \n     Title II and III of the ADA, the regulation should use the \n     language contained in the incorporated statutory sections. \n     The Board has made this change in the adopted regulations. \n     The same commenter suggested that mediation should be \n     mentioned when describing the charge and complaint process. \n     The Board has also made this change in the adopted \n     regulations.\n       b. Sec. 1.102--Definitions. One commenter suggested that \n     the incorporated definition of the ``Act'' should be \n     reconciled with the definition of ``ADA'' provided in the \n     proposed definitions. The Board has added ``or Americans with \n     Disabilities Act'' after ``ADA'' in the definition section of \n     the adopted regulations. This will clarify that references to \n     the ``Americans with Disabilities Act'' or the ``Act'' will \n     refer to only those sections of the ADA that are applied to \n     the legislative branch by the CAA. One commenter suggested \n     that there should be some discussion in this section \n     regarding when a covered entity will be considered to be \n     operating a ``place of public accommodation'' within the \n     meaning of Title III. The Board has provided additional \n     guidance on this topic in this Notice of Adoption and has \n     added a provision in the adopted regulations providing that \n     the regulations shall be interpreted in a manner consistent \n     with the Notice of Adoption.\n       c. Sec. 1.103--Authority of the Board. One commenter \n     suggested that this section be modified in a way that would \n     allow the Board to adopt the Pedestrian Right of Way \n     Accessible Guidelines (``PROWAG'') as a standard. Because the \n     PROWAG are only proposed guidelines and they have not been \n     adopted by the DOT as standards by regulation, these are not \n     among the current DOT regulations that the Board can adopt \n     under Section 210(e)(2) of the CAA. For this reason, the \n     Board has not acted upon this suggestion.\n       d. Sec. 1.104--Method for identifying entity responsible. A \n     commenter suggested that the term ``this section'' refers to \n     both the statutory and regulatory language at different \n     times. In response to this suggestion, the Board has changed \n     the first reference to ``this section'' to ``Section 210 of \n     the CAA'' in the adopted regulation. A commenter has also \n     suggested that the regulation refers to allocating \n     responsibility between covered entities rather than \n     identifying the entity responsible and notes that there may \n     be instances where access issues arise because a private \n     landlord has failed to comply with the lease with the covered \n     entity and the General Counsel would be unable to ``allocate \n     responsibility'' between the covered entity and the private \n     landlord. In response, the Board notes that Section 1.104(c) \n     describes how the entities responsible for correcting \n     violations are identified. Section 1.104(d) describes how \n     responsibility is allocated when more than one covered entity \n     is responsible for the correction. Because a private landlord \n     is not a ``covered entity'' within the meaning of the CAA, \n     Section 1.104(d) would not be applicable when deciding how to \n     allocate responsibility between a private landlord and a \n     covered legislative branch office. To further clarify this \n     distinction, the Board has added the word ``covered'' before \n     ``entity'' in Section 1.104(d) of the adopted regulation. \n     Another commenter requested that this regulation be clarified \n     so that only violations of the sections of the ADA \n     incorporated in the CAA will be considered violations. In \n     response, the Board notes that this has been accomplished by \n     defining the ``ADA'' as including only those sections \n     incorporated by the CAA. Another comment requested a \n     definition of the term ``order'' in the last sentence of \n     Section 1.104(d). In response, this word has been deleted in \n     the adopted regulations.\n       e. Sec. 1.105--Title II Regulations incorporated by \n     reference. The Architect of the Capitol suggested a slight \n     modification to the definition of ``historic property'' in \n     Sec. 1.105(a)(4) which would add the word ``properties'' to \n     the list including ``facilities'' and ``buildings.'' The \n     Board has made this change in the adopted regulations. \n     Another commenter requested that the definition of \n     ``historic'' properties be modified to include properties \n     designated as historic by state or local law to cover \n     district offices located in such buildings. In response, the \n     Board notes that the definition contained in Sec. 1.105(a)(4) \n     merely supplements the definition of historic properties \n     contained in Section 35.104, which includes those properties \n     designated as historic under State or local law. To further \n     clarify this, the Board has added the word ``also'' to the \n     definition in the adopted regulation. Another comment \n     suggested that, rather than providing a general rule of \n     interpretation, all potentially conflicting regulations \n     should be rewritten to reconcile all possible conflicts. In \n     response, as noted earlier in response to the general \n     comments, the Board has adopted only the Title II regulation \n     when both a DOJ Title II and Title III regulation address the \n     same subject.\n       (1) Section 35.103(a). A comment suggested that this \n     regulation should not be adopted because it references Title \n     V of the Rehabilitation Act which includes employment \n     discrimination issues. In response, the Board notes that \n     Section 35.103(a) is based on Section 204 of the ADA, 42 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 12134, which is incorporated by reference into \n     the CAA; consequently, this provision remains in the adopted \n     regulations.\n       (2) Section 35.104. A comment suggested that this \n     regulation should be rewritten to delete all terms that are \n     irrelevant, duplicative, or otherwise inapplicable. In \n     response, the Board notes that definitions of terms that are \n     not used in the incorporated regulations are not incorporated \n     by reference, as made clear by the additional language added \n     in Sec. 1.105(a); consequently, there is no need to rewrite \n     the regulation.\n       (3) Section 35.105 (Self-Evaluation) and Section 35.106 \n     (Notice). A comment suggested that these regulations should \n     not be adopted because they might require covered entities to \n     report findings to the OOC or keep and maintain certain \n     records. The Board does not find this reason to be ``good \n     cause'' for modifying the existing DOJ regulation. Unlike \n     some of the other statutes incorporated by the CAA, the ADA \n     does not contain a specific section about recordkeeping that \n     Congress declined to apply to legislative branch entities.\n       (4) Section 35.107 (Designation of responsible employee and \n     adoption of grievance procedures). A comment suggested that \n     this regulation should not be adopted because the CAA \n     contains other enforcement provisions. The Board does not \n     find ``good cause'' for modifying the existing DOJ \n     regulation. The DOJ placed these provisions in the \n     regulations even though the ADA contains enforcement \n     provisions. These regulations provide an opportunity to \n     promptly address access issues by allowing individuals with \n     disabilities to complain directly to the covered entity about \n     an access problem.\n       (5) Section 35.131 (Illegal use of drugs). A comment \n     suggested that this regulation should not be adopted because \n     it may raise\n\n[[Page S628]]\n\n     Fourth Amendment issues. The Board finds that there is not \n     ``good cause'' for modifying the existing DOJ regulation. The \n     Fourth Amendment also applies to state and local governments. \n     This regulation exists to make clear that covered entities \n     can legally prohibit participants in government sponsored \n     sport and recreational activities from illegally using drugs.\n       (6) Section 35.133 (Maintenance of accessible features). A \n     comment suggested that this regulation should be modified to \n     exclude offices that have no ``direct care and control'' over \n     accessible features because only certain offices control the \n     common areas in buildings. In response, the Board finds that \n     there is not ``good cause'' for modifying the existing DOJ \n     regulation. The entity or entities responsible for correcting \n     violations are identified in accordance with Section 1.104(c) \n     of the Proposed Regulations.\n       (7) Section 35.137 (Mobility Devices). A comment suggested \n     that this regulation should be modified to exclude offices \n     that do not have direct control over the daily operation of \n     legislative branch facilities. In response, the Board has \n     failed to find ``good cause'' for modifying the existing DOJ \n     regulation. The entity or entities responsible for correcting \n     violations are identified in accordance with Section 1.104(c) \n     of the Proposed Regulations.\n       (8) Section 35.150 (Existing Facilities). A comment \n     suggested that this proposed regulation should be modified so \n     that it requires that only accessible facilities be leased \n     and that Section 35.150(d) be removed because it requires the \n     development of a transition plan which imposes recordkeeping \n     requirements not adopted in the CAA. The Board does not find \n     ``good cause'' for modifying the existing DOJ regulation. The \n     accessibility requirements of leased facilities are addressed \n     in a separate regulation. Regarding transition plans, as \n     noted earlier, unlike some of the other statutes incorporated \n     by the CAA, the ADA does not contain a specific section about \n     recordkeeping that Congress declined to apply to legislative \n     branch entities. The transition planning requirement is a key \n     element of the DOJ regulations since it compels public \n     entities to develop a plan for making all of their facilities \n     accessible.\n       (9) Section 35.160 (Communications--General) A comment \n     suggested modifying this regulation so that it is consistent \n     with Section 36.303(c) (Effective communication). In \n     response, the Board notes that the adopted regulations do not \n     include Section 36.303(c) so there is no longer a reason for \n     modifying the existing DOJ Title II regulation.\n       (10) Section 35.163 (Information and Signage). A comment \n     suggested excluding offices that do not have direct control \n     over signage in common areas from this regulation. In \n     response, the Board does not find ``good cause'' for \n     modifying the existing DOJ regulation. The entity or entities \n     responsible for correcting violations are identified in \n     accordance with Section 1.104(c) of the adopted regulations.\n       (11) Appendices to Part 35 Regulations. A commenter \n     suggested correcting the titles of the Appendices to Parts 35 \n     and 36. The titles have been corrected in the adopted \n     regulations.\n       f. Sec. 1.105--Title III Regulations incorporated by \n     reference.\n       (1) Section 36.101 (Purpose). A comment suggested that this \n     regulation be modified to state that only those sections of \n     Title III incorporated by the CAA are being implemented. The \n     Board finds that this change is not necessary because the \n     adopted regulations define the term ``Americans with \n     Disabilities Act'' as including only those sections of the \n     ADA incorporated by the CAA.\n       (2) Section 36.103 (Relationship with other Laws). A \n     comment suggested deleting this regulation because it \n     references Title V of the Rehabilitation Act. In response, \n     the Board notes that Section 36.103 is based in part on \n     Section 204 of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 12134, which is \n     incorporated by reference into the CAA, and therefore finds \n     no cause for deleting this regulation.\n       (3) Section 36.104 (Definitions). Several comments \n     suggested that this regulation be modified to remove all \n     definitions that are irrelevant, duplicative, or otherwise \n     inapplicable. The Board notes that definitions of terms that \n     are not used in the incorporated regulations are not \n     incorporated by reference and therefore finds no cause for \n     altering the regulation. As noted earlier, because the Notice \n     of Adoption will be included as an appendix to the \n     regulations, the notice will serve as guidance for \n     interpreting the regulations.\n       (4) Section 36.209 (Illegal use of drugs). The Board has \n     not responded to comments regarding this regulation because \n     it has not been incorporated into the adopted regulations.\n       (5) Section 36.211 (Maintenance of accessible features). \n     The Board has not responded to comments regarding this \n     regulation because it has not been incorporated into the \n     adopted regulations.\n       (6) Section 36.303 (Effective communication). The Board has \n     not responded to comments regarding this regulation because \n     it has not been incorporated into the adopted regulations.\n       (7) Section 36.304 (Removal of Barriers). A comment \n     suggested modifying this regulation to acknowledge that the \n     General Counsel has no authority over private landlords. The \n     Board does not find good cause for modifying this regulation. \n     As noted earlier, there is nothing in the regulations \n     suggesting that the CAA applies to private landlords. In many \n     cases, barrier removal is the responsibility of both the \n     landlord and the tenant. If the tenant has a lease provision \n     that places this responsibility on the landlord, it is up to \n     the tenant to take appropriate action to enforce this \n     provision.\n       (8) Sections 36.402 (Alterations), 36.403 (Alterations: \n     Path of travel), 36.404 (Alterations: Elevator exemption), \n     36.405 (Alterations: Historic preservation) and 36.406 \n     (Standards for new construction and alterations). A comment \n     suggested modifying these regulations to consider the limited \n     control that some offices have over capital improvement and \n     alterations to buildings and to modify the historic \n     preservation definition to include buildings designated as \n     historic by state and local governments. The Board does not \n     find good cause for modifying the existing DOJ regulations. \n     The entity or entities responsible for correcting violations \n     are identified in accordance with Section 1.104(c) of the \n     adopted regulations. As noted earlier, the definition \n     contained in Sec. 1.105(a)(4) merely supplements the \n     definition of historic properties contained in Section \n     36.405(a), which includes those properties designated as \n     historic under State or local law.\n       (9) Appendices to Part 36 Regulations. A commenter \n     suggested correcting the titles of the Appendices to Parts 35 \n     and 36. The titles have been corrected in the adopted \n     regulations.\n       g. Section 1.105(e)--36 C.F.R. Part 1190 (2004) & ABAAG \n     Sec. F202.6\n       (1) Several commenters suggested that 36 C.F.R. Part 1190 \n     (2004) should not be adopted because it is no longer in the \n     Code of Federal Regulations. The Board does not find good \n     cause to reconsider its decision to adopt this regulation. As \n     noted earlier, although the regulation was removed from the \n     C.F.R. in 2004 when the substance of the regulation became \n     part of the ABA Accessibility Guidelines (``ABAAG'') at \n     Sec. F202.6, it is still an enforceable standard applied to \n     the United States Government. Since 1976, when Congress \n     amended the ABA, it has been a hallmark of federal policy \n     regarding people with disabilities to require accessibility \n     of buildings and facilities constructed or leased using \n     federal funds.\n       h. Part 2--Matters Pertaining to Investigation and \n     Prosecution of Charges of Discrimination\n       (1) Section 2.101 (Purpose and Scope). Several commenters \n     suggested that this regulation explain in more detail how the \n     General Counsel will exercise statutory authority by \n     procedural rule or policy. In response, the Board has deleted \n     this sentence from the adopted regulation.\n       (2) Section 2.102(b). A comment suggested that this \n     regulation be modified to further clarify what ``other \n     means'' can be used to ``file a charge'' other than those \n     listed in the regulation. In response, the Board has deleted \n     the reference to ``other means.''\n       (3) Section 2.102(c). Commenters suggested that this \n     regulation should be modified because subpart (2) of the \n     definition of ``the occurrence of the alleged violation'' is \n     currently phrased in a way that seems to assume that a \n     violation has occurred and is too broad because it might \n     allow a charge to be filed beyond 180 days of the date of the \n     alleged discrimination. In response to these comments, the \n     adopted regulations retain only the definition of occurrence \n     in subpart (1).\n       (4) Section 2.103. Commenters suggested modifying this \n     regulation because it appears to expand the General Counsel's \n     authority beyond what the CAA provides. For the reasons \n     stated earlier in the response to the general comments, the \n     Board disagrees with this assessment and therefore this \n     section has not been changed in the adopted regulations.\n       (5) Section 2.107(a)(2). Commenters suggested removing this \n     regulation because they believe that the CAA does not provide \n     compensatory damages as a remedy for violations of Section \n     210. After due consideration of these comments, the Board has \n     decided that the issue of what constitutes an appropriate \n     remedy should be decided on a case-by-case basis through the \n     statutory hearing and appeals process rather than by \n     regulation. It should be noted, however, that the analysis in \n     Lane v. Pena, 518 U.S. 187 (1996) may not be applicable to \n     ADA cases under the CAA by virtue of the language in Section \n     210(b)(2) which defines ``public entity'' as including any of \n     the covered entities listed in Section 210(a) and the \n     language in Section 210(c) which provides for ``such remedy \n     as would be appropriate if awarded under section 203 or \n     308(a) of the American with Disabilities Act of 1990.'' These \n     provisions, when read together, may very well constitute an \n     express waiver of sovereign immunity for all damages that can \n     be appropriately awarded against a public entity, which would \n     include compensatory damages.\n       i. Part 3--Matters Pertaining to Periodic Inspections and \n     Reporting\n       (1) Section 3.101 (Purpose and Scope). Several commenters \n     suggested that this regulation explain in more detail how the \n     General Counsel will exercise statutory authority by \n     procedural rule or policy. In response, the Board has deleted \n     this sentence from the adopted regulation.\n       (2) Section 3.102 (Definitions). A commenter suggested that \n     the definition of ``facilities of a covered entity'' be \n     narrowed so that the General Counsel would only inspect \n     spaces occupied solely by a legislative branch office and \n     would not inspect common spaces, entrances or accessible \n     pathways used to access the solely occupied spaces. The Board \n     finds that such a narrow definition of ``facilities of a \n     covered entity'' would\n\n[[Page S629]]\n\n     be inconsistent with the DOJ regulations and the purpose of \n     the statutory mandate to inspect facilities for compliance \n     with Titles II and III of the ADA; therefore, it has not \n     modified this definition in the adopted regulations.\n       (3) Section 3.103 (Inspection Authority). Commenters \n     suggested that the General Counsel not be allowed to conduct \n     an inspection or investigation initiated by someone who \n     wishes to remain anonymous. For the reasons stated earlier in \n     response to the general comments, the Board rejects this \n     suggestion and has therefore not changed this section in the \n     adopted regulations. The Architect of the Capitol suggested \n     that, in the interest of simplicity and timeliness, Section \n     3.103(d) be shortened to: ``The Office of the Architect of \n     the Capitol shall, within one year from the effective date of \n     these regulations, develop a process with the General Counsel \n     to identify potential barriers to access prior to the \n     completion of alteration and construction projects.'' Because \n     the language used in the NPRM more thoroughly describes what \n     this preconstruction process should entail, the Board does \n     not find good cause to modify this regulation in the manner \n     suggested.\n\n                          Adopted Regulations:\n\n     PART 1--MATTERS OF GENERAL APPLICABILITY TO ALL REGULATIONS \n                   PROMULGATED UNDER SECTION 210 OF THE \n                   CONGRESSIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1995\n\n     Sec. 1.101 PURPOSE AND SCOPE\n     Sec. 1.102 DEFINITIONS\n     Sec. 1.103 AUTHORITY OF THE BOARD\n\n     Sec. 1.104 METHOD FOR IDENTIFYING THE ENTITY RESPONSIBLE FOR \n       CORRECTING VIOLATIONS OF SECTION 210\n\n     Sec. 1.105 REGULATIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE\n\n     Sec. 1.101 Purpose and scope.\n       (a) CAA. Enacted into law on January 23, 1995, the \n     Congressional Accountability Act (``CAA'') in Section 210(b) \n     provides that the rights and protections against \n     discrimination in the provision of public services and \n     accommodations established by sections 201 through 230, 302, \n     303, and 309 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, \n     42 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 12131-12150, 12182, 12183, and 12189 \n     (``ADA''), shall apply to the following entities:\n       (1) each office of the Senate, including each office of a \n     Senator and each committee;\n       (2) each office of the House of Representatives, including \n     each office of a Member of the House of Representatives and \n     each committee;\n       (3) each joint committee of the Congress;\n       (4) the Office of Congressional Accessibility Services;\n       (5) the United States Capitol Police;\n       (6) the Congressional Budget Office;\n       (7) the Office of the Architect of the Capitol (including \n     the Botanic Garden);\n       (8) the Office of the Attending Physician; and\n       (9) the Office of Compliance;\n       Title II of the ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis \n     of disability in the provision of public services, programs, \n     activities by any ``public entity.'' Section 210(b)(2) of the \n     CAA provides that for the purpose of applying Title II of the \n     ADA the term ``public entity'' means any entity listed above \n     that provides public services, programs, or activities. Title \n     III of the ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of \n     disability by public accommodations and requires places of \n     public accommodation and commercial facilities to be \n     designed, constructed, and altered in compliance with \n     accessibility standards. Section 225(f) of the CAA provides \n     that, ``[e]xcept where inconsistent with definitions and \n     exemptions provided in [this Act], the definitions and \n     exemptions of the [ADA] shall apply under [this Act.]'' 2 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1361(f)(1).\n       Section 210(d) of the CAA requires that the General Counsel \n     of the Office of Compliance accept and investigate charges of \n     discrimination filed by qualified individuals with \n     disabilities who allege a violation of Title II or Title III \n     of the ADA by a covered entity. If the General Counsel \n     believes that a violation may have occurred, the General \n     Counsel may request, but not participate in, mediation under \n     Section 403 of the CAA and may file with the Office a \n     complaint under Section 405 of the CAA against any entity \n     responsible for correcting the violation. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1331(d).\n       Section 210(f) of the CAA requires that the General Counsel \n     of the Office of Compliance on a regular basis, and at least \n     once each Congress, conduct periodic inspections of all \n     covered facilities and to report to Congress on compliance \n     with disability access standards under Section 210. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1331(f).\n       (b) Purpose and scope of regulations. The regulations set \n     forth herein (Parts 1, 2, and 3) are the substantive \n     regulations that the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance has promulgated pursuant to Section 210(e) of the \n     CAA. Part 1 contains the general provisions applicable to all \n     regulations under Section 210, the method of identifying \n     entities responsible for correcting a violation of Section \n     210, and the list of executive branch regulations \n     incorporated by reference which define and clarify the \n     prohibition against discrimination on the basis of disability \n     in the provision of public services and accommodations. Part \n     2 contains the provisions pertaining to investigation and \n     prosecution of charges of discrimination. Part 3 contains the \n     provisions regarding the periodic inspections and reports to \n     Congress on compliance with the disability access standards.\n\n     Sec. 1.102 Definitions.\n\n       Except as otherwise specifically provided in these \n     regulations, as used in these regulations:\n       (a) Act or CAA means the Congressional Accountability Act \n     of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-1, 109 Stat. 3, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1301-\n     1438).\n       (b) ADA or Americans with Disabilities Act means those \n     sections of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 \n     incorporated by reference into the CAA in Section 210: 42 \n     U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 12131-12150, 12182, 12183, and 12189.\n       (c) Covered entity and public entity include any of the \n     entities listed in Sec. 1.101(a) that provide public \n     services, programs, or activities, or operates a place of \n     public accommodation within the meaning of Section 210 of the \n     CAA. In the regulations implementing Title III, private \n     entity includes covered entities.\n       (d) Board means the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance.\n       (e) Office means the Office of Compliance.\n       (f) General Counsel means the General Counsel of the Office \n     of Compliance.\n\n     Sec. 1.103 Authority of the Board.\n\n       Pursuant to Sections 210 and 304 of the CAA, the Board is \n     authorized to issue regulations to implement the rights and \n     protections against discrimination on the basis of disability \n     in the provision of public services and accommodations under \n     the ADA. Section 210(e) of the CAA directs the Board to \n     promulgate regulations implementing Section 210 that are \n     ``the same as substantive regulations promulgated by the \n     Attorney General and the Secretary of Transportation to \n     implement the statutory provisions referred to in subsection \n     (b) except to the extent that the Board may determine, for \n     good cause shown and stated together with the regulation, \n     that a modification of such regulations would be more \n     effective for the implementation of the rights and \n     protections under this section.'' 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(e). \n     Specifically, it is the Board's considered judgment, based on \n     the information available to it at the time of promulgation \n     of these regulations, that, with the exception of the \n     regulations adopted and set forth herein, there are no other \n     ``substantive regulations promulgated by the Attorney General \n     and the Secretary of Transportation to implement the \n     statutory provisions referred to in subsection (b) [of \n     Section 210 of the CAA]'' that need be adopted.\n       In promulgating these regulations, the Board has made \n     certain technical and nomenclature changes to the regulations \n     as promulgated by the Attorney General and the Secretary of \n     Transportation. Such changes are intended to make the \n     provisions adopted accord more naturally to situations in the \n     Legislative Branch. However, by making these changes, the \n     Board does not intend a substantive difference between these \n     regulations and those of the Attorney General and/or the \n     Secretary of Transportation from which they are derived. \n     Moreover, such changes, in and of themselves, are not \n     intended to constitute an interpretation of the regulations \n     or of the statutory provisions of the CAA upon which they are \n     based.\n\n     Sec. 1.104 Method for identifying the entity responsible for \n       correction of violations of section 210.\n\n       (a) Purpose and scope. Section 210(e)(3) of the CAA \n     provides that regulations under Section 210(e) include a \n     method of identifying, for purposes of Section 210 of the CAA \n     and for categories of violations of Section 210(b), the \n     entity responsible for correcting a particular violation. \n     This section sets forth the method for identifying \n     responsible entities for the purpose of allocating \n     responsibility for correcting violations of Section 210(b).\n       (b) Violations. A covered entity may violate Section 210(b) \n     if it discriminates against a qualified individual with a \n     disability within the meaning of Title II or Title III of the \n     ADA.\n       (c) Entities Responsible for Correcting Violations. \n     Correction of a violation of the rights and protections \n     against discrimination is the responsibility of the entities \n     listed in subsection (a) of Section 210 of the CAA that \n     provide the specific public service, program, activity, or \n     accommodation that forms the basis for the particular \n     violation of Title II or Title III rights and protections \n     and, when the violation involves a physical access barrier, \n     the entities responsible for designing, maintaining, \n     managing, altering or constructing the facility in which the \n     specific public service program, activity or accommodation is \n     conducted or provided.\n       (d) Allocation of Responsibility for Correction of Title II \n     and/or Title III Violations. Where more than one covered \n     entity is found to be an entity responsible for correction of \n     a violation of Title II and/or Title III rights and \n     protections under the method set forth in this section, as \n     between those parties, allocation of responsibility for \n     correcting the violations of Title II or Title III of the ADA \n     may be determined by statute, contract, or other enforceable \n     arrangement or relationship.\n\n     Sec. 1.105 Regulations incorporated by reference.\n\n       (a) Technical and Nomenclature Changes to Regulations \n     Incorporated by Reference. The definitions in the regulations \n     incorporated by reference (``incorporated regulations''') \n     shall be used to interpret these regulations except: (1) when \n     they differ from the definitions in Sec. 1.102 or the \n     modifications listed below, in which case the definition in \n     Sec. 1.102 or the modification listed below shall be\n\n[[Page S630]]\n\n     used; or (2) when they define terms that are not used in the \n     incorporated regulations. The incorporated regulations are \n     hereby modified as follows:\n       (1) When the incorporated regulations refer to ``Assistant \n     Attorney General,'' ``Department of Justice,'' ``FTA \n     Administrator,'' ``FTA regional office,'' ``Administrator,'' \n     ``Secretary,'' or any other executive branch office or \n     officer, ``General Counsel'' is hereby substituted.\n       (2) When the incorporated regulations refer to the date \n     ``January 26, 1992,'' the date ``January 1, 1997'' is hereby \n     substituted.\n       (3) When the incorporated regulations otherwise specify a \n     date by which some action must be completed, the date that is \n     three years from the effective date of these regulations is \n     hereby substituted.\n       (4) When the incorporated regulations contain an exception \n     for an ``historic'' property, building, or facility, that \n     exception shall also apply to properties, buildings, or \n     facilities designated as an historic or heritage asset by the \n     Office of the Architect of the Capitol in accordance with its \n     preservation policy and standards and where, in accordance \n     with its preservation policy and standards, the Office of the \n     Architect of the Capitol determines that compliance with the \n     requirements for accessible routes, entrances, or toilet \n     facilities (as defined in 28 C.F.R. Parts 35 and 36) would \n     threaten or destroy the historic significance of the \n     property, building or facility, the exceptions for \n     alterations to qualified historic property, buildings or \n     facilities for that element shall be permitted to apply.\n       (b) Rules of Interpretation. When regulations in (c) \n     conflict, the regulation providing the most access shall \n     apply. The Board's Notice of Adoption shall be used to \n     interpret these regulations and shall be made part of these \n     Regulations as Appendix A.\n       (c) Incorporated Regulations from 28 C.F.R.

Part 2 of these regulations contains the provisions \n     pertaining to investigation and prosecution of charges of \n     discrimination.\n\n     Sec. 2.102 Definitions.\n\n       (a) Charge means any written document from a qualified \n     individual with a disability or that individual's designated \n     representative which suggests or alleges that a covered \n     entity denied that individual the rights and protections \n     against discrimination in the provision of public services \n     and accommodations provided in Section 210(b)(1) of the CAA.\n       (b) File a charge means providing a charge to the General \n     Counsel in person, by mail, or by electronic transmission. \n     Charges shall be filed within 180 days of the occurrence of \n     the alleged violation.\n       (c) The occurrence of the alleged violation means the date \n     on which the charging individual was allegedly discriminated \n     against.\n       (d) The rights and protections against discrimination in \n     the provision of public services and accommodations means all \n     of the rights and protections provided by Section 210(b)(1) \n     of the CAA through incorporation of Sections 201 through 230, \n     302, 303, and 309 of the ADA and by the regulations issued by \n     the Board to implement Section 210 of the CAA.\n\n     Sec. 2.103 Investigatory Authority.\n\n       (a) Investigatory Methods. When investigating charges of \n     discrimination and conducting inspections, the General \n     Counsel is authorized to use all the modes of inquiry and \n     investigation traditionally employed or useful to execute \n     this investigatory authority. The authorized methods of \n     investigation include, but are not limited to, the following: \n     (1) requiring the parties to provide or produce ready access \n     to: all physical areas subject to an inspection or \n     investigation, individuals with relevant knowledge concerning \n     the inspection or investigation who can be interviewed or \n     questioned, and documents pertinent to the investigation; and \n     (2) requiring the parties to provide written answers to \n     questions, statements of position, and any other information \n     relating to a potential violation or demonstrating \n     compliance.\n       (b) Duty to Cooperate with Investigations. Charging \n     individuals and covered entities shall cooperate with \n     investigations conducted by the General Counsel. Cooperation \n     includes providing timely responses to reasonable requests \n     for information and documents (including the making and \n     retention of copies of records and documents), allowing the \n     General Counsel to review documents and interview relevant \n     witnesses confidentially and without managerial interference \n     or influence, and granting the General Counsel ready access \n     to all facilities where covered services, programs and \n     activities are being provided and all places of public \n     accommodation.\n\n     Sec. 2.104 Mediation.\n\n       (a) Belief that violation may have occurred. If, after \n     investigation, the General Counsel believes that a violation \n     of the ADA may have occurred and that mediation may be \n     helpful in resolving the dispute, prior to filing a \n     complaint, the General Counsel may request, but not \n     participate in, mediation under subsections (b) through (d) \n     of Section 403 of the CAA between the charging individual and \n     any entity responsible for correcting the alleged violation.\n       (b) Settlement. If, prior to the filing of a complaint, the \n     charging individual and the entity responsible for correcting \n     the violation reach a settlement agreement that fully \n     resolves the dispute, the General Counsel shall close the \n     investigation of the charge without taking further action.\n       (c) Mediation Unsuccessful. If mediation under (a) has not \n     succeeded in resolving the dispute, and if the General \n     Counsel believes that a violation of the ADA may have \n     occurred, the General Counsel may file with the Office a \n     complaint against any entity responsible for correcting the \n     violation.\n\n     Sec. 2.105 Complaint.\n\n       The complaint filed by the General Counsel shall be \n     submitted to a hearing officer for decision pursuant to \n     subsections (b) through (h) of Section 405 of the CAA. The \n     decision of the hearing officer shall be subject to review by \n     the Board pursuant to Section 406 of the CAA.\n\n     Sec. 2.106 Intervention by Charging Individual.\n\n       Any person who has filed a charge may intervene as of \n     right, with the full rights of a party, whenever a complaint \n     is filed by the General Counsel.\n\n     Sec. 2.107 Remedies and Compliance.\n\n       (a) Remedy. The remedy for a violation of Section 210 of \n     the CAA shall be such remedy as would be appropriate if \n     awarded under Section 203 or 308(a) of the ADA.\n       (b) Compliance Date. Compliance shall take place as soon as \n     possible, but no later than the fiscal year following the end \n     of the fiscal year in which the order requiring correction \n     becomes final and not subject to further review.\n\n     Sec. 2.108 Judicial Review.\n\n       A charging individual who has intervened or any respondent \n     to the complaint, if aggrieved by a final decision of the \n     Board, may file a petition for review in the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, pursuant to Section \n     407 of the CAA.\n\n     PART 3--MATTERS PERTAINING TO PERIODIC INSPECTIONS AND \n                   REPORTING.\n\n     Sec. 3.101 PURPOSE AND SCOPE\n\n     Sec. 3.102 DEFINITIONS\n\n     Sec. 3.103 INSPECTION AUTHORITY\n\n     Sec. 3.104 REPORTING, ESTIMATED COST & TIME, AND COMPLIANCE \n       DATE\n\n     Sec. 3.101 Purpose and scope.\n\n       Section 210(f) of the CAA requires that the General \n     Counsel, on a regular basis, at least once each Congress, \n     inspect the facilities of covered entities to ensure \n     compliance with the Titles II and III of the ADA and to \n     prepare and submit a report to Congress containing the \n     results of the periodic inspections, describing any \n     violations, assessing any limitations in accessibility, and \n     providing the estimated cost and time needed for abatement. \n     Part 3 of these regulations contains the provisions \n     pertaining to these inspection and reporting duties.\n\n     Sec. 3.102 Definitions.\n\n       (a) The facilities of covered entities means all facilities \n     used to provide public programs, activities, services or \n     accommodations that are designed, maintained, altered or \n     constructed by a covered entity and all facilities where \n     covered entities provide public programs, activities, \n     services or accommodations.\n       (b) Violation means any barrier to access caused by \n     noncompliance with the applicable standards.\n       (c) Estimated cost and time needed for abatement means cost \n     and time estimates that can be reported as falling within a \n     range of dollar amounts and dates.\n\n     Sec. 3.103 Inspection authority.\n\n       (a) General scope of authority. On a regular basis, at \n     least once each Congress, the General Counsel shall inspect \n     the facilities of covered entities to ensure compliance with \n     Titles II and III of the ADA. When conducting these \n     inspections, the General Counsel has the discretion to decide \n     which facilities will be inspected and how inspections will \n     be conducted. The General Counsel may receive requests for \n     ADA inspections, including anonymous requests, and conduct \n     inspections for compliance with Titles II and III of the ADA \n     in the same manner that the General Counsel receives and \n     investigates requests for inspections under Section 215(c)(1) \n     of the CAA.\n       (b) Review of information and documents. When conducting \n     inspections under Section 210(f) of the CAA, the General \n     Counsel may request, obtain, and review any and all \n     information or documents deemed by the General Counsel to be \n     relevant to a determination of whether the covered entity is \n     in compliance with Section 210 of the CAA.\n       (c) Duty to cooperate. Covered entities shall cooperate \n     with any inspection conducted by the General Counsel in the \n     manner provided by Sec. 2.103(b).\n       (d) Pre-construction review of alteration and construction \n     projects. Any project involving alteration or new \n     construction of facilities of covered entities are subject to \n     inspection by the General Counsel for compliance with Titles \n     II and III of the ADA during\n\n[[Page S632]]\n\n     the design, pre-construction, construction, and post \n     construction phases of the project. The Office of the \n     Architect of the Capitol shall, within one year from the \n     effective date of these regulations, develop a process with \n     the General Counsel to identify potential barriers to access \n     prior to the completion of alteration and construction \n     projects that may include the following provisions:\n       (1) Design review or approval;\n       (2) Inspections of ongoing alteration and construction \n     projects;\n       (3) Training on the applicable ADA standards;\n       (4) Final inspections of completed projects for compliance; \n     and\n       (5) Any other provision that would likely reduce the number \n     of ADA barriers in alterations and new construction and the \n     costs associated with correcting them.\n\n     Sec. 3.104 Reporting, estimating cost & time, and compliance \n       date.\n\n       (a) Reporting duty. On a regular basis, at least once each \n     Congress, the General Counsel shall prepare and submit a \n     report to Congress containing the results of the periodic \n     inspections conducted under Sec. 3.103(a), describing any \n     violations, assessing any limitations in accessibility, and \n     providing the estimated cost and time needed for abatement.\n       (b) Estimated cost & time. Covered entities shall cooperate \n     with the General Counsel by providing information needed to \n     provide the estimated cost and time needed for abatement in \n     the manner provided by Sec. 2.103(b).\n       (c) Compliance date. All barriers to access identified by \n     the General Counsel in its periodic reports shall be removed \n     or otherwise corrected as soon as possible, but no later than \n     the fiscal year following the end of the fiscal year in which \n     the report describing the barrier to access was issued by the \n     General Counsel.\n\n                    Recommended Method of Approval:\n\n       The Board has adopted the same regulations for the Senate, \n     the House of Representatives, and the other covered entities \n     and facilities, and therefore recommends that the adopted \n     regulations be approved by concurrent resolution of the \n     Congress.\n       Signed at Washington, D.C., on this 3rd day of February, \n     2016.\n\n                                            Barbara L. Camens,\n\n                         Chair of the Board, Office of Compliance.\n\n\n                                endnotes\n\n       1. 28 C.F.R. Sec. 36.201(b) reads as follows: ``Landlord \n     and tenant responsibilities. Both the landlord who owns the \n     building that houses a place of public accommodation and the \n     tenant who owns or operates the place of public accommodation \n     are public accommodations subject to the requirements of this \n     part. As between the parties, allocation of responsibility \n     for complying with the obligations of this part may be \n     determined by lease or other contract.''\n       2. The DOJ's illustrations and descriptions in its \n     Technical Assistance Manuals regarding compliance with Titles \n     II and Title III by tenants and landlords make this clear. \n     See, U.S. Dept. of Justice, ADA Title III Technical \n     Assistance Manual Sec. III.-1.2000 (Nov. 1993) (``The title \n     III regulation permits the landlord and the tenant to \n     allocate responsibility, in the lease, for complying with \n     particular provisions of the regulation. However, any \n     allocation made in a lease or other contract is only \n     effective as between the parties, and both landlord and \n     tenant remain fully liable for compliance with all provisions \n     of the ADA relating to that place of public \n     accommodation.''); U.S. Dept. of Justice, ADA Title II \n     Technical Assistance Manual Sec. II.-1.3000 (Nov. 1993) (Both \n     manuals are available online at www.ada.gov). Also see, \n     Gabreille P. Whelan, Comment, The ``Public Access'' \n     Provisions of Title III of the Americans with Disabilities \n     Act, 34 Santa Clara L. Rev. 215, 217-18 (1993).\n       3. Several commenters correctly noted that the NPRM \n     contains a technical error because the year (2004) was \n     omitted from the C.F.R. citation, which was a potential \n     source of confusion because the regulation was removed from \n     the C.F.R. in 2004 when the substance of the regulation \n     became part of the ABA Guidelines at Sec. F202.6. \n     Fortunately, all of the commenters were sufficiently able to \n     ascertain the subject matter of the proposed regulation to \n     participate fully in the rulemaking process by providing \n     detailed comments about the proposed regulation, which is all \n     that is required of a NPRM. See e.g., Am. Iron & Steel Inst. \n     v. EPA, 568 F.2d 284, 293 (3d Cir. 1977); United Steelworkers \n     v. Marshall, 647 F.2d 1189, 1121 (D.C. Cir. 1980); and Am. \n     Med. Ass'n v. United States, 887 F.2d 760, 767 (7th Cir. \n     1989).\n       4. Under Sec. F202.6 of the ABAAG, ``Buildings or \n     facilities for which new leases are negotiated by the Federal \n     government after the effective date of the revised standards \n     issued pursuant to the Architectural Barriers Act, including \n     new leases for buildings or facilities previously occupied by \n     the Federal government, shall comply with F202.6.'' F202.6 \n     then proceeds to describe the requirements for an accessible \n     route to primary function areas, toilet and bathing \n     facilities, parking, and other elements and spaces. The ABAAG \n     became the ABA Accessibility Standards (``ABAAS'') on May 17, \n     2005 when the GSA adopted them as the standards. See 41 \n     C.F.R. Sec. 102 76.65(a) (2005).\n       5. These features include at least one accessible route to \n     primary function areas, at least one accessible toilet \n     facility for each sex (or an accessible unisex toilet \n     facility if only one toilet is provided), accessible parking \n     spaces, and, where provided, accessible drinking fountains, \n     fire alarms, public telephones, dining and work surfaces, \n     assembly areas, sales and service counters, vending and \n     change machines, and mail boxes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/03/senate-section/article/S632-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S632-S633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RESEARCH EXCELLENCE AND ADVANCEMENTS FOR DYSLEXIA ACT\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI.
