Mr. President, tonight we will welcome the President \nof the United States for the State of the Union Address. It is his \nfinal address, and it gives us cause for reflection.\n  Many of us recall the moment in Boston when a State senator became a \nnational star. His rhetorical gift was undeniable. It was a soaring \nelocution bathed in confetti that promised a new and more inclusive \nbeginning. It inspired many. It propelled Barack Obama to the highest \noffice in the land.\n  Americans assumed the campaigning would eventually come to a close \nand the serious work of governing would eventually commence, but it is \nnow many years later, and the Obama for President campaign never really \nended. Speeches still substitute for substance. Straw men still stand \nin for serious debate. Slogans still surrogate for governing.\n  We have been promised even more campaigning tonight, this time for \nthe candidate President Obama would like to see succeed him. It leads \nAmericans to wonder: When is the serious work of governing ever going \nto begin? Governing isn't easy. Governing often requires serious \nengagement with the Congress the American people elected, not the one \nthe President wishes they had elected.\n  Here is a simple fact. ``You don't make change through slogans.'' \nThat is something President Obama once said. I wish he had taken his \nown advice because here is what we know as we enter the twilight of his \nPresidency. He has presided over a sluggish and uneven economic \nrecovery that is failing too many of our citizens.\n  Health premiums and deductibles have continued to shoot ever higher. \nWages have flatlined for too many. Inequality has grown. Manufacturing \nhas shrunk. Poverty seems to entrench. The middle class has continued \nto collapse, to the point where it no longer even constitutes a \nmajority of our country.\n  The Obama administration says it wants to help the middle class, but \nits policies often tell a different story. We have seen the negative \nimpact ObamaCare has had on so many middle-class families. We have also \nseen this administration declare a war on coal families who just want \nto get ahead.\n  I have invited a Kentucky miner from Pikeville, Howard Abshire, as my \nState of the Union guest tonight. He has watched as the Obama \nadministration's heartless approach has helped contribute to \ndevastation in his community and to the loss of thousands of jobs in \nKentucky, one of which was his own job.\n  Here is what his message has been to President Obama. Howard Abshire \nsaid: ``We're hurting [and] we need help,'' but ``we don't want to be \nbailed out, we want to work.''\n  Many Kentuckians feel the very same way. Many Americans feel \nsimilarly too. Today only 20 percent of our citizens think things are \nheaded in the right direction in their country. Nearly three-quarters \nwant the next President to take a totally different approach from the \ncurrent one. These are the simple facts, and they present the President \nwith a choice.\n  President Obama can try to blame others for it. He can try to \nconvince Americans they are wrong to feel the way they do or he can \ntake responsibility and chart a new course. Americans are losing faith \nin the future. They are losing hope that their children can lead a \nbetter life. They watch as challenges continue to mount around the \nworld--like those from ISIL, Iran, Russia, Al Qaeda, an ever-aggressive \nChina, North Korea, and of course the Taliban--while this \nadministration seems to have no plan to deal with any of it.\n  This hurt in our country and the failing approach from the White \nHouse should be disheartening to all of us. Perhaps the worst part is, \nit didn't have to be like this. It really didn't have to be like this. \nI believe that when the American people elect divided government, they \nare not telling us to do nothing. They are telling us to work together \nin the areas where we\n\n[[Page S40]]\n\ncan agree so we can make progress for our country.\n  This Congress has racked up a growing list of bipartisan \naccomplishments for the American people over the past year. Some \nthought the major reforms we passed in areas such as education, \ntransportation, Medicare, and tax relief were all impossible in the \ncurrent political climate. We proved those pundits wrong. We showed how \nsignificant bipartisan accomplishments can be achieved when good policy \nis the goal.\n  Perhaps we have inspired the President to finally try his hand at \nbipartisan achievement as well. We will see tonight when he delivers \nhis last State of the Union Address. If he proposes real plans to do \nthings such as defeat ISIL, grow economic opportunity, and strengthen \nthe middle class--plans actually designed to pass this Congress, not \njust provide talking points for the next campaign--we will know he is \nready to join us in meeting the challenges of tomorrow because \nRepublicans aren't afraid of the future, and we don't think President \nObama should be either. We want him to join us in recognizing the \nchallenges of today while working for the solutions of tomorrow. It is \ntrue that we as a nation have a lot of challenges to confront. The pain \nand the worry in our country is real, it is palpable, but none of it is \ninsurmountable.\n  That is the hopeful message I expect Governor Haley to deliver \ntonight. I expect her to contrast a failing Presidency that is stuck in \nthe past with a Republican Party that is oriented to the future. Nikki \nHaley knows the American dream. She has lived the American dream. She \nbelieves in the continuing promise of our country, and she understands \nthe importance of opportunity and upward mobility for our middle class. \nWhen Governor Haley talks about hope and change, she means it because \nshe has actually worked to deliver it.\n  There is nothing wrong with inspirational speeches. We all need to be \ninspired, especially in trying times such as these. Soaring rhetoric \nmatched with the right policies and hard work to actually achieve them \nis usually good for our country--just ask Ronald Reagan or Jack Kemp. \nEmpty eloquence wrapped in leftwing ideas of yesterday that hurt the \nmiddle class--it is time to leave that behind. It is time to look to \nthe future. We will see tonight if President Obama is ready to do so \nand move beyond the failed policies of the past.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/12/senate-section/article/S40-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S40]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, if this were a card game, which it is not, I \nguess what I would do is trump what the Republican leader has said. My \nfriend lives in a world that doesn't exist. Let's talk about this \nperson named Barack Obama. What has happened under his time in office, \nhis 7 years, in spite of the unheard of, unrecognizable Senate that the \nRepublicans have created--cloture had to be filed more than 500 times \nbecause they set out to block everything he wanted--in spite of that, \nthe state of the Union now reflects the last 7 years. We have 14 \nmillion private sector jobs that have been created. During the Obama \nyears, the economy has grown. The private sector created jobs for 70 \nstraight months--the longest stretch in the history of our country. \nUnemployment is at 5 percent. When Barack Obama took office, in some \nStates it was as much as 14 percent.\n  During the years of Barack Obama, 17 million uninsured Americans have \ngained access to health care--17 million--and the number is climbing. \nRenewable energy production has increased significantly. You drive \nacross America today and you see wind farms in the middle part of this \ncountry, and farmers make more money from producing energy on their \nfarms than they do harvesting corn and soybeans because of what the \nPresident suggested and what we legislated in the so-called stimulus \nbill.\n  Solar, wind, and geothermal has increased significantly, and it will \ncontinue to grow more because they have tax incentives now for as long \nas 7 additional years. You know what else we have done--not enough. The \nwealthiest Americans who don't mind paying more than their fair share--\nthe only people in America today who believe that these rich people \nshouldn't pay a little more are the Republicans in Congress, not \nRepublicans around the country, so we made sure the wealthiest pay a \nlittle bit more.\n  We have secured permanent tax relief that will help lift 16 million \nlower income, middle-income families out of poverty. The auto industry \nwas on the brink of destruction. General Motors, this icon of American \nindustry, was begging for help. Chrysler Motors was begging for help. \nThe Republicans said no. We Democrats said yes. We were right. \nRepublicans were wrong. Hundreds of thousands of jobs have been created \nin the auto industry. Last year more American cars and trucks were sold \nthan any time in the history of our country. Why? Because of Barack \nObama's leadership.\n  Osama bin Laden is gone. He has been killed, and we destroyed and \ndegraded terrorist organizations in our Nation. We have more to do. Of \ncourse we do.\n  There have been historic agreements on climate change. We have \nstopped Iran from getting access to nuclear weapons. Within the last \nfew days, Iran has shipped 12 tons of uranium out of Iran because of \nBarack Obama. While we have a lot more to do for America on behalf of \nthe American people, we can't ignore the progress that has been made.\n  My friend talks about the new Senate, and there is a new Senate \nbecause there is a constructive minority. We Democrats have been \nwilling to work with them. The issues that we have been able to pass \nwith rare exception have been issues that we should have passed years \nago but we couldn't because Republicans filibustered and obstructed \neverything we tried to do.\n  I repeat: We have a lot more to do for the American people. It is a \nwonderful country, and I am so pleased with the progress we have made \nduring the 7 years of Barack Obama.\n  Mr. President, I see no one on the floor.

Mr. President, I want to talk for a few minutes at the \nbeginning of my remarks about what the response to the flooding has \nbeen in our State of Missouri. I was in St. Louis County with \nCongresswoman Wagner on Saturday. I was in St. Charles County the week \nbefore that. I was in Cape Girardeau following up on the work \nCongressman Smith has done there. I was in St. Genevieve, Perryville, \nCassville, and Monette. If you know anything about the geography of our \nState, those places are spread pretty far apart, but we had a flooding \nsituation that was almost totally generated in our State--different \nfrom the floods we normally deal with--and the communities reacted with \nvery little time in an impressive way. The Corps of Engineers was also \nthere to help. The National Guard was there to do what they needed to \ndo. Now we see FEMA and the SBA stepping in to see who qualifies for \nassistance.\n  There was loss of life. More often than not, the loss of life \noccurred when somebody drove around a sign that said ``Don't pass this \nsign'' and then got caught in a situation they didn't anticipate or \nthought was less than it turned out to be. Some families clearly are \ngrieving that loss of life. We had five international soldiers who lost \ntheir lives near Fort Leonard Wood.\n\n[[Page S41]]\n\nMaybe the whole idea of a low-water bridge that you and I would be used \nto was something they hadn't thought about.\n  We had three interstate highways close--Interstate 55, Interstate 70, \nand Interstate 44. They were not all closed at exactly the same time \nbut within somewhere between a 24- to 36-hour timeframe. We will have \nto look at that to be sure people don't lose access to where their kids \nare, where their jobs are, and where their health care is. The economic \nimpact of that Interstate System that comes together in so many ways in \nMissouri shutting down is something that clearly, once we get beyond \nthe immediacy of dealing with the flood itself, we need to look at and \nsee how we can prevent that problem from happening again. I don't know \nof a time when any two of those highways were closed at the same time \nbefore, but I know Interstate 70 and Interstate 44 were closed at the \nsame time, and it had a real impact economically on people traveling \neast to west or economic things happening east to west anywhere in the \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/12/senate-section/article/S41-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S41-S42]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    HEALTH CARE RESEARCH, MENTAL HEALTH, AND PRESCRIPTION DRUG ABUSE\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I was also able to talk about some good \nnews. I am not sure how much good news we are going to hear over the \nnext few days, but certainly there is the good news of stepping up and \nlooking at health care research and the impact it can have in the \ncountry. There are things that are beginning to happen in mental health \nand things that we are trying to do to respond to prescription drug \nabuse and opioid abuse in all areas.\n  In health care research, the National Institutes of Health hadn't \nreceived an increase in their research funding since 2003. There was an \neffort made right before that to make a substantial increase. The fact \nthat the Congress and the administration stopped research funding had \nalways been frustrating, but we were able to see an increase this year \nfor the first time in 12 years. That meant we had to create a priority. \nFor too many people in government, when there is a discussion about \nfunding priorities, a lot of our colleagues hear that and think that \nmeans we have to fund anything anybody has ever convinced the \ngovernment we are interested in. Being interested in something doesn't \nmake it a priority; it just makes it something that, if everything was \ngoing along the right way, maybe this is something to look at. But in \nfunding NIH at a new level, we totally eliminated 18 programs, zeroed \nthem out. We didn't eliminate the authorization for them, but we \neliminated the money to run those 18 programs. Congress and eventually \nthe President accepted the argument that for the greater good, these 18 \nprograms did not need to continue. The President asked for 23 new \nprograms that also did not receive funding, but that allowed us to make \na commitment and to set priorities.\n  Why set a priority? The first funding increase in 12 years was 6.6 \npercent. We went from spending $30 billion on health care research last \nyear to $32 billion this year. Hopefully this is a first step toward \ntrying to solve health care problems.\n  There are many changing developments in health care, from smartphone \ntechnology, to individual medicine, to knowing more about the human \ngenome. How did we find out about the human genome? We found that out \nthrough NIH research. If we hadn't had NIH research, it is likely that \nthe human genome would still be a mystery to us. It had been a mystery \non the planet until just a few years ago. The reason that happened was \nthe National Institutes of Health and the Congress decided it would be \nhelpful to figure out how all of us are different from each other, \nwhich also means trying to figure out a different approach to curing \ndiseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's, and heart disease.\n  What difference does it make? Why is it a priority to spend \ntaxpayers' money in this way? One reason is the clear impact health \ncare research is having every day on individuals and families who no \nlonger are dealing with problems they would have been dealing with 10 \nyears ago. Moving forward, let's see if we can find ways to meet the \nchallenges for families and caregivers. Let's see what we can do there.\n  Generally, for taxpayers, even if you aren't the individual \nbeneficiary, estimates are that the Medicare system will be absolutely \noverwhelmed between now and 2050 by things such as Alzheimer's and \ncancer. If we can figure out a cure or delay onset of Alzheimer's by 5 \nor 7 years on average, the impact on the cost of that devastating \ndisease--both the real cost to taxpayers and the emotional and \npsychological costs to everybody involved--will be overwhelming.\n  The Medicare system won't be able to withstand the projections of how \nmuch money will be spent if we don't find ways to deal with these new \nchallenges. As people get older, Alzheimer's and cancer are more likely \nto end life than heart disease and stroke. That doesn't mean we don't \nneed to be focused on neurological research or on heart research. All \nof those things are important, and a relatively small investment by the \nFederal Government on health care to try do something about that \nmatters.\n  It is generally understood that health care will dramatically change \nin the next 10 or 20 years. Where the research is done is likely to be \nwhere the jobs and economic impact of that research occurs.\n  I don't want to be going to the Chinese 10 years from now saying: \nWill you tell us how your investment in research has paid off? We are \nbetter at this than anybody else in the world, and we need to continue \nto be better. There are reasons for us to be better.\n  I do visit some of the places where this research is being done. I \nwas at the Siteman Cancer Center on the campus of Washington \nUniversity, one of the premier cancer focus centers in the country. \nWashington University is where one-third of all research was done to \nunderstand the human genome.\n  I have met with the Alzheimer's Association and the American Cancer \nAssociation.\n  I met with the family of a young man who lost his fight with cancer \nbefore he was 10 years old. His mom and dad formed the Super Sam \nFoundation to encourage other families and to encourage research. They \nwere there with his sister representing the Super Sam Foundation.\n  The Thompson Center for Autism and Neurodevelopment Disorders at the \nUniversity of Missouri is another place where we are looking to see \nwhat we can do to intervene earlier and help solve problems. The new \nchancellor at the university, Hank Foley, was with me, as was the \ndirector of that center, Dr. Stephen Kanne. They are doing good work \nand will continue to do so.\n  In Kansas City, I met with an organization, MRIGlobal, that is doing \nincredible work in the field of environmental and cancer research and \nis making a big difference. The head of that company, Thomas Sack, was \nthere as we were talking about what they were doing and what they hoped \nto do.\n  My hometown of Springfield is also the home location of the \nAlzheimer's Association Missouri Chapter. I had a chance to talk with \nthem.\n  I also met with the people from the Alzheimer's Association, the \nAmerican Cancer Society, the American Diabetes Association, and I then \nwent on to Southeast Missouri State University, another autism center \nthat is working to figure out how we can deal with autism disorders, \nincluding early detection.\n  I visited Truman State University in Kirksville, where I had the \nopportunity to learn more about the university's efforts to create an \ninterprofessional autism clinic. I was able to hear stories about how \nfrustrated young researchers have been with just a 6.6-percent \nincrease--the first increase in 12 years. During that 12 years, the \nbuying power of the research dollar went down by 20 percent. We \nrestored a little of that 20 percent.\n  The Federal Government has been involved in research at least since \nthe founding of the Department of Agriculture in 1862. Whether it is \nhealth care research or ag research or environmental research or energy \nresearch, there is a level of that research which should and will be \ndone by the private sector, but there is another level of research by \nthe Federal Government that benefits everybody by sharing the results \nof that research.\n  In mental health, there is a lot of excitement in Missouri and around \nthe\n\n[[Page S42]]\n\ncountry about the potential of being one of the pilot States in \nexcellence of mental health. Senator Stabenow from Michigan and I \nintroduced legislation a few years ago that would combine--that would \ntreat behavioral health, treat mental health just like all other \nhealth. This is another way to save money, because of that mental \nhealth situation.\n  By the way, the National Institutes of Health says that one out of \nfour adult Americans has a diagnosable and almost always treatable \nmental health issue. If that mental health issue is being treated, \nwhatever your other health issues are, they are likely to be treated in \na much more effective way.\n  We are looking for more choices to deal with the issues suffered by \nour Vietnam veterans to our youngest veterans, giving them more options \nand more choices.\n  Eight States are going to be doing that and 24 States have applied. \nSenator Stabenow and I will be talking more about what happens and what \nwe might do to encourage those other 16 States.\n  The President says he wants to spend more money on mental health. It \nreally doesn't matter how you share your mental health information or \nwhat your provider last told you or how many mental health care \nproviders you have if there is no place to go and if there are no \naccess points to treat behavioral health like all other health issues, \nand that is what excellence in mental health does for patients.\n  I will close with one final area. I think there has been a lot of \nresponse to understanding and addressing the opioid epidemic and the \ndrug issue. Deaths from prescription opioids and other pain-related \ndrugs quadrupled between 1999 and 2013, claiming more than 145,000 \nlives over the past 10 years, but a substantial portion of those deaths \noccurred over the last couple of years. These overdoses cost the \neconomy an estimated $20 billion in medical costs and lost work \nproductivity. Some people die from overdosing, and many other people \nhave to be treated by their health care provider. There is a personal \nloss to those individuals who become addicted to prescription drugs.\n  I mentioned that I had a chance to talk to the Missouri General \nAssembly last week, and I talked about how our veterans are often the \nvictims just because of the serious injuries they sustain and the \npainkilling drugs they are given to help deal with the pain of those \ninjuries. But that then leads to an addiction to that drug and other \ndrugs.\n  Approximately three out of four new heroin users abused prescription \ndrugs before switching to heroin. We have made a new commitment to this \nissue with new programs that are targeted to combat opioid abuse at the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention and the Substance Abuse and \nMental Health Services Administration with almost three times the \ninvestment that the country made before. This is truly becoming an \nepidemic, and we need to deal with that epidemic sooner rather than \nlater.\n  Many of our Members and their States have talked effectively about \nfighting heroin and drug addiction but also about dealing with the \ntransition from taking drugs that they were prescribed to drugs that \nthey shouldn't have. We are looking at new opportunities there. The new \nRepublican-led Senate is looking at how to deal with these \nopportunities in new ways. I hope we haven't made those successes for \nthe spending year we are in now a one-time only event but a new \ncommitment to try to solve the problems early so that society and the \nprograms which taxpayers fund aren't overwhelmed by those problems \nlater.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/12/senate-section/article/S42-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S42-S43]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE STATE OF THE UNION\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Missouri, Mr. \nBlunt, addressing some of the issues that the Republican majority has \nattempted to accomplish, including the advances made over the last \nyear, which I think will lay a foundation for the future and for \nfurther successes in the coming year.\n  Tonight President Obama will come to Congress to deliver his final \nState of the Union Address, which raises this question: What is the \nstate of our Union? The truth is that while the strength and spirit of \nthe American people remain a beacon of hope for our future, our country \nis facing a number of serious challenges. Global unrest has grown over \nthe course of the President's administration, most notably with the \nrise of ISIS, one of the most brutal terrorist groups in existence.\n  On President Obama's watch, we have experienced the worst economic \nrecovery since the Eisenhower administration, with stagnant wages and \nmillions dropping out of the labor force. American families are seeing \ntheir dreams for the future erode as they struggle under ever-\nincreasing government burdens and a lack of economic opportunity.\n  Any serious discussion of the state of our Union needs to address \nthese challenges and offer solutions. That is the kind of speech that I \nwish we were going to hear tonight, but unfortunately all indicators \nsuggest that is not the kind of speech the President plans to give. \nInstead, the President apparently intends to take a victory lap despite \nthe fact that the American people clearly don't think there is much to \ncelebrate. A recent New York Times/CBS News poll found that 68 percent \nof the American people think our country is on the wrong track, and \nmost Americans believe the next generation will be worse off, not \nbetter off.\n  In a preview of the President's speech, the White House notes: ``We \nhave made extraordinary progress on the path to a stronger country and \na brighter future.'' That is not how the American people are feeling, \nand it doesn't reflect the reality of the President's administration.\n  The President plans to talk about his supposed economic successes \ntonight. While our economy has recovered to a certain extent since the \nrecession, it has never fully rebounded. Wage growth continues to lag. \nDecember marked the 77th straight month in which year-over-year hourly \nwage growth was at or below 2\\1/2\\ percent. Underemployment also \ncontinues to be a problem with millions of Americans continuing to work \npart-time jobs because they can't find full-time work. Almost 5 years \nafter the recession ended, the percentage of Americans working full \ntime has still not returned to prerecession levels.\n  While the most commonly mentioned unemployment rate is 5 percent, the \nU-6 unemployment rate, which measures the number of both unemployed \nworkers and underemployed workers, is 9.9 percent. Of the unemployed, \nthose who have been unemployed for 27 weeks or more, or those \nconsidered long-term unemployed, make up 26 percent. Labor force \nparticipation remains near record lows. In short, stagnation has become \nthe new normal for the economy under the Obama administration and \neconomic opportunities for families have been few and far between.\n  In addition to the lack of economic opportunity, families have had to \nshoulder new burdens thanks to the Obama administration. Chief among \nthose burdens, of course, is ObamaCare, the President's disastrous \nhealth care law, which has failed to reduce the cost of health care, \nripped away millions of Americans' preferred health care plans, forced \nfamilies onto insurance plans they don't want and can't afford, reduced \npatients' access to doctors and hospitals, increased taxes, and wasted \nliterally billions of taxpayer dollars.\n  Then there are the burdensome regulations the Obama administration \nhas imposed, which have made it more challenging for businesses, large \nand small, to grow and create jobs.\n  The Obama Environmental Protection Agency, in particular, has done \nmore than its fair share to make things difficult for Americans. During \nthe course of the Obama administration, this Agency has implemented one \ndamaging rule after another, from a massive national backdoor energy \ntax that would hurt poor and working families the most to a new rule \nthat would subject ponds and puddles in Americans' backyards to a \ncomplex array of expensive and burdensome regulatory requirements.\n  Again and again, I have heard from South Dakota farm and ranch \nfamilies, homeowners and small businesses about the difficulties they \nare facing thanks to the Obama EPA's massive regulations.\n  If the President's record on the economy and middle-class opportunity \nis\n\n[[Page S43]]\n\nbad, his record on foreign policy is even worse. A White House preview \nof the State of the Union touts the President's work to ``redefine \nAmerican leadership for the 21st century.'' During the President's last \nyear in office the White House says: ``We can show the world what is \npossible when America truly leads.''\n  Republicans couldn't agree more that America should truly lead. The \nproblem is that the President's first 7 years in office have generally \nbeen distinguished by a lack of leadership. Back in June, former \nPresident and fellow Democrat Jimmy Carter described President Obama's \nsuccesses on the world stage as ``minimal.'' He said: ``On the world \nstage, just to be as objective about it as I can, I can't think of many \nnations in the world where we have a better relationship now than we \ndid when he took over.'' Again, that was a quote from former Democratic \nPresident Jimmy Carter. Well, neither can I.\n  The White House claims that the President ended two wars. Yet it \nneglects to mention that since the United States withdrew from Iraq, \nlarge sections of the country have gone into chaos thanks to ISIS. The \nPresident's failure to enforce his redline in Syria when President \nBashar al-Assad used chemical weapons on his own people and the \nPresident's lack of a strategy to defeat ISIS have contributed to a \nmassive refugee crisis with no easy solution. Meanwhile, Assad remains \nin power, and ISIS continues to thrive.\n  With the terrorist attacks in Paris, ISIS officially expanded its \ntheater of operations beyond the Middle East. As we witnessed in the \ncase of the San Bernardino shooting, as long as ISIS continues to \nexist, its demented ideology will inspire disturbed individuals to \ncommit acts of terror. The United States is in desperate need of a \ncomprehensive strategy to confront the threat posed by ISIS. Yet the \nPresident has so far made no move to develop one.\n  On another foreign policy front, the President has repeatedly touted \nhis nuclear deal with Iran as one of the major foreign policy \nachievements of his Presidency. Yet the agreement he signed actually \nimproves Iran's long-term prospects for developing a bomb. In a clear \nviolation of U.N. restrictions, Iran tested a ballistic missile, \ndemonstrating once again that it has in no way curbed its aggressive \nbehavior. Elsewhere, Russian aggression has increased on the \nPresident's watch. North Korea recently conducted yet another nuclear \ntest.\n  The Obama administration has left the American people with a host of \nproblems at home and abroad, but once again, it sounds like President \nObama's State of the Union Address will fail to offer any substantial \nsolutions. More than that, it sounds as if the President will largely \nignore the problems, and that is unfortunate.\n  The President is missing an opportunity to offer substantial \nsolutions before turning the problems of his administration over to his \nsuccessors. I don't want to give credence to those Obama administration \naccusations that the Republicans are all ``doom and gloom.'' As I said, \nI believe the strength and spirit of the American people mean that the \nfuture of America is always bright. But realizing that future requires \nunderstanding and developing solutions to the problems facing our \nNation, and that is something the President has been unwilling to do.\n  Republicans have worked hard over the past year to make our economy \nstronger, our government more efficient and accountable, and our Nation \nand our world safer and more secure. But there is a lot more work that \nneeds to be done, and we need a partner in the White House who is \nwilling to meet us half way. We hope the President will use the last \nyear of his Presidency to work with us as we seek to address the \nchallenges that are facing the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, a few months ago my colleague from \nMissouri, Senator Blunt, took the floor and spoke to two issues we have \nin common. I will speak to one of them in a moment--the flooding in the \nMidwest--but I wish to also address another one that he raised.\n  Senator Blunt is in an extraordinary position, having been given an \nopportunity to handle the appropriations bill for the Department of \nHealth and Human Services. Within the Health and Human Services \nappropriations bill is funding for most of the biomedical research by \nthe Federal Government.\n  I have spoken to Senator Blunt over the past year and even before \nabout my strong feelings on this subject. I feel, as most Americans do, \nthat our investment in biomedical research is a wise investment, \npotentially sparing people from disease and death that could follow an \nillness but also making an investment in America's innovative economy, \ncreating opportunities for jobs and for expanded research and new \nproducts and pharmaceuticals. Senator Blunt took that challenge to \nheart, and when he was faced with the appropriations bill for this \nDepartment, he made a special effort when it came to medical research. \nI am so happy that he did.\n  It was only a few years ago that we had automatic, across-the-board \ncuts called sequestration. It was devastating. As a net result of that, \nmany of the youngest and most promising researchers gave up on the \nfield because they didn't think there was a commitment from Congress, \nfrom the President, and from the government to continue to expand \nbiomedical research. We saw the median age of researchers climbing \nbecause younger researchers looked for other jobs. That is a horrible \nwaste of talent and a squandering of an opportunity, I am sure, to find \nways to make life more bearable and to cure diseases across America.\n  Several years ago, when I visited the NIH, the head of the National \nInstitutes of Health, Dr. Francis Collins, told me that if we could \nhave 5 percent real growth in biomedical research at the NIH for 10 \nyears, he could light up the scoreboard. We were on the cusp of so many \ndiscoveries that this was an opportunity, if the investment were made, \nto really have some medical breakthroughs. I took that to heart and \nintroduced a bill called the American Cures Act, and I am sure Senator \nBlunt and many of my colleagues are tired of hearing about it. The \nnotion is 10 percent by Congress; 5 percent real growth each year when \nit comes to the NIH.\n  As it turns out, this year we are knocking on the door of doing just \nthat with the investment that was made by the appropriations bill. This \ninvestment is almost $42 billion in biomedical research, $32 billion in \nthe National Institutes of Health, a 6.6-percent increase over last \nyear; $7 billion for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a \n4.5-percent increase over fiscal year 2015.\n  There are two other areas of research opportunities in biomedical \nresearch: the Veterans Medical and Prosthetics Research Program and the \nDepartment of Defense Health Program. That is an appropriations bill I \nhave something to do with, working with the chairman, Senator Cochran. \nBoth of those programs received a 7-percent increase over the previous \nfiscal year. These increases at NIH, CDC, Veterans, and Defense are a \nreal turnaround. They bring to an end a decades-long downward trend \nwhen it comes to biomedical research.\n  Senator Blunt has said--and I have, too--this shouldn't be a one-hit \nwonder. We have to repeat that this year when it comes to the \nappropriations for the next fiscal year beginning October 1. We have to \nmake sure we make our promise and keep it when it comes to biomedical \nresearch. If we do it, I know this level of funding is going to result \nin dramatic, positive developments.\n  There are so many areas we need help with. I can think of a few that \nare obvious, including Alzheimer's. An American is diagnosed with \nAlzheimer's once every 67 seconds. When my staff told me that, I didn't \nbelieve it. I said: Go back, recalculate, and tell me the real number. \nIt turns out they were right. Once every 67 seconds, a person is \ndiagnosed with Alzheimer's.\n\n[[Page S44]]\n\n  Last year we spent over $200 billion in Medicare and Medicaid for \nAlzheimer's care. That is just a fraction of the total cost. Think \nabout what individual families spent, what private insurance sources \nspent, the charitable care that was given to Alzheimer's patients. So \nwhen we talk about increasing the NIH budget by $2 billion for 1 year, \nit is a tiny fraction. It is 1 percent of the amount we are spending on \nAlzheimer's.\n  If we could find a way to detect Alzheimer's earlier, delay its \nonset, reduce the period of time of suffering, or perhaps even find a \ncure, God willing, it would have a dramatic, positive impact on so many \nlives and families and on our bottom-line Federal budget. Take that \nargument about Alzheimer's and apply it as well to cancer. How many of \nour families and friends are suffering and fighting cancer right now? \nMy wife and I were struck over the holidays by how many of our close \nfriends are battling cancer at this moment. We know they are looking \nfor hope. They are looking for drugs. They are looking for something \nthat will break through and give them a chance at life. That is why I \nbelieve this biomedical research is so critical.\n  Let me add one postscript. Stopping with these agencies is not \nenough. I recently visited the Department of Energy. The new Secretary \nthere, Ernest Moniz, and I were talking about biomedical research. He \nsaid that when it comes to the technology for imaging that is making \nsuch a difference in the world, it isn't just in biomedicine; it is in \nengineering and science as well, in the Department of Science, within \nthe Department of Energy. So let's not be shortsighted. Let's have an \nopen mind about innovation and creation.\n  Last week I was in Peoria, IL, an area I am proud to represent. I \nwent to visit OSF Hospital there. I went to what is known as the Jump \nCenter. We don't forget that name very easily. What they have done in \nthe Jump Center is they have combined the University of Illinois \nMedical School and the University of Illinois Engineering Department in \na common effort to bring new engineering and new technology to medicine \nand medical breakthroughs. What they are doing there is amazing--first, \ntraining doctors and medical professionals to do their job effectively \nwithout mistakes. That, of course, is the ultimate outcome we are \nlooking for. Over their shoulders are engineers and technicians who are \nlooking at these doctors doing their work, finding new applications for \ncomputers and engineering technology that can make their work easier \nand more effective.\n  They showed me a model of the human heart. It was a heart of an \ninfant with serious heart problems. This model they gave me was the \nactual human heart reproduced of an infant who was facing surgery. They \ntook the MRIs and the CAT scans, put them into a 3D copier, and \nproduced this little heart that you could hold in your hand. They were \nable to give that heart to the surgeon to look at before the surgery, \nand they opened it so that the surgeon could look inside that heart \nmodel--a model which tracked the reality of that infant--and know \nbefore the surgery what he would find.\n  It meant less time on the heart-lung machine, a more likely positive \nrecovery. It was the use of technology in engineering to move us \nforward and to give that little baby a fighting chance. So I thank \nSenator Blunt. I want to especially thank my colleague Senator Patty \nMurray. She has been a terrific leader in this field, both on the \nappropriations and authorizing committees, and also Senator Lamar \nAlexander.\n  I think we have all come to conclude that regardless of how much time \nwe have in the Senate, we should leave a mark that makes a difference. \nWhen it comes to biomedical research, this year's budget, which Senator \nBlunt referred to, will make a difference. Now, let's make sure it is \nnot a one-hit wonder. Let's make sure we do it again in next year's \nbudget as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/12/senate-section/article/S44-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S44-S45]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FLOODING IN THE MIDWEST\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would also like to speak for a moment \nabout the flooding situation in the Midwest, and, of course, in my \ncolleagues' neighboring State of Missouri.\n  Last month, right in the midst of the holidays, rain storms swept \nthrough my State, covering it with 7 inches of rainfall in a very short \nperiod of time. The heavy rainfall caused water levels on the rivers to \nreach record highs. We were surprised. We expect this in the spring, \nnot in December. Communities had to evacuate their homes for their own \nsafety. Sadly, these storms were so severe they flooded roadways, \nclaiming the lives of 10 people whose vehicles were swept away by the \nfloods. Many of them did not realize how high the water actually was in \nthese flash floods or how fast it was moving. They got caught in \ndangerous waters.\n  Two areas that were some of the worst impacted were Alexander and \nRandolph Counties on the Mississippi River--Monroe County, I might add \nas well. Last Wednesday I went to visit two towns in these areas, Olive \nBranch and Evansville, to talk to the residents. In Olive Branch I met \nwith Alexander County board vice-chair Lamar Houston and spoke with \nState representative Brandon Phelps. Both have been working diligently \nto help the community recover.\n  I have some photographs which I think will tell the story. This a \nphotograph from Olive Branch. You can see water completely surrounding \nthe home and covering the nearby areas. The levee that protects the \ncommunities of Olive Branch, Hodges Park, and Unity was breached and \novertopped by a record crest at the Mississippi River. These overtops \ncaused miles of flood damage, impacting ag lands as well as homes and \nbusinesses.\n  Before flooding occurred, local law enforcement and emergency \nresponders tried to evacuate everybody as quickly as possible. \nThankfully, a lot of people heeded the call and went to find shelter \nwith family and friends, but many residents I spoke with in these towns \nwere still concerned about being able to recover from the flood and the \ndamage.\n  One man from Olive Branch, Bruce Ford, said his auto repair shop was \nengulfed by water. He worries he could be out of business for months. \nBruce is working night and day to clean out the debris and to move his \nequipment back in. He was not sure when his shop would be ready to \nopen. Even worse, if the levee breaches again this spring, which it \nmight, he worries that he will not have the means to fix it all over \nagain in just a few months.\n  In Evansville--and this photo is taken in that area; this was taken \non New Year's Eve crossing the Mississippi River at St. Louis. It shows \nthe devastation on the Illinois side. As you can see, these buildings \nare nearly completely submerged in water, and for many areas around St. \nLouis the damage you see here is typical. When I went to visit \nEvansville, about an hour south from here, I met with residents who \nworked around the clock to sandbag homes and businesses to keep the \nKaskaskia River out of their town.\n  I met with Evansville mayor Craig Valleroy, emergency management \ncodirector Nancy Shilling, who did a great job in making a presentation \nto me, and State Representative Jerry Costello, Jr.\n  I was given a tour around the waterfront and flooded areas. As is \noften the case with disasters like these, I was impressed with the \nlocal residents, first responders, local officials, and volunteers, who \njust stepped up and started filling sandbags. By building a wall of \nsandbags around downtown, Evansville residents were able to hold off \nthe worst of the flooding.\n  Last week, I spoke with the Illinois Emergency Management Agency \ndirector, James Joseph, and the FEMA Regional Administrator, Andrew \nVelasquez, about the rain and flooding. The Governor declared 23 \ncounties State disaster areas. State and local emergency responders \nwere dispatched to affected areas. The State provided almost 1 million \nsandbags--997,000; 4,000 tons of sand; and 117 DOT trucks for flood \nmitigation.\n  As the water continues to recede in the coming days, local officials \nand the Illinois Emergency Management Agency are working together to \nassess the damages. I might say there is one issue that Senator Kirk \nand I have looked at over and over again. We are blessed in our State \nto have about 13 million people. The largest percentage of them are \naround the Chicagoland area, but we have a vast State beyond Chicago. \nThat is where I hail from--downstate Illinois, with hundreds of miles \nof small town and rural areas.\n\n[[Page S45]]\n\n  When they go through flooding like this, and they are making a \ncalculation of how much damage there has to be in order for the Federal \nGovernment to step in and help pay for the damage, they take into \naccount the entire State and its population. The net result is, had \nthis flooding occurred in a sparsely populated State, they would have \nreceived Federal assistance. But we have to hit a threshold number of \nabout $18 million in public infrastructure damage before we qualify for \nFederal assistance.\n  Senator Kirk and I have both witnessed the damage of two tornadoes in \nIllinois, one in Washington, IL, and another one in Harrisburg, which \nat first glance we thought would clearly qualify for Federal \nassistance. In neither case did we make the threshold of $18 million in \ndamage. So I think this formula needs to be recalculated. The fact that \nwe happen to have a great city like Chicago and the region around it as \npart of our State should not really inure to the detriment of people \ndownstate in smaller rural areas who suffer this kind of damage from \nflooding and tornadoes.\n  I am proud of the volunteers who came forward. I want to thank our \nNational Guard. They are always there when we need them. Local law \nenforcement never gets enough credit--our firefighters, police, first \nresponders, hospitals, and volunteers.\n  When I went into Olive Branch--it is a tiny town--most of the \nactivity in the community center that I went into was happening in the \nkitchen. They said: Go to that lady wearing the pink hat. She is in \ncharge. She had been there every single day since this flooding \nstarted, asking all the neighbors to bring in covered dishes and some \nfood for the volunteers and the people who were displaced from their \nhomes. God bless them for caring so much for their neighbors and \nresponding in this time of need.\n  I want to recognize the hard work of the Federal and State employees \nwho have been engaged in this. I have no doubt that the people of my \nState who have been impacted by these floods are going to roll up their \nsleeves and clean up the mess and get ready to make life normal again.\n  Our thoughts are with the many people today who have lost their loved \nones. There were about 25 who died in these floods in the Midwest. We \nwill again stand with them and others as we prepare for the future, to \nrebuild as the people of Illinois and the United States always do, \nstronger for the experience.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake).

Mr. President, we are going to Mars--Mars or bust. We are \ngoing to send a human crew to Mars in the decade of the 2030s. We are \nright at the cusp of the breakthrough to show how this is possible. I \nhave just returned from the Kennedy Space Center, meeting with its \nDirector, Bob Cabana. All of the ground infrastructure--the two launch \npads--are being reconfigured. Old abandoned launch pads on Cape \nCanaveral Air Force Station are being redone with new commercial launch \npads.\n  Less than 2 years from right now, in September of 2017, we will be \nlaunching Americans again on American rockets to go to and from the \nInternational Space Station. Three years from now, we will be launching \nthe full-up test of the largest and most powerful rocket ever invented \nby mankind, the Space Launch System, with its spacecraft Orion, which \nwill be the forerunner that will ultimately take us to Mars.\n  This appropriations bill that we passed just before Christmas treats \nNASA with a decent increase of over $1 billion and puts the resources \ninto each part of NASA--its scientific programs, its technology \nprograms, its exploration programs, its aviation, and especially \naviation research programs--to keep us moving forward in our \ndevelopment of technology.\n  I am especially enthusiastic about bringing this message because 30 \nyears ago today, I had the privilege of launching on the 24th flight of \nthe space shuttle into the heavens for a 6-day mission. Let me tell you \nabout some of the members of this crew, just to give you an idea of how \naccomplished these people are.\n  In NASA terminology in the space shuttle, the commander sits on the \nleft seat; on the right seat, his pilot--in effect, his copilot. He \nhandles all of the systems. In almost all cases, those pilot astronauts \nare military test pilots. They are so good that when they land that \nspace shuttle without an engine, they have one chance; they are so good \nthey can put it on a dime.\n  Of course, our crew, 30 years ago launching from pad 39-A--the same \npad that I saw on Saturday that has now been transformed into a \ncommercial launch pad under lease to SpaceX--that crew was the best of \nthe best. The two pilot astronauts were naval aviators. In the left \nseat was CDR Hoot Gibson--Robert Gibson, the best stick-and-rudder guy \nin the whole astronaut office. He could put it down, and you would \nhardly know that the wheels had touched.\n  In the right seat, then Marine colonel, now Marine general, retired, \nCharlie Bolden, who then went on to command three missions thereafter, \nand today is--for the last 7 years--the Administrator of NASA. He is \nthe one who has transformed NASA and has us going in the right \ndirection now to go to Mars and at the same time working out the \narrangements for the commercial marketplace to flourish, as we are \nseeing with Boeing and SpaceX, which will be the two rockets that will \nlaunch in less than 2 years, taking Americans to and from the \nInternational Space Station.\n  Let me tell you about the rest of the crew that launched 30 years ago \ntoday. The flight engineer, Steve Hawley, an astrophysicist. By the \nway, he is the one who deployed for the first time the Hubble Space \nTelescope. An astrophysicist, Dr. George ``Pinky'' Nelson. By the way, \nall of these guys are doctors. They are Ph.D.s. Also, Dr. Franklin \nChang-Diaz, an astronaut who came to America from Costa Rica--not \nspeaking a word of English after high school and taught himself \nEnglish. He has a Ph.D. in plasma physics from MIT. While he was still \nflying, seven times as an astronaut, he was building a plasma \nrocket. Today that plasma rocket is one of the propulsion systems that \nNASA is considering when we go to Mars. If you saw the Matt Damon \nmovie, ``The Martian,'' the author of the book had consulted with \nFranklin about the technology that is referenced in the book as the \npropulsion that sent that spacecraft to and from Mars. Another is \nengineer Bob Cenker, an RCA engineer. We launched an RCA communications \nsatellite in the course of the mission.\n\n  The seventh is yours truly. I performed 12 medical experiments, the \nprimary of which was a protein crystal growth experiment in zero-g, \nsponsored by the medical school at the University of Alabama at \nBirmingham--their comprehensive cancer center. The theory was if you \ncould grow protein crystals--and out of the influence of gravity--then \nyou could grow them larger and more pure, so when you brought them back \nto Earth, examining them either through x-ray defraction or an electron \nmicroscope, you could unlock the secrets of their architecture and get \nthe molecular structure.\n  I also performed the first American stress test in space in an \nunmechanized treadmill. You wonder how in zero-g you can propel \nyourself running on a treadmill. I had to put on a harness with bungee \ncords that would force me down onto the treadmill, and I pulled and \npushed with my feet. We were trying to see what happens to our \nastronauts who go outside on spacewalks. Their hearts would start \nskipping beats. So the idea was to get the heart rate up and use me as \na comparison.\n  Indeed, what happened was I ran for 20 minutes, pulling and pushing. \nLo and behold I discovered that the tape recorder was not working and \nhad to repeat it. It made so much racket in that small confined space \nthat our crew was mighty happy when I finished. Thus, the space doctors \nhad additional data to study, and they have published that. We thought \nit was the first stress test in space, but later on we found out that \nthe Soviets had done stress tests--we don't know how long.\n\n[[Page S46]]\n\n  On this occasion, 30 years later, of something that was \ntransformative to me, I wish to say I am so optimistic of where we are \ngoing because we are going to Mars. If you ask the average American on \nthe street, they think the space program is shut down because they \nvisualize it as the shutting down of the space shuttle, but they will \nbe reminded, reenergized, enthused and excited--as only human space \nflight can do--when those rockets start lifting off at the Cape in \nSeptember of 2017, in less than 2 years, and we are beginning on our \nway to Mars.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for this opportunity on this 30th \nanniversary.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/12/senate-section/article/S46-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S46-S50]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FEDERAL RESERVE TRANSPARENCY BILL\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise this morning to speak about the \nlegislation we will be considering this afternoon. Specifically, my \nunderstanding is we will be voting on a procedural measure which will \nallow us to take up legislation that is commonly known as auditing the \nFed. I want to address that.\n  Let me start with the context that I think is important to think \nabout when we consider whether we ought to even modestly change the \nrelationship that exists between Congress and the Fed. It starts for me \nwith the simple observation that the financial crisis of 2008 is over. \nIt actually ended a long time ago. It has been a number of years now \nthat our financial system and our economy has not been in the imminent-\ncrisis-meltdown mode that it was in the fall of 2008. In fact, for \nseveral years now we have had meager but some economic growth. Our \nbanking system has been massively recapitalized. There is no current or \nimminent wave of bankruptcies in really any segment of the economy.\n  Yet despite the fact that we are clearly not in a financial or \neconomic crisis, we have crisis-era monetary policy, policy from the \nFed that one would expect to occur--presumably--only in a crisis. The \nrecent very modest change in Fed policy, the movement in the Fed funds \nrate from a target of zero to 25 basis points to 25 to 50 basis points \nis arguably the most modest tightening in Fed history. You couldn't \neven begin to suggest that this is a tightening of monetary policy. \nThis is just a very slightly less easy money policy. That is what we \nhave.\n  So in my view there are huge dangers and problems that are associated \nwith the Fed pursuing this completely unprecedented and, I would say, \nradical experiment in monetary policy. I wish to talk about a few of \nthose this morning.\n  One of the first and clearest problems is because the Fed has kept \ninterest rates so low for so long, the Fed has caused a big \nmisallocation of resources. This undoubtedly caused asset bubbles that \nare existing today that would not have occurred had it not been for the \nabnormal monetary policy. For instance, take sovereign debt markets. In \nmany cases--especially in Europe--we have debt issued by governments \nand the return on those instruments is negative. In other words it \ndoesn't cost the government money to borrow money, which is abnormal. \nYou have to pay interest to borrow money normally. In fact, the \ngovernment gets paid to borrow money, which is ridiculous and it is \nextremely abnormal. It has happened in the United States, not at the \nmoment but in recent history. As a result of this Fed policy, we have \nhad the bizarre world of negative interest rates. That is just one \ncategory that has clearly been in the bubble.\n  Most observers believe that the high-yield market, the junk bond \nmarket, was in a bubble. That has gone through a very turbulent time \nand a big selloff--arguably, some of the years coming out of that \nbubble, but who knows. There has been considerable speculation that \nthere are real estate bubbles, other financial assets. This is \ninevitable when the Fed distorts monetary policy, and it is a \ndisturbing echo of the distortion that occurred back in the early part \nof the very beginning of this century, when the Fed's extremely low \nmonetary policy of very low interest rates contributed to a housing \nbubble which of course ended up collapsing in the financial crisis, but \nthat is just one category of problems the Fed causes with these ultra-\nlow interest rates.\n  Of course, the second is the corollary that people who have saved \nmoney and want to invest in a low-risk investment are completely denied \nan opportunity to get a return. The savers are forced to--the \nexpression is--reach for yield, which is to say: Take your money out of \nthe bank and buy something else because you are earning nothing with \nthe bank.\n  Well, you know what, for a lot of people a savings account at the \nbank is appropriate for their circumstances, for their risk tolerance, \nbut they are driven away from that because bank deposits yield pretty \nmuch zero.\n  Consider the case of an elderly couple who lives in Allentown, PA. \nThey worked their whole lives, saved whenever they could, sacrificed, \nchose not to squander their money, and they lived modestly rather than \nlavishly. They did it in the expectation that when they retired, this \nnest egg that they had worked decades to build, this savings account at \nthe bank, was going to yield a little bit of income to help them make \nends meet in their retirement, to help supplement whatever Social \nSecurity and whatever pension they might have.\n  What we have done to those folks--and they are all over America--who \nhave spent a lifetime living prudently, carefully, sacrificing savings, \nwe have said: Well, you made a huge mistake because the government is \nmaking sure you earn nothing on those savings.\n  Joseph Stiglitz is a very respected economist. His research has \ndemonstrated that this zero interest rate and quantitative easing--as \nit is described, this Fed monetary policy--has contributed \nsignificantly to expanding income and wealth inequality. It is not a \nsurprise.\n  This Fed policy has been very good for stocks. Stock prices have gone \nup, generally. It has been terrible for people with a bank account. \nWhile wealthy people have a lot of money in stocks, people of much more \nmodest means tend to have more of their money sitting in a savings \naccount which, as I have just described, earned zero. So the income \ninequality problem is exacerbated.\n  In addition, what the Fed has been doing is encouraging fiscal \nirresponsibility in Washington. What the heck, borrowing is free, which \nit basically has been for the Federal Government. Why not run big \ndeficits and borrow lots of money? That is an attitude that some people \nhave. It frankly diminishes the pressure on Congress to pursue sensible \nand responsible monetary policy. When the Fed is willing to just buy up \nall the debt and buy it at an extremely low interest rate, it \nencourages irresponsible behavior.\n  Now, of course, because the Federal Government has accumulated this \n$18 trillion mountain of debt, if and when interest rates return to \nsomething like normal--which one day they will, whether the Fed likes \nit or not--then that is a devastating problem for our budget outlook.\n  So all of this is particularly disturbing to me when you consider \nthat this massive creation of money, this flooding the world with \ndollars that the Fed has engaged in, does not create wealth. It is the \ndifference between money and wealth.\n  So some people might feel wealthier when they see stock prices rise \nif they have stocks, but that can be a very artificial phenomenon. It \nis an inflation in asset prices. It is not an improvement in \nproductivity. It is not an expansion in our economic output. It is not \nactual wealth. It is numbers on a piece of paper.\n  Of course, what the Fed is able to inflate in this artificial means \nby creating lots of money, well, that can eventually deflate. Whatever \ngood they think they were accomplishing on the way up, why should we \nthink we couldn't see the reverse on the way back down? This is what I \nthink is the fundamental problem. The fact is, we have factors that are \nholding back our economy that are very real and very important, and the \nFed's monetary policy can't correct that.\n  We have a Tax Code that is completely uncompetitive. It discourages \nwork. It discourages savings. It discourages investment. It makes us \nless competitive in countries around the\n\n[[Page S47]]\n\nworld that have more sensible tax codes than we have. We need to fix \nthe Tax Code. Monetary policy cannot make up for a badly flawed Tax \nCode.\n  We have unsustainable entitlement programs. They are the ultimate \ndrivers of large and growing deficits, and we will not be on a \nsustainable path until we fix these programs, and monetary policy can't \nmake up for the cloud they cast over our economy. We have a declining \npercentage of Americans who are participating in the workforce. This is \na huge problem for us. Again, monetary policy does nothing about that.\n  Finally, we have been overregulating this economy on a completely \nunprecedented scale. The massive wave of overregulation that this \nadministration, and on some occasions Congress, has inflicted on our \neconomy clearly contributes a great deal to the subpar economic growth \nwe have been living through. Again, monetary policy doesn't reverse \nthat. It doesn't change that. It seems to me that, despite all their \ngood intentions, their intentions themselves were flawed in that the \nFed seems to be trying to compensate for the flawed policy in these \nother areas.\n\n  Given the magnitude, the persistence, and the dangers of pursuing \nthis kind of monetary policy, I think it is time that Congress reassert \nits authority over monetary affairs. The Constitution clearly gives \nCongress the responsibility to mint coins and to print money. In 1914, \nCongress delegated the management of our currency to the Fed. For a \nlong time there was a sense that we ought to just leave them to their \nown devices and not pay very much attention. I think those days are \npast. I think the Fed's behavior obligates us to take a different \napproach.\n  One good beginning step is the legislation we are considering today, \nwhich would audit the Fed. All it really does is give Congress and the \nAmerican people the opportunity to examine and understand the mechanics \nand the thinking behind changes in monetary policy in something close \nto real time. I think we absolutely need that. I will say that I was a \nskeptic about this for a long time. I thought: I am not so sure it is \nsuch a good idea to have Congress looking over the shoulders of the \nfolks making monetary policy. But I think the dangerous behavior that \nthe Fed has engaged in for years now means they have squandered the \nright to be independent. We need to have more supervision.\n  A next step which I think would be very important is for Congress to \nrequire the Fed to adopt a rule that would govern monetary policy. If \nwe let the Fed decide what that rule should be and if circumstances \nrequire it, in the opinion of the Fed, they ought to be able to deviate \nfrom that rule. But they should come and explain to the American people \nand to Congress when and why they are deviating, rather than have year \nafter year of this bizarre, unnatural policy that is very hard to \nexplain and understand.\n  So I am going to support the legislation we are considering this \nafternoon, the audit the fed bill. It is one of many important steps we \ncan take to restore the accountability that the Fed ought to have. It \nis important that we get on a different path with our monetary policy. \nI understand it is not going to occur overnight, and it is not going to \noccur entirely as a result of this legislation. But this policy has \nbeen going on too long, and it is time for Congress to reassert its \nauthority.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to offer my \nstrong support for the legislation we are debating today that would \nfinally audit the Federal Reserve.\n  Since I came to Congress, I have supported auditing the Fed. When I \nwas first elected to the House of Representatives, I would attend \nbriefings hosted by Congressman Ron Paul, Senator Paul's father, and I \nlearned why more accountability and transparency was needed at the Fed.\n  I remember talking to Congressman Paul on the House floor about \nvarious issues at the Fed, and that is when I started to support this \nbill to audit the Fed, just as I am supporting his son's bill today. I \nthank Senator Paul for continuing to take up this cause and for \nbuilding the momentum to audit the Fed that has led us to where we are \ntoday.\n  Since its founding, the Federal Reserve has often operated in \nsecrecy, even though it is the biggest influence on our country's \neconomy. The Fed's actions affect every American family and their hard-\nearned income. I am fortunate to be chairman of the Economic Policy \nSubcommittee on the Senate banking committee, where I have direct \noversight over the Federal Reserve's monetary policies. I can say that \nthe Federal Reserve's actions warrant passage of this legislation. For \nseveral years we have seen unprecedented monetary and regulatory \npolicies come from the Fed. One of the riskiest policies I have ever \nseen is the Fed's stimulus program of quantitative easing. The Federal \nReserve essentially turned on their computers, fired up their \nelectronic printing presses, created new money out of thin air, and \nstarted to buy assets.\n  Now, we may ask ourselves this: How big is this stimulus program? It \nis an unbelievable number. As of today, it is nearly $4.5 trillion. Let \nme say that again: $4.5 trillion. And that is with a ``t.'' That is \nmore than four times the cost of President Obama's own failed stimulus \nprogram. And who has benefited from this quantitative easing? I can \ntell you in two words: It is Wall Street. That is right. Wall Street \nhit the jackpot because the Fed's easy money policies drove everybody \ninto the equities market to get any return they possibly could on their \ninvestments. Wall Street won, and Main Street, savers, and workers \nlost.\n  The scary part is the Fed won't rule out buying more assets in the \nfuture. If we ask the Fed today when or how they would begin to reduce \ntheir $4.5 trillion balance sheet, there is nothing but silence. Is \nthat being transparent? Is that accountability? No, absolutely not. \nThis is just one of the reasons why we must pass this bill to audit the \nFed.\n  I find it ironic that the Federal Reserve is so opposed to being \naudited, because they themselves go around auditing lending \ninstitutions all the time. I frequently hear from community lenders in \nNevada who have either the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the National \nCredit Union Administration or the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \nknocking on their door all the time. These community lenders have not \ncaused the financial crisis, yet they are the ones feeling the brunt of \nall these audits. Why should there be a double standard that government \nagencies can examine every American's bank account but the American \npublic can't examine those same agencies back? Again, this is why we \nmust pass this legislation to audit the Fed.\n  I remind my colleagues that even though most of the news about the \nFed revolves around interest rates and the Fed's monetary policy, the \nFed is also responsible for major regulations that touch on almost \nevery aspect of our financial system. Now, I support reasonable \nregulations, but only after thoughtful and careful evaluations. I think \nit should be mandated that the Fed conduct a cost-benefit analysis of \nall their proposed regulations and always allow for public comment on \nproposed regulations.\n  I am also very concerned that the Fed is getting involved in \nfinancial sectors in which they have not been in the past. We have a \nlong tradition here in the United States of having a time-tested and \neffective State-based insurance regulatory system. Unfortunately, Dodd-\nFrank has changed all that, and now the Federal Reserve has new \nauthorities over the insurance sector.\n  Right now, as we speak, the Fed is attempting to regulate capital \nstandard requirements for insurance companies in the United States. \nThis will be the first time the Federal Government imposes domestic \nFederal capital standards on the State-regulated insurance industry.\n  I worked very hard to ensure bank-centric standards are not \ninappropriately applied to the insurance industry by the Fed. But not \nonly does the Fed want to add their own domestic layer of rules on top \nof State-based insurance regulations, they even want another layer of \none-size-fits-all international capital standards on top of that. I \nalmost have to laugh, because it is only in Washington, DC, where a \nFederal agency can put the trailer in front of the truck.\n  Unfortunately, that is exactly what the Fed is doing by working on \ninternational capital standards before they\n\n[[Page S48]]\n\ncomplete their own domestic standards. I have serious concerns about \nthese international efforts. Together with Senator Tester of Montana, \nwe introduced the bipartisan International Insurance Capital Standards \nAccountability Act, which would compel the Federal Reserve and the \nTreasury Department to complete a study on consumers and markets in the \nUnited States before supporting any international insurance proposal or \ninternational insurance capital standard.\n  These are just a few of the examples of some of the Fed's \nquestionable actions. As I said earlier, this legislation to audit the \nFed is critical to bring transparency and accountability to the Fed, \nbut even more fundamental changes need to be made.\n  A few months ago, Chairman Shelby put together an impressive bill \nthat the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee passed \nwith my support, which would make important reforms to the Fed. One \nprovision would establish a commission to study the potential \nrestructuring of the districts in the Federal Reserve System. Chairman \nShelby's bill would also require the Fed's Federal Open Market \nCommittee to make more frequent and detailed reporting requirements to \nCongress and to increase transparency by reducing the time lag for \nFederal Open Market Committee transcripts from 5 years to 3 years. \nThese are very reasonable changes that I think Democrats and \nRepublicans alike can support, and I hope that Chairman Shelby's bill \nwill be brought to the Senate floor soon.\n  The Federal Reserve recently celebrated its 100th anniversary, and in \nmany aspects the Fed has not changed much since Woodrow Wilson's time. \nAs most of us know, a few months ago we cut a very specific dividend \nthat banks receive for buying stock of the Federal Reserve System in \norder to pay for the highway bill. While the debate mostly centered on \nhow to cut the dividend, I was trying to figure out why the Federal \nReserve requires banks to buy these so-called stocks to begin with. \nAfter all, it doesn't look like the Fed is in desperate need of funds, \nbecause over the past half dozen years the Fed has sent nearly half a \ntrillion dollars of profits to the U.S. Treasury.\n  One hundred years ago, these stock purchases and dividends were meant \nto incentivize banks to join the Federal Reserve System. Since that \ntime, laws have been passed that essentially don't give a bank the \nchoice as to whether or not they want to be supervised by the Federal \nReserve System because, by law, the Fed has gained authority over all \nbanks that are eligible for FDIC insurance. Just because something was \nstandard practice over 100 years ago does not mean it is still needed \ntoday. I think it is time to review and examine these Federal Reserve \nmembership requirements even further.\n  My colleagues, it is essential that Congress exercise its \nconstitutional responsibility to conduct oversight and scrutinize of \nthe Federal Reserve in an open and transparent way, which is why I will \nproudly vote today to move forward with auditing the Fed, and I \nencourage my colleagues to join me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in opposition to S. \n2232, the Federal Reserve Transparency Act. I am concerned that, out of \nall the issues before the Senate and out of all the issues we need to \nwork on--in terms of growth, in terms of ISIS, in terms of wage \ninequality, in terms of transportation, and so many other issues--this \nis the first bill the Senate considers at the beginning of the year.\n  I will talk for a moment about the direction in which we should go, \nbut I want to talk about this issue. There are so many issues we are \nnot talking about--national security, job creation, college \naffordability, student debt, and immigration.\n  In my time in Ohio over the past several weeks, people talked to me \nabout all kinds of different issues that Congress should be addressing. \nBut it, frankly, comes as no surprise to anybody watching or any of my \ncolleagues that not one person came up to me and said: ``Congress needs \na greater say in monetary policy.'' There is no demand for that, except \nfrom those who want to score political points. There is no reason for \nthis. There is no legitimate public function that we should even do \nthis legislation, the Federal Reserve Transparency Act. And don't be \nfooled by the name of the bill because it really isn't about \ntransparency. It is about the Federal Reserve but not about \ntransparency. But let me move on.\n  Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen recently wrote to Senate leaders, \ncopying all of us in the Senate, and spoke to the central problem with \nthis legislation:\n\n       This bill risks undoing the steady progress that has been \n     made on the economic recovery over recent years in an \n     environment with low and stable inflation expectations; \n     progress that was made in part because the Federal Reserve is \n     able to make independent decisions in the longer-term \n     economic interest of the American people.\n       ``Audit the Fed'' legislation, if enacted, would undermine \n     the independence of the Federal Reserve and likely lead to an \n     increase in inflation fears and market interest rates, a \n     diminished status of the dollar in global financial markets, \n     increased debt service costs for the federal government, and \n     reduced economic and financial stability.\n\n  Janet Yellen is exactly right. This legislation is about 535 Members \nof Congress getting involved in Federal monetary policy. I can't \nimagine that the American people want a Federal Reserve where Congress \nis so involved that it is disruptive and where it becomes so political. \nThat is really what this is all about. It is about a handful of Members \nof the House and Senate who want to govern monetary policy in a way so \nthat it ultimately won't work in the public interest. It is about their \npolitical talking points. It is about all of that.\n\n  Let's go back. When President Obama took office--you will hear about \nthis in tonight's speech, I assume, down the hall in the House of \nRepresentatives--our country was losing about 800,000 jobs a month when \nhe took office. In February 2010, we did the Recovery Act and the auto \nrescue. Since February 2010, we have seen job growth for about 69, 70, \n71 straight months since the auto rescue. I know what the auto rescue \nmeant in my State. I know we see an auto industry that is doing very \nwell and we see a lot more people back to work.\n  Supporters of auditing the Fed claim they want to make the Fed's \noperations and activities more transparent. We know that is not what \nthis is about. In a statement in July, the Senate banking committee \nchairman--the Republican chair of the committee, Richard Shelby, hit \nthe nail on the head. Here is what he said:\n\n       A lot of people called for an audit of the Fed for years, \n     but they already audit the Fed for years . . . I don't \n     believe they're just talking about an audit, like you'd audit \n     the books of somebody--they're talking about monetary policy. \n     They're talking about . . . 435 members of the House and 100 \n     Senators getting into the day-to-day business of the monetary \n     policy of the Fed. We created the Fed, Congress did, to get \n     politics as far as we could out of it. I don't believe we \n     need politics back in it.\n\n  Chairman Shelby is right. We don't need 535 Members of Congress on \nthe Federal Open Market Committee. One of the most important components \nwe need for sound monetary decisionmaking policy is political \nindependence.\n  Senator Paul--the sponsor of this--argues that we need to understand \nthe ``extent of the Fed's balance sheet.''\n  Congress already requires the Federal Reserve to have its financial \nstatements audited every year by an external auditor, someone who is \noutside, independent of all matters relating to the Fed. The Fed \nreleases a quarterly report presenting detailed information on the \nFed's balance sheet and information on the combined financial position \nand results of operations of the Federal Reserve Banks. That report is \nreleased to Congress. The report is available to the public on the \nFed's Web site. Anyone can go to federalreserve.gov right now and read \nit.\n  Each week the Fed publishes its balance sheet and charts of recent \nbalance sheet trends. There are legitimate criticisms of the Federal \nReserve. There always have been. There probably always will be because \nof its reach and complexity, but since the crisis the Fed has gotten \nbetter. It has gotten better in part because of the last two Chairs of \nthe Federal Reserve--Ben Bernanke, a Bush appointee and then an Obama \nnominee the second time, and with Janet Yellen, an Obama\n\n[[Page S49]]\n\nnominee. Since the crisis, the Government Accountability Office has \nconducted over 100 audits of the Federal Reserve's activities. Many of \nthese audits relate to the financial crisis, including the Fed's \nemergency lending activities. There is more and there should be more.\n  The Fed is transparent and accountable in the following ways. Let me \nlist them again. This is not an out-and-out defense of the Fed. They \nshould be open to criticism. There is still much to criticize about \nthem, but this legislation solves nothing, except to politicize the \nFed. These are the ways the Fed is transparent and accountable: The \nChair of the Federal Reserve is required to testify before the Senate \nBanking Committee and the House Financial Services Committee twice a \nyear on monetary policy. In practice, she will testify at additional \nhearings and other topics. The Governors of the Federal Reserve and \nsenior staff--that is, others of the nine members of the Federal \nReserve--testify dozens more times every year.\n  The Fed releases a statement after each Federal Open Market Committee \nmeeting to describe the FOMC's decisions and the reasoning behind those \ndecisions. The Chair holds press conferences four times a year after \nFOMC meetings. Minutes of FOMC meetings are released 3 weeks after each \nmeeting and are available on the Federal Reserve's Web site. \nTranscripts of FOMC meetings are released earlier than before--5 years \nafter each meeting and are available on the Fed's Web site. That is \nmuch earlier than most other central banks release transcripts, for \nobvious reasons.\n  Summaries of the economic forecasts of FOMC participants, including \ntheir projections for the most likely path of the Federal funds rate, \nare released quarterly. The Board's Office of the Inspector General \naudits and investigates all of the Fed's Board and Reserve bank \nprograms, operations, and functions. These completed audits, \nassessments, and reviews are listed in the Federal Reserve Board's \nannual report.\n  The Fed releases detailed transaction-level data on the discount \nwindow lending and open market operations. This is relatively new. This \nwas required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law. Clearly, \nCongress knew the Fed was not as responsible and open as it should be. \nOne of the things we did in Dodd-Frank was this reform. All securities \nthat the Fed holds are published on the Federal Reserve Bank of New \nYork's Web site.\n  The New York Fed, the most important district regional Federal \nReserve--there are 12 of them, including one in the city I live in, \nCleveland. The New York Fed is the most important for a number of \nreasons. It publishes an annual report of the system open market \naccount that includes a detailed summary of open market operations over \nthe year, and it includes balance sheet and income projections. I would \nadd, this Chair of the Federal Reserve is more open to the public. This \nChair of the Federal Reserve is out and about the country, as was her \npredecessor, Chairman Bernanke, and Chair Yellen even more so. She was \nin Cleveland not too long ago last summer making a speech to the City \nClub of Cleveland. Afterward she and I went to visit a large Cleveland \nnational manufacturer with a large site in Cleveland so she could see \nthe real economy, talk to workers, and see how important manufacturing \nis, especially in the middle of the country, to all things Federal \nReserve.\n  I wonder how many of those claiming the Fed is not transparent have \nactually taken the time to read some of these reports I mentioned--\nwhether it is the annual report, whether it is some of the audits, \nwhether it is some of the transcripts of FOMC, and I wonder if they \nhave listened to very many of these hours of testimony from Chair \nYellen or from Governor Tarullo, Governor Powell or others on the \nFederal Reserve. The Fed is far from perfect. I have been one of its \nmajor critics in this body, as the ranking Democrat on banking, but I \nargued, for instance, that it should be a stronger regulator of the \nNation's large bank holding companies. I appreciate what it is doing \nwith living wills. I think that is very important. I especially \nappreciate what the Fed has done for stronger capital standards. To me, \nthat is the most important thing we can do. It is more important than \nreinstatement of Glass-Steagall, more important than my amendment of 5 \nyears ago to break up the largest banks, making sure banks have \nsignificant enough capital to make the system safer and sounder, but it \nis hard to dispute that this Fed is one of the most transparent central \nbanks in the world.\n  What is this truly all about? I know some of people are unhappy about \ndecisions the Federal Reserve made during the financial crisis, \nincluding holding interest rates near zero for 7 years. They want to \nshow their anger at the Fed by taking away independence, but without \nthe Fed's extraordinary monetary policy actions, which might not have \nbeen possible if its actions were micromanaged by Congress, our economy \nwould likely be in a far worse situation today.\n  Several months ago I was asked by C-SPAN to interview Chairman \nBernanke on one of its shows called ``After Words.'' We sat for an hour \nat a studio in Washington and discussed the memoir that Chairman \nBernanke began to write on the day he left the Federal Reserve a couple \nof years ago. It was clear then that because Congress had pursued, in \nterms of fiscal policy, such austerity, he saw the economic growth that \nhad started with the auto rescue and the Recovery Act, he saw that \neconomic growth--immobilized is perhaps not the right word, but he saw \nthat economic growth stall. He knew, because Congress was starting to \nsqueeze the economy at that point with the wrong kind of fiscal policy, \nthat he had to make up for it by low interest rates and ultimately by \nquantitative easing, which is what he did. So understanding that he \nknew he would offend some Members of Congress with that action, he also \nunderstood that because he was independent, he could do the kinds of \nthings, as Chair Yellen has been able to do, to get this economy \ngrowing. Hence, in large part because of the auto rescue but in large \npart because of QE that the Federal Reserve has done through the last \ntwo Chairs of the Federal Reserve--one a Republican appointee and one a \nDemocratic appointee--the Fed has been independent enough to do the \nright thing.\n  Inflation remains low. We have something called a dual mandate, where \nthe Federal Reserve is responsible for working to keep inflation at no \nmore than 2 percent and unemployment at no more than 5 percent. The Fed \nhas balanced that well. Inflation remains low, despite the doomsday \nprediction by many of this bill's proponents. We know our economy still \nhas a way to go and that too many Americans are struggling, but it is \nclear that an increase in interest rates before last month would have \nbeen premature and would have been harmful to working Americans. If \nCongress were involved in that, in the way that the sponsor of this \nbill seems to want, our economy would be in much worse shape. I don't \nthink there is much question about that.\n  Audit the Fed legislation, there is also a backdoor, piecemeal way of \ninstituting something called the Taylor rule, which is an attempt to \nimpose a monetary policy role on the Fed. To me, this is the heart of \nthis legislation that when they look at the dual mandate, they think \nway more about inflation, which is what the bondholders of Wall Street \nwant them to do, and way less about fiscal policy and way less about \nlow interest rates and way less about employment. The dual mandate is \ninflation and employment.\n  If you lean far too much toward inflation, which is what Wall Street \nwants, then people on Main Street are left out. Frankly, that has been \nthe story of the Fed for far too many years. That is why what Chairman \nBernanke did and what Chairwoman Yellen have done is so important, but \nif the audit the Fed sponsors have their way, we will see some kind of \nTaylor rule.\n  In November, House Republicans passed a Federal Reserve reform bill \nthat imposes the Taylor rule. The enforcement mechanism? GAO reviews, \naudits, and reports. Is there any doubt that this is where the audit \nthe Fed effort is headed next?\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no this afternoon. This vote will take \nplace in a couple of hours. It is in the interests of all of us to \nunderstand the role, the operations, and the activities of the Federal \nReserve. We can do that better\n\n[[Page S50]]\n\nin this body. This is not the way to do it. We can do it better. It is \nalso in the interest of the American economy for Congress to keep its \npolitical hands, if you will, out of monetary policy decisionmaking.\n  If Republicans were serious about making the Fed work better, they \nwould confirm the two pending nominees to the Board of Governors--a \nRepublican community banker named Al Landon, who has been waiting for a \nnomination hearing for a year, and Kathryn Dominquez, a Democratic \nnominee, who has been waiting for nearly 6 months. Yet, instead of \nworking to improve the Fed's operations, we are considering this bill \nto undermine it. It is a big mistake that most people I know who have \nany expertise in the Federal Reserve reject. I ask my colleagues to \nvote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, tonight the President of the United States \nwill offer his last State of the Union speech and one that I know we \nwill all be listening carefully to. I couldn't help but reflect on the \nfirst speech he gave to a joint session of Congress back in 2009, \nshortly after his inauguration. It was a hopeful speech, it was an \noptimistic speech--one that appealed to the better angels of \nRepublicans and Democrats and the whole Nation alike. He said we needed \nto pull together and boldly confront the challenges we face, but \nsomewhere along the way he seems to have forgotten the benefit of \nfinding common ground where folks can agree. It seems we have seen the \nObama administration more involved in dividing the American people when \nfacing opposition and then preferring to go it alone rather than to \nwork with Congress under the constitutional scheme created by our \nFounding Fathers.\n  Tonight in his final address on his priorities as President, I am \nsure President Obama will want to talk about what his legacy looks like \nonce he leaves office, and that will invariably include times when he \nhas simply done an end run around Congress. We have seen it time and \ntime again. It is a mistake. It is shortsighted, but it is his method \nof governing and presumably being able to tell people: Well, I have \ngotten my way and I haven't had to do the hard work of working with \npeople of different points of view to find the areas where we agree.\n  I have said it before, but I think it is worth noting the comment by \nthe senior Senator from Wyoming, when I said to him: You are on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions with Teddy Kennedy, the liberal lion of \nthe Senate, whom I served with for a while before he unfortunately \npassed away. How is it that you are able to work with somebody whose \nworld view is so opposite from yours and you are still able to actually \nget things done? To this he replied: It is simple. It is the 80-20 \nrule. We look at the 80 percent of things we can agree upon, and we do \nthose and forget the 20 percent we can't agree on.\n  I fear that our country and the Congress has become a Congress that \nlooks at the 20 percent we can't agree on and as a result can't do the \n80 percent that we do agree on because we disagree on the 20 percent, \nand that is a mistake. It is also not the scheme of government that was \ncreated by America and our Constitution, and it would be a mistake to \ndo nothing because we can't agree on the 20 percent when we can agree \non the 80 percent.\n  I know there are some areas where we are going to have a fundamental \ndisagreement, and we are going to continue to fight and oppose each \nother's points of view, but I have been around here long enough to know \nthat there are people of goodwill on both sides of the aisle, some of \nwhom I disagree with strenuously, but by working together, we can find \nways to solve problems and help move the country's agenda forward. But \nsomewhere along the way, the President forgot that, and so I suspect he \nwill be talking about some of his Executive orders, which have been a \nterrible mistake.\n  First of all, on his Executive order for immigration, there was a \nlawsuit. A Federal judge issued an injunction, which has been upheld so \nfar. It bars implementation of his Executive order. So what did the \nPresident accomplish other than to enrage and polarize people and \npoison the well when it comes to actually trying to begin the process \nof solving and fixing some of our broken immigration system? The \nPresident has poisoned the well and made it virtually impossible for us \nto work with him on solving or fixing our broken immigration system \nbecause of what? Because of an Executive order that was subsequently \nenjoined by a Federal court. So he wasn't able to accomplish his goal, \nbut he was able to kill meaningful immigration reform debate in the \nSenate.\n  Of course, as we have on the Iranian nuclear negotiation, the \nPresident seems content not to engage in a treaty process, which is \nactually binding on his successor. It is simply a political document \nwhich is not even in writing. It tries to freeze out the American \npeople, whom we represent, and the sort of educational and consensus-\nbuilding process that is good for our country. I mean, that is how we \nhave become unified as a country--by looking at the things we can work \ntogether on and not just focusing on our differences. If we are just \ngoing to focus on our differences, we are never going to get anything \ndone. There are some people who may be OK with that, but, frankly, I \nthink the American people voted for Republicans and a new leadership in \nthe last election not because they didn't want to get anything done, \nbut because they wanted to give us the responsibility for setting the \nagenda and doing the things that were their priorities, which doesn't \nentail doing nothing. That entails doing those things that reflect the \npriorities of the American people and by working together where we can.\n  Nobody here is a dictator, not even the President of the United \nStates. It is shortsighted. It is a mistake, and it is in contravention \nof the whole constitutional framework that was set up 230-something \nyears ago.\n  We saw it most recently on the President's announcement on gun issues \nwhere he, again, ignored Congress and said: Well, I am going to do it \nmy way. Maybe he is impatient. Maybe he doesn't believe in consensus \nbuilding. Maybe he just doesn't like his job very much. Sometimes I \nthink that is true. Temperamentally, I think the President may not be \nsuited for the kind of consensus building and legislative process that \nis necessary to actually get important things done.\n  I was thinking, as we were celebrating the 50th anniversary of the \nCivil Rights Act a short time back, do you actually think we could do \nsomething like that, given this polarized political environment and a \nPresident unwilling to work with Congress? I would say Lyndon Baines \nJohnson was a lot of things, but he knew how to get things done. He was \nthe antithesis of this President when it came to rolling up his sleeves \nand working with Congress and people with different points of view and \nactually trying to find the possible and the doable--not to focus on \nfailure but to focus on where we can make progress.\n  Unfortunately, as a result, I think the President's legacy is going \nto be discussed in a way that he probably isn't going to fully \nappreciate.\n  I was reading the Wall Street Journal this morning and was reminded \nof how his political legacy will be remembered. Since President Obama \ntook office, his party has lost 13 Senate seats, 69 House seats, 910 \nState legislative seats, and has lost majority party status in 30 State \nlegislatures. Those are amazing statistics, given that the President \ncame out of the starting gate so strong. Unfortunately, he used his \npolitical capital by passing legislation like ObamaCare with just \nDemocratic votes. That is not a way to build durable or sustainable \npolicy or to build consensus. That is a way of jamming it down the \nthroat of the minority party and then saying: Well, you are just going \nto have to live with it. Well, that is not the case.\n  As we reflected on the recent vote we had on appealing ObamaCare, \nwhich the President vetoed, we have the political will and votes to \nchange that ill-considered and misguided health care law and to replace \nit with something that makes more sense, is more affordable, and suits \nthe needs of individual Americans. What we do need is a new President, \nand I think we have demonstrated that.\n\n[[Page S51]]\n\n  If you look at item after item and our struggling economy--after the \nterrible events of 2008, I admit the President had a tough hand because \nAmerica's economy cratered, and we went into a recession. Typically \nwhat economists will tell us--and I take some of my economic advice \nfrom former Senator Phil Gramm who is a Ph.D. economist. He wrote in \nthe Wall Street Journal, or maybe it was the Washington Post, that \nfollowing recessions, typically what you have is a v-shaped bounce of \nthe economy. But what we have had under this President's policy--\nbecause of overregulation and political uncertainty, just because of \nhis unwillingness to work to build consensus to get things done, we \nhave seen an economy struggling to recover with stagnant wages and slow \neconomic growth.\n\n  Then there is the issue of foreign policy. I just had the privilege \nof meeting with a group of people, including the King of Jordan, where \nwe talked about the battle against the Islamic State and Syria, which \nis right outside the King's back door, and the work they have been \ndoing with us to try and deal with the Russians that are taking \nadvantage of the chaos. There is a lack of a master strategy or plan to \ndeal with this threat. It is not just a threat over there, as we have \nlearned; it is a threat over here because of the use of social media \nand the ability to radicalize people who live in the United States and \nconvince them to commit acts of violence right here in our country. So \nwe have a mess in Syria and no real strategy to fight ISIL.\n  I mentioned ObamaCare just a few moments ago because I can't help but \nremember when the President was selling ObamaCare and jammed it through \non a purely partisan vote. I remember he said: If you like what you \nhave, you can keep it. Well, that was not true. I was a former attorney \ngeneral in Texas. We had a consumer protection division that sued \npeople for consumer fraud. When people are lied to about what it is \nthey are going to get in exchange for their hard-earned money and they \ndon't get it because they have been deceived, that usually ends up in \ncourt, and you end up getting sued. Well, we know that premiums didn't \ncome down an average of $2,500 for a family of four. Instead, they \nskyrocketed. And we have been reading stories in the press which show \nthat a lot of younger people who need to be part of the pool in order \nto keep rates down--because, frankly, you need young, healthy people as \npart of that insurance pool to hold down rates for the whole country--\ndidn't buy it because they don't think it suits their needs, and it is \nit too expensive. They are being forced to buy coverage that they can't \nuse.\n  I say all of this because I think in some ways the President has \nsquandered his mandate when he was elected. I remember in 2008 when the \nPresident talked about hope and change. I wasn't quite sure what he \nmeant, but we all agree that hope is a good thing, and frequently \nchange is a good thing. We were hopeful for the new President--the \nfirst African-American President elected in American history. It was a \nvery positive thing for so many of us. It represented a huge transition \nfor a country that unfortunately committed the original sin of treating \nAfrican-Americans as less than fully human, and we paid a terrible \nprice for it, and we continue to pay a terrible price. But I was \nhopeful, like many others were, that he would actually use his position \nas President to bring people together and work with us.\n  I will tell you that I am an optimistic person, and so despite the \nlast 7 years, I hope the President talks tonight about what he plans to \ndo in his last year in office. He still has one full year left in his \ntwo terms, or 8 years, in office. He has a choice to make, just as we \nall have choices to make. The President can decide to double down on \nhis go-it-alone strategy, which has proved to be a disaster. It doesn't \nwork. It is not enduring, and it polarizes the political parties and \nthe American people. I think, actually, the way this President has \nchosen to govern is more responsible for the polarization we see among \nthe American people when it comes to politics and some of the sorts of \ncraziness of our current political process, which we all talk about \nprivately. I think he is actually largely responsible for that--maybe \nnot entirely, but largely.\n  The President can decide whether he actually wants to do something \nduring his last year in office. He can actually want to try to work \nwith Congress.\n  I will suggest an area where we can find common ground and work \ntogether, and that is by reforming our criminal justice system. \nActually, I have been involved for several years, as have many Members \non the Democratic and Republican side, on looking at our criminal \njustice system and saying: How can we do better?\n  For example, for too long we have treated our prison system at the \nState and Federal levels as a warehouse for people, and we have \nforgotten some of the basic tenets of the goals of the criminal justice \nsystem, which is to rehabilitate people. You can't rehabilitate \neverybody. You have to have a willing heart, and you have to have \npeople willing to change and take advantage of an opportunity to turn \ntheir lives around. There are people like that, and we have \ndemonstrated that in many of our State penal systems, such as Texas, \nwhere we have seen that if you provide the right incentives, people \nwill take advantage of opportunities to turn their lives around and \ndeal with their addictions, lack of education, and lack of skills so \nthey no longer have to live a life--as one person in Houston told me. \nHe called himself a frequent flier in the criminal justice system. \nEvery time he got out, he ended up coming back, until he finally took \nadvantage of the opportunity to turn his life around. So we do have \nlegislation that passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee 15 to 5.\n\n  There are some things we still need to continue to work on with our \ncolleagues. But I think it represents a great opportunity--something \nthe President himself has said he wants to see us do--and I think it \ncould be a genuine legacy item for him and something that offers hope \nto people without much hope. It is also good for the taxpayers. We have \nactually been able to shutter three different penitentiaries in Texas \nand save the taxpayers billions of dollars, so it strikes me that it is \na win across the board. So I think reforming our criminal justice \nsystem is a great opportunity.\n  I also believe, as I mentioned yesterday when I spoke on the floor, \nthat addressing our broken mental health system is another area that we \ncould deal with productively on a bipartisan basis and that could be a \nlegacy of this President and certainly of this Congress.\n  We know our mental health delivery system is broken. All we have to \ndo is look at people living on our streets, homeless people. These \npeople frequent our emergency rooms because they have various medical \nconditions, but because of their mental illness, they never get the \ntreatment they need, so they go in and out of that turnstile.\n  We also know that some people tragically become a danger not only to \nthemselves but to their loved ones and the communities where they live. \nI know it is a simple fact borne out by public opinion polls that most \npeople understand that some of the acts--not all but some of the acts--\nin fact, public opinion in the polling I have seen said that 70 percent \nof respondents in public opinion polls said that mental illness is a \nfactor in incidents of mass violence, including shootings in places \nsuch as Sandy Hook; Aurora, CO; Charleston; and others. We can name \nthose incidents and those tragic circumstances, but until we get \nserious about working together to try to improve access to mental \nhealth services and give families the additional tools they need in \norder to get their loved ones compliant with their doctor's orders and \ntheir medication, we are never going to be able to make progress in \nthis area.\n  I think about Adam Lanza, the shooter at Sandy Hook, who stole his \nmother's own gun, killed her with it, and then went on to that \nelementary school and killed those poor, innocent children--a horrific \ntragedy. But Adam Lanza's mother knew he was sick. She knew he was \nbasically living downstairs and descending into his mental illness and \ngetting sicker and sicker. She didn't have much in the way of options, \nso she tried to find common ground with him and work with him, but \nobviously that wasn't enough to overcome his mental illness. If we \ncould just do some simple things, such as provide outpatient, court-\nordered\n\n[[Page S52]]\n\nmental health treatment--that is something that is included in a piece \nof legislation on which we will be having a hearing in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. That will provide families additional tools other \nthan involuntary commitment, which is just temporary and doesn't serve \nthe long-term problems.\n  One of the biggest problems, I have learned, with our mental health \nsystem is that so often people who need treatment refuse treatment. In \nother words, frequently they don't take their medication. As long as it \nis purely a voluntary matter, particularly for people who are a threat \nto their own safety as well as the community's safety, then we are \ngoing to continue to see repetitions of this and more and more \ntragedies, more families torn apart by mental illness, when we could \nactually offer them some help and some hope.\n  There is a gentleman named Pete Earley who is an award-winning \njournalist who wrote a book called ``Crazy.'' This is not about his \nson, although his son did suffer from mental illness; this is about our \nbroken mental health system. He called it ``Crazy.'' He wrote a book, \nwhich I would commend to anybody, about his own family's experience \ndealing with a mentally ill son and how hard it was to get him to \ncomply with his doctor's orders and take his medication and the like.\n  I hope Pete Earley will come testify in front of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee later this month, along with some really innovative programs \nlike those in San Antonio, TX, where they found a way to not just \nwarehouse the mentally ill in our jails but to actually divert them for \ntreatment and to get them in a better place and out of this turnstile \nof the criminal justice system.\n  So those are just a couple of ideas about what this President could \ndo, and I hope they are areas he will perhaps address tonight that he \nwould be willing to work with us on: criminal justice reform and mental \nhealth reform. I think if he were willing to do that, he would find \nRepublicans and Democrats alike willing to work with him to try to \nbuild that common-ground consensus, and actually that would be one of \nthe lasting legacies of his final year of his administration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines).

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the Searching \nfor and Cutting Regulations that are Unnecessarily Burdensome Act--more \naffectionately known as the SCRUB Act. This past summer, my colleague \nSenator Hatch and I introduced this legislation to help free American \nfamilies and small businesses from the unnecessary burdens of our \nregulatory system. I am pleased to mention that the bill passed the \nHouse last week on a bipartisan basis.\n  For too long, our Nation's innovators and employers have been trying \nto comply with a swath of outdated, duplicative, or obsolete \nregulations that hamper their growth and creativity. Many of these \nregulations also come with stacks of paperwork requirements that force \nour small businesses to spend time on filling in the blanks rather than \nfilling in jobs. The SCRUB Act would peel back these types of \nregulations so our businesses can focus on doing what they know best: \ninnovating and creating jobs.\n  The purpose of this bill is to take an objective and in-depth look at \nmajor regulations that are at least 15 years old and could be repealed \nbecause they have, No. 1, achieved their goal and there is no threat to \nthe problem reoccurring; No. 2, technology or market changes have made \nthe regulation unnecessary; or No. 3, they are ineffective or overlap \nwith other Federal or State regulations.\n  For decades, lawmakers and Presidents on both sides of the aisle have \nrecognized the need to unleash our small businesses and job creators \nfrom rules and regulations that don't make sense. When new rules are \nproposed, there is very little, if any, attention paid to how the new \nrule will work with the hundreds of other rules that came before it. \nThis buildup of rules is a cumulative burden on our businesses which \nultimately slows job growth and hits families even harder who are \nalready struggling to make ends meet. In fact, according to one study, \nif the cost of all of these regulations was considered in an \nindependent country--all of the costs of these rules and regulations--\nit would be about the 10th largest economy in the world.\n  Let's face it: The more expensive it becomes to make a product or \ndeliver a service, the more money the consumer will have to dig out of \ntheir own pockets to pay for it. It is those families who are working \nmultiple jobs to provide for their kids who are going to be hit the \nhardest.\n  This bill is how we start to solve that problem. The SCRUB Act \nestablishes a bipartisan, blue ribbon commission to give a fair and \nthoughtful review of our Nation's existing regulations. Once the \ncommission is finished with their review, they would provide \nrecommendations to Congress and we would have an opportunity to vote on \nthem.\n  If an agency wants to impose a new regulation, they can do that under \nthe SCRUB Act, but they would have to offset the cost of that new \nregulation by repealing an existing one that is of equal cost and has \nbeen deemed unnecessary or outdated by the commission.\n  I know Iowa families do this. They know how to prioritize. Why can't \nour Federal agencies? We simply cannot allow the buildup of unnecessary \nand costly regulations over time.\n  I will end with just one last comment. Rules and regulations often \nhave unintended consequences. It is our responsibility as lawmakers to \nnot only recognize when this happens but to then proactively fix it.\n  The SCRUB Act is a commonsense solution that forces lawmakers and our \nagencies to be honest about their regulatory system by fixing the rules \nthat need fixing and dropping those that have outlived their useful \npurpose.\n  I thank Senator Hatch for his leadership on this, and I urge all of \nmy colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/12/senate-section/article/S52-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S52]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mrs. ERNST.

Under the previous order, the time until 2:30 \np.m. will be equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to secrecy. I \nrise today in support of auditing the Federal Reserve. I rise in \nopposition to the lack of accountability at the Reserve, an institution \nthat has for too long been shrouded in secrecy. The objective of the \nFederal Reserve Transparency Act is simple: to protect the interests of \nthe average American by finding out where hundreds of billions' worth \nof our dollars are going.\n  The Federal Reserve has the ability to create new money and to spend \nit on whatever financial assets it wants, whenever it wants, while \ngiving the new money to whichever banks it wants. Yet if the average \nJoe and Jane from Main Street printed their own money, they would be \nimprisoned as counterfeiters.\n\n[[Page S53]]\n\n  Nowhere else but in Washington, DC, would you find an institution \nwith so much unchecked power. Creating new money naturally lowers \ninterest rates, or the price of using money. Put another way, the \nFederal Reserve's unchecked printing press creates a price control on \nthe cost of using money.\n  Throughout our country's history, price controls have never worked, \nand the Fed's price control on interest rates has also not worked. \nThink back to the housing bubble. Artificially low interest rates led \nto many individuals buying, selling, and investing in the housing \nindustry. This in turn led prices to soar, which ultimately led the \neconomy to spiral down to the great recession of 2008.\n  Since the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed has increased its balance \nsheet from less than $1 trillion to over $4 trillion. Although the Fed \nhas created trillions of new dollars, it has become apparent that most \nof this money is not finding its way into the hands of average \nAmericans. From 2009 to 2012, the incomes of the top 1 percent \nincreased by a whopping 31 percent, while everyone else's income \nincreased by only 0.4 percent. The reason for this is simple: Big \nbanks, corporations, and government entities receive the Federal \nReserve's money long before anyone else, and they bid up the price of \nassets before any of the rest of us can get to purchase them.\n  Former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh once referred to the \nFed's easy-money policies as the reverse Robin Hood effect. ``If you \nhave access to credit--if you've got a big balance sheet--the Fed has \nmade you richer,'' he said in an interview. ``This is a way to make the \nwell-to-do even more well-to-do.''\n  The side effect of this uneven distribution of money is painfully \napparent to anyone who shops at a grocery store. Over the past 15 \nyears, the price of white bread has increased by over 50 percent, while \nthe price of eggs has more than doubled. The cost of housing has also \nappreciated significantly in many areas. When adjusting for inflation, \nthe price of housing in San Francisco has increased by 58 percent over \njust 25 years.\n  Real household income for regular Americans has declined 10 percent \nover the past 15 years. Higher rent and higher grocery bills cause low-\nincome workers to incur more loans and credit card debt, which involve \nfar higher interest rates than what the banks and Wall Street are \ncurrently paying. These low-income workers do not get the luxury of \nreceiving the Fed's newly created money first, nor do they have the \nluxury of receiving the near-zero interest rates the wealthy do. As a \nresult, one thing is for certain: The Fed's price control on interest \nrates acts as a hidden tax on the less well-to-do.\n  The Fed also exacerbates income inequality by paying large commercial \nbanks $12 billion in interest. This is a departure from nearly a \ncentury of practice. While individual savers earn practically no \ninterest, the big banks are given $12 billion per year in interest. \nThere often is a revolving door between the Fed, the Treasury, and Wall \nStreet. It is a revolving door in a building that is all too eager to \nenrich big banks and asset holders at the expense of everyone else.\n  I think it is about time we pull back the curtain to uncover this \ncloak of secrecy once and for all. Who is receiving the loans from the \nFed today? To whom is the Fed paying interest? Are there any conflicts \nof interest about how these payments are determined? Are there any \nchecks and balances on the size of these payments?\n  The Federal Reserve Act actually forbids the Fed from buying some of \nthe troubled assets they bought in 2008; yet they did it anyway.\n  Given all of these unanswered questions and given the sharp increase \nin the risk of the Fed's balance sheet, it is unquestionably necessary \nfor the Fed to be audited more thoroughly than it has been in the past. \nAudit the Fed is just 3 pages long, and it simply says that the \nGovernment Accountability Office, the GAO, which is a nonpartisan, \napolitical agency in charge--that they be allowed to audit the Fed, a \nfull and thorough audit.\n  Currently the GAO is not allowed to audit the Fed's monetary policy \ndeliberations or the Fed's Open Market Committee transactions. The GAO \nwas also forbidden from reviewing agreements with foreign central \nbanks. During the downturn in 2008, trillions of dollars were spent, \nmuch of it or quite a bit of it on foreign banks, and we are not \nallowed to know what occurred, to whom it was given, and for what \npurpose. The Fed audit in its current form is virtually futile.\n  When these restrictions were added to the audit in the 1970s, the GAO \ntestified before Congress, saying: ``We do not see how we can \nsatisfactorily audit the Federal Reserve System without the authority \nto examine [its] largest single category of financial transactions and \nassets. . . . ''\n  To grasp just how limited the current audit is, recall that in 2009 \nDemocratic Congressman Alan Grayson asked then-Fed Chairman Ben \nBernanke which foreign countries received $500 billion in loans from \nthe Fed. Bernanke was unwilling to name which countries or banks \nreceived half a trillion dollars' worth of funds.\n  That is right. The Feds swapped half a trillion dollars to foreign \ncountries in secret and did not even have the decency, under testimony \nbefore Congress, to report the details. But it gets worse. Democratic \nSenator Bernie Sanders asked Bernanke: Who received $2.2 trillion that \nthe Fed lent out during the financial crisis? Again, Bernanke refused \nto give an answer.\n  In the 2011 Dodd-Frank law, Congress ordered a limited, one-time GAO \naudit of Fed actions. During the financial crisis, that audit uncovered \nthat the Fed lent out over $16 trillion to domestic and foreign banks \nduring the financial crisis.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an extra 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, does Senator Paul--how much time do we \nhave?\n  Mr. PAUL. I would be happy to ask unanimous consent for equal time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Paul's time has expired. The time of \nthe majority has expired.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I only need 5 minutes, so I am willing to \ncede whatever remains so he can have enough time, but I would like to \nreserve 5 minutes, and I lift my objection.\n  Mr. PAUL. Well, the unanimous consent would be to have 5 extra \nminutes and to give the Senator as much time as he needs to conclude.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Both Republicans and Democrats agree that it is absurd that \nwe do not know where hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of our \nmoney is going. In fact, last year my audit the Fed bill received the \nsupport of nearly every Republican in the House and over 100 Democrats.\n  Some say an audit will politicize the Fed. I find this claim odd \ngiven the support of both sides of the aisle for the bill. The GAO is \nnonpartisan, independent, and works for Congress. It does not lean \nRepublican or Democratic, and it is not interested in influencing \npolicy. I can't seem to understand how a simple check by the GAO to \nensure that there are no conflicts of interest will politicize \nanything.\n  Instead of criticizing a standard audit, though, maybe the \nindividuals who work at the Fed and within our central bank should \nbegin curbing their own actions. Unlike the actions of current Fed \nofficials, my bipartisan bill will not politicize anything. I simply \nwant the Fed overseen to ensure that our central bank isn't picking \nfavorites, and I want to ensure that it remains solvent.\n  Like every agency, the Federal Reserve was created by Congress and is \nsupposed to be overseen by Congress.\n  Auditing the Fed should not be a partisan issue. Regardless of one's \nmonetary policy views, regardless of whether one thinks interest rates \nshould be higher or lower, everyone can and should agree that for the \nsake of the country's economic well-being, we need to know what has \nbeen going on behind the Federal Reserve's cloak of secrecy. It is time \nwe quit this guessing game. It is time we audit the Federal Reserve \nonce and for all to restore transparency to our Nation's checkbook.\n\n[[Page S54]]\n\n  \n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I do not support Senator Paul's bill to \naudit the Federal Reserve.\n  In 2010, I supported an amendment to the Dodd-Frank financial reform \nlegislation included in the final law which required an audit of the \nFederal Reserve's actions during the financial crisis. That report was \nreleased in 2011 and found no significant problems with the Fed's \nactivities.\n  Dodd-Frank not only authorized the 2011 audit, it also expanded the \nscope for future GAO audits which any Member of Congress can request. \nAlso, the Fed includes an independent audit of its financial statements \nwithin its annual report to Congress.\n  The Federal Reserve has taken independent actions in recent years to \nbe more transparent about its operations. Since 2009, the Fed has \npublicly released its economic projections, and since 2011, the \nchairman has held quarterly press conferences following Federal Open \nMarket Committee meetings. Two recent studies found the Fed to be one \nof the most transparent central banks in the world.\n  Transparency and openness in government is essential to a healthy \ndemocracy, but by requiring more audits and more disclosures, we risk \npoliticizing a nonpartisan institution that plays a uniquely \nsignificant role in the global economy.\n  Fed Chairman Janet Yellen recently wrote that a similar bill that \npassed the House of Representatives ``would politicize monetary policy \nand bring short-term political pressures in the deliberations of the \nFOMC by putting into place real-time second guessing of policy \ndecisions. . . . The provision is based on a false premise--that the \nFed is not subject to an audit.''.\n  Since there are already many means for audits, disclosure, and \ntransparency at our disposal, I do not support Senator Paul's bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the audit the Fed bill.\n  One of the things that we learned around here as new Members of the \nHouse and Senate--and I served with the Presiding Officer almost my \nentire time in the House, and we learned this--is that if you can name \nthe bills here, you have a tremendous advantage. You call the estate \ntax the death tax, even though about 1 percent of Americans pay it, and \nyou may have won the debate. Calling this bill audit the Fed--and how \ncan you be against auditing the Fed--may win the debate, but this time \nI don't think so.\n  I am concerned in this way. It won't make the Fed stronger. It won't \nmake the Fed more effective. It won't make the Fed more accountable. It \nwill impair the Fed's functions. It will give conservative Members of \nCongress more tools to second-guess the Fed's decisionmaking. It will \nmake the system ultimately less sound, flexible, and responsive.\n  Think about what happened in 2009. President Obama took office. We \nwere losing 800,000 jobs a month. Congress passed the Recovery Act, \npassed the auto rescue, which mattered so much to the Presiding \nOfficer's State, to my State, and, frankly, to the Senator from \nKentucky and his State too, but then, with the changing time and the \nelections of 2010, this Congress engaged in austerity, and we saw what \nthat meant. It took a Bush-appointed Federal Reserve Chair, Ben \nBernanke, who engaged in enough pump priming, if you will, through low \ninterest rates and then QE to get the economy going.\n  I think we asked ourselves, would we have wanted a Federal Reserve \nthen where Congress had its tentacles in monetary policy? Congress \nfailed on fiscal policy. Chairman Bernanke and now Chair Yellen have \nhad to move on monetary policy in that way. I don't want to \nstraitjacket this Congress and straitjacket the Federal Reserve by \ndoing that with Congress.\n  I know some of you have supported audit bills in the past. Many \nsupported the Dodd-Sanders amendment during Wall Street reform. But \nthis one is different. It doesn't include provisions to review the \nIndependent Foreclosure Review Program process, and it doesn't include \nprotections on some of the sensitive information that GAO could review, \nsuch as transcripts.\n  What this is about, in addition to Congress meddling in monetary \npolicy, is ultimately this: We know the Fed is charged with a dual \nmandate--to deal with the tension between combatting inflation and \ncombatting unemployment. We know that in past years the Fed has leaned \nfar more toward the bondholders and Wall Street in combatting inflation \nthan it has toward Main Street in employment and combatting \nunemployment.\n  We also know that with the pressures in this town, when President \nObama signed Wall Street reform, the chief lobbyist for the financial \nservices industry said it is now half time, meaning that conservative \nMembers of this Congress, people in this Congress influenced by Wall \nStreet, would immediately go and try to weaken these rules going \ndirectly to the agencies.\n  We will see the same thing here. We will see many Members of Congress \npushing the Fed to side with the bondholders and Wall Street on \ncombatting inflation rather than siding with Main Street and small \nbusinesses and workers in dealing with unemployment. That is \nfundamentally the biggest problem with the Paul proposal. I ask my \ncolleagues to defeat it.\n\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending \ncloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 289, S. 2232, a bill to require a \n     full audit of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \n     System and the Federal reserve banks by the Comptroller \n     General of the United States, and for other purposes.\n         Mitch McConnell, John Barrasso, Roy Blunt, John Cornyn, \n           Cory Gardner, David Vitter, Shelley Moore Capito, Rand \n           Paul, Johnny Isakson, Steve Daines, Patrick J.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto complete my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               Scrub Act\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to take up a \npiece of legislation that I am sponsoring which has recently passed the \nHouse of Representatives, the Searching for and Cutting Regulations \nthat are Unnecessarily Burdensome Act--or SCRUB Act.\n  Federal regulations today impose--by some estimates--a crushing \nburden of $1.88 trillion on our economy. That is roughly $15,000 per \nhousehold and more than the entire country's corporate and individual \nincome taxes combined. Excessive and often unnecessary rules imposed by \nunaccountable Washington bureaucrats strain family budgets and create \nconditions where small businesses struggle to create jobs.\n  Nevertheless, the regulatory burden keeps growing year after year. \nThe Code of Federal Regulations is now more than 175,000 pages long and \ncontains more than 200 volumes. Since 2008, regulators have added on \naverage more than $107 billion in annual regulatory costs. And as we \nnear the end of President Obama's time in office, Americans should be \nprepared for a deluge of new rules. As has been widely reported, about \n4,000 regulations are working their way through the Federal \nbureaucracy, with some experts predicting their costs to exceed well \nover $100 billion.\n  Every President since Jimmy Carter has affirmed the need to review \nour existing regulations to make sure that they are efficient and no \nmore intrusive and burdensome than is absolutely necessary. \nNevertheless, administrations of both parties have failed to make \nmeaningful reductions in the regulatory burden, with some retrospective \nreview efforts even adding costs to the economy. Most notably, \naccording to a study by the American Action Forum, the Obama \nadministration's much-touted efforts to review old rules actually added \nmore than $23 billion in costs on the economy and mandated nearly 9 \nmillion additional hours of paperwork.\n  With family budgets stretched thin and our economy badly in need of \njob creation, we need to act to turn this longstanding bipartisan \ncommitment to effective retrospective review into a reality. But to do \nso, we need to take the responsibility of reviewing old rules away from \nthe bureaucrats who keep failing to make the reductions to the \nregulatory burden. That is why I have joined my colleagues, the junior \nSenators from Iowa and Missouri, to introduce the SCRUB Act.\n  The SCRUB Act establishes a bipartisan, blue-ribbon commission to \nreview existing Federal regulations and identify those that should be \nrepealed to reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens. It prioritizes for \nreview regulations where major rules have been in effect more than 15 \nyears, impose paperwork burdens that could be reduced substantially \nwithout significantly diminishing regulatory effectiveness, impose \ndisproportionately high costs on small businesses, or could be \nstrengthened in their effectiveness while reducing regulatory costs. It \nalso sets other basic, commonsense criteria for recommending repeal of \nregulations, such as: whether they have been rendered obsolete by \ntechnological or market changes; whether they have achieved their goals \nand can be repealed without target problems recurring; whether they are \nineffective; whether they overlap, duplicate, or conflict with other \nFederal regulations or with State and local regulations; or whether \nthey impose costs that are not justified by benefits produced for \nsociety within the United States.\n  Once the commission develops a set of recommendations, our bill \nrequires that these recommendations be presented to the House and the \nSenate for approval by joint resolution. If Congress votes to approve \nthe commission's recommendations, repeal must take place.\n  Mr. President, I have served long enough to know that Washington's \npreferred solution to a tough problem is to create a commission that, \nonce established, is rarely seen or heard from again, no matter how \ncompelling its recommendations. Therefore, I want to lay out a few key \nfeatures of how SCRUB avoids the pitfalls of so many do-nothing \ncommissions as well as the problems encountered with other attempts to \nimplement retrospective review.\n  First, our bill sets a hard target for the commission: the reduction \nof at least 15 percent in the cumulative costs of Federal regulation \nwith a minimal reduction in the overall effectiveness of such \nregulation. The Obama administration's efforts at retrospective \nreview--perhaps by mistake, perhaps by design--lacked a quantified cost \nreduction mandate. The result was the manipulation of the review \nprocess into a charade in which highly suspect new benefits were touted \nas a reason for adding costs. Our bill structures the retrospective \nreview process in a way that prioritizes cost cutting while maintaining \na responsible respect for benefits by calling for a minimal reduction \nin general overall effectiveness.\n  Second, our bill does not artificially limit what costly and \nunjustified regulations could be repealed. Under some superficially \nsimilar but fundamentally unsound proposals for retrospective review, \nreview would be arbitrarily limited by time or subject. Such limits \nwould not only seriously hinder the prospect of meeting a meaningful \ncost reduction target, but also put numerous regulations off limits for \nreview just because they have seen minor tweaks after a certain \narbitrary cutoff.\n  Third, our bill guarantees an up-or-down vote on the Commission's \npackage of recommendations as a single package. This element of our \nbill represents the single most important feature that distinguishes it \nfrom a do-nothing commission that far too often characterizes \nWashington's approach to intractable problems. We should be under no \nillusions that every single special interest in town is going to fight \nto preserve the favors they have won by manipulating the regulatory \nprocess over the years, and gathering the votes to get the Commission's \nrecommendations enacted will certainly be a difficult endeavor.\n  Following the models of other successful means by which Congress has \naddressed situations in which the costs are concentrated but benefits \nare widely dispersed, it is absolutely vital that the Commission's \nrecommendations be packed together as a single bill and not subject to \ndismemberment by amendment.\n  Further, to put it simply, an up-or-down simple majority vote \nrequires an actual viable pathway to repealing these regulations. \nSubjecting the package to the supermajority threshold would represent \nnothing but a death knell for the prospect of repealing these onerous \nrules. Moreover, because extended debate in the Senate exists to allow \nSenators to modify a proposal under debate, the lack of amendment \nopportunities seriously undermines the rationale for subjecting it to \nthe supermajority threshold typically required to end debate. And this \ncarefully tailored exception to the cloture rule is hardly a wild \ndeparture from precedent; rather, it follows the precedents set by \nnumerous other pieces of legislation such as trade promotion authority \nand the Congressional Review Act, both of which have long earned \nbipartisan support.\n  Fourth, for any given regulation, the Commission is authorized to \nrecommend either immediate repeal or repeal through what we call cut-go \nprocedures, whereby agencies, on a forward basis, would have to offset \nthe costs of new regulations by repealing Commission-identified \nregulations of equal or greater cost. These procedures allow immediate \nrepeal in the most urgent cases and staggered repeals of other \nregulations to assure a smoother process for agencies and affected \nentities.\n  Mr. President, a process such as cut-go proves critical for two \nparticular reasons. First, it provides an avenue for addressing the \nmany regulations on the books that impose unjustifiable costs in \npursuit of a legitimate goal. While some regulations on the books\n\n[[Page S56]]\n\ncould undoubtedly be repealed without any meaningful negative \nconsequences, numerous others provide important protections but in an \ninefficient and costly manner. The cut-go process allows agencies to \nrepeal costly rules and replace them with more sensible ones--for \nexample, prescribing performance standards instead of specific, \noftentimes outdated technology--in a manner that reduces costs on the \neconomy while maintaining or even improving regulatory effectiveness.\n  Second, the cut-go process holds agencies accountable to Congress's \nlaws, a perennial problem in the regulatory process. Bureaucratic \nagencies--so often devoted to increasing their own power and \ninsensitive to the costs they impose on the economy--frequently use the \nexcuse of limited resources to avoid retrospective review. By imposing \na reasonable limit on prospective rulemaking until an agency complies \nwith congressionally enacted repeal recommendations, cut-go ensures \nthat the agency cannot simply ignore its duty to repeal.\n  Mr. President, these are just a handful of the numerous reasons why \nthe SCRUB Act provides a uniquely visible pathway to accomplishing the \nlongstanding bipartisan goal of repealing outdated and ineffective \nregulations. I wish to thank my colleagues from both sides of the \naisle--and both sides of the Capitol, by the way--who have joined in \nsupport of this bill, especially Senator Ernst for her leadership on \nthis issue on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. \nEven though she has only been in the Senate for a year, her strong and \neffective leadership on this issue has been a model for how to hit the \nground running. I call on my colleagues in the Senate to follow the \nHouse's lead and pass this effective, commonsense approach to rooting \nout unjustifiably burdensome regulations. Also, as I understand it, the \nHouse has passed this bill just today.\n\n\n                           Religious Liberty\n\n  Mr. President, I also wish to address another subject--the subject of \nreligious liberty. Congress is convening for the second session of the \n114th Congress at a moment in time rich with significance for religious \nfreedoms. January 6, for example, marked the 75th anniversary of \nPresident Franklin Roosevelt's famous ``Four Freedoms'' speech. During \nthe depths of World War II, President Roosevelt used his 1941 State of \nthe Union Address to describe a world founded on what he called ``four \nessential human freedoms.'' One of these is the ``freedom of every \nperson to worship God in his own way.''\n  At the end of the week, on January 16, it is Religious Freedom Day. \nIt commemorates the 230th anniversary of the Virginia General \nAssembly's enactment of the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom. \nThomas Jefferson authored the legislation and, after he left to serve \nas U.S. Minister to France, his colleague James Madison secured its \nenactment.\n  Of his many accomplishments--and Jefferson had a lot of \naccomplishments--Jefferson directed that three of what he called \n``things that he had given the people'' be listed on his tombstone. One \nof them was the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, which laid the \nfoundation for the protection of religious freedom in the First \nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n  Mr. President, last fall I delivered a series of eight speeches on \nthe Senate floor presenting the story of religious freedom. I explained \nwhy religious freedom itself is uniquely important and requires special \nprotection. At no time in world history has religious freedom been such \nan integral part of a Nation's character as it is here in the United \nStates.\n  The story of religious freedom includes understanding both its status \nand its substance. The status of religious freedom can be summarized as \nboth inalienable and preeminent. As James Madison put it, religious \nfreedom is ``precedent, both in order of time and in degree of \nobligation, to the claims of civil society.''\n  Madison also explained that religious freedom is the freely chosen \nmanner of discharging a duty an individual believes he or she owes to \nGod. As we have affirmed so many times in statutes, declarations, and \ntreaties, it includes both belief and behavior in public and in \nprivate, individually and collectively.\n  Tonight, President Obama delivers his final State of the Union \nAddress. According to the Washington Post this morning, President Obama \nwill speak about unity, about coming together as one American family. \nUntil very recently, religious freedom was such a unifying priority. \nLast month, I described to my colleagues the unifying statement about \nreligious freedom called the Williamsburg Charter. Published in 1988, \nit brought together Presidents and other leaders in both political \nparties, the heads of business and labor, universities and bar \nassociations, and diverse communities to endorse the first principles \nof religious freedom.\n  The charter boldly proclaims that religious freedom is an inalienable \nright that is ``premised upon the inviolable dignity of the human \nperson. It is the foundation of, and is integrally related to, all \nother rights and freedoms secured by the Constitution.'' It asserts \nthat the chief menace to religious freedom is the expanding power of \ngovernment--especially government control over personal behavior and \nthe institutions of society. And the charter also declares that \nlimiting religious freedom ``is allowable only where the State has \nborne a heavy burden of proof that the limitation is justified--not by \nany ordinary public interest, but by a supreme public necessity--and \nthat no less restrictive alternative to limitation exists.''\n  Congress made these principles law 5 years later by almost \nunanimously enacting the Religious Freedom Restoration Act--an act that \nI had a great deal to do with. One way to know the value of something \nis by the effort made to protect it. In RFRA, government may burden the \nexercise of religion only if it is the least restrictive means of \nfurthering a compelling government purpose. That is the toughest \nstandard found anywhere in American law. By this statute, we declared \nthat religious freedom is fundamental, it is more important than other \nvalues and priorities, and government must properly accommodate it. The \nCoalition for the Free Exercise of Religion supporting RFRA was the \nmost diverse grassroots effort I have ever seen in all of my years in \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  Five years after RFRA, Congress unanimously enacted the International \nReligious Freedom Act. Twenty-one Senators serving today voted for it--\n12 Republicans and 9 Democrats. So did Vice President Joe Biden and \nSecretary of State John Kerry when they served here. That law declares \nthat religious freedom ``undergirds the very origin and existence of \nthe United States.'' It calls religious freedom a universal human \nright, a pillar of our Nation, and a fundamental freedom.\n  That is what unity looks like. With a Presidency no less than any \nother aspect of life, however, actions speak louder than words. While \nPresident Obama has paid lip service to religious freedom, as I assume \nhe will in his annual Religious Freedom Day proclamation this week, the \nactions of his administration tell a different story.\n  In 2011, the Obama administration argued to the Supreme Court that \nthe First Amendment provides no special protection for churches, even \nin choosing their own ministers. The Court unanimously rejected that \nbizarre theory. The administration ignored religious freedom and RFRA \naltogether when developing the Affordable Care Act and its implementing \nregulations. When religious employers argued that the administration's \nbirth control mandate did not adequately accommodate their religious \nfreedom, the administration fought them all the way to the Supreme \nCourt. The Court again rejected the administration's attempt to \nrestrict religious freedom.\n  Yesterday, 32 Members of the Senate and 175 Members of the House of \nRepresentatives filed a legal brief with the Supreme Court supporting \nreligious organizations that are again arguing that the Obama \nadministration's birth control mandate violates the Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act. I want to thank my friend from Oklahoma, Senator \nLankford, for working with me on this important project. I know \nreligious freedom was important to him when he served in the House and \nhe is already a leader on this critical issue in the Senate and I am \npleased to see him in the chair today.\n  This mandate requires religious organizations to violate their deeply \nheld religious beliefs or pay crushing monetary fines. The plaintiffs \nin these cases\n\n[[Page S57]]\n\ninclude Christian colleges, Catholic dioceses, and many organizations \nthat minister to the elderly and disadvantaged as part of their \nreligious mission. They want to provide health insurance for their \nemployees and students in a manner that is consistent with their \nreligious beliefs.\n  The Obama administration, however, is working hard to make those \nreligious groups knuckle under to its political agenda. It provides \nblanket exemptions for churches that do not object to the birth control \nmandate but denies exemption to religious employers that do object. The \nadministration exempts for-profit companies employing more than 44 \nmillion workers, including some of America's largest corporations, even \nif they have no objection to the mandate. Yet it is fighting to force \ncompliance by religious nonprofit organizations that do object to the \nmandate on the basis of deeply held religious beliefs. Not only is that \npolicy simply irrational, but it treats religious freedom as optional.\n  Here is how I put it last month: Subjugating religious beliefs to \ngovernment decrees is not the price of citizenship. To the contrary, \nrespecting and honoring the fundamental rights of all Americans is the \nprice our government pays to enjoy the continued consent of the \nAmerican people.\n  If that is true, then religious freedom must be properly respected \nand accommodated. And I believe it is true.\n  Religious freedom should be a primary consideration, not an \nafterthought. Religious freedom should be given the accommodation that \na preeminent right requires, rather than begrudgingly be given the \nleast attention politically possible.\n  If our leaders wish to abandon the religious freedom that undergirds \nAmerica's origin and existence, they should say so. If Members of \nCongress now reject what they once supported and insist that religious \nfreedom is less important than the political reference of the moment, \nthey should make that case.\n  If the Obama administration wants to repudiate treaties we have \nratified, asserting that religious freedom is a fundamental human \nright, the President should be upfront about it.\n  As with many things that happen in the twilight of a Presidency, I \nexpect to hear much in the State of the Union Address tonight that \nspeaks to President Obama's legacy. What will he be remembered for? \nWhat great principles or causes will be associated with the Obama \nPresidency?\n  Part of President Roosevelt's legacy is that State of the Union \nAddress 75 years ago that affirmed that practicing one's faith is an \nessential human freedom. What a tragedy to have President Obama be \nremembered for hostility to--rather than protection of--religious \nfreedom.\n  In the coming days, I will be presenting to each of my Senate \ncolleagues the collection of speeches on religious freedom that I \noffered on the floor last fall. I hope they will encourage us in \nCongress, as well as our fellow citizens, to unite in our commitment to \nthis fundamental right.\n  This is important. Even though we may agree or disagree with certain \nreligious beliefs, they still ought to have the right to believe them. \nThey still ought to have the right to worship the way they want to. The \nfact of the matter is that is what has made America the greatest \ncountry in the world--bar none. I don't want to see it destroyed \nbecause we are doing everything we can to undermine religious freedom \nin this country. I refuse to allow that to happen, and I hope my \ncolleagues will take this seriously as well. I know a number of them \ndo, including the current Presiding Officer.\n  I just want everybody to know that as long as I am in the Senate, I \nam going to be fighting for religious freedom and I hope that all of us \nwill also.\n  God bless America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, tonight President Obama will be coming \nto Congress to deliver his final State of the Union Address. His \nadvisers have been all over television talking about what the President \nis planning to say. Tonight, I expect President Obama will talk a \nlittle about the health care law. Last year in his State of the Union \nAddress, the President bragged--he actually bragged--that more people \nhave insurance now than when he took office. I expect he will probably \nsay something similar tonight.\n  I wish to talk a little bit about the other side of the story. I want \nto talk about what President Obama is not going to say tonight to the \nAmerican people. The President is not going to admit that many \nAmericans are actually worse under his health care law. He is not going \nto say that under the health care law there is a very big difference \nbetween health law insurance and being able to actually get health \ncare. The President focuses on the word ``coverage'' and, as a doctor, \nI focus on the word ``care.''\n  The New York Times had an article about this just the other day. The \narticle on page 1 of Monday, January 4, says: ``Many Holdouts Roll the \nDice And Pay I.R.S., Not an Insurer.'' They would rather pay the \npenalty to the Internal Revenue Service rather than pay the insurance \ncompany. Why?\n  Turn to page A9 of the same day, January 4, 2016: ``Many Who Refuse \nInsurance See I.R.S. Penalty as Most Affordable Option.'' The most \naffordable option for the American people is not the Obama health law \ninsurance. It is actually paying the IRS the penalty. The article tells \nthe story about a number of different people. One is named Tim Fescoe \nfrom Culver City, CA. He and his wife had an insurance plan that cost \nthem more than $5,000 a year, but it came with a deductible of over \n$6,000 for each of them--$5,000 for the policy, $6,000 for the \ndeductible for him and another $6,000 for her. Well, they decided to \ndrop the insurance last year.\n  Mr. Fescoe told the New York Times: ``It literally covered zero \nmedical expenses.''\n  I wonder if President Obama is going to talk about this man tonight, \nTim Fescoe. Will we hear anything about him in his speech tonight? Will \nthe President point to him in the gallery as somebody who the President \nclaims to have helped by making insurance so expensive and so \nunaffordable that it was much better to just pay the penalty than deal \nwith what the mandates of the President's health care law call into \nplay? Is he going to talk about the deductibles and how the out-of-\npocket costs have become so high for Americans all across the country?\n  The article also talks about Clint Murphy of Sulfur Springs, TX. \nClint Murphy expects that he will have to pay a penalty of about $1,800 \nfor being uninsured this year. The article says that in his view, \npaying the penalty is worth it if he can avoid buying the President's \nlaw health insurance, a policy that costs $2,900 or more.\n  This man in Texas went on to say: ``I don't see the logic behind \nthat, and I'm just not going to do it.''\n  Is President Obama going to talk about these people--people who think \nthat it is better to pay the steep IRS penalty than buy the President's \nexpensive and, in many ways, useless insurance? There are millions of \nAmericans in this same situation as Clint Murphy, as Tim Fescoe, and \nother people who are mentioned in a story in the New York Times. If the \nNew York Times is writing about it--they are supporters of the health \ncare law--even they are pointing to the damage that this very unpopular \nlaw continues to do to the American people.\n  According to a report by the Kaiser Family Foundation, about 7 \nmillion Americans were finding it cheaper to pay the tax penalty than \nto pay for this unusable insurance. Look at this chart. Of those people \nwho don't get subsidies and are not eligible for subsidies, 95 percent \nwould pay--all of these people--less for the tax penalty than for an \nObamaCare bronze plan, which is the cheapest level of plan that there \nis.\n  So for people who don't get a subsidy from Washington, 95 percent of \nthem would pay less by paying the tax penalty than they would for an \nObamaCare bronze-level plan with high deductibles and high copays--so \nhigh that the people who look at it say: It is unusable.\n\n[[Page S58]]\n\n  Now, remember, again, these bronze plans are the cheapest option, and \nthe people are just saying no because even the cheapest option under \nObamaCare is more expensive than dropping insurance and paying the \npenalty. Bronze plans are the ones most likely to have a $5,000 to \n$6,000 deductible per individual on the plan.\n  Do we expect President Obama to talk about any of these things \ntonight or any of these people who have been harmed by his law?\n  After the President gives his State of the Union Address, much has \nbeen made that he is going on a tour of America. He is going to visit \nBaton Rouge, LA, and Omaha, NE. What the President may not know and \ncertainly won't mention is how much ObamaCare premiums have increased \nin those States he is going to visit.\n  In Louisiana, prices for the benchmark silver plan on the ObamaCare \nexchange went up over 9 percent this year. In Nebraska, the same \nbenchmark silver plan rates went up almost 12 percent this past year. \nNow that is for the people who are willing to actually shop around and \nswitch their insurance from last year to try to hold down the costs.\n  Remember when the President said this: If you like your plan, you can \nkeep your plan. Well, if you only want a 9-percent or a 12-percent \nincrease, you can't keep your plan. You have to try to shop around and \nswitch to a different plan, maybe even change your doctors and the \nhospital you go to. That is the only way you can find rates of \ninsurance that still go up a lot but don't go up even higher by staying \nwith what you had.\n  The President probably won't mention that when he goes to Louisiana \nor Nebraska. He probably won't mention either that the ObamaCare co-ops \nin both of the States that he is visiting collapsed last year--\nfundamentally collapsed. Tens of thousands of people lost the insurance \nthey had in those States, and now the taxpayers are on the hook for \nover $100 million.\n  The law has not come anywhere near what President Obama promised the \npeople of Louisiana or the people of Nebraska or the people of America. \nAll across the country, the American people know that ObamaCare was not \nwhat they wanted. They know that it has never been the right answer for \nthe problems in our health care system. That is why majorities in both \nHouses of Congress voted recently to repeal the key parts of the Obama \nhealth care law. We passed the legislation, and we sent it to the \nPresident's desk. When President Obama vetoed the bill, he rejected the \njudgment of the American people.\n  In his speech tonight, I expect the President to continue to pretend \nthat there are no problems at all with American health care under his \nlaw. Well, Republicans are going to keep offering solutions to fix \nhealth care in America. Almost 6 years ago President Obama sat down \nwith Members of Congress to try to sell us his health care law. I was \npart of that roundtable discussion. I told the President at the time \nthat low-cost catastrophic plans could be a good option for people as \nlong as they could use health savings accounts to help pay their day to \nday medical bills.\n  The President had no interest in that idea or in any of the \nRepublican ideas that we brought forward that day.\n  So now, under his law, people are left with the equivalent of \ncatastrophic coverage and they are paying far too much for it because \nof all of the law's mandates. On top of that, the law cuts back on \nhealth savings accounts. The law specifically cut back on that so \npeople all across the country have fewer options to help them pay for \ntheir care.\n  Republicans are going to continue to bring up better ideas. We will \ntalk about real solutions that give people more options, not more \nmandates. We will talk about the ideas that help people get the care \nthey need from a doctor they want at lower costs, not just as the \nPresident talks about coverage--coverage that most Americans find they \ncannot use.\n  Tonight President Obama is probably going to make a lot more \npromises. When he does, I think everybody should remember Clint Murphy \nfrom Sulfur Springs, TX, who doesn't see the logic in paying for \noverpriced ObamaCare insurance. They should remember all of the broken \npromises from the health care law and all of the hardworking Americans \nwho have been hurt by the Obama health care law. Even though President \nObama won't admit it tonight, America can do much better. If the \nPresident won't say it, then it will be up to Congress to lead on the \nissue. That is exactly what Republicans intend to do. President Obama's \nspeech tonight will be looking to define his legacy. Tonight and for \nthe rest of the year, Republicans will be offering solutions for the \nAmerican people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to enter \ninto a colloquy with a number of my colleagues, including Senators from \nVirginia, Florida, and New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n Delegation To The Middle East and Implementing the Nuclear Agreement \n                               With Iran\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I have just returned from a trip to the \nMiddle East--an absolutely important and eye-opening trip at this vital \nmoment when the threat of extremism, the threat of violence, and the \nrisks posed to regional stability by Iran and its regional ambitions \ncould not be clearer. Senator Gillibrand of New York led this \ndelegation, and a group of eight of us had an opportunity to visit \nTurkey, Saudi Arabia, Israel, and Austria.\n  Let me begin by saying that all of us were deeply moved and concerned \nwhen we heard this morning news of a terrorist attack in Istanbul, \nliterally in an area we had just visited Saturday morning. I reached \nout, as have a number of others on this trip, to express our \ncondolences and concerns both to the Turkish Ambassador, the American \nAmbassador, and to others we met with on our visit there.\n  This is just another brazen reminder of the instability raging \nthroughout the Middle East and of the threats to our concerns and \ninterests and to regional stability posed by terrorism.\n  I invite the Senator from Virginia to join me in making some comments \nbased on his insights and his experience on this trip. The very first \nplace we visited left an important and lasting impression on me. We \nvisited with the IAEA, the International Atomic Energy Agency, in \nVienna to hear about their progress towards implementing the nuclear \ndeal with Iran and what they are going to be doing, now and in the \nfuture, to ensure full, thorough, and valuable inspections of the \nentire cycle of Iran's nuclear efforts.\n  If Senator Kaine would offer any additional comments as a member of \nthe delegation and someone who joined in the trip, what were some of \nthe things that the Senator saw and what were some of the concerns that \nthe Senator came home with that we ought to share with our constituents \nand colleagues?\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware for the \nopportunity to engage in a colloquy. It was a remarkable visit with \neight Senators to Israel, Vienna, Turkey, as well as Saudi Arabia, to \ndig into two issues that I would like to address. The issues are Iran \nand the war against ISIL.\n  With respect to Iran, since the conclusion of the negotiation and the \ngreen light for the deal to go forward, there have been some positive \ndevelopments and there have been some troubling developments. I wish to \nspend time talking about both.\n  On the positive development side, because of the deal that the United \nStates and other nations entered into with Iran, as of yesterday they \nhave permanently decommissioned the plutonium reactor at Arak, which is \none half for them to make a nuclear weapon. That is a very positive \nresult of the negotiation.\n  Second, they have disabled a huge percentage of the centrifuges, \nwhich was also a requirement under the agreement--the centrifuges that \nare used to enrich uranium, another path to nuclear weapons.\n  Third, Iran has worked with the IAEA to structure the level of \ninspections. Under the inspections required by the agreement, Iran will \nbe the most inspected nation in the world, because the inspections will \nnot only go to nuclear sites, but they will go to the entire supply \nchain of uranium mills and uranium mines. Those are inspections not \nrequired of any other nation.\n\n[[Page S59]]\n\nThe IAEA is ready to move forward on those inspections.\n  Finally, there is the last bit of positive news, which in my view, \npersonally, is the most compelling. Iran took more than 28,000 pounds \nof low-enriched uranium, which is sufficient for multiple nuclear \nweapons. Because of this deal, they have shipped that uranium out of \nIran. It is held in a facility in Russia that is closely monitored \n24/7, 365 by the IAEA. So any movement of that material will be \nunderstood.\n  Having that nuclear material--sufficient for multiple nuclear \nweapons--out of Iran's hands and out of that country would not have \nhappened without this deal, and it makes the world safer.\n  There are some challenges. In October, Iran fired a missile, and a \nnumber of us on the Foreign Relations Committee immediately wrote to \nthe President and Secretary of State that we think this violates a \nseparate U.N. Security Council resolution. The United Nations empaneled \na team of exports to dig into the factual and technical evidence, and \nthey concluded in mid-December that Iran had in fact fired a missile in \nviolation of a U.N. Security Council resolution separate from this \ndeal. We all think it is very important--for both Congress and the \nadministration and our global partners--to make sure that there is a \nconsequence for that. Whether we supported the deal or didn't, the \nstrategy should be strict enforcement and strict implementation, \nrequiring that Iran meet every last detail--not only of the deal but of \ntheir other international obligations. We need to continue to press the \nadministration and Congress to do that.\n  So on Iran, that was basically the gist of the conversation. We had a \nlengthy discussion with Prime Minister Netanyahu, where we said: Look, \nwe disagreed on the deal. But now the important thing is to make sure \nwe implement it and we are strong and united on implementation issues. \nI think that is critically important.\n  Finally, I have a word about ISIL. Everywhere we went in the region \nwe heard about the threat of ISIL. The bombing this morning in a \ntourist square in Istanbul, where some of us were standing just 72 \nhours ago, although all of the investigative work hasn't yet been done, \nclearly has the earmarks of an ISIL-related bombing, much as the \nbombings in the Sinai, in Beirut, and the attacks in Paris. So it is \nvery critical that we take this seriously because we are not only \nseeing ISIL extend their field of battle beyond Syria and Iraq; we are \nseeing them engage in one-off or rogue terrorist activities around the \nglobe.\n  The U.S. is at war with ISIL, and we have been at war since August 8, \n2014. We are in the 17th month of that war. We have spent billions of \ndollars, we have deployed thousands of troops, and we have seen both \nAmerican hostages and servicemembers killed in this war. But as I hand \nit back to my colleague, I will conclude and say that Congress has been \nstrangely silent during this war. It is Congress under article I that \nshould declare war, and yet we have not been willing to have a debate \nand vote--even as we are deploying people, even as Americans are being \nkilled, even as we are spending billions of taxpayer dollars. The only \nvote that has taken place in this body on the war directly on the \nauthorization question was in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in \nDecember of 2014. It was a vote to move forward to an authorization. \nBut when it came to the floor, it got no action.\n  I am reminded of the great Irish poet W.B. Yeats, who talked about a \ntime where ``the best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of \npassionate intensity.'' We see every day efforts that ISIL is, at \nworst, filled with passionate intensity. I believe America is the best. \nI believe Congress should be the best. Yet we have been strangely \nsilent and have lacked conviction in the face of an enemy that is \ndangerous and threatens us abroad and at home.\n  With that, I hand it back to my colleague, the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Virginia for his \nservice on the Foreign Relations Committee and for his real leadership \non the question of our prosecution the war against ISIL and the roll of \nthis Senate in confirming that we are in fact engaged in a conflict, \nfor his role on the Armed Services Committee, and for the important and \ntough questions he asked on our visit to the four countries that I just \nreferenced in opening. I appreciate the Senator detailing the four \ndifferent, big positive moves forward that are happening as the JCPOA, \nthe Iran nuclear deal, moves towards into full implementation.\n  I wish to encourage my colleague from Florida, the second-most senior \nDemocrat on the Armed Services Committee, to also offer his thoughts on \nhow this deal contributes to our security and what concerns are \nremaining.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President and my fellow Senators, I just want to \npoint out what the Senator has already brought up and underscore that \nthe fact is that the plutonium reactor in Arak has now been filled with \nconcrete. The fact is that 12 tons--or 24,000 pounds--of enriched \nuranium has been shipped out of Arak to another destination, mostly to \nRussia.\n  Before the agreement, it would only take 3 months to build a nuclear \nweapon. Now, it would take at least 12 months. So we would have a 1-\nyear advance notice in order to determine what we needed to do to deter \nIran.\n  May I say it is irritating that we are going to continue to deal with \nan Iran that is going to do things that are going to provoke us. And \nthey have certainly done this in the Strait of Hormuz just a few days \nago, doing a live-fire exercise while we have the aircraft carrier \nbattle group going through the Strait of Hormuz--not even 29 miles \nwide. That is a provocation. There is the provocation of shooting off \ntwo missile tests, which is a violation of U.N. sanctions. I hope the \nPresident will follow through and sanction them for that, regardless of \ntheir protests that say: Oh well, then, you are violating our nuclear \nagreement.\n  No, it is a nuclear agreement. They have now stretched the time to 12 \nmonths before, if they decided today that they wanted to build a \nnuclear weapon. That was the whole purpose of the nuclear negotiations \nin the first place--to take off the table that Iran would be a nuclear \npower and upset the balance of power in that part of the world.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding. I thank all of my colleagues for \nmaking these insightful comments.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Florida.\n  I would invite my colleague from New Jersey, who also joined us in \nthe Middle East and is on the homeland security committee, to offer his \ncomments on how the Iran deal actually contributes to regional and \nglobal security, and I ask what remaining concerns there are that we \nhave to tackle together.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, first, I echo the concerns of my \ncolleagues here. It was extremely valuable to be able to travel with \nSenators Heitkamp, Kaine, and Coons as part of the eight-Member \ndelegation to the IAEA, and meet with the individuals in charge of the \ninspections, as well as to go to Israel, and meet with Benjamin \nNetanyahu in a private setting about the concerns Senator Kaine \narticulated. In addition to that, we visited with other allies: Saudi \nArabia, as well as Turkey.\n  Let's be clear. As has been said already, we are seeing important \nsteps being taken that, in the immediate term, reduce the threat of a \nnuclear-armed Iran. The steps they are taking are definitive, \nmeasurable, and specifically aligned with the JCPOA.\n  It is important to understand--whether it is moving uranium out, \nblocking their plutonium pathway, and setting up the inspections regime \nalong the entire supply chain--that these are all important steps \ntoward implementing the JCPOA. But I want to make two very clear \npoints.\n  The first point is that last summer, as I and many of my colleagues \nwere immersed in evaluating the JCPOA, the Administration promised \nclear and firm responses to even the smallest violation. Like many of \nmy colleagues, this played a role in my decision to support the nuclear \nagreement. We expect to see a follow-through on that promise of \naccountability. We expect enforcement. If we allow Iran--as this \nagreement goes on--to push the bounds and cross the lines laid out in \nthis deal without a response, we are undermining the strength of this \nagreement\n\n[[Page S60]]\n\nand, I believe, actually putting in jeopardy the security of the \nregion.\n  The second point I want to make relates to the provocative behavior \nIran is engaging in right now. Separate and apart from the nuclear \nsanctions that will be lifted, there are other sanctions in place for \nother issues related to Iran's behavior. Iran is a dangerous actor and \nhas proven so throughout that region. They are a state sponsor of \nterrorism and other destabilizing activities in that region. While the \nimmediate threat of the nuclear issue might be off the table, they are \nstill a regional threat.\n  So when we have clear transgressions that are measurable, that have \nbeen done in violation of international law--such as two separate \ninstances of ballistic missile testing--there must be a response. I am \ncalling on the administration not to hesitate any longer. We must \nrespond with sanctions appropriate to these violations of international \nlaw. To not do so, to me, is unacceptable.\n  The U.S. must make the consequences for Iranian regional aggression \nclear and follow with robust response, if necessary. We cannot lose \nsight of Iran's use of surrogates and proxies in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, \nand Yemen to further undermine the security of the region. Let's not \nlose sight of the fact that there are Americans being held in Iran \nright now, such as Siamak Namazi, a graduate of Rutgers University in \nNew Jersey, arrested in October, and being held by the Iranian \nRevolutionary Guard for, as of yet, unspecified reasons. Let's not \nforget about Jason Rezaian, who continues to languish in jail without a \nclear and justifiable rationale for his imprisonment, as well as Saeed \nAbedini, Amir Hekmati, and Robert Levinson. These Americans are being \nheld by a regime for no justifiable reason.\n  These are particularly egregious violations. In my opinion, Iran \nshould be held accountable. So I repeat, the Senate should collectively \ncall on the administration to take action against Iran and to sanction \nIran for their violation of Security Council Resolution 1929.\n  I want to finally say that my colleagues and I observed in our \nmeetings with Israeli officials, as Senator Kaine mentioned, an Israeli \nadministration that understands the nuclear deal will go into \neffect. Let's make sure it is enforced. Let's make sure we have the \neyes and ears in place so we can make sure the nuclear threat is \nremoved. But let's stay united with Israel and our other allies in \nholding this dangerous actor to account if they violate international \nlaw, if they threaten their neighbors, if they engage in destabilizing \nactivities, if they support terrorism. We must share intelligence. We \nmust double down our efforts to interdict the movement of arms. And we \nmust work together for a larger piece in that region.\n\n  With that, I will turn it back to Senator Coons.\n  Mr. COONS. I wish to thank my colleague from the State of New Jersey \nand to briefly recognize a success in the fall, in September--a raid \noff the coast of Yemen that seized a large cache of Iranian arms \ndestined for the Houthi rebels who are working to undermine the \nlegitimate Government of Yemen. This massive weapons shipment of 56 \ntube-launched, optically tracked, wire-guided TOW missiles, and the \nassociated sights, mounts, tubes, and batteries--those are all the \ndifferent components for these advanced and sophisticated anti-tank \nweapons--was successfully interdicted in international water. This is \nan example of what my colleague the Senator from New Jersey was just \ntalking about, which is the need for more and more aggressive and more \nsuccessful interdiction to push back on Iran's destabilizing actions in \nthe region.\n  I am grateful now to be joined on the floor by my colleague from the \nState of New Hampshire, who is also my colleague on the Foreign \nRelations Committee, who wants to contribute to our conversation today \nabout the positive progress that is being made in the implementation of \nthis deal and what remains ahead in the work we have to do to make sure \nwe are implementing it effectively.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague \nSenator Coons and others on the floor today, especially those of you \nwho had a chance to travel to the Middle East. I didn't get a chance to \ngo with you on this trip. But, like Senator Kaine, I do serve on both \nthe Armed Services and the Foreign Relations Committees, and I \nsupported the nuclear deal with Iran because I was convinced and \ncontinue to be convinced that it is the best available option for \npreventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.\n  As my colleagues have already spoken to, to some extent, we already \nsee the effects of this nuclear deal in Iran's actions. On December 28, \nIran shipped over 25,000 pounds of low-enriched uranium to Russia, \nincluding the removal of all of Iran's nuclear material enriched to 20 \npercent that was not already fabricated into reactive fuel. We know \nthis was one path for Iran to get a nuclear weapon. They have removed \nthis low-enriched uranium. It is in Russia.\n  The IAEA has increased the number of its inspectors on the ground in \nIran. They are deploying modern technologies to monitor Iran's nuclear \nfacilities, and they have set up a comprehensive oversight program of \nIran's nuclear facilities. The IAEA is now inspecting all of Iran's \ndeclared nuclear facilities 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and they \nwill have access not just to the facilities where we know Iran was \ntrying to build a weapon but also to the uranium mines and mills, which \nwill give the IAEA and the rest of the world complete access to the \nentire nuclear fuel cycle.\n  The Iraq reactor, which has been spoken to already, will be \ncompletely disabled. Its core is being filled with concrete. Once the \nIAEA verifies that Iran has completed the steps related to the Arak \nreactor, Iran's plutonium pathway to a bomb will have effectively been \nblocked. Iran has been dismantling its uranium enrichment \ninfrastructure, including the removal of thousands of centrifuges.\n  Again, taken together, these and other steps will effectively cut off \nIran's four pathways to a nuclear weapon, and they will push its \nbreakout time to at least a year for the next 10 years.\n  What should Congress be doing? My colleague from New Jersey, Senator \nBooker, was very eloquent in talking about some of the actions that we \nneed to take, both Congress and the administration, to continue to \naddress Iran's terrorist activities throughout the region. But I think \none of the other things we ought to be doing as a Congress is \nconfirming key Obama administration foreign policy and national \nsecurity nominees because many of these nominees are critical as we \nlook at the implementation of the Iran agreement. They are critical as \nwe think about what we need to protect this country, to protect our \nnational security.\n  I would ask my colleague on the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator \nMurphy, what does it mean that we have failed to confirm Adam Szubin as \nthe Treasury Department's Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial \nCrimes? I was a cosponsor, with Senator Rubio, of the Hezbollah \nsanctions bill, the additional sanctions we can put on Hezbollah to \nlimit their activities, and yet we are still missing one of the key \nplayers in making that work at the Treasury Department. What does that \nmean, I ask Senator Murphy, the fact that Congress has failed to \nconfirm these nominees?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank Senator Shaheen for the question. I would hope \nthat regardless of how any individual Senator voted on this deal, we \nwould all be rooting for its success because success in the end is an \nassurance that Iran never obtains a nuclear weapon. But the results of \nthis Senate failing to confirm Adam Szubin as the Under Secretary for \nTerrorism and Financial Crimes undermine the implementation of not only \nthis important achievement but also of all our efforts to try to root \nout the financial sources of terrorism all around the world.\n  The fact is that this gentleman, Adam Szubin, is particularly \nqualified for the job. There is no one on the Republican side who has \nraised any individual objection to him. He has been doing the job very \nwell for the United States under President Obama. He was the senior \nadvisor to this appointee under President Bush's administration. He has \ndone and worked in this field under both Republican and Democratic \nPresidents. It seems as if it is just politics that are holding this \nup. He is not\n\n[[Page S61]]\n\nthe only one who is on that list. Laura Holgate has been appointed to \nbe our U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. offices in Vienna, which includes \nthe IAEA. She was nominated on August 5. Her nomination hasn't even \ngotten out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Wendy Sherman's \nreplacement, Tom Shannon, was nominated on September 18. His nomination \nis on the floor today. We could vote on that this week if it was our \npleasure.\n  If we want this agreement to succeed, if we want to make sure Iran \ndoes not get a nuclear weapon, if we want to cut off the flow of funds \nfrom Iran to groups like Hezbollah, then we actually have to have \npeople in place to do those jobs.\n  I wanted to quickly come to the floor to make the point that in \naddition to the important points that are being made by my colleagues \nabout the success so far of the agreement with respect to \nimplementation, if we all are hoping that the end result of this is \ndespite the predictions of many Republicans that Iran doesn't obtain a \nnuclear weapon, then we have to have these people in these important \nroles.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Would my colleague yield for another question briefly? \nI didn't give the date that Adam Szubin was nominated, and he has been \nbefore the banking committee. Does the Senator have that information to \nshare with everybody?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I said that Holgate was August 5, and Shannon was \nSeptember 18. Adam Szubin has been before the banking committee since \nApril 16. He is a few months away from being before the Senate for \nalmost a full year in a job that we can all agree is one of the most \nimportant when it comes to protecting the national security of this \ncountry. That is pretty astounding.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I thank all three of my colleagues on the Foreign \nRelations Committee. I will close and yield back to Senator Coons with \nsaying that I would hope that one of the things we would all agree to, \nas Senator Murphy has said, is that regardless of where we stood on the \nIran nuclear agreement, the goal now is to make sure that is \nimplemented in a way that makes sure that at least 10 years from now we \nhave at least a year's breakout before Iran--if they decided to do \nthat--could go back and have a nuclear weapon. I would hope that we all \nshare that as our most important priority with respect to Iran.\n  I yield back to my colleague Senator Coons.\n  Mr. COONS. I thank my colleagues from Connecticut and from New \nHampshire. I invite my colleague from North Dakota, who also serves on \nthe homeland security committee and who was part of our delegation that \njust had the opportunity to travel to Israel, to Saudi Arabia, to \nTurkey, and to Austria, and in Austria to hear from the IAEA.\n  The references just made by my colleagues on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee were in one part to the vacancy in the position of the U.S. \nAmbassador to the U.N. offices in Vienna. I want to reemphasize that. \nEver since August 5 of last year, that mission the Senator from North \nDakota and I just visited that is responsible for directing and \nsupporting the work of the IAEA to the extent the United States helps \nfund it and supports it and is a participating member--they have been \nwaiting for a new confirmed ambassador for more than 6 months.\n  I wish to invite my colleague to make comments based on her \nexperiences and her reflections based on this recent trip.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, thank you to my great friend from the \nState of Delaware. I wish to first make a comment on Adam Szubin \nbecause I also serve on the banking committee and have had a chance not \nonly to meet with him personally but to witness the excellent testimony \nhe provided during his confirmation hearing.\n  We all see very smart people. They come through and they agree to \nserve their country in these appointed positions which frequently get \nbogged down here. And not taking anything away from anyone else who has \never appeared before the banking committee, I would say that he is one \nof the brightest America has to offer. He has a wonderful family, he is \ndeeply devout in his religion--he is Jewish--and a friend to Israel, a \nfriend to this country, using his enormous talents to keep this country \nsafe. There is nothing that would recommend that we not confirm Adam \nSzubin in one of the most critical positions we have in the Treasury \nDepartment. If we are serious about stopping Iran from getting a \nweapon, if we are serious about enforcing a regime of sanctions, then \nwe need our best and brightest. He clearly is our best and brightest.\n  One of the points I want to make coming to the floor is that we \ncannot allow incremental creep, incremental violations, small, little \nviolations. You know how it is. We are all parents, and we watch kids \ntake advantage and take advantage until pretty soon we don't really \nhave the role anymore of a parent. We want to make sure that when we \nare enforcing this agreement and when we are looking at this agreement, \nwe send a clear message from the very beginning, which is we will not \ntolerate a breach.\n  I think it is disturbing that somehow this has become such a partisan \nissue. We should all be on the floor today encouraging the \nadministration to not let this agreement be eroded by the failure to \nenforce.\n  An agreement is only as good as the enforcement capability, and we \nneed to fund the IAEA. We need to make sure they have adequate \nresources. My great friend from Delaware has suggested a long-term \nstrategy for funding. We need to make sure they have the political \nsupport, not just in this body, but across the world to do the right \nthing.\n  We have been talking about the reason we, in fact, agreed to allow \nthis agreement to go forward, and the biggest agreement was the \nenforcement regime. We believed that because of the unprecedented \naccess that the IAEA would have in Iran, we would know more about this \nprogram and we would have access to more. We were reassured about that \naccess when we went to Vienna. We were reassured that, yes, they were \nnot going to back down, but if they do back down and don't give access, \nwe need enforcement. We should all be joining together to talk about \nwhat that enforcement should look like, how we fund that enforcement, \nand what a difference it could make.\n  I share a level of optimism that we are moving in the right \ndirection, but being someone who has negotiated deals, I know it is not \nover when you sign on to the agreement. It is never over when you sign \non to the agreement. It is going to take a level of absolute myopic \nfocus on enforcement to make sure we realize the promise of this \ninternational agreement and that we work with our allies and work with \nour colleagues. We can't do that if we don't have people in those \npositions who can have a dialogue and speak for the administration, and \nwe certainly can't do it if we allow an incremental breach.\n  I am joining with my colleagues to provide a unified voice that says: \nWe stand ready to do what it takes to enforce this agreement and \nprevent breach and make sure we realize the promise of the joint \nagreement.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. I will be glad to yield to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BOOKER. I was with the Senator when you heard from Prime Minister \nNetanyahu about the priorities and the partnership between our two \nnations, including support for the Iron Dome and David's Sling. What \nwas also critical, was our cooperation to prevent terror tunnels. One \nof the other challenges we had before this deal was even executed, was \nHezbollah's vast arsenal of rockets that could be fired toward Israel. \nThose missiles are getting more sophisticated and their range is \ngetting longer.\n  I don't think people put the connection together between the \nimportance of us doing the work of the Treasury Department to stop the \nflow of money that can purchase those weapons and have Israeli citizens \nscrambling for bomb shelters. When we say a name like Adam Szubin, most \nfolks in America have no idea who he is and the work that he is doing. \nNow that the Senator has been to Israel, I wonder if she can make the \nconnection as to why the work he is doing is so important to stop the \ngrowing sophistication and source of those missiles.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. I thank my good friend from New Jersey for that \nquestion. The surest way to prevent acts of terror is to make sure acts \nof terror\n\n[[Page S62]]\n\nare never funded. That takes an international banking sophistication \nand an understanding of every potential loophole you have in every \ncountry out there, and that is what Adam Szubin does. He spends all day \ngetting briefings and reports about where those potential failures \ncould be and how to plug those holes. How do we do what is necessary to \nunfund terrorism? Whether it is ISIL--ISIS--Hezbollah or Hamas, we need \nto take away the money. That is the surest way toward success.\n  If we do not confirm someone in this critical position, what is the \nmessage? I will be the first person to say that if he is not up to the \njob, let's find somebody else, but after having met him and watched his \ntestimony and the level of dialogue he has not only with the Democrats \nbut also with the Republicans--this isn't about the caliber of this \ngentleman to serve our country. It is about a political fight over this \ndeal. The deal is done--not done, but the deal is in its infancy. If we \nare going to realize the promise of this deal and the commitment this \ncountry made, we absolutely need people in place to make sure this deal \nis enforced, and that is in fact Adam Szubin.\n  My colleagues who were on the trip with me know we received a number \nof briefings that went to the heart of taking a look at the \ninternational banking system, where the weakest links are, and how we \ncan attack those weakest links in shutting down the terrorist network \nfor financing this terrible behavior.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues who have come to the \nfloor to join with one voice in recognizing the very strong progress \nthat is being made so far in implementing the JCPOA, in implementing \nthe nuclear deal with Iran.\n  I wish to particularly thank my colleague from North Dakota who has \ntaken her experience on the banking committee to help us understand why \nit is so important to have confirmed senior administration figures who \ncan enforce the sanctions that were on the books before this deal, were \nenforced during this deal, and should be enforced going forward.\n  In closing, let me briefly make some reference as to what that means. \nThe JCPOA was an agreement about constraining Iran's nuclear program, \nbut the sanctions the United States has on the books to stop Iran's \nsupport for terrorism, to stop Iran's ballistic missile program, and to \nstop Iran's human rights abuses or to hold them accountable and \nsanction them for those abuses will remain on the books.\n  I will briefly mention that during the negotiation of the JCPOA, the \nTreasury Department, where Adam Szubin is the nominee to be the top \nsanction enforcement person, utilized multiple authorities and \nsanctioned more than 100 Iranians and Iran-linked entities, including \nmore than 40, under its ongoing terrorism sanction authorities.\n  Just this past July, three senior Hezbollah military officials were \nsanctioned in Syria and Lebanon because they provided military support \nto the Assad regime. In November, the Treasury Department designated \nprocurement agents and companies in Lebanon, China, and Hong Kong, and \njust this last week, on January 7, the Treasury Department targeted a \nkey Hezbollah support network by designating a Hezbollah financier and \nmember, Ali Youssef Charara, and Spectrum Investment Group.\n  As my colleague from New Jersey has said, we are all optimistic that \nthe administration will take the next step and soon impose sanctions in \nresponse to recent ballistic missile launches.\n  I celebrated earlier because I recognized the success the \nadministration had in interdicting a weapons shipment from Iran to the \nHouthis rebels, their proxies in the region. The fundamental point is \nthis. If we want to have the positive successes of the JCPOA, and if we \nwant to continue to have the opportunity to constrain Iran's nuclear \nprogram and its bad behavior in the region, we have to be vigilantly \nengaged in oversight and in support for the enforcement of that \nagreement and for our exercise of the prerogatives and capabilities the \nAmerican Government has to push back on Iran.\n  I think by working together in a bipartisan and responsible way, we \ncan get this done. There are folks in this Chamber who opposed the deal \nand folks who supported it, but what we heard on our recent delegation \ntrip to Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey was that our regional allies \nare looking for clarity--clarity that the United States stands together \nin fighting Iran's regional ambitions to support terror and in \nconstraining Iran's nuclear program. We can do that best by confirming \nthese nominees, by funding the IAEA, by exercising the sanction \nauthorities that this administration and this Congress have put in \nplace, and by continuing to make progress under this agreement.\n  With that, I thank my colleagues and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n             The President's Economic and Foreign Policies\n\n  Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, tonight President Obama will deliver his \nfinal State of the Union Address, a closing argument for his \nPresidency. This President, who promised change, will attempt to point \nto his administration's accomplishments, as many Presidents have done \nin the past. However, this will prove to be difficult because Georgians \nand Americans have seen change but in the wrong direction.\n  When President Obama took the White House, he promised fiscal \nresponsibility, but right now he is on track to more than double the \ndebt in his tenure. He promised to work together in a bipartisan way, \nbut he used the Democratic supermajority in those first 2 years to \nforce through ObamaCare and Dodd-Frank on the American people. He \npromised to bring us together, but he has served to divide us as a \ncountry. He promised to focus on defeating terrorism, but he created a \npower vacuum in the Middle East for others who wish to do us harm. \nThere is no denying it, under this President's failed leadership, the \nAmerican people have had a tough several years.\n  Today more Americans have fallen into poverty under this Presidency. \nToo many individuals and families have seen their health care premiums \nand their deductibles rise to points where they can no longer afford \nthem. Our national debt is almost $19 trillion, which is well past any \nreasonable tipping point, and we have a global security crisis on our \nhands that makes the world possibly more dangerous than at any point in \nmy lifetime. These are all symptoms of the President's failed economic \npolicies as well as a lack of leadership in foreign policy.\n  Even by his own accord, the President has saddled our country with an \nirresponsible amount of debt which he described in the past as \nunpatriotic. Before he took office, then-Senator Barack Obama reviewed \nPresident Bush's tenure in office saying:\n\n       The way Bush has done it over the last eight years is to \n     take out a credit card from the Bank of China in the name of \n     our children, driving up our national debt from $5 trillion \n     for the first 42 presidents--number 43 added $4 trillion by \n     his lonesome, so that we now have over $9 trillion of debt \n     that we are going to have to pay back--$30,000 for every man, \n     woman, and child. That's irresponsible. It's unpatriotic.\n\n  Those are the words of this President, Barack Hussein Obama.\n  Let's be clear, under this President, our national debt has ballooned \nto almost $19 trillion from $10 trillion. That means that President \nObama has added almost $9 trillion already and is on track to more than \ndouble this debt before he is through.\n  Before President Obama leaves office, he will have nearly added as \nmuch debt as all of the other Presidents before him. This is even more \noutrageous when you factor in how much revenue or tax dollars the \nFederal Government has collected.\n  In 2015, we collected over $3.4 trillion in taxes for our Federal \nGovernment. This is more than any year in our history. Washington does \nnot have a revenue problem, it has a spending problem, and it is \nfocused on the wrong priorities.\n  Equally concerning, this massive debt isn't interest free. If \ninterest rates were to rise to the 30-year average of only 5.5 percent, \nthe interest on this debt would amount to over $1 trillion each year. \nThat is more than twice what we spent on all nonmilitary discretionary \nspending. It is more than twice what we spend on our military and \ndefending our country. It is totally out of control and this is \nunmanageable.\n  In reality, this debt crisis will only get worse because this \nPresident and\n\n[[Page S63]]\n\nWashington have not tackled the government's largest expense--mandatory \nspending programs such as Social Security and Medicare. This debt \ncrisis does not only present a fiscal problem, it is inextricably \nlinked to the global security concerns we are seeing today.\n  In order to have a strong foreign policy, we have to have a strong \nmilitary, but to have a strong military we have to have a vibrant and \ngrowing strong economy. There is no secret that down through history \nthe countries that have had the strongest militaries, and therefore the \nmost secure foreign policy, are those that had the most vibrant \neconomies of their day. Under this President's foreign policy \ndecisions, he has created a power vacuum and put the country in a much \nweaker position.\n  Today our enemies don't fear us and our allies don't trust us. Just \nthree decades ago we brought down the Soviet Union with the power of \nour ideas and the strength of our economy. Look at the world today. \nOver the past 7 years, we have seen the rise of a global security \ncrisis that is unrivaled in my lifetime. We have seen the rise of \ntraditional rivals such as China and Russia grow more aggressive. We \nhave seen North Korea and Iran actually collaborate on nuclear \nproliferation. We have seen Syria cross red lines and terrorism fill \npower vacuums in the Middle East and around the world.\n  Last week North Korea claimed to have successfully completed its \nfourth nuclear weapons test with a much more powerful weapon than they \npossessed before. This is a sobering and stark reminder of the true \nconsequences our country faces when our President shows weakness in the \nface of these radical regimes. And not only have we witnessed \nweaknesses, but we have also seen this President naively trust a \ncountry like Iran, the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism \ntoday.\n\n  Since President Obama announced his dangerous Iran deal in July \ndespite strong bipartisan opposition, Iran has actively accelerated its \nballistic missile program and continued financial support for terrorism \nin the region, in violation of the very sanction we just heard on this \nfloor.\n  Iran has fired rockets near U.S. warships, fomented unrest in Yemen, \ntaken more Americans hostages, refused to release an American passenger \nwho has been held for 3 years, convicted an American journalist of \nspying, banned American products from being sold in Iran, and renewed \nits support for Hamas and Hezbollah terrorists.\n  From the beginning, President Obama didn't listen to military advice \nand prematurely pulled our troops out of Iraq, creating another power \nvacuum. ISIS, of course, we now know, grew into that power vacuum and \nsprouted influence not only in the Middle East but in Africa and Asia \nas well.\n  Last November, this President told the American people in a news \ninterview:\n\n       We have contained them. They have not gained ground in \n     Iraq. And in Syria if they'll come in, they'll leave. But you \n     don't see this systematic march by ISIL across the terrain.\n\n  Well, we now know ISIS is not being contained in their ability to \nwage war against the West and will stop at nothing to deliver terrorism \neven to the shores of America. The President's plan has failed, it is \nplain and simple, and we sit here today with no strategy to defeat \nISIS.\n  The world needs to see decisive action from the United States, not \nempty rhetoric that can't be backed up. We need a new leader who takes \nevery threat of any size seriously. Moving forward, nothing can go \nunchecked and unmet without relentless American resolve.\n  No matter how we measure it, President Obama's economic and foreign \npolicies have indeed failed. Time and again, he has refused to change \ncourse when his policies didn't work, when they didn't help the \nAmerican people, whom he claims to champion. Instead, this President \nhas created the fourth arm of government--the regulators--and they are \nsucking the very life out of our free enterprise system today. Now, \nfewer people are working, wages are stagnant, incomes aren't growing, \nthe debt is soaring, and the world is much more dangerous than it was 8 \nyears ago.\n  But tonight we will also hear from this President about his optimism \nfor the future. Well, I get that. I share that optimism but only \nbecause I believe we can do better. We can do a lot better. We can \ntackle our national debt crisis. We can save Social Security and \nMedicare. We can defeat terrorism once and for all. We cannot do it \nwithout bold leadership, however. We cannot do it without a sense of \nurgency or responsibility. We cannot do it unless the political class \nin this town--Washington, DC--finally puts national interests in front \nof self-interests. We cannot do it without the will and support of the \nAmerican people.\n  I believe in America. Georgians believe in America. Americans believe \nin America. Americans have always risen to the crisis of the day, and I \nbelieve we will rise to this crisis. But Washington needs to really \nlisten to the American people, focus on solutions they support, and \nunite our Nation to make sure our best days are indeed ahead of us. We \nowe it to our children and our children's children, and the time to \nmove is right now. The time for rhetoric has ended.\n  We need to face up to the two crises we have today: the global \nsecurity crisis and our own debt crisis, which are interwoven together.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

He is the second Utahn \nto hold the title of press club president.\n  Founded in 1908, the National Press Club bills itself as the \n``World's Leading Professional Organization for Journalists.'' Since \nits inception, the organization has hosted monarchs, heads of state, \nU.S. Presidents, and prominent thought leaders such as Martin Luther \nKing and the Dalai Lama. As president, Tommy will focus on building the \npress club's long-standing efforts to expand press freedoms worldwide. \nHe also intends to boost membership and speak out for journalists who \nface government restraints.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the achievements \nof Tommy Burr and thank him for his contributions to the great State of \nUtah. On a personal note, I am grateful for my friendship with Tommy \nand look forward to many more stories to come. I wish him the very best \nin his new role as president of the National Press Club.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/12/senate-section/article/S64-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S64]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING DIANA TABLER FORBES\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, today I wish to pay tribute to a \ndedicated, long-time public servant, wife, and mother, Diana Tabler \nForbes. Diana died peacefully at her home in Alexandria, VA, on \nDecember 28, 2015, after a courageous 3-year battle with esophageal \ncancer.\n  Diana was a truly remarkable public servant. For over three decades, \nshe served senior government leaders from both the executive and \nlegislative branches of government in the areas of military health and \npersonnel policy.\n  Throughout her career, Diana often played a central role in \nresponding to both international crises and domestic challenges. From \n2004 until her retirement in 2013, she served as the senior \nprofessional staff member primarily responsible for oversight of the \nmilitary health system on the Senate Armed Services Committee, serving \nme as ranking member and previously Chairman John Warner. In that role, \nshe helped shape the legislative response to improving care and \nservices to wounded, ill, and injured military servicemembers following \na series of Pulitzer prize-winning Washington Post stories on health \ncare support provided at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Additionally, \nDiana played an instrumental role in developing legislation that \nestablished TRICARE benefits for military reservists and their \nfamilies; provided community support for military families with \ndisabilities; expanded combat casualty care research; and ensured \naccess to healthcare services for servicemembers suffering from \nbehavioral health conditions, like post-traumatic stress, and from \ntraumatic brain injury.\n  In 2001, Diana was the senior health leader in the Pentagon on \nSeptember 11. After relocating to other government buildings following \nthe attack on the Pentagon, she oversaw the coordination of military \nmedical support in both Washington, DC, and New York City.\n  Shortly after the U.S. invasion of Iraq and the toppling of Saddam \nHussein's regime, Diana volunteered to serve in Iraq as a civilian in \n2003, where she played a key role in the reconstruction of health \nsystems in Iraq while serving as an adviser to the coalition \nprovisional authority with U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq.\n  During the 1990s, Diana served in executive positions within the \nOffice of the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Health Affairs, and \nhelped oversee and implement many of the major components of the \nmilitary health system now in place today, to include the establishment \nof TRICARE--the military's global health benefit that serves 9.5 \nmillion Americans today.\n  Following her retirement from Federal service, Diana continued to \nserve others. She remained closely connected with the Department of \nDefense, and she supported military servicemembers and families on the \nboard of the National Military Family Association.\n  Diana's limitless energy and passion for the well-being of \nservicemembers and their families was legendary. She ensured everyone \nin Congress remembered who we served and why we served them. She knew \nhow to cut through the bureaucracy and provide real solutions for those \nin need.\n  I express my sympathy to her husband, Ripley Forbes; her daughter, \nMeredith, a schoolteacher in Alexandria; and son, Jonathan, a junior at \nVirginia Commonwealth University. As they mourn, they should know that \nDiana's legacy lives on in them and in the many thousands of \nservicemembers and their families that she selflessly served.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/12/senate-section/article/S64-3", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S64]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/12/senate-section/article/S64-4", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S64]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The message received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/12/senate-section/article/S64-5", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S64-S68]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   REPORT ON THE STATE OF THE UNION DELIVERED TO A JOINT SESSION OF \n                  CONGRESS ON JANUARY 12, 2016--PM 36\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States which was ordered to lie on the \ntable:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow \nAmericans:\n  Tonight marks the eighth year I've come here to report on the State \nof the Union. And for this final one, I'm going to try to make it \nshorter. I know some of you are antsy to get back to Iowa.\n  I also understand that because it's an election season, expectations \nfor what we'll achieve this year are low. Still, Mr. Speaker, I \nappreciate the constructive approach you and the other leaders took at \nthe end of last year to pass a budget and make tax cuts permanent for \nworking families. So I hope we can work together this year on \nbipartisan priorities like criminal justice reform, and helping people \nwho are battling prescription drug abuse. We just might surprise the \ncynics again.\n  But tonight, I want to go easy on the traditional list of proposals \nfor the year ahead. Don't worry, I've got plenty, from helping students \nlearn to write computer code to personalizing medical treatments for \npatients. And I'll keep pushing for progress on the work that still \nneeds doing. Fixing a broken immigration system. Protecting our kids \nfrom gun violence. Equal pay for equal work, paid leave, raising the \nminimum wage. All these things still matter to hardworking families; \nthey are still the right thing to do; and I will not let up until they \nget done.\n\n[[Page S65]]\n\n  But for my final address to this chamber, I don't want to talk just \nabout the next year. I want to focus on the next five years, ten years, \nand beyond.\n  I want to focus on our future.\n  We live in a time of extraordinary change--change that's reshaping \nthe way we live, the way we work, our planet and our place in the \nworld. It's change that promises amazing medical breakthroughs, but \nalso economic disruptions that strain working families. It promises \neducation for girls in the most remote villages, but also connects \nterrorists plotting an ocean away. It's change that can broaden \nopportunity, or widen inequality. And whether we like it or not, the \npace of this change will only accelerate.\n  America has been through big changes before--wars and depression, the \ninflux of immigrants, workers fighting for a fair deal, and movements \nto expand civil rights. Each time, there have been those who told us to \nfear the future; who claimed we could slam the brakes on change, \npromising to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that \nwas threatening America under control. And each time, we overcame those \nfears. We did not, in the words of Lincoln, adhere to the ``dogmas of \nthe quiet past.'' Instead we thought anew, and acted anew. We made \nchange work for us, always extending America's promise outward, to the \nnext frontier, to more and more people. And because we did--because we \nsaw opportunity where others saw only peril--we emerged stronger and \nbetter than before.\n  What was true then can be true now. Our unique strengths as a \nnation--our optimism and work ethic, our spirit of discovery and \ninnovation, our diversity and commitment to the rule of law--these \nthings give us everything we need to ensure prosperity and security for \ngenerations to come.\n  In fact, it's that spirit that made the progress of these past seven \nyears possible. It's how we recovered from the worst economic crisis in \ngenerations. It's how we reformed our health care system, and \nreinvented our energy sector; how we delivered more care and benefits \nto our troops and veterans, and how we secured the freedom in every \nstate to marry the person we love.\n  But such progress is not inevitable. It is the result of choices we \nmake together. And we face such choices right now. Will we respond to \nthe changes of our time with fear, turning inward as a nation, and \nturning against each other as a people? Or will we face the future with \nconfidence in who we are, what we stand for, and the incredible things \nwe can do together?\n  So let's talk about the future, and four big questions that we as a \ncountry have to answer--regardless of who the next President is, or who \ncontrols the next Congress.\n  First, how do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and \nsecurity in this new economy?\n  Second, how do we make technology work for us, and not against us--\nespecially when it comes to solving urgent challenges like climate \nchange?\n  Third, how do we keep America safe and lead the world without \nbecoming its policeman?\n  And finally, how can we make our politics reflect what's best in us, \nand not what's worst?\n  Let me start with the economy, and a basic fact: the United States of \nAmerica, right now, has the strongest, most durable economy in the \nworld. We're in the middle of the longest streak of private-sector job \ncreation in history. More than 14 million new jobs; the strongest two \nyears of job growth since the '90s; an unemployment rate cut in half. \nOur auto industry just had its best year ever. Manufacturing has \ncreated nearly 900,000 new jobs in the past six years. And we've done \nall this while cutting our deficits by almost three-quarters.\n  Anyone claiming that America's economy is in decline is peddling \nfiction. What is true--and the reason that a lot of Americans feel \nanxious--is that the economy has been changing in profound ways, \nchanges that started long before the Great Recession hit and haven't \nlet up. Today, technology doesn't just replace jobs on the assembly \nline, but any job where work can be automated. Companies in a global \neconomy can locate anywhere, and face tougher competition. As a result, \nworkers have less leverage for a raise. Companies have less loyalty to \ntheir communities. And more and more wealth and income is concentrated \nat the very top.\n  All these trends have squeezed workers, even when they have jobs; \neven when the economy is growing. It's made it harder for a hardworking \nfamily to pull itself out of poverty, harder for young people to start \non their careers, and tougher for workers to retire when they want to. \nAnd although none of these trends are unique to America, they do offend \nour uniquely American belief that everybody who works hard should get a \nfair shot.\n  For the past seven years, our goal has been a growing economy that \nworks better for everybody. We've made progress. But we need to make \nmore. And despite all the political arguments we've had these past few \nyears, there are some areas where Americans broadly agree.\n  We agree that real opportunity requires every American to get the \neducation and training they need to land a good-paying job. The \nbipartisan reform of No Child Left Behind was an important start, and \ntogether, we've increased early childhood education, lifted high school \ngraduation rates to new highs, and boosted graduates in fields like \nengineering. In the coming years, we should build on that progress, by \nproviding Pre-K for all, offering every student the hands-on computer \nscience and math classes that make them job-ready on day one, and we \nshould recruit and support more great teachers for our kids.\n  And we have to make college affordable for every American. Because no \nhardworking student should be stuck in the red. We've already reduced \nstudent loan payments to ten percent of a borrower's income. Now, we've \nactually got to cut the cost of college. Providing two years of \ncommunity college at no cost for every responsible student is one of \nthe best ways to do that, and I'm going to keep fighting to get that \nstarted this year.\n\n  Of course, a great education isn't all we need in this new economy. \nWe also need benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of \nsecurity. After all, it's not much of a stretch to say that some of the \nonly people in America who are going to work the same job, in the same \nplace, with a health and retirement package, for 30 years, are sitting \nin this chamber. For everyone else, especially folks in their forties \nand fifties, saving for retirement or bouncing back from job loss has \ngotten a lot tougher. Americans understand that at some point in their \ncareers, they may have to retool and retrain. But they shouldn't lose \nwhat they've already worked so hard to build.\n  That's why Social Security and Medicare are more important than ever; \nwe shouldn't weaken them, we should strengthen them. And for Americans \nshort of retirement, basic benefits should be just as mobile as \neverything else is today. That's what the Affordable Care Act is all \nabout. It's about filling the gaps in employer-based care so that when \nwe lose a job, or go back to school, or start that new business, we'll \nstill have coverage. Nearly eighteen million have gained coverage so \nfar. Health care inflation has slowed. And our businesses have created \njobs every single month since it became law.\n  Now, I'm guessing we won't agree on health care anytime soon. But \nthere should be other ways both parties can improve economic security. \nSay a hardworking American loses his job--we shouldn't just make sure \nhe can get unemployment insurance; we should make sure that program \nencourages him to retrain for a business that's ready to hire him. If \nthat new job doesn't pay as much, there should be a system of wage \ninsurance in place so that he can still pay his bills. And even if he's \ngoing from job to job, he should still be able to save for retirement \nand take his savings with him. That's the way we make the new economy \nwork better for everyone.\n  I also know Speaker Ryan has talked about his interest in tackling \npoverty. America is about giving everybody willing to work a hand up, \nand I'd welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all \nsupport, like expanding tax cuts for low-income workers without kids.\n  But there are other areas where it's been more difficult to find \nagreement\n\n[[Page S66]]\n\nover the last seven years--namely what role the government should play \nin making sure the system's not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and \nbiggest corporations. And here, the American people have a choice to \nmake.\n  I believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy. \nI think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed, and \nthere's red tape that needs to be cut. But after years of record \ncorporate profits, working families won't get more opportunity or \nbigger paychecks by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds make \ntheir own rules at the expense of everyone else; or by allowing attacks \non collective bargaining to go unanswered. Food Stamp recipients didn't \ncause the financial crisis; recklessness on Wall Street did. Immigrants \naren't the reason wages haven't gone up enough; those decisions are \nmade in the boardrooms that too often put quarterly earnings over long-\nterm returns. It's sure not the average family watching tonight that \navoids paying taxes through offshore accounts. In this new economy, \nworkers and start-ups and small businesses need more of a voice, not \nless. The rules should work for them. And this year I plan to lift up \nthe many businesses who've figured out that doing right by their \nworkers ends up being good for their shareholders, their customers, and \ntheir communities, so that we can spread those best practices across \nAmerica.\n  In fact, many of our best corporate citizens are also our most \ncreative. This brings me to the second big question we have to answer \nas a country: how do we reignite that spirit of innovation to meet our \nbiggest challenges?\n  Sixty years ago, when the Russians beat us into space, we didn't deny \nSputnik was up there. We didn't argue about the science, or shrink our \nresearch and development budget. We built a space program almost \novernight, and twelve years later, we were walking on the moon.\n  That spirit of discovery is in our DNA. We're Thomas Edison and the \nWright Brothers and George Washington Carver. We're Grace Hopper and \nKatherine Johnson and Sally Ride. We're every immigrant and \nentrepreneur from Boston to Austin to Silicon Valley racing to shape a \nbetter world. And over the past seven years, we've nurtured that \nspirit.\n  We've protected an open internet, and taken bold new steps to get \nmore students and low-income Americans online. We've launched next-\ngeneration manufacturing hubs, and online tools that give an \nentrepreneur everything he or she needs to start a business in a single \nday.\n  But we can do so much more. Last year, Vice President Biden said that \nwith a new moonshot, America can cure cancer. Last month, he worked \nwith this Congress to give scientists at the National Institutes of \nHealth the strongest resources they've had in over a decade. Tonight, \nI'm announcing a new national effort to get it done. And because he's \ngone to the mat for all of us, on so many issues over the past forty \nyears, I'm putting Joe in charge of Mission Control. For the loved ones \nwe've all lost, for the family we can still save, let's make America \nthe country that cures cancer once and for all.\n  Medical research is critical. We need the same level of commitment \nwhen it comes to developing clean energy sources.\n  Look, if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate \nchange, have at it. You'll be pretty lonely, because you'll be debating \nour military, most of America's business leaders, the majority of the \nAmerican people, almost the entire scientific community, and 200 \nnations around the world who agree it's a problem and intend to solve \nit.\n  But even if the planet wasn't at stake; even if 2014 wasn't the \nwarmest year on record--until 2015 turned out even hotter--why would we \nwant to pass up the chance for American businesses to produce and sell \nthe energy of the future?\n  Seven years ago, we made the single biggest investment in clean \nenergy in our history. Here are the results. In fields from Iowa to \nTexas, wind power is now cheaper than dirtier, conventional power. On \nrooftops from Arizona to New York, solar is saving Americans tens of \nmillions of dollars a year on their energy bills, and employs more \nAmericans than coal--in jobs that pay better than average. We're taking \nsteps to give homeowners the freedom to generate and store their own \nenergy--something environmentalists and Tea Partiers have teamed up to \nsupport. Meanwhile, we've cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly \nsixty percent, and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on \nEarth.\n  Gas under two bucks a gallon ain't bad, either.\n  Now we've got to accelerate the transition away from dirty energy. \nRather than subsidize the past, we should invest in the future--\nespecially in communities that rely on fossil fuels. That's why I'm \ngoing to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources, \nso that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our \nplanet. That way, we put money back into those communities and put tens \nof thousands of Americans to work building a 21st century \ntransportation system.\n\n  None of this will happen overnight, and yes, there are plenty of \nentrenched interests who want to protect the status quo. But the jobs \nwe'll create, the money we'll save, and the planet we'll preserve--\nthat's the kind of future our kids and grandkids deserve.\n  Climate change is just one of many issues where our security is \nlinked to the rest of the world. And that's why the third big question \nwe have to answer is how to keep America safe and strong without either \nisolating ourselves or trying to nation-build everywhere there's a \nproblem.\n  I told you earlier all the talk of America's economic decline is \npolitical hot air. Well, so is all the rhetoric you hear about our \nenemies getting stronger and America getting weaker. The United States \nof America is the most powerful nation on Earth. Period. It's not even \nclose. We spend more on our military than the next eight nations \ncombined. Our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of \nthe world. No nation dares to attack us or our allies because they know \nthat's the path to ruin. Surveys show our standing around the world is \nhigher than when I was elected to this office, and when it comes to \nevery important international issue, people of the world do not look to \nBeijing or Moscow to lead--they call us.\n  As someone who begins every day with an intelligence briefing, I know \nthis is a dangerous time. But that's not because of diminished American \nstrength or some looming superpower. In today's world, we're threatened \nless by evil empires and more by failing states. The Middle East is \ngoing through a transformation that will play out for a generation, \nrooted in conflicts that date back millennia. Economic headwinds blow \nfrom a Chinese economy in transition. Even as their economy contracts, \nRussia is pouring resources to prop up Ukraine and Syria--states they \nsee slipping away from their orbit. And the international system we \nbuilt after World War II is now struggling to keep pace with this new \nreality.\n  It's up to us to help remake that system. And that means we have to \nset priorities.\n  Priority number one is protecting the American people and going after \nterrorist networks. Both al Qaeda and now ISIL pose a direct threat to \nour people, because in today's world, even a handful of terrorists who \nplace no value on human life, including their own, can do a lot of \ndamage. They use the Internet to poison the minds of individuals inside \nour country; they undermine our allies.\n  But as we focus on destroying ISIL, over-the-top claims that this is \nWorld War III just play into their hands. Masses of fighters on the \nback of pickup trucks and twisted souls plotting in apartments or \ngarages pose an enormous danger to civilians and must be stopped. But \nthey do not threaten our national existence. That's the story ISIL \nwants to tell; that's the kind of propaganda they use to recruit. We \ndon't need to build them up to show that we're serious, nor do we need \nto push away vital allies in this fight by echoing the lie that ISIL is \nrepresentative of one of the world's largest religions. We just need to \ncall them what they are--killers and fanatics who have to be rooted \nout, hunted down, and destroyed.\n  That's exactly what we are doing. For more than a year, America has \nled\n\n[[Page S67]]\n\na coalition of more than 60 countries to cut off ISIL's financing, \ndisrupt their plots, stop the flow of terrorist fighters, and stamp out \ntheir vicious ideology. With nearly 10,000 air strikes, we are taking \nout their leadership, their oil, their training camps, and their \nweapons. We are training, arming, and supporting forces who are \nsteadily reclaiming territory in Iraq and Syria.\n  If this Congress is serious about winning this war, and wants to send \na message to our troops and the world, you should finally authorize the \nuse of military force against ISIL. Take a vote. But the American \npeople should know that with or without Congressional action, ISIL will \nlearn the same lessons as terrorists before them. If you doubt \nAmerica's commitment--or mine--to see that justice is done, ask Osama \nbin Laden. Ask the leader of al Qaeda in Yemen, who was taken out last \nyear, or the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks, who sits in a prison \ncell. When you come after Americans, we go after you. It may take time, \nbut we have long memories, and our reach has no limit.\n  Our foreign policy must be focused on the threat from ISIL and al \nQaeda, but it can't stop there. For even without ISIL, instability will \ncontinue for decades in many parts of the world--in the Middle East, in \nAfghanistan and Pakistan, in parts of Central America, Africa and Asia. \nSome of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks; \nothers will fall victim to ethnic conflict, or famine, feeding the next \nwave of refugees. The world will look to us to help solve these \nproblems, and our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to \ncarpet bomb civilians. That may work as a TV sound bite, but it doesn't \npass muster on the world stage.\n  We also can't try to take over and rebuild every country that falls \ninto crisis. That's not leadership; that's a recipe for quagmire, \nspilling American blood and treasure that ultimately weakens us. It's \nthe lesson of Vietnam, of Iraq--and we should have learned it by now.\n  Fortunately, there's a smarter approach, a patient and disciplined \nstrategy that uses every element of our national power. It says America \nwill always act, alone if necessary, to protect our people and our \nallies; but on issues of global concern, we will mobilize the world to \nwork with us, and make sure other countries pull their own weight.\n  That's our approach to conflicts like Syria, where we're partnering \nwith local forces and leading international efforts to help that broken \nsociety pursue a lasting peace.\n  That's why we built a global coalition, with sanctions and principled \ndiplomacy, to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. As we speak, Iran has \nrolled back its nuclear program, shipped out its uranium stockpile, and \nthe world has avoided another war.\n  That's how we stopped the spread of Ebola in West Africa. Our \nmilitary, our doctors, and our development workers set up the platform \nthat allowed other countries to join us in stamping out that epidemic.\n  That's how we forged a Trans-Pacific Partnership to open markets, \nprotect workers and the environment, and advance American leadership in \nAsia. It cuts 18,000 taxes on products Made in America, and supports \nmore good jobs. With TPP, China doesn't set the rules in that region, \nwe do. You want to show our strength in this century? Approve this \nagreement. Give us the tools to enforce it.\n  Fifty years of isolating Cuba had failed to promote democracy, \nsetting us back in Latin America. That's why we restored diplomatic \nrelations, opened the door to travel and commerce, and positioned \nourselves to improve the lives of the Cuban people. You want to \nconsolidate our leadership and credibility in the hemisphere? Recognize \nthat the Cold War is over. Lift the embargo.\n  American leadership in the 21st century is not a choice between \nignoring the rest of the world--except when we kill terrorists; or \noccupying and rebuilding whatever society is unraveling. Leadership \nmeans a wise application of military power, and rallying the world \nbehind causes that are right. It means seeing our foreign assistance as \npart of our national security, not charity. When we lead nearly 200 \nnations to the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate \nchange--that helps vulnerable countries, but it also protects our \nchildren. When we help Ukraine defend its democracy, or Colombia \nresolve a decades-long war, that strengthens the international order we \ndepend upon. When we help African countries feed their people and care \nfor the sick, that prevents the next pandemic from reaching our shores. \nRight now, we are on track to end the scourge of HIV/AIDS, and we have \nthe capacity to accomplish the same thing with malaria--something I'll \nbe pushing this Congress to fund this year.\n  That's strength. That's leadership. And that kind of leadership \ndepends on the power of our example. That is why I will keep working to \nshut down the prison at Guantanamo: it's expensive, it's unnecessary, \nand it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies.\n  That's why we need to reject any politics that targets people because \nof race or religion. This isn't a matter of political correctness. It's \na matter of understanding what makes us strong. The world respects us \nnot just for our arsenal; it respects us for our diversity and our \nopenness and the way we respect every faith. His Holiness, Pope \nFrancis, told this body from the very spot I stand tonight that ``to \nimitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best \nway to take their place.'' When politicians insult Muslims, when a \nmosque is vandalized, or a kid bullied, that doesn't make us safer. \nThat's not telling it like it is. It's just wrong. It diminishes us in \nthe eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals. And it \nbetrays who we are as a country.\n  ``We the People.'' Our Constitution begins with those three simple \nwords, words we've come to recognize mean all the people, not just \nsome; words that insist we rise and fall together. That brings me to \nthe fourth, and maybe the most important thing I want to say tonight.\n  The future we want--opportunity and security for our families; a \nrising standard of living and a sustainable, peaceful planet for our \nkids--all that is within our reach. But it will only happen if we work \ntogether. It will only happen if we can have rational, constructive \ndebates.\n  It will only happen if we fix our politics.\n  A better politics doesn't mean we have to agree on everything. This \nis a big country, with different regions and attitudes and interests. \nThat's one of our strengths, too. Our Founders distributed power \nbetween states and branches of government, and expected us to argue, \njust as they did, over the size and shape of government, over commerce \nand foreign relations, over the meaning of liberty and the imperatives \nof security.\n  But democracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens. \nIt doesn't work if we think the people who disagree with us are all \nmotivated by malice, or that our political opponents are unpatriotic. \nDemocracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise; or when \neven basic facts are contested, and we listen only to those who agree \nwith us. Our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get \nattention. Most of all, democracy breaks down when the average person \nfeels their voice doesn't matter; that the system is rigged in favor of \nthe rich or the powerful or some narrow interest.\n\n  Too many Americans feel that way right now. It's one of the few \nregrets of my presidency--that the rancor and suspicion between the \nparties has gotten worse instead of better. There's no doubt a \npresident with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better \nbridged the divide, and I guarantee I'll keep trying to be better so \nlong as I hold this office.\n  But, my fellow Americans, this cannot be my task--or any \nPresident's--alone. There are a whole lot of folks in this chamber who \nwould like to see more cooperation, a more elevated debate in \nWashington, but feel trapped by the demands of getting elected. I know; \nyou've told me. And if we want a better politics, it's not enough to \njust change a Congressman or a Senator or even a President; we have to \nchange the system to reflect our better selves.\n  We have to end the practice of drawing our congressional districts so \nthat politicians can pick their voters, and not the other way around. \nWe have to reduce the influence of money in our politics, so that a \nhandful of families\n\n[[Page S68]]\n\nand hidden interests can't bankroll our elections--and if our existing \napproach to campaign finance can't pass muster in the courts, we need \nto work together to find a real solution. We've got to make voting \neasier, not harder, and modernize it for the way we live now. And over \nthe course of this year, I intend to travel the country to push for \nreforms that do.\n  But I can't do these things on my own. Changes in our political \nprocess--in not just who gets elected but how they get elected--that \nwill only happen when the American people demand it. It will depend on \nyou. That's what's meant by a government of, by, and for the people.\n  What I'm asking for is hard. It's easier to be cynical; to accept \nthat change isn't possible, and politics is hopeless, and to believe \nthat our voices and actions don't matter. But if we give up now, then \nwe forsake a better future. Those with money and power will gain \ngreater control over the decisions that could send a young soldier to \nwar, or allow another economic disaster, or roll back the equal rights \nand voting rights that generations of Americans have fought, even died, \nto secure. As frustration grows, there will be voices urging us to fall \nback into tribes, to scapegoat fellow citizens who don't look like us, \nor pray like us, or vote like we do, or share the same background.\n  We can't afford to go down that path. It won't deliver the economy we \nwant, or the security we want, but most of all, it contradicts \neverything that makes us the envy of the world.\n  So, my fellow Americans, whatever you may believe, whether you prefer \none party or no party, our collective future depends on your \nwillingness to uphold your obligations as a citizen. To vote. To speak \nout. To stand up for others, especially the weak, especially the \nvulnerable, knowing that each of us is only here because somebody, \nsomewhere, stood up for us. To stay active in our public life so it \nreflects the goodness and decency and optimism that I see in the \nAmerican people every single day.\n  It won't be easy. Our brand of democracy is hard. But I can promise \nthat a year from now, when I no longer hold this office, I'll be right \nthere with you as a citizen--inspired by those voices of fairness and \nvision, of grit and good humor and kindness that have helped America \ntravel so far. Voices that help us see ourselves not first and foremost \nas black or white or Asian or Latino, not as gay or straight, immigrant \nor native born; not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans \nfirst, bound by a common creed. Voices Dr. King believed would have the \nfinal word--voices of unarmed truth and unconditional love.\n  They're out there, those voices. They don't get a lot of attention, \nnor do they seek it, but they are busy doing the work this country \nneeds doing.\n  I see them everywhere I travel in this incredible country of ours. I \nsee you. I know you're there. You're the reason why I have such \nincredible confidence in our future. Because I see your quiet, sturdy \ncitizenship all the time.\n  I see it in the worker on the assembly line who clocked extra shifts \nto keep his company open, and the boss who pays him higher wages to \nkeep him on board.\n  I see it in the Dreamer who stays up late to finish her science \nproject, and the teacher who comes in early because he knows she might \nsomeday cure a disease.\n  I see it in the American who served his time, and dreams of starting \nover--and the business owner who gives him that second chance. The \nprotester determined to prove that justice matters, and the young cop \nwalking the beat, treating everybody with respect, doing the brave, \nquiet work of keeping us safe.\n  I see it in the soldier who gives almost everything to save his \nbrothers, the nurse who tends to him 'til he can run a marathon, and \nthe community that lines up to cheer him on.\n  It's the son who finds the courage to come out as who he is, and the \nfather whose love for that son overrides everything he's been taught.\n  I see it in the elderly woman who will wait in line to cast her vote \nas long as she has to; the new citizen who casts his for the first \ntime; the volunteers at the polls who believe every vote should count, \nbecause each of them in different ways know how much that precious \nright is worth.\n  That's the America I know. That's the country we love. Clear-eyed. \nBig-hearted. Optimistic that unarmed truth and unconditional love will \nhave the final word. That's what makes me so hopeful about our future. \nBecause of you. I believe in you. That's why I stand here confident \nthat the State of our Union is strong.\n  Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, January 12, 2016. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/12/senate-section/article/S68-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S68]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:52 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 142.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Illinois applying to the United States Congress, \n     pursuant to Article V of the Constitution of the United \n     States, for the calling of a convention for proposing \n     amendments; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 42\n\n       Whereas, The first President of the United States, George \n     Washington, stated in his Farewell Address: ``The basis of \n     our political systems is the right of the people to make and \n     to alter their Constitutions of Government.''; and\n       Whereas, It was the stated intention of the framers of the \n     Constitution of the United States of America that the \n     Congress of the United States of America should be \n     ``dependent on the people alone'' (James Madison, Federalist \n     52); and\n       Whereas, That dependency has evolved from a dependency on \n     the people alone to a dependency on those who spend \n     excessively in elections, through campaigns or third-party \n     groups; and\n       Whereas, The United States Supreme Court ruling in Citizens \n     United v. Federal Election Commission, 558 U.S. 310 (2010), \n     removed restrictions on amounts of independent political \n     spending; and\n       Whereas, Article V of the United States Constitution \n     requires the United States Congress to call a convention for \n     proposing amendments upon application of two-thirds of the \n     legislatures of the several states for the purpose of \n     proposing amendments to the United States Constitution; and\n       Whereas, The State of Illinois sees the need for a \n     convention to propose amendments in order to address concerns \n     such as those raised by the decision of the United States \n     Supreme Court in Citizens United v. Federal Election \n     Commission and related cases and events, including those \n     occurring long before or afterward, or for a substantially \n     similar purpose, and desires that the convention should be so \n     limited; and\n       Whereas, The State of Illinois desires that the delegates \n     to the convention shall be comprised equally from individuals \n     currently elected to State and local office, or be selected \n     by election in each Congressional district for the purpose of \n     serving as delegates, though all individuals elected or \n     appointed to federal office, now or in the past, be \n     prohibited from serving as delegates to the Convention, and \n     intends to retain the ability to restrict or expand the power \n     of its delegates within the limits expressed above; and\n       Whereas, The State of Illinois intends that this be a \n     continuing application, considered together with applications \n     calling for a convention currently pending in the 188th \n     Massachusetts legislature as S.1727 and H.3190, the 2013-2014 \n     Vermont legislature as J.R.S. 27, and the 2013-2014 \n     California legislature as AJR 1, and all other passed, \n     pending, and future applications, the aforementioned concerns \n     of Illinois notwithstanding until such time as two-thirds of \n     the several states have applied for a Convention and that \n     Convention is convened by Congress; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Senate of the Ninety-Eighth General \n     Assembly of the State of Illinois, the House Of \n     Representatives concurring herein, that we, the legislature \n     of the State of Illinois, hereby make application to the \n     Congress, under the provisions of Article V of the \n     Constitution of the United States, for the calling of a \n     convention for proposing amendments; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this application shall be deemed an \n     application for a convention to address each and any of the \n     subjects listed in this resolution; for purposes of \n     determining whether two-thirds of the states have applied for \n     a convention addressing any subject, this application is to \n     be aggregated with the applications of any other state \n     legislatures limited to one or more of the subjects listed in \n     this resolution; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this resolution constitutes a continuing \n     application and remains in effect until rescission by any \n     sitting session of the legislature of this State; this \n     application does not constitute a recognition that any \n     particular activity or activities currently undertaken by the \n     federal government is or are authorized by the Constitution; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution be \n     delivered to the President and Secretary of the United States \n     Senate, the Speaker and Clerk of the House of Representatives \n     of the United States Congress, and the Archivist of the \n     United States; to the members of the United States Senate and \n     House of Representatives from this State; and to the \n     presiding officers of each of the legislative chambers in the \n     several states, requesting their cooperation.\n\n[[Page S72]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n       POM-127. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan urging the United \n     States Senate to concur with the United States House of \n     Representatives and repeal the country-of-origin labeling \n     regulations; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \n     Forestry.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S71, January 12, 2016, under PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS, \nthe Resolution text for House Resolution No. 184 and Senate Joint \nResolution No. 42 were inadvertently transposed.\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected so that the Resolution text \nfor Senate Joint Resolution No. 42 follows POM-126 and the \nResolution text for House Resolution No. 184 follows POM-127.\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n\n                        House Resolution No. 184\n\n       Whereas, The United States and Canada have the largest \n     trading relationship in the world, with bilateral trade \n     valued at $759 billion in 2014, an association that benefits \n     the economies of both countries. Michigan's merchandise \n     exports to Canada in 2014 were valued at $25.4 billion, and \n     259,000 Michigan jobs depend on trade and investment with \n     Canada; and\n       Whereas, The U.S. has implemented mandatory country-of-\n     origin labeling (COOL) rules requiring meats sold at retail \n     stores to be labeled with information on the source of the \n     meat. The World Trade Organization (WTO) has repeatedly ruled \n     that COOL discriminates against imported livestock and is not \n     compliant with international trade obligations. Due to the \n     WTO rulings, the U.S. may be subject to $3.6 billion in \n     retaliatory tariffs sought by Canada and Mexico; and\n       Whereas, COOL regulations also jeopardize the viability of \n     the U.S. packing and feeding industries. The additional $500 \n     million in annual compliance costs could lead to significant \n     job losses and plant closures with potentially devastating \n     impacts to local and state economies. All this for an issue \n     the United States Department of Agriculture has clearly \n     indicated is not about food safety; and\n       Whereas, The U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 2393 \n     to repeal the mandatory labeling for certain meats in June \n     2015 with 300 votes, showing a strong recognition across \n     party lines, as well as regionally, that COOL must be \n     repealed. However, the U.S. Senate appears less inclined to \n     repeal the COOL requirement, risking the American economy to \n     billions of dollars in retaliatory tariffs; Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we urge the \n     United States Senate to concur with the United States House \n     of Representatives and repeal the country-of-origin labeling \n     regulations; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-128.

A bill to amend the Real ID Act of 2005 to repeal provisions \nrequiring uniform State driver's licenses and State identification \ncards, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, in 2005, the Federal Government enacted \nthe REAL ID Act, imposing Federal standards established by the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to the production and issuance of \nStates' driver's licenses and identification cards.\n  This law was an underfunded, top down, Federal mandate, infringing on \npersonal privacy and State sovereignty. Furthermore, a REAL ID \ncompliant State ID will be required for all ``official federal \npurposes,'' including boarding commercial aircraft.\n  Twenty States have implemented laws prohibiting the implementation of \nREAL ID. Montana led opposition to this Federal mandate. In 2007, \nMontana enacted a law, after both chambers of the State legislature \nunanimously passing legislation, refusing to comply.\n  That is why I am re-introducing the Repeal ID Act--to allow Montana \nand\n\n[[Page S74]]\n\nother States to implement their laws. Consistent with the Montana State \nlegislature, this legislation will repeal the REAL ID Act of 2005.\n  Montanans are fully aware of the power that big data holds and the \nconsequences when that data is abused. Montana has shown how States are \nbest equipped to make licenses secure, without sacrificing the privacy \nand rights of their citizens. The Repeal ID Act will allow us to strike \na balance that protects our national security, while also safeguarding \nMontanans' civil liberties and personal privacy.\n  I want to thank Senator Tester for being original cosponsors of this \nbill and I ask my other Senate colleagues to join us in support of this \nlegislation. I want to also thank Representative Zinke for leading \nintroduction of companion legislation in the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2440\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
