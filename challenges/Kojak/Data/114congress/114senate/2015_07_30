Mr. President, many thought we would never get here, \nbut we have. Later today, the Senate will pass a multiyear highway bill \nthat does not raise taxes by a penny, and we will do it on a broad \nbipartisan basis. This is more than just another accomplishment for the \nSenate. It is a win for our country because the bill would cut redtape \nand streamline regulations, it would modernize infrastructure and \nadvance research and innovation, it would enact new transparency \nmeasures to empower Americans to see how much of their tax money is \nactually being spent, and because it is a multiyear bill it would give \nStates, cities, and towns the certainty they need to better plan road \nand bridge projects well into the future.\n  The multiyear nature of this legislation is one of its most critical \ncomponents. It is also something the House and Senate are not united \non. We all want the House to have the space it needs to develop its own \nbill because we all want to work out the best possible legislation for \nthe American people in conference later this year. So we will take up a \nmeasure this afternoon to give them that space, while also delivering \nimportant relief to veterans.\n  The bill will extend a helping hand to heroes who need it by covering \nunfunded requirements the administration failed to budget for. I hope \nwe will rally in support of veterans when that measure is considered, \njust as we continue to rally in support of a multiyear bipartisan and \nfiscally responsible highway bill we will pass today.\n  Some never thought this day would come, but thanks to the enduring \ndedication of Senators on both sides of the aisle--in particular, \nSenator Inhofe, Senator Boxer, as well as Senator Thune, Senator \nNelson, and Senator Hatch--it is here.\n\n[[Page S6148]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/30/senate-section/article/S6148-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      NUCLEAR AGREEMENT WITH IRAN\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on another matter, the purpose of the \nIran Nuclear Agreement Review Act is to ensure Congress has a fully \ninformed understanding of any comprehensive agreement reached between \nthe administration and Iran. These are principles both parties endorsed \nwhen they voted overwhelmingly to pass that measure earlier this year. \nThese are principles President Obama endorsed when he signed it into \nlaw. These are principles that need to be upheld.\n  That is why I recently joined Speaker Boehner, Senator Cotton, and \nCongressman Pompeo in calling on the administration to comply with the \nterms of this law by providing the Senate with the text of the two side \nagreements reached between Iran and the IAEA. That was more than a week \nago, but we still have yet to receive it. Without this critical \ninformation, Republicans and Democrats in Congress may not be able to \nproperly assess such a highly consequential deal with Iran. That is \nsimply not acceptable. The administration needs to turn over the side \nagreements without delay. Let me say that again. The administration \nneeds to turn over the side agreements without delay.\n  Even considering all this, the Senate has already begun its necessary \noversight of the deal that will soon be before us. The Armed Services \nCommittee held a hearing yesterday on the strategic and military \nimplications of the deal. The Foreign Relations Committee also held a \nhearing yesterday to consider the alternatives to this agreement.\n  Today it will consider the implications of sanctions relief for Iran, \nalong with Congress's ability to impose additional sanctions if Tehran \npersists in its support of terrorism. The Intelligence Committee has \nalready embarked on a series of briefings and hearings that will help \nCongress determine whether the deal can even be verified.\n  As the review moves forward, we will continue working to assess the \nrelative threat posed to the Greater Middle East and to the United \nStates by an Iranian regime empowered with a threshold nuclear program \nand billions of dollars of additional resources. I know this worries a \nlot of Members in both parties.\n  Consider what the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee \nsaid just this week:\n\n       I'm troubled that what this essentially does is after \n     fifteen years it legitimizes Iran as a nuclear threshold \n     state. After fifteen years Iran can produce weapons-grade \n     highly-enriched uranium without limitations and that is \n     disturbing because what that means to me is it really doesn't \n     prevent Iran from having a nuclear weapon. It just postpones \n     it.\n\n  That is the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. He \nis not the only Democrat or Republican with these types of concerns. We \nwill keep working for answers.\n  We will also keep pressing for a more fulsome revelation of the true \nextent of the possible military dimensions of Iran's nuclear program.\n  Understanding Iran's relative trustworthiness in the past will be \ncritical to determining Iran's potential for trustworthiness in the \nfuture--whether, for instance, it can truly be trusted to live up to \nits commitments in today's agreement. Getting a fuller picture of \nIran's past nuclear activities and research will also be important to \nensuring the U.N. Security Council, which rushed to approve the \ncomprehensive deal, has a more comprehensive understanding moving \nforward.\n  We will continue working hard to assess this agreement on behalf of \nthe American people who absolutely deserve a say in a deal of this \nmagnitude. At the end, Congress will take a vote and answer a simple \nbut powerful question: Will this agreement actually make America and \nits allies safer?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/30/senate-section/article/S6148-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Republicans called it ``the beginning of \nsocialized medicine.'' The Wall Street Journal accused Democrats and \nthe President of ``politicking with a nation's health.'' One Republican \nSenator called the health care law ``brazen socialism.''\n  Further:\n\n       It is not needed. It is socialism. It moves the country in \n     a direction which is not good for anyone, whether they be \n     young or old. It charts a course from which there will be no \n     turning back. . . . It is not only socialism--it is brazen \n     socialism.\n\n  You would think that based on the 50-plus times of trying to overturn \nObamaCare, that is what the Republican Senators were talking about, \nbut, no, that was Medicare. They weren't talking about ObamaCare; \nMedicare is what they were talking about.\n  Fifty years ago, President Lyndon Johnson signed into law Medicare \nand Medicaid. At that time, conservatives believed that access to \nhealth care through government was the worst possible decision any \nelected official could make--and so many Republicans, the same thing. \nIn fact, Republicans still do feel that way. Even after decades of \nMedicare's success, they are still clamoring for the program's \nelimination or massive changes.\n  Jeb Bush--a frontrunner for the Republican Presidential nomination--\ncalled for ``phasing out'' Medicare. Where did he do this? At a Koch \nbrothers rally in New Hampshire. Jeb Bush--a frontrunner for the \nRepublican Presidential nomination--said let's phase out Medicare. How \nabout that one?\n  For half a century, Republicans have continued to attack Medicare, \ndespite all the good it has done. They have tried to privatize Medicare \nand turn it into a voucher system and reduce benefits for seniors. \nRepublicans attacked the closing of the prescription drug doughnut hole \nand elimination of cost-sharing for preventative coverage simply \nbecause they were improvements made by the Affordable Care Act.\n  Republicans have repeatedly sought to destroy Medicaid, and \nRepublican Governors have turned back millions of Federal dollars and \ndenied their citizens, the most needy of all, coverage simply because \nof ideology.\n  This week they renewed their never-ending assault on women's health \nby trying to defund Planned Parenthood in reaction to a radical \nrightwing crusade by an extremist group. American women value Planned \nParenthood because they know Planned Parenthood provides vital health \ncare services to millions of women, but Republicans are choosing to \ndisseminate access to the health services of women. Women need this \nhealth care to stay healthy.\n  Why are they doing it? I guess, to further their political agenda. \nWhen will the Republican attack on effective health care programs end?\n  Medicare and Medicaid have positively affected and even saved \nmillions of Americans' lives. Before Medicare, nearly half of all \nseniors age 65 and older were uninsured. The elderly were discriminated \nagainst simply because of their age. If you were fortunate enough to \nhave health insurance, you paid over 50 percent of the cost straight \nout of your pocket.\n  My first elected job was from Clark County. That is in Las Vegas, NV. \nI was chosen to be a member of the board of trustees of Southern Nevada \nMemorial Hospital--the largest hospital district in Nevada. After a \nyear or so, I became chairman of the board of trustees. I was there \nwhen Medicare came into being. Prior to Medicare, more than 40 percent \nof all seniors who came into our hospital were required to have a \nbrother, a son, a daughter, a mother, a father, a husband, a wife or a \nneighbor sign on the dotted line, saying: If that bill is not paid, we \nwill guarantee it is paid.\n  We had a collection department in that hospital that was very \naggressive and went after these people. That is how bad it was for \nseniors, but today, 50 years later, about 99 percent of seniors are \ninsured and go to the hospital when they need care.\n  The cost during their working years is a small amount of out-of-\npocket costs. The program that we call Medicare is a lifeline. Before \nMedicare and Medicaid, health care for millions of younger Americans \nwas subject to racism and discrimination. A White American was 30 \npercent more likely to be admitted to a hospital than an African \nAmerican. In fact, in many cases emergency response calls were subject \nto race confirmation before action. They\n\n[[Page S6149]]\n\nwanted to know where you lived, and if the color of your skin wasn't \njust right when you were brought to the hospital, you went on your way. \nToday the disparity in hospitalization rates between minorities and \nWhite Americans has decreased significantly.\n  Medicare and Medicaid have protected the health and well-being of \nmillions of seniors, individuals with disabilities, low-income \nindividuals, and millions of children.\n  In the past 50 years, Medicaid has grown to be the Nation's primary \nhealth insurance program for low-income individuals and families. \nMedicaid has grown to cover nearly 70 million Americans, including more \nthan 40 million children.\n  Today Medicaid covers nearly half of all births in the United States \nand ensures that children receive the health care they desperately need \nin the early stages of their lives. By providing early childhood health \ncare to millions, Medicaid has improved the long-term health of \nchildren and contributed to their overall quality of life.\n  Medicaid has also provided health care and long-term services to 16 \nmillion low-income seniors and individuals with disabilities. Medicaid \npays for services that Medicare does not cover. It ensures that low-\nincome seniors and individuals with disabilities have access to a wide \nvariety of services. These options allow them to remain in their \ncommunities rather than relocate to nursing homes. But when they do \nhave to go to a nursing home, the vast majority of people in \nconvalescent centers in America are Medicaid recipients.\n  Sadly, 22 States have chosen not to expand Medicaid coverage, and \nthis decision has hurt millions of people who can't afford health care \nany other way. Why do States and the Republican Governors of those \nStates oppose this? Because it is part of ObamaCare.\n  To his credit, the conservative Republican Governor from the State of \nNevada, Brian Sandoval, was one of the first Governors to sign on to \nthis program. He didn't care if it was a Democratic program or a \nRepublican program; it helped people in Nevada who needed help. I truly \nadmire him for doing that. The expansion of Medicaid in States \nthroughout the country would boost States' economic activity--and Brian \nSandoval knows that--and create job growth, in addition to providing \nquality, affordable health care to vulnerable Americans. The State of \nNevada is a relatively sparsely populated State. Almost 200,000 people \nare receiving the health care they need and would not have but for \nObamaCare and Governor Brian Sandoval.\n  Medicaid expansion would benefit every State. The Affordable Care Act \ntransformed Medicaid into a true safety net for vulnerable Americans. \nWe should be expanding this coverage, not restricting it for partisan \ngain.\n  Medicare and Medicaid have protected Americans for 50 years, and our \nNation is healthier and stronger because of its existence. But despite \n50 years of undeniable Medicare and Medicaid success, Republicans \nremain committed to ending access to health care for those who need it \nthe most.\n  We will be celebrating ObamaCare's success 50 years from now while \nRepublicans call for the Affordable Care Act to be phased out, like Jeb \nBush wants. In 50 years, will there be a Republican Presidential wanna-\nbe out there saying ``Let's get rid of ObamaCare; let's phase it out''? \nI hope not.\n  Republicans have repeatedly engaged in politically motivated attacks \ndesigned to undermine the law that transformed our Nation's health care \nsystem. The Affordable Care Act has helped millions of Americans to \ngain access to quality health care. Since the Affordable Care Act was \nsigned into law, 16.4 million Americans have gotten quality health \ncare--many of them for the first time in their lives. The United States \nhas seen the largest decline in the uninsured rate in decades, if not \nforever. In the last 18 months, the uninsured rate for nonelderly \nadults has fallen by 35 percent. Health care costs have grown at their \nslowest rate in 50 years. Patient safety initiatives are keeping \nAmericans safe.\n  The Affordable Care Act is working. It is the law of the land, and \nthat is not going to change. There have been more than 50 votes to \nrepeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act and there have been \nrepeated challenges to this law before the courts, but we have won on \nevery level. The American people have won twice with the stamp of \napproval by the Supreme Court. Last month we witnessed the Supreme \nCourt rule, as I have indicated, again for the second time in favor of \nthe Affordable Care Act. It is here to stay. It is here to stay because \nthe American people want affordable health care.\n  American seniors need affordable, accessible health care coverage, \nand they need it right now.\n  Five decades ago--50 years ago--President Johnson said:\n\n       No longer will older Americans be denied the healing \n     miracle of modern medicine. No longer will illness crush and \n     destroy the savings they have so carefully put away over a \n     lifetime so that they might enjoy dignity in their later \n     years. No longer will young families see their own incomes, \n     and their own hopes eaten away simply because they are \n     carrying out their deep moral obligations to their parents, \n     and to their uncles, and their aunts.\n\n  The Republicans have spent the last five decades fighting against \nPresident Johnson's dream. The Republicans are determined to roll back \naccess to health care for Americans. It is hard to believe, but it is \ntrue. Just this week the Senate held a vote on whether to repeal this \nlifesaving program--again. It is clear that after 50 years, the \nRepublicans have learned nothing.\n  We should be building on the success of Medicare, Medicaid, and the \nAffordable Care Act. We need to be expanding coverage to all Americans. \nWe should be encouraging States to expand Medicaid access. Democrats \nare committed--just as President Johnson was half a century ago--to \ngiving Americans the health care they need and deserve.\n  Will the Chair announce the schedule for today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/30/senate-section/article/S6149-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 22, which the clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 22) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n     to exempt employees with health coverage under TRICARE or the \n     Veterans Administration from being taken into account for \n     purposes of determining the employers to which the employer \n     mandate applies under the Patient Protection and Affordable \n     Care Act.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 12 \np.m. will be equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, soon we will vote on final passage of a \nbill that will provide a long-term solution to the shortfalls of the \nhighway trust fund. If enacted, this bill will provide the longest \npaid-for authorization of highway and transportation spending in nearly \na decade.\n  This bill is the result of an incredible amount of work by a number \nof Senators, including our distinguished majority leader as well as the \nchairman and ranking member of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. I commend them for setting aside partisan differences to \nfind a solution despite the cynicism and naysaying from some of our \ncolleagues and others here in Washington.\n  I am also pleased to have been able to play a part in these efforts, \nworking with Leader McConnell to identify suitable offsets to pay for \nthe reauthorization of the highway and transit programs. While the \nFinance Committee, which I chair, has jurisdiction over the funding \nstream for the highway trust fund, we had to cull together offsets from \nother areas and other committees in order to pay for this multiyear \nhighway bill. This required the cooperation of multiple chairmen and \ncommittees, all working together toward a common goal.\n  One of the most remarkable things about this bill is that it provides \n3 full years of highway funding without raising taxes or adding to the \ndeficit. We have heard time and again that a long-term highway bill \nwould only be possible if we included a big tax increase. With the \nupcoming final vote on this\n\n[[Page S6150]]\n\nbill, the Senate is about to prove otherwise, and it will do so with \nbipartisan support. This is how the Senate should operate, particularly \nwhen we are dealing with something as big and important as highway \nfunding.\n  As I said last week, this bill represents a victory for good \ngovernment and is yet another bipartisan win for the Senate under the \ncurrent leadership. Like many of my colleagues, my hope is that \neventually the House of Representatives will follow suit and work \ntoward passage of a similar long-term highway bill so that we can come \ntogether, reconcile differences, and finish the job. While I know there \nare some divisions on the other side of the Capitol about the Senate's \noverall strategy and maybe even some of the particulars in our bill, I \nthink we have shown that a long-term bill is a realistic goal and a \npreferable option to yet another short-term highway patch.\n  Once again, I am well aware of the desire of some in Congress and in \nthe administration to marry long-term highway funding to some kind of \ntax reform. As the chairman of the Senate's tax-writing committee and \nits most outspoken supporter of tax reform, I think that idea has a lot \nof merit. I commend those who are thinking in those terms. Fortunately, \nthis bill will provide just that opportunity while giving added \ncertainty to our States as they plan their highway projects and to our \nbuilders and job creators looking to expand and hire more workers.\n  Put simply, the Senate's highway approach is a win for everyone. The \nHouse should consider our approach, and I hope they will.\n  Long story short, today is a good day. Today the Senate will \naccomplish something few thought possible. While the process has been a \nbit more difficult and divisive than many of us would have liked, I \npersonally am very pleased to see the Senate function properly and \ngovern responsibly.\n  There are a lot of things we can fight over here in Congress, but I \nthink we can--or at least should--all agree on the need to come \ntogether to pay for our Nation's infrastructure. I am pleased to join \nwith my colleagues--Senators from both parties--in taking a major step \ntoward that goal today.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak as in morning business for no more than 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n\n\n                      50th Anniversary of Medicare\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 50th anniversary of \nMedicare. Fifty years ago, on July 30, 1965, President Lyndon Johnson \nsigned into law the legislation to create Medicare. I say thank God for \nMedicare. It was a great idea 50 years ago, 50 months ago, 50 weeks \nago, and 50 minutes ago.\n  I stand on the Senate floor to say that we must keep Medicare as \nMedicare and keep the integrity and solvency of Medicare. We cannot \nturn Medicare into a voucher; we cannot dilute it, phase it out, or \neliminate it. And until my last vote is cast in the Senate, I will \ndefend Medicare.\n  I saw what it meant. In the summer of 1965, I had just graduated from \nthe University of Maryland School of Social Work. Change was in the \nair. The civil rights movement was making its progress toward history \nand moving forward. There were beginning doubts about the Vietnam war, \nand the Nation was recovering from the assassination of President \nKennedy. President Johnson wanted to lead in a bold way, having had a \nlandslide victory, and he said he wanted to create a great society. He \nknew that a great society meant that we had to have a great heart.\n  What we knew then, as we know today, is that people feared financial \nbankruptcy because of health care costs. They were terrified that a \nheart attack that resulted in hospitalization would bankrupt the \nfamily. They delayed the idea of getting cataract surgery, which then \nneeded to be done in the hospital, not because they were afraid of the \nsurgery but because they were afraid of the cost of surgery. If you \nwere a small, independent business person over 65, you often had no \nhealth insurance. It didn't matter whether you were in agriculture or \nan urban small business.\n  Medicare changed all of that. Medicare protected people from two \nthings. No. 1, it protected them so that they could go to a doctor when \nthey needed to and have health care when they needed it. No. 2, it \nprotected them from financial disaster.\n  Today, 55 million Americans--nearly every senior--have access to \nMedicare, including 1 million seniors.\n  What was so significant about that bill is that it provided universal \naccess to doctors.\n  No. 2, it had no barriers because of preexisting conditions.\n  No. 3, it was portable because it was national. Whether a person was \nin Maryland or Utah or whatever State, Medicare was the national \nprogram, and it was viewed as an earned benefit.\n  America at that time had many things going for it. One was that we \nhad a sense of self-confidence that we could really solve problems and \nmeet the compelling needs of our country, and the other was that we had \ncompassion.\n  One of my guiding principles, which I believed then as well, and that \nguided the Nation at that time was the guiding principle of honor thy \nfather and mother. We knew that it was not only a great commandment to \nlive by, but it was a good policy to live by. Therefore, we ensured \nthat all Americans had access to health care, regardless of their \nincome.\n  As I said, in the 1960s--1965 was the year that I actually graduated \nfrom the school of social work. I worked for a program called \n``responding to the elderly's abilities and sicknesses otherwise \nneglected.'' It was called Operation Reason. Our job--a social worker \nand a nurse, one of my oldest friends from school--was to help elderly \npeople know about the program and sign up for the program and help them \nuse the program. It was the joy--the sheer joy--people experienced when \nthey heard about this program, knowing that simply because they were \nAmerican citizens, their needs would be taken care of, with a modest \npremium.\n  Part A was hospitalization--a safety net. In those days, care for \nsignificant illnesses had to be done in the hospital. The advances of \nmedicine and medical technology has allowed us now to do less in the \nhospital, such as cataract surgery and other surgeries being done on an \noutpatient basis. Those advances weren't there in the 1960s. So people \nno longer had to fear the cost of hospitalization.\n  Then there was this program called Part B. That meant seniors had \naccess to see a doctor, to see if they had diabetes, to see if they had \nhigh blood pressure, to see why they couldn't see those grandchildren \nor do their work on the family farm, the small business or in the \nfactories that we had in those days. What they needed was maybe better \neyesight--that cataract surgery. Maybe they were feeling old and slow \nnot because of age but because they had diabetes or other issues. Then, \nof course, there was the cost of the dreaded ``c'' word--cancer.\n  My colleague and I worked in the neighborhoods to make sure we took \ncare of how people could get to the facilities, know about those \nservices, and know about those barriers. In those days, Baltimore \nseniors were struggling. When they retired, it was often the end of \nhealth insurance. It meant nearly half of the seniors were uninsured. \nThey went to clinics, standing in very long lines, often shuttled back \nand forth from one clinic to another. They got their blood work here, \nthey looked at their kidneys there, and they looked at their eyes here. \nTheir concept of primary care was fragmented.\n  Before Medicare, millions of seniors, as I have said, were just one \nheart attack away from bankruptcy or one cancer diagnosis away from \ndestitution. That was before Medicare.\n  Many were skeptical about Medicare. Once again, the other party \nfought it. They were wondering what it would mean. People were \nskeptical. Was this a big government move or was it a big opportunity? \nMy job was to show them that this program was not about big government, \nbut about government with a big heart.\n  After four months of operation, we had enrolled hundreds of people \ninto this much needed program. And what\n\n[[Page S6151]]\n\nhas it meant? Before Medicare, 48 percent of seniors had no health \ninsurance. Today, only 2 percent are uninsured. Out-of-pocket costs \nhave decreased. Before Medicare, seniors paid 56 percent of health care \ncosts out of their pocket. Imagine what that meant if you were \nhospitalized in those days. Life expectancy is now 5 years longer. \nDeath from heart disease has dropped. Our elderly poverty rate has \ndeclined. Seniors have access to more affordable drugs.\n  This isn't about numbers, and it isn't about statistics. It is about \npeople. It is about the compelling needs of human beings. It is about \ngovernment that says: I am on your side and at your side, and we are \ngoing to use our national resources, our national brain power, our \nnational know-how to be able to create a program that you can \nparticipate in and that at the end of the day, your life will be better \nand our society will be improved.\n  I am really proud of what the Congress and the President did 50 years \nago. I hope we have that same attitude again. It is not about big \ngovernment; it is about government with a big heart.\n  I will say this: There are those who continue to talk about ending \nMedicare. Most recently, a Presidential candidate who I think has \nincredible ability--Jeb Bush--said he wanted to phase out Medicare. I \ndon't get it. How do we phase out Medicare? Do we start first with age? \nDo we phase out 90-year-olds, and then the next year we phase out 80-\nyear-olds? How do we phase it out? Do we phase it out by disease? OK, \nthis year, no more diabetics; OK, this year, no more cancer patients--\nthey really cost a lot of money. What does it mean to phase it out, and \nwhat are we phasing it out to?\n  Medicare cannot be privatized. We must continue it as a guaranteed \nbenefit. Do we need to reform it, take a look at it, refresh it? The \nanswer is yes. We have done that, such as when we added Part B. But I \nwill say this: No matter what, thank God for Medicare.\n  When we go around this country, no matter how they feel about \ngovernment or about Congress, people love Social Security and they love \nMedicare. We have to defend it. We have to make sure it is there as we \nneed it.\n  So on this 50th anniversary of Medicare, let's come together to make \nsure we continue to be focused not on big government but on a sense of \nself-confidence and a belief in our country to solve big problems and \nthat we continue to act like a country with a big heart. We can do it \nbecause we have done it in the past.\n  I will conclude by saying: Thank God for Medicare, and I thank God \nfor the ability to be here on the floor of the Senate to defend it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n\n             Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request, but I \nam waiting for Senator Grassley from Iowa, the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, to propound it, so I will speak first and then do \nthe request.\n  I rise today to address the growing crisis of judicial vacancies in \nour Federal and district courts.\n  There are no values more American than the speedy application of \njustice and the right to petition the government for a redress of \ngrievances. Frankly, neither of those can be achieved without justices \nand judges on the bench.\n  It is the job of the Senate to responsibly keep up with the need to \nconfirm judges. Yet we have a 10-percent vacancy in judicial positions \nthroughout the United States. We have 28 districts that are considered \n``judicial emergencies.'' In my home State of New York, in the Western \nDistrict, there is not a single active district judge--zero. The \nWestern District has one of the busiest caseloads in the country. It \nhandles more criminal cases than Washington, DC, or Boston or \nCleveland. The delays for civil trials are by far the worst in the \ncountry. Yet they don't have a single active Federal district judge. If \nnot for the efforts of two judges on senior status who are volunteering \nto hear cases in their retirement, the Western District would be at a \nfull judicial standstill.\n  How have we gotten to this point? My friends on the other side of the \naisle slowed the pace of confirmations when the Senate was under \nDemocratic leadership, creating these backlogs, but we still pushed as \nmany through as we could. Now, under the new Republican Senate, more \nthan half the year into this new Congress, the Republican leadership \nhas scheduled votes on only five Federal judges. It is July. They have \nscheduled votes on five Federal judges. That is a disgrace.\n  For context, in the seventh year of President Bush's Presidency, the \nDemocratic Senate--we were in charge then--approved 25, compared to 5 \nhere. That is a direct one-to-one comparison, apples to apples. At this \npoint in President Bush's term, Democrats had confirmed five times the \namount of judges that this Republican Congress--this Republican \nSenate--has confirmed. That is unacceptable.\n  Right now, there are 14 noncontroversial judges on the Executive \nCalendar, including 3 highly qualified judges for New York. I know \nthese nominees. They are brilliant legal minds, experienced jurists \nand, above all, they are moderate.\n  Larry Vilardo and Ann Donnelly are two whom I have recommended, and \nLaShann DeArcy Hall was recommended by my good friend, the junior \nSenator from New York, Kirsten Gillibrand. They should all be \nconfirmed, but we don't know if they will ever come up for a vote.\n  I wish to spend a moment telling my colleagues about these qualified \njudges.\n  Mr. Vilardo is a true Buffalonian and will be a credit to the bench \nin his hometown. He went to Canisius College, Harvard Law School, and \nwas a clerk on the Fifth Circuit. He is fundamentally and classically a \nBuffalonian--salt of the Earth, honest, and grounded. Buffalo is in his \nbones; it is part of who he is. As with so many other people from the \nregion, the city has made him tough, levelheaded, fair, and decent. As \nthe first in his family to graduate from college, he adds an important \nelement of socioeconomic diversity to the court. The people of the \nWestern District of New York will be incredibly lucky to have him on \nthe bench.\n  As perfect as Larry Vilardo is for the bench in Buffalo, so are Ann \nDonnelly and LaShann DeArcy Hall perfect for the bench in Brooklyn.\n  Judge Donnelly has dedicated her life to public service. She spent a \nquarter decade as a prosecutor in the prestigious Office of the \nDistrict Attorney of New York County under DA Morganthal. I could tick \noff more of her accomplishments. The list would be long. She is more \nthan a brilliant resume. She is at her core a kind, thoughtful, and \ncompassionate person.\n  Let me say a word about LaShann DeArcy Hall. I can't take credit for \nher nomination to the Eastern District of New York. That goes to \nSenator Gillibrand. But I am proud to offer my strong support. She too \nhas accumulated extensive and impressive legal experience as a partner \nin the international law firm of Morrison & Foerster. She is a veteran, \nhaving proudly served in the Air Force. She is a graduate of Howard \nUniversity School of Law, and she is member of the board of visitors \nthere.\n  Now, all of these nominees meet and even exceed my standard for \njudicial nominations in his or her own way. My standards are three: \nexcellence--legally excellent, no political hacks; moderation--not too \nfar right but not too far left; and diversity. Whenever we can get \ndiversity on the bench, we should.\n  But they are not the only outstanding nominees we have on the floor. \nWe have judges pending--candidates--for Missouri, California, \nrepresented by Republican Senators as much as by Democrats who are \nexperiencing the same judicial emergencies and heavy backlog caseloads. \nYet we have no indication they will ever be moved off the calendar.\n  This is about governing. In January, the distinguished and newly \nminted majority leader came before this body and said it was time to \ngovern. We would do the budget by regular order. Things would return to \nnormal in the Senate. We wouldn't fill the tree. Yet here we are, 7 \nmonths later, and we have approved five judges. That is it--five. Ten \npercent of the Federal and district judgeships across the country are \nvacant.\n\n[[Page S6152]]\n\n  Confirming judges is part of the business of government, and right \nnow the majority party is failing that responsibility to the American \npeople. It has real consequences. In the Western District of New York, \nJudge Skretny, on senior status, has admitted that he is encouraging \nall cases to settle in pretrial mediation to lower caseloads. Criminal \ntrials are prioritized while civil trials languish. The two retired \njudges in western New York are the only ones reading cases at the \nmoment and spending far less time on each individual case than they \nwould under normal circumstances. And defendants may be inclined to \nsettle, admit guilt, and take plea deals rather than wait out a lengthy \ntrial process. The same story line is playing out throughout the \ncountry. That is not how our justice system is supposed to work. As \nmany of my colleagues have said so eloquently, the harsh truth of the \nmatter is that for these petitioners, companies, and communities, \njustice is being delayed and thus denied.\n\n  In the Senate, we often invoke the principles upon which our country \nwas founded: principles of individual liberty, justice, and equality in \nthe eyes of the law. These words have to mean something. There \nshouldn't be political games standing in their way. The equal and fair \napplication of justice is necessarily tarnished by a courtroom without \na judge. It is as simple as that.\n  In conclusion, Democrats will not stand to watch our judicial system \nbrought to its knees by the death of a thousand cuts. We have one week \nof legislative session before a month-long recess. I submit that we \nshould not--cannot leave town having confirmed only five judges in what \nwould be 8 months of this Congress.\n  Today I rise to request we move to New York's pending judicial \nnominations, but I also hope we will move the other Justices before and \nafter New York's on the calendar. I would like to make this request, \nbut I know my colleague from Iowa would like to answer it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session to consider the following nominations: Calendar Nos. \n139, 140, and 141; that the Senate proceed to vote without intervening \naction or debate on the nominations in the order listed; that the \nmotions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with \nno intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order to \nthe nominations; that any related statements be printed in the Record; \nthat the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and \nthe Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Before I speak about reserving the right to object, I \nwould like to have the floor immediately after the Senator from New \nYork gives up the floor, if I could. Is there any objection to that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. OK. I want to reserve the right to object, and I will \nobject.\n  I would like to make a few comments on the pace of judicial \nnominations. First of all, during President Obama's Presidency thus far \nthe Senate has confirmed 313 judicial nominees. In contrast to that, \nthere were 283 judicial nominees that the Senate had confirmed at this \nvery same point of the previous Presidency. That is 30 more judicial \nnominees confirmed at this point than in the year 2007.\n  Concerning this year's pace, the Senate is simply following the \nstandard that my colleagues on the other side established in that year, \n2007. By this point in 2007, the committee had held six hearings for a \ntotal of 20 judicial nominees. So far we have held 7 hearings for a \ntotal of 21 nominees, 5 executive nominees, and 16 judicial nominees, \nincluding hearings on both the Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral.\n  I would like to remind my colleagues that the Attorney General and \nDeputy Attorney General nominees took significantly more time to \nprocess on both staff and Members. So we are doing a little bit better \nthan the pace that was set on the other side during the last 2 years of \nthe previous Presidency. And I am trying to compare to the last 2 years \nof that Presidency to this Presidency.\n  I would also note that the nominees from New York are below other \nArticle III judges on the Executive Calendar. As I understand it, our \nside has agreed to vote on the next judge on the calendar when we \nreturn.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, would my colleague yield for a brief \nquestion?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will yield. Of course, I will yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I very much appreciate his courtesy.\n  I understand my colleague has talked about what has been done in the \nJudiciary Committee which he chairs. Does my colleague deny the fact \nthat confirmed on the floor of the Senate in the year 2007, which he \nreferred to, there were 25 at this time and only 5 have been confirmed \nby this Senate? Does my colleague deny that fact?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would agree to that, and I will speak \nto that point right now. It is very appropriate that my colleague would \nknow exactly what I was going to say to answer his question.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Great minds think alike.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. With respect to the judges on the Executive Calendar, \neverybody knows at the end of last year the Senate rammed through 11 \njudges, which under regular order--and regular order is very important \nin the U.S. Senate--should have been considered at the beginning of \nthis Congress. That is what happened in 2006 when 13 nominations were \nreturned to the President instead of being returned to the U.S. Senate \nin the next Congress. The end of 2006 is comparable to what was done at \nthe end of 2014. Had we not confirmed those 11 judicial nominees during \nthe lame duck last year, we would be roughly at the same pace for \njudicial confirmations this year compared to 2007. So put that in your \npipe and smoke it, Senator Schumer.\n  We are moving at a reasonable pace. Therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Without smoking, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                        Governing in the Senate\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Senator from New York gave very good \nwords that I want to follow up on. He said that we were promised when \nRepublicans took over we said things would be different in governing. \nThey are different. I would just like to show the Senator from New York \nthat promises made are promises kept. I think the best example of \npromises made was a January 2014 speech by the leadership of the \nRepublicans where a speech was given that if there were Republican \ncontrol of the United States Senate, then we would govern.\n  I think the best way to show that Republicans are governing is this: \nthere were 370 House bills that died in the U.S. Senate under the \nleadership of the Democrat majority. We had 15 amendments with rollcall \nvotes. So far this year, we have had over 160 rollcall votes on \namendments.\n  We have passed over 40 bipartisan bills, reported over 160 bills out \nof committee, had 29 bills signed into law, and balanced the first \nbudget for over a decade. Under Republican leadership, we had a budget \nagreement for the first time in 6 years, whereas under the Democratic \nmajority we had one budget in 6 years. The law requires that we adopt a \nbudget every year, and we have done that.\n  We made a promise that the Senate was going to function as a \ndeliberative body, unlike the way it was run under the Democratic \nmajority for the 6 years of this Presidency. From that standpoint, we \nhave done that with the statistics that I just gave you.\n  The Senator from New York says we were promised a Senate that would \ngovern, but the only metric he is using is whether judges are moving at \nthe same pace as they did when they took over the U.S. Senate in 2007. \nAnd that is an inadequate way to measure how well the Senate is \ngoverning. We must look at all the work the Senate is doing. And the \nSenate is doing the good work we promised we'd do before the election. \nWe have delivered.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n[[Page S6153]]\n\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, thank you.\n  We have had some interesting back-and-forth here this morning. We had \na great message from our good Senator from Maryland, and we had the \ncolloquy we just saw here on judicial nominees. I want to move in a \nlittle different direction to something I think is important.\n  As the previous speaker talked about, the current majority is getting \nthings done. I want to talk about for the first time in 10 years what \nis going to happen on this floor today, and that is for the first time \nin 10 years we are going to pass a multiyear transportation bill \nwithout raising taxes.\n  Keep in mind, we have done short-term transportation efforts 33 times \nbefore we finally got to the next multi-year bill that will be passed \non this floor today. I believe one of the core constitutional functions \nof the Federal government is to create the infrastructure necessary to \nconduct commerce, trade, and allow general transportation. I sit on \nthree of the four Senate committees tasked with developing this highway \nbill that we will vote on today--the Finance Committee, the Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation Committee, and the Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs Committee. Because of this, infrastructure development is \none of my top priorities while here in this Congress.\n  It has been a pleasure to work with Chairman Inhofe, to work with \nChairmen Thune, Shelby, and Hatch over the past several months on this \nhighway bill. I am very appreciative of our leadership team, \nparticularly that of Leader McConnell and Senator Cornyn for working to \nadvance it before the authorities expire and the Congress adjourns for \nthe August recess.\n  Moving forward with a highway bill that invests in our Nation's \ncrumbling infrastructure, reduces congestion, and increases safety \nwithout adding to the national debt will create short-term jobs and \nlong-term economic growth.\n  Western States like Nevada, which have experienced an unprecedented \namount of growth over the past couple of decades, have the most to gain \nfrom this highway bill. Nevada is one of the fastest growing States in \nour Nation, adding nearly 850,000 people to that State in the last 15 \nyears. In fact, the Silver State was the fastest growing State in the \nNation in the decade of the 2000s, experiencing a 35-percent population \nincrease. This growth, while exciting for the State, has posed \nadditional strains on our transportation infrastructure system. From \n1990 to 2013, vehicle travel on Nevada's highways has increased 141 \npercent.\n  It is also important to note that the Silver State's economy relies \nheavily on tourism. Travel spending adds nearly $60 billion to Nevada's \neconomy annually, accounting for about 13 percent of the State's GDP. \nSafe and reliable roads and bridges in our State and throughout the \ncountry are crucial to growing our economy.\n  Our rapidly expanding State has a long list of infrastructure \npriorities to address. A multiyear highway bill will provide the \nresources and tools that will benefit high priority projects such as \nthe Boulder City Bypass, the Carson City Freeway, and the I-15 widening \nin Las Vegas--which, by the way, is Nevada's busiest freeway. Under \nNevada's most conservative budgetary plans, our Department of \nTransportation has identified over $9 billion of capital improvement \nprojects over the next 20 years. Short-term patches will not put a dent \nin that work plan. Additionally, it is important to cut bureaucratic \nred tape that will speed up permitting and ensure that our Nation gets \nmore roads, more bridges, more rail projects and other infrastructure \ndevelopments for every dollar that we invest.\n  Over the past couple of months, I have worked diligently on my \ncommittees and with the Environment and Public Works Committee in a \nbipartisan manner to include a variety of Nevada and national safety \npriorities in the highway bill, which are included in the Senate bill \nthat we will vote on today.\n  First and foremost of those priorities is the expansion of Interstate \n11 to northern Nevada. I have been working for years with my colleagues \nin both the Nevada and Arizona delegations on Capitol Hill to move I-11 \nforward. In the 112th Congress, we were successful in including \nlanguage in the last highway bill, MAP-21, to officially designate an \ninterstate route connecting Phoenix and Las Vegas. These are the two \nlargest cities that are not connected by an interstate highway system.\n  Let me say that again, Mr. President. Phoenix and Las Vegas are the \ntwo largest cities in America that are not connected with an interstate \nhighway system.\n  I have been working diligently to extend the proposed highway to I-80 \nin northern Nevada. Earlier this year, I introduced the bipartisan, \nbicameral Intermountain West Corridor Development Act to extend the \nroute north and worked with Chairman Inhofe to include it in the DRIVE \nAct. This full north-to-south, Canada-to-Mexico interstate system is a \nproject of national significance, critical for our Nation's mobility, \neconomy, and national defense. This extension will open even more \nmarkets for tourism and trade, create jobs and improve the economy for \nthe entire Western United States.\n  I have also worked to include policies in the bill that will greatly \nbenefit the Lake Tahoe region's transportation efforts. The Tahoe Basin \nis a unique area, shared by the States of Nevada and California but \nalso heavily controlled by the Federal Government. In fact, the Feds \nare the largest land managers of the Lake Tahoe Basin, controlling 77 \npercent of the land. Under current law, Tahoe is not considered as one \narea, from a transportation perspective, because the size of Lake Tahoe \nseparates the individual communities that surround the lake.\n\n  The growing tourism industry greatly benefits the local economy but \nalso poses additional strains on the region's transportation system. \nThe language included in both the EPW and banking titles ensures the \npopulation of California and Nevada communities surrounding the lake is \nconsidered a singular entity. This will greatly benefit local leaders \nas they seek additional resources to implement the Basin's innovative \n21st century highway and transit plans.\n  As a member of the commerce committee, I also worked with Chairman \nThune on the Comprehensive Transportation and Consumer Protection Act, \nwhich was approved earlier this month in our committee and is also part \nof this bill. It includes important reforms that will enhance the \nsafety of our roads and our railways.\n  I am pleased legislation I introduced with my friend from \nMassachusetts Senator Markey, Safety Through Informed Consumers Act, \ncommonly referred to as the STICRS Act, was included in the commerce \nbill. This policy promotes the purchase of safer cars by requiring the \nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration to integrate crash \navoidance technology information, such as active braking and lane \ntracking technology, onto the safety ratings listed on your car's \nstickers.\n  Consumers have a right to the most accurate and up-to-date \ninformation possible when making decisions on what cars to purchase. A \nseparate five-star rating for crash avoidance technologies or an \nadjustment to the current rating system that would preclude a new car \nfrom getting five stars unless it has at least one of these new crash \navoidance technologies will make it clear to every buyer whether the \nvehicle they are considering has the latest and the best in safety \ntechnology.\n  Senator Schatz and I have also teamed up on a safe streets amendment, \naimed at improving pedestrian safety. Threats to pedestrian safety are \nincreasingly becoming a problem in my State. The number of pedestrian \nfatalities has nearly doubled in the Silver State in just the last 3 \nyears. In total, pedestrian fatalities are nearly one-quarter of our \noverall traffic fatalities. Nevada is the sixth most dangerous for \npedestrians over the age of 65 years. I know our State regional \ntransportation organizations are working diligently to address the \npedestrian safety concerns. I hope our initiative will spur innovative \ntransportation planning throughout the Nation that aims to improve bike \nand pedestrian safety.\n  Finally, I had a provision included in the bill that restores some \nsanity to the Department of Transportation's hours of service \nregulation. Under the existing rule, drivers of commercial motor \nvehicles are required to take a 30-minute break after most 8 hours of \nconsecutive work. Industries such as\n\n[[Page S6154]]\n\nthe ready mixed concrete industry, whose products are perishable, find \nit difficult to implement the HOS regulation given the unique \nconditions of their work.\n  Concrete is needed on a just-in-time basis. Once a delivery is \nstarted, it must be completed or the concrete may harden in the truck, \ncausing thousands of dollars of damage in that vehicle. Concrete \ndelivery often takes more than 2\\1/2\\ hours to complete. Mixer drivers \nare also unique in the commercial truckdriving industry, in that they \ntypically spend only 40 percent of their time on duty actually driving. \nThe other 60 percent is spent at the plant waiting to be dispatched, at \nthe job site waiting on the contractor to receive the concrete or \nunloading the concrete itself. This one-size-fits-all regulation does \nnot make sense. I am pleased my provision making this existing \nadministrative exemption for perishable goods permanent has been \nincluded in the commerce bill.\n  I would be remiss if I did not mention some important rail \ninfrastructure policies also included in the commerce bill. Freight \nrail plays a major role in Nevada's economy. The Silver State has 1,192 \nmiles of rail track, and nearly 43 million tons of freight moves \nthrough the State each year via rail, supporting over 700 high-paying \njobs. I was proud to team up with my friends Senator Blunt and Senator \nBooker on two stand-alone proposals that are in the rail title.\n  First, the Track, Railroad, and Infrastructure Network Act, which \nstreamlines permitting for the development of new railroad structure, \nis critical to ensure scant infrastructure dollars are spent \nefficiently and spent wisely. Additionally, the Railroad Infrastructure \nFinancing Improvement Act implements a variety of good government \nreforms to the revolving loan program utilized to spur development of \nrailroad infrastructure. The program is notoriously underutilized. I \nbelieve it is important that we ensure this valuable tool is reworked \nso it can be used for new freight and passenger rail development.\n  I strongly supported the rail reform title when it was approved by \nthe commerce committee and believe it is important that we include rail \nas part of the surface transportation bill. Improving rail safety, \nexpanding both passenger and freight rail infrastructure are critical \ncomponents of Nevada's and our Nation's long-term economic development \nplans. A long-term surface and transportation bill is extremely \nimportant to the State of Nevada and also to our Nation.\n  Transportation efficiency and reliability is critical for our \nNation's economic competitiveness, and the policies in the bill will \nhelp address the need to maintain, repair, and expand the national \ntransportation system, but none of these important policies will get \ndone if Congress kicks the can down the road.\n  Passing a strong multiyear bill in the Senate sends an important \nmessage to our colleagues in the House. I urge my colleagues to support \nthe DRIVE Act. Again, I thank Leader McConnell and Chairmen Inhofe, \nSenators Thune, Shelby, and Hatch for working with me on my priorities. \nThey know how important it is that we enact policies that increase \ninfrastructure efficiency, improve safety, and create jobs throughout \nthe Nation. By passing this bill, we show the American people the \nSenate is back to work supporting policies to create jobs and spur \neconomic development across our Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n             Private Sector Engineering and Design Services\n\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with the distinguished chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee on an amendment that I have filed to H.R. 22, the DRIVE \nAct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, as the chairman of the committee is well \naware, private sector engineering and design services can play an \nimportant role in the development and maintenance of our Nation's \ntransportation infrastructure. By supplementing the capabilities of \nengineers at State DOTs, private sector engineering and design services \nenable State and local governments to deliver projects more efficiently \nand with long-term cost savings.\n  In order to make better use of these private sector resources, I have \nintroduced an amendment which will provide incentives to States that \nmake use of innovative engineering and design approaches by bringing in \nthe expertise of private sector companies. This amendment is intended \nto streamline and improve the efficient delivery of highway and bridge \nprojects and would not increase Federal spending. In the last Congress, \nworking with Senators Boxer and Vitter, the committee included this \nidentical provision in the highway authorization bill that was \nunanimously approved by the Environment and Public Works Committee.\n  The language has not been included in the bill we are debating today, \nand while I recognize that many hard decisions have had to be made in \norder to achieve a bipartisan consensus on this bill, I ask for \nChairman Inhofe's commitment to work with us as the DRIVE Act \nprogresses to conference.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator for raising this issue and for his \ncommitment to helping to pass a long-term surface transportation bill. \nThe Senator is correct about the time constraints the Senate is under, \nas we must pass this bill before July 31. Unfortunately, that means we \nhave been unable to include many worthy provisions in the DRIVE Act, \nsuch as his amendment, which I support as a means of improving the \nefficient delivery of Federal taxpayer dollars.\n  I share the Senator's enthusiasm for fostering the use of private \nsector expertise in transportation construction. While this expertise \nis useful at all times, it is particularly useful in the aftermath of \nnatural disasters, when a State must act quickly to rebuild its \ninfrastructure. This is something we are very familiar with in my home \nState of Oklahoma.\n  I thank the Senator from Arkansas for his leadership on this issue \nand he has my commitment that I will work with the Senator on this \nmatter during our bipartisan conference negotiations with the House.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. I thank the distinguished chairman for taking a moment \nto discuss this issue and I look forward to working with him on this \nbill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate will approve a \ncomprehensive, 6-year authorization for our Nation's transportation \nsystems. It will give our States and local communities the ability to \nplan for investments in the critical infrastructure that supports our \ncities and towns, enables inter- and intrastate commerce, and creates \njobs for American workers.\n  This bill is far from perfect; I have strong concerns about the lack \nof safety measures in this bill. The battle on whether to allow mammoth \ntractor trailer trucks--the equivalent of wheeled eight-story \nbuildings--to drive alongside all the other motorists on some of our \nroads will come up again in the fall and so I will continue to fight to \nput safety first. I am concerned that this bill will undermine the \ngoals of the National Environmental Policy Act. And I am concerned \nthat, while we have before us a needed 6-year authorization, this \ntransportation bill is funded only through 2018. I hope that as the \nSenate and the House conference a long-term transportation \nauthorization bill, these concerns will be adequately addressed.\n  It is regrettable that some in Congress, for several years now, have \ndone their utmost to undermine what used to be strong bipartisan \nsupport for responsible and timely reauthorizations and funding of the \nhighway trust fund and our transportation infrastructure. The result \nhas been a continuing era of stop-gap, short-term fixes, which hobble \nState and local transportation planning and which impose unending \nuncertainty on their vital work. How short-sighted, and how \nirresponsible. We must get back to that kind of consensus, and that \nkind of forward-thinking action.\n  A series of short-term patches do not provide States like Vermont--\nwhere the construction season is short, and the infrastructure needs \nare many--with the certainty they need to make needed repairs to the \nbridges, roads and byways that keep business moving and connect our \nrural towns and villages. This legislation, however, is the result of \ncompromise on all sides. This bill protects the MAP-21 funding formula, \nwhich will benefit Vermont and maintain a level stream of Federal \nfunding\n\n[[Page S6155]]\n\nfor Vermont. I am also pleased the bill includes a 20 percent revenue \nprovision dedicated to highway and transit growth, despite previous \nattempts to decrease it to 6 percent. I am also gratified that, in \nworking with the relevant committee chairs, we were able in this final \nbill to remove unnecessary and harmful exemptions to the Freedom of \nInformation Act, which remains the public's first line of defense in \nthe right to know what their government is doing. Nowhere is the free \nflow of information more important than when the safety and wellbeing \nof every Vermonter--of every American--is at stake.\n  The House of Representatives now has an opportunity. They can kick \nthe can down the road, beyond this year, or they can get to work, to \ndevise a meaningful, reasonable long-term transportation authorization \nbill. Short-term authorizations will not adequately address our \nNation's crumbling infrastructure. After investing billions of dollars \nin infrastructure development overseas, it is well past time to invest \nright here at home, in our own people and their communities, and in our \nown country. We need this certainty, and we need it now.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I support the bipartisan DRIVE Act \nbecause we can't make the perfect the enemy of the good. This bill will \nprovide 3 years of funding and stability to States that want to plan \nmajor multiyear construction projects. This means badly needed jobs in \nconstruction for labor unions, contractors, engineers, and \nmanufacturers of transportation materials. This is good news.\n  According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, Maryland's \ninfrastructure has a C- rating. Our roads and transit have a C- rating \nand our bridges a B- rating. Nearly a quarter of Maryland's major \nroadways are in poor condition and 317 of our 5,291 bridges are \nstructurally deficient.\n  In addition, Marylanders face some of the worst traffic congestion in \nthe Nation. I commute every day from Baltimore to Washington and know \nhow bad it has become. The Washington region is the No. 1 most \ncongested area in the Nation and the Baltimore region is the fifth. \nThese conditions cost Maryland's commuters between $1,200 and $1,500 \nper year.\n  We need at least $4 billion to replace the B and Howard Street \ntunnels in Baltimore. If we want to double stack these major rail \narteries for the Port of Baltimore, we need $8 billion.\n  In 2013, the State of Maryland was forced to pass a gas tax. Sadly, \ntoday our statewide transportation needs still remain unmet. If we add \nup every Maryland county's No. 1 transportation priority, it equals $20 \nbillion. Yet, we still have competing job corridor needs in the urban \nand rural parts of the State.\n  That is why I was hoping for a more substantial bill--a true shot in \nthe arm to tackle our aging infrastructure and ease congestion. But I \nwill vote for the DRIVE Act because doing nothing is unacceptable and \nshort-term extensions do not provide the planning and funding certainty \nStates need to put millions of workers on the job. These are jobs in \nconstruction, engineering, and manufacturing right here in the United \nStates.\n  Bright spots in this bill for Maryland include the new formula-based \nfreight program. These additional dollars will help the class I \nrailroads in Maryland, CSX and Norfolk Southern, and our short line \nrailroads. It also is good news for the operations at the Port of \nBaltimore.\n  I also appreciate the strengthened transit safety oversight role of \nthe U.S. Department of Transportation for the Nation's metro systems. \nWhile I would have liked the Metro Senators' stronger amendment to be \ndebated and adopted, the underlying bill is a good step in the right \ndirection for safety. Safety is our collective No. 1 priority for the \nriders and workers of the Washington Metro system.\n  The bill gives the Secretary of Transportation the authority to \nestablish minimum safety standards for the safe operations of metro \nsystems. This builds upon what I was able to accomplish in MAP-21 \nworking with Senators Dodd, Shelby, and Menendez. We gave the \ndepartment new authority to establish and enforce Federal safety \nstandards focusing on railcars.\n  The bill also requires the Secretary to review the existing safety \nstandards and protocols of metro systems. It requires a report to \nCongress with the findings, list of recommendations, needed legislative \nchanges, and the action the Secretary will take to establish Federal \nsafety standards.\n  Before I conclude, I would like to voice my disappointment that the \nDRIVE Act is not stronger on safety. I am a cosponsor of the Feinstein-\nWicker amendment on double 33 truck trailers. Because of the \nparliamentary procedures to prevent consideration of amendments, \nincluding germane amendments, this amendment was not considered.\n  I am opposed to extending the length of double truck trailers. The \nState of Maryland prohibits operation of these trucks. I have heard \nfrom Maryland families who have lost loved ones in truck crashes. The \nSlattery family lost Mrs. Slattery and the crash left their son, \nMatthew, with severe brain damage. Mr. Slattery and Matthew came to the \nAppropriations Committee markup of the fiscal year 2016 Transportation, \nHousing and Urban Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill. \nSadly, this same amendment failed by a tie vote of 15 to 15.\n  I also heard from Don Bowman, owner of D.M. Bowman, Incorporated, a \nfamily-owned trucking company in Williamsport, MD, and our State's fire \nservice community. They all think double 33 truck trailers are a \ndangerous idea.\n  I commend Senator Boxer for her hard work on this bill. Passing this \nbill is the right thing to do for jobs and our economy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I do appreciate the comments from the \nSenator from Nevada. It is a reminder that a lot of people think almost \nall of this act is from the Environment and Public Works Committee. \nAbout 75 percent is, but we do have the commerce committee, we have the \nbanking committee, and the other provisions. A lot of people have been \nworking on this, not just our committee.\n  I am glad we got a good vote yesterday. I think it is important that \nwe have a strong vote because we certainly want to encourage the \nHouse--and I think the House will be taking up our bill. In fact, I \nthink a lot of the staff people are working on that right now over on \nthe other side. Anyway, the importance of this is significant. If we do \nnot pass the DRIVE Act out of this Chamber, then what we are doing is \nreinforcing current law.\n  What is current law? Current law is short-term extensions. That means \nit is the worst possible outcome. It means no big projects, for one \nthing. We spent yesterday--most of the day yesterday, our comments were \non the big projects, the big bridges, and those things that need to be \ndone.\n  But the big projects--normally you are talking about between $700 \nmillion and $1.4 billion. They can't be done on short-term extensions. \nLogically, everybody knows that. They are not done. Our problem is, the \nlast bill we passed was in 2005. It ran out in 2009. Since that time, \nit has been short-term extensions. So we have not gotten into any of \nthe projects that have to be done.\n  The tendency, I guess, to do the hard things, is to wait until \nsomething collapses and a bunch of people die, such as happened in \nMinnesota. That could have been done before. That was done in the 2005 \nact in my State of Oklahoma, however, not until after a young lady was \ndriving her car under one of our bridges and a bunch of concrete fell \noff and killed her, the mother of three children.\n  Why wait until a disaster occurs? The current law fails to provide \nthe long-term certainties the States and cities are going to have to \nhave on their big projects to get them off the ground. Current law \nfunding has no growth, not even for inflation. The DRIVE Act provides \ngrowth in highway and transit programs to each State. The current law \ngives States and local governments no certainty. There have been 33 \nshort-term extensions since the SAFETEA-LU bill was passed--that is 33. \nWhen you pass those extensions, as I said, it takes 30 percent off the \ntop. Clearly, the conservative position is to have a long-term bill. \nYou would not have the project delivery. The DRIVE Act eliminates the \nduplicative review\n\n[[Page S6156]]\n\nand expands categorical exclusions. We cannot do that with short-term \nextensions.\n  Transparency. That was a lot of work. What we don't want is, as we \nare spending money as the years go by and the months go by and the \nweeks go by--we have transparency built into this so people can have \nfaith and know exactly what programs there are.\n  Innovation. The DRIVE Act prepares our Nation's transportation system \nfor the future by promoting innovation across all aspects of the \nprogram. The transportation system will be stuck in reverse if we stick \nwith the current law. The current law, now this is what we have been \ndoing since 2009.\n  I think it is also worthwhile for us to keep in mind that there are \nsome things I wanted in the bill that we could not get in. I wanted to \nchange this 80-20 Federal match program. First of all, we had 60-40--\nthat was not acceptable--and 70-30. I have to admit it was not the \nDemocrats; it was the Republicans who objected to that. \nConsequentially, we had to go ahead and go back to 80-20. If this \nlegislation does not pass, then it is still going to be 80-20 because \nthat is current law. So that would not change.\n  Anyway, the freight section of this directs new funding toward \nfreight transportation projects that provide the platform for our \nbusinesses to compete globally. The freight program sometimes does not \nget the attention. One of the good things about a transportation bill \nand the way we do this, and have done it historically, is we go to the \nStates.\n  I can assure you that the Arizona Transportation Department knows a \nlot more about what their needs are than we do in our infinite wisdom \nhere in Washington. So they don't get as concerned about freight \nprograms and freight expenditures because they do not directly benefit \nthe particular State it goes through, but they benefit the entire \ncountry.\n  We actually have a freight section in this that is very good. It \nhasn't been done before. I will go into greater detail about the new \nNational Freight Program and what it means to America's economy. Today, \nthe National Highway System carries more than 55 percent of the \nNation's highway traffic and 97 percent of the truck freight traffic. \nOf the 4 million miles of public roads, the National Highway System \nrepresents only 5.5 percent. So what we are saying is, 5 percent of the \nroads out there transport 55 percent of the highway traffic and 97 \npercent of the freight traffic.\n  Americans depend on the well-maintained National Highway System that \nprovides a critical connection between the urban areas and the rural \nareas. American businesses pay and estimate $27 billion a year in extra \nfreight transportation costs due to the poor condition of the public \nroads, which increases shipping delays and raises prices on everyday \nproducts. Recognizing that this is the foundation for the Nation's \neconomy and the key to the national ability to compete in a global \neconomy, it is essential that we focus efforts to improve freight \nmovement on the National Highway System.\n  The DRIVE Act includes two new programs to help the States deliver \nprojects and promote the safety in that delivery. The bipartisan \nfreight program levies its Federal investment by encouraging public-\nprivate partnerships and other creative financing approaches.\n  It also will create the first-ever freight-specific investment \nprogram, prioritizing investment in our commerce-moving network. The \nfirst new program is the National Freight Program. It is distributed by \na formula that will provide funds to all States to enhance the movement \nof goods that go through their State.\n  This is something, as I have said, that has not been done before, and \nI haven't heard any objection. In fact, this isn't just State specific \nbecause this goes to the whole Nation, and so it is very popular. The \nprogram expands the flexibility for both rural and urban areas to \ndesignate key freight corridors, and it will help identify projects \nwith a higher return on investment.\n  The second program that is new is the Assistance for Major Projects \nProgram. It creates a competitive grant program to provide funds for \nthe major projects. This is what we have been talking about the past \nseveral days, the very large projects that can't be done with short-\nterm extensions. They are just neglected.\n  These new freight programs will only exist with the passage of the \nDRIVE Act, when it is enacted by Congress. It is time for us to become \ninnovative and forward-thinking in how the Federal Government is using \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  In talking about this type of program for States to improve the \nNational Highway System, the DRIVE Act is the answer. It directly helps \nto relieve the freight bottlenecks around the country.\n  This is a chart of Chicago I-290, I-90, and I-94, the three \nintersections. This goes between those three. Look at it. It is all of \nthese. I haven't even counted the lanes. Traffic is stopped, and it is \njust one of the congestions. When this happens, the average speed in \nthis case is 29 miles an hour. In the morning and evening rush hour, it \nis 20 miles an hour. Then it talks about all of the pollution that is \nthere. People are idling their engines while they are waiting in \ntraffic.\n  There is a very similar situation in Houston, TX, the I-45. I have \nbeen on this one quite often, quite a few times. It is I-45 at U.S. 59. \nIf you look at the chart, it is home to five of the top freight \nbottlenecks in the Nation. Texas is home to nine of them. The overall \ncost in conjunction with this to individuals in Texas is $671 million \nannually and 8.8 million hours of delay. The I-45 is ranked third by \nthe congestion index.\n  We have an index, and people know how bad it is and how it compares \nto other States. That is why this has been so popular.\n  I-45 at U.S. 610 is ranked 15th. The average speed is below 39 miles \nan hour. For morning and evening traffic, of course, it is much less \nthan that.\n  Fort Lee, NJ, I-95. Anyone who is in Washington and wants to go \nanyplace on the north coast--New York, Connecticut, and on up--they \nhave to go all the way up on I-95. This particular intersection, which \nis in Fort Lee--this is the George Washington Bridge. It connects Fort \nLee, NJ, to New York City. By congestion index, it is the second worst \nfreight bottleneck in the Nation. The average speed is 29 miles an \nhour. I have been on that one before, and it is a very old bridge. When \nyou drive over it, you worry about whether you are going to make it. \nThe George Washington Bridge is the world's busiest motor vehicle \nbridge, carrying over 106 million cars a year.\n  The DRIVE Act, with the newly formed freight program, will make \ntargeted investments in the infrastructure critical to moving commerce \nand alleviating these bottlenecks I just mentioned. These new programs \ninvest in the infrastructure needed to move goods across the Nation.\n  When you look at the corridors and you look at the bridges--we \nactually had one presentation where we went over the 20 busiest of all \nthe traffic-congested areas in the country.\n  We are going to have a vote in 40 minutes. It is going to be one of \nthe most critical votes of the year. I have no doubt that it is going \nto pass. But I wanted to send the signal across America, to the House \nof Representatives, and to everyone else that we really care about \ninfrastructure.\n  I repeat--I feel compelled to do so--there are a lot of people who \ndon't realize that the conservative position is to vote for a long-term \ninfrastructure bill because it costs about 30 percent off the top--and \nthat is a figure no one has debated, no one has talked about--if you do \nit piecemeal with short-term extensions, along with not getting this.\n  The other thing is, we have that old document nobody reads anymore; \nit is called the Constitution. If you look up article I, section 8, it \nsays--you know, we do a lot of things around this Chamber that our \nforefathers never envisioned. They said what we ought to be doing--and \nit says so right in the Constitution--is two things: defend America, \nand roads and bridges.\n  Well, that was foreseen by Dwight Eisenhower. I have here in the \nChamber a picture of Dwight Eisenhower. Many of us who are old enough \nto remember or those of us who have studied World War II know what a \nhero this guy was when he came in as President of the United States. He \nwanted the first national system to be primarily for defense, for \ndefending our Nation. He said: Yes, it will help the economy. Here is \nthe quote he makes. He talks\n\n[[Page S6157]]\n\nabout how this will be helpful to the economy. We all know that. There \nwill be jobs, and people will be put back to work. But he also said--\nthis was after World War II--that we have to move our goods and \nservices around this country to defend this Nation.\n  I kind of have a dual role in this. The two major committees that I \nhave--and I have served as the ranking member on both of them--are the \ndefense committee, the Senate Armed Services Committee--and so I am \nvery sensitive to the fact that there is a defense component to this \nbill we are going to be voting on today--as well as chairing the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  This is what he said back then. He said it is for defense purposes \nand it is something we have to have so that it goes in a uniform way \nacross the Nation, not just for defense but for our economy. I would \nmake one comment. You hear people say, and I used to say it myself--\nthey talk about the program called devolution. Devolution is what a lot \nof people have looked at, and it sounds so good on the stump. \nConfession is good for the soul. I remember when I was the father of \ndevolution, along with Connie Mack from Florida when we were both \nserving in the House. What that says is you repeal the Federal highway \ntaxes and then you make them local taxes, you make them State taxes so \nthe States are participating.\n  But there are two problems with that. One is, how do you get a \nuniform program across the country? Take Wyoming, for example. If they \nrepeal their Federal tax, in order to make up for it, since there are \nvery few people in Wyoming but there are a lot of roads, they would \nhave to pass a 48-cent tax increase. That is not going to happen. \nDevolution is based on the assumption that all States will pass a tax \nincrease, and that isn't going to happen.\n  So that is the other reason we really need to have this, and we will. \nWe are going to pass this bill. I think in the final analysis the House \nwill too.\n  I will share with you, I say to the Presiding Officer, that when we \nhad our last bill, it wasn't all that good. It was only a 27-month \nbill.\n  I can remember going over there, after we passed that on the floor of \nthe Senate, and I requested an audience with the members of the \nTransportation and Infrastructure Committee at the House, with the \nRepublicans because there were a lot of them who were tea party \nRepublicans, a lot of conservatives. I explained to them the same thing \nI just went over--the constitutional aspect of it as well as the cost \nof it and the fact that you cannot get projects done if you continue to \ndo short-term extensions. When this came up in the House, every one of \nthe 33 Republicans--all 33 of them--voted for it. I think that is what \ngives me confidence that when they see that there is a bill that we \nhave passed out of this Chamber--you know, I was disappointed that the \nHouse was only going to be in session until Thursday; that is today. \nBut they left last night; they moved it up a day. And I am not saying \nthey did that so they wouldn't have to make a decision on this bill, \nbut nonetheless that did happen.\n  I understand there are other Senators who wish to speak before the \nvote, and I certainly want to give them the opportunity. So I will \nconclude by saying that this is arguably one of the most important \nvotes we will have. We are doing what the Constitution tells us to do. \nWe are going to pass it, and it is going to happen.\n  I know there are two Members--one from the majority and one from the \nminority--who wish to speak. I think the majority leader will be coming \nin a matter of minutes too. So we do have several who want to be heard \non this bill.\n  I think it is worth stating that 75 percent of the bill is in the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works. That is the committee I \nchair. When we developed this bill, we developed it over a period of \ntime. They took about 4 months, and we worked on it. We took \namendments, and we had major changes. In fact, I can remember going to \nthe Republican conference and saying: If you have amendments, before \nthis is passed out of our committee and goes to the floor, I think it \nis important for you to get your amendments in so we can make them a \npart of the bill and then later on part of the managers' package. Well, \nthe managers' package didn't work as we wanted it to, and everyone \nknows there are problems that caused that.\n  But we argued. We discussed this bill. We put it together for about 4 \nmonths in the committee. On June 24, we passed that out of the \ncommittee unanimously. All 20 members of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee--all Democrats, all Republicans--all voted for it. That \ndoesn't happen very often.\n  The ranking member, the ranking Democrat on the committee is Senator \nBoxer from California. Senator Boxer and I don't agree on very much, \nbut we do agree on this. I mean, she is a very proud liberal, and I am \na very proud conservative. What we have in common is this bill; that is \nabout it. As soon as this bill is over--I was joking with a group this \nmorning--I said then we will go back to fighting again. Maybe that is \nmore fun.\n  But with all of the problems we have in this country right now, a lot \nof people don't realize that one of the greatest problems is the \noverregulation by the bureaucracies, the unelected bureaucracies. We \nhave watched that coming. We have seen it particularly in this \nadministration. Just look at what the EPA is doing to harm businesses \nthat are trying to do the American thing and hire people out there. We \nhave all of these regulations that are coming online. We have the water \nregulations.\n  This is kind of interesting because historically the regulations over \nwater have always been a State function, with the exception of \nnavigable waters. Well, I understand that. I think everyone else \nunderstands that. But there are always the collectivists, the liberals \nwho want to bring all of that power into Washington and take it away \nfrom the States. In my State of Oklahoma, we do a lot better job than \nthe Federal Government does, so we have been in a position to be able \nto continue to have that regulation of water as a State function.\n  About 5 years ago, Senator Feingold in the Senate and Congressman \nOberstar--they are from Wisconsin and Minnesota--introduced a bill to \ntake the word ``navigable'' out, which means then the Federal \nGovernment would have regulation over all the waters. We have areas in \nOklahoma that are very arid. The other day, I was out in the panhandle, \nBoise City. You don't get anyplace drier than Boise City, OK. I was out \nthere and I told them that if the Federal Government were doing this, \nthey would probably find the time after a rain to declare the panhandle \nof Oklahoma a wetland because that is what they do. They want power. \nThey want to expand their authority.\n  Anyway, they had this bill, and not only did we defeat the \nlegislation to take the word ``navigable'' out, but we also defeated \nboth the Senator and the House Member who were the sponsors.\n  I see my good friend from New York has arrived.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                           Planned Parenthood\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise to strongly oppose this \ncynical and opportunistic ploy to fulfill a longtime ideological goal \nto defund Planned Parenthood.\n  Let's talk facts, not rhetoric. The fact is no Federal funds can be \nused for an abortion. No Federal funds can be used for an abortion, \nexcept in the dire circumstances of rape, incest or the life of the \nmother.\n  Here is another fact. Only 3 percent of Planned Parenthood's work is \ndedicated to abortion services. The other 97 percent of their work is \ndedicated to preventive women's health services, such as STD testing \nand screenings, contraception, Pap tests, breast exams, cancer \nscreenings, and other services, such as adoption referrals, pediatric \ncare, and immunizations. So when someone says let's defund Planned \nParenthood because they never liked that it ever existed, what they are \nsaying to women, particularly low-income women, women in low-income \ncommunities, and many women of color is that they won't have access to \na wide range of essential services because of an ideological desire to \ncontrol what choices are being made by women and their doctors.\n  I fail to see the logic here. This exploitative movement, advanced by \nspecial interests, would effectively tell a\n\n[[Page S6158]]\n\nhalf million American women: Sorry, you can't have a breast exam this \nyear. Of all the issues that we are going to debate on the floor right \nnow, why are we debating this? Why are we telling 400,000 American \nwomen: Sorry, you won't be able to have a lifesaving screening for \ncervical cancer.\n  We have kids in all 50 States who are going hungry during summer \nvacation because their parents can't afford to have that extra lunch \nthey normally got from school. We have college graduates who can't \nafford to start their lives, buy a home, get married, and have kids \nbecause they are drowning in student debt. We have men and women in \nthis country who work 40 hours a week, with no vacation days, no sick \ndays, and are still stuck in poverty. That is not my vision of the \nAmerican Dream.\n  We have millions of hard-working Americans who have to quit their \njobs and lose paychecks every time they have a family emergency. It \ndoesn't matter if it is a new baby. It doesn't matter if their husband \nis dying of cancer. It doesn't matter if their mother is on her \ndeathbed. They don't have access to paid family and medical leave. We \nare literally the only industrialized country that doesn't have paid \nleave.\n  This makes no sense in a country that believes if you work hard every \nday, you will be able to get into the middle class. That is simply not \ntrue for low-wage workers who are working 40 hours a week and are still \nbelow the poverty line and cannot meet those family needs because they \nhave no paid leave.\n  But the issue this body wants to debate is defunding Planned \nParenthood. This body wants to make sure that millions of women don't \nget basic access to health care. Whether or not to maliciously hurt an \norganization that provides vital health services to millions of \nAmerican women--this is the issue our colleagues are using to threaten \nyet another government shutdown--controlling women's choices about \ntheir health, about their families, about their reproductive health \ncare.\n  It is clear that some of my colleagues just want to roll back Roe v. \nWade. That is their goal. That is their mission in life. It is \nideologically driven and funded by special interests. That is their \nmission. But we should not return to the days when women had no medical \nindependence.\n  Some of my colleagues will use any excuse they can to overreact and \nforce this same tired old Planned Parenthood debate on us. But here is \nthe fundamental truth about Planned Parenthood. Millions of women in \nthis country--women in low-income communities, women of color, women in \nevery State--rely on Planned Parenthood for basic health care--\nmammograms, cervical screenings, access to contraception, and family \nplanning. They rely on it to prevent disease. They rely on it to detect \ndisease. They rely on it to treat disease. We cannot and will not \ndefund Planned Parenthood.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, over the last couple of weeks we have been \ndiscussing some pretty basic and important work that we need to do when \nit comes to our Nation's infrastructure--specifically, the highway bill \nthat we will vote on and pass out of the Senate today.\n  I am very encouraged by the fact that the House of Representatives \nhas now taken up the challenge of coming up with their own highway \nbill, and we are going to pass a 3-month temporary extension to give \nthem the chance to do that and then to give all of us a chance to get \nto a conference committee and come up, hopefully, with an even better \nbill.\n  That is the way the Senate and the House are supposed to work, and \nthat is why I am encouraged. I think the debate we have had over the \nhighway bill is a good one, and I am glad to see, as I say, that we are \non the right track.\n  In my State of Texas we know that good infrastructure and a working \nhighway system are important for a number of reasons. First, it is \nimportant for public safety. Second, it is important for the \nenvironment. Third, it is important for the economy because when goods \ncan flow freely across the roads and the highways and the freight lines \nin our State, it helps improve our economy and creates a more favorable \ncondition for jobs.\n  When you come from a State such as mine, which is a fast-growing \nState, that growth requires the improvements, repairs, and \nmodernization of our roadways to accommodate the visitors who come to \nour State, as well as those who move there--some 1,000 more each day. \nSo that is why I am pleased this legislation will include resources \nthat will make the lives of everyday Texans better.\n  Resources in this bill--which I should stress involves no tax \nincreases--invest in interstates and freight routes and provide for \nmuch-needed border infrastructure projects to promote legitimate trade \nand travel flowing across our international border, while supporting \neconomic development and improved quality of life.\n\n\n                           Work in the Senate\n\n  This bill is just another reminder of the Senate's progress we have \nmade in the 114th Congress under new management. This year, the Senate \nhas made a lot of progress on key pieces of legislation. The fact is we \nare finally back working again in a bipartisan manner that provides \nreal solutions for the American people.\n  I am proud to say that work includes things on a wide spectrum of \npriorities, including passing a budget for the first time since 2009, \nlegislation that fights the scourge of human trafficking, a trade bill \nthat will open up new markets for American-made products, and of course \nearlier this year, the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, which was \nsigned into law and freezes the administration's ability to lift \nsanctions on Iran until representatives of the American people have had \na chance to carefully examine President Obama's deal.\n  As I mentioned a number of times, I have many concerns about this \ndeal, and I will continue to remind the President of his own words when \nhe said that no deal is better than a bad deal. I couldn't agree more, \neven though he and the rest of the administration are actively \nsuggesting that the only real alternative to this deal is war--a \nstatement which is demonstrably false.\n  I think, unfortunately, that is a scare tactic. I hope people of \ngoodwill will be persuaded by the facts and not scare tactics, and I \nhope we will have that debate in September after all the Members of the \nSenate and the House have had a chance to thoroughly immerse themselves \nin the terms of this deal and are prepared to debate that on the floor \nof the Senate and on the floor of the House.\n  But our work is not over. Earlier this week, I cosponsored \nlegislation, along with a number of my colleagues, which would provide \nadditional money for women's primary health care services while at the \nsame time defunding Planned Parenthood. I know I speak for many of my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle when I say I was shocked, \nsaddened, and disgusted at the several recent videos that depicted \nhuman life being reduced to spare parts for sale. This is a \nheartbreaking practice, and we cannot let it stand. We must stand up to \nprotect the most vulnerable.\n  This bill does that by defunding Planned Parenthood, which has made a \npractice of taking aborted children and then selling the body parts for \ncompensation. The one reason why this is so important is that, beyond \nthe immediate disgust at these videos in the way that somehow this \ntrafficking in human body parts has become a commercialized practice \nthat Planned Parenthood engages in, since 1976 there has actually been \na prohibition in U.S. law against the use of tax dollars to pay for \nabortion, except in some rare circumstances, and that is known as the \nHyde amendment, named after Congressman Henry Hyde. This has been part \nof the law of the land since 1976.\n  What Planned Parenthood has done is taken tax dollars and claimed \nthey have separated those tax dollars from the privately raised money \nthey use that then finances abortion. They say: Well, we use the tax \ndollars for women's health services, and we don't use any tax dollars \nto pay for abortions. Well, we all know that is a convenient fiction, \nbecause money is fungible. The tax dollars paid by you, me, and all of \nus in the United States who are taxpayers goes into a single fund that\n\n[[Page S6159]]\n\npays for the operation of Planned Parenthood--the largest abortion \nprovider in America.\n  So this legislation is very important because it does take care of \nthe primary care women's health services, but it defunds Planned \nParenthood's abortion practice, consistent with the Hyde amendment, \nwhich has been the law of the land since 1976.\n  By doing it in this way, I would say that we are actually improving \nand increasing access for women to health care services through places \nsuch as our community health clinics. In my State alone, there are \nalmost eight times more community health centers that could provide \nthese primary care services to women than there are Planned Parenthood \noutlets. So this actually will increase access to primary care for \nwomen, while defunding Planned Parenthood's abortion practice, \nconsistent with the Hyde amendment.\n  I hope this is legislation we can all unite behind. I would implore \nall of our colleagues, when we vote on this next Monday afternoon, to \njoin us in getting on the bill by voting for cloture and then debating \nit and passing it.\n  While I am glad Congress has a clear way forward to meet our Nation's \ninfrastructure needs on this bill, we have a lot more we need to do to \nprotect and serve the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, just one quick comment before Senator \nBoxer makes some remarks.\n  We have talked about this. We have talked about the significance of \nthe upcoming vote. I just want to reemphasize to my conservative \ncolleagues on the Republican side that this is something which is a \nconservative position. The only alternative to this is short-term \nextensions, which cost about 30 percent off the top.\n  So let's do in this vote what the Constitution tells us to do and \ntake care of one of the two assignments that are given to us in article \nI, section 8 of the Constitution; that is, roads and highways.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be here today. This \nhas been a long and winding road to get to the point where we can pass \na transportation bill which is a very good bill and which is very \nbipartisan. According to a formula, each and every one of our States \nwill get more than they have in the past.\n  This is what our States are facing. This is a bridge between Arizona \nand California. I am sure my friend knows what happened. People \ncommuting between our States have had to go 400 miles out of their way.\n  We cannot turn away from this vote today. I know and my friend from \nOklahoma knows that each one of us would have written a different bill, \nbut the process means we have to come together. This person says ``I \ndon't like the process'' and this one says ``I don't like the pay-\nfors.'' Well, I am sure Senator Inhofe and I feel the same way, but we \nknow that if we run into a construction worker who is unemployed and we \nsay ``Well, we didn't vote for this because we didn't like the \nprocess,'' they would say ``I need a paycheck.''\n  So I am going to ask our colleagues to vote aye for three reasons.\n  First, let's get our construction workers back to work. We have so \nmany of them--hundreds of thousands--who are out of work. The general \ncontractors told us last week that in 25 States they are seeing layoffs \nof construction workers because we are not doing a long-term bill. So \nlet's help our construction workers get back to work.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthree letters of support from the Nation's leading construction unions \nand additional letters of support I received from the Transportation \nConstruction Coalition and the Highway Materials Group.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       [From the National Infrastructure Alliance, July 22, 2015]\n\n                      H.R. 22--Senate Cloture Vote\n\n           (By Raymond J. Poupore, Executive Vice President)\n\n       The leading construction unions building our country's \n     surface transportation infrastructure strongly urge a ``YES'' \n     vote on the Motion to Proceed to debate H.R. 22--The DRIVE \n     Act.\n       As persistent high unemployment still plagues the \n     construction industry, we need a well funded, multi-year \n     infrastructure bill to put hundreds of thousands of our \n     members to work building critical highway and transit \n     projects. It is our understanding that the transit title in \n     this bill actually exceeds its traditional 20 percent share, \n     despite rumors to the contrary.\n       Through this legislation, we can begin to address the most \n     pressing needs facing our transportation infrastructure. \n     Please support your constituent construction workers by \n     voting to proceed on the DRIVE Act.\n                                  ____\n\n                                     Laborers' International Union\n\n\n                                             of North America,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 21, 2015.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the 500,000 members of the \n     Laborers' International Union of North America (LIUNA), I \n     urge you to support the motion to proceed to consideration of \n     a long term reauthorization of the federal highway and \n     transit programs.\n       Last month, the Senate Environment and Public Works \n     Committee unanimously approved S. 1647, the Developing a \n     Reliable and Innovative Vision for the Economy (DRIVE) Act. \n     Now is the time for the rest of the U.S. Senate to join \n     together and embrace a bipartisan effort to invest in this \n     Nation and reject the politics of division.\n       A long term highway bill will help provide necessary funds \n     to improve America's crumbling transportation infrastructure. \n     Our economy requires a functioning transportation network and \n     with bridges literally falling apart and highways unable to \n     handle current traffic volumes, America's transportation \n     infrastructure is in dire need of a robust and sustainable \n     investment.\n       Under the current extensions, the Highway Trust Fund is \n     unable to fully fund these necessary repairs, making our \n     highways and bridges more susceptible to further \n     deterioration. A long term federal commitment to invest in \n     the Nation's infrastructure and safety needs is essential.\n       I urge you to end the delays on political games and pass a \n     long term highway bill before Congress leaves for vacation.\n       With kind regards, I am\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                 Terry O'Sullivan,\n     General President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            International Union of\n\n\n                                          Operating Engineers,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 21, 2015.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles E. Schumer,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Dick Durbin,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patty Murray,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Reid, Durbin, Schumer, and Murray: At this \n     critical moment for America's transportation infrastructure, \n     the International Union of Operating Engineers respectfully \n     requests the support of Senate Democratic Leadership for \n     immediate passage of a long-term highway and transit bill. \n     Passage of the cloture vote today is a necessary step in \n     order to have a debate on revenue options to fund the \n     nation's biggest, most important infrastructure programs.\n       The model developed by the Environment and Public Works \n     Committee in the DRIVE Act (Developing a Reliable and \n     Innovative Vision for the Economy Act), both procedurally and \n     substantively, should serve as the framework for Senate floor \n     consideration. The bipartisan process led to a consensus and \n     unanimous committee vote. The substance of the policy issues \n     ensured that extreme measures from both the left and the \n     right were rejected.\n       Aspects of the Commerce Committee markup were a serious \n     disappointment, as you know. Similarly, consistent references \n     to partisan revenue-raisers understandably make policymakers \n     reluctant to engage in serious debate. While the sensitive \n     nature of negotiations and legislative strategy leaves us \n     with precious few details, we are assured that ``real \n     revenue'' could be available to the program with bipartisan \n     support. Serious revenue options must be on the table, and \n     egregious, partisan provisions must be off the table. It is \n     that simple, if we have any chance of success.\n       The DRIVE Act addresses what is perhaps the most pressing \n     domestic economic issue of our time: reauthorization of a \n     multiyear highway and transit program. The Act's legislative \n     framework provides a six-year certainty to transportation \n     planners, the construction industry, and its supply chain. It \n     builds on important successes in MAP-21 by\n\n[[Page S6160]]\n\n     expediting project delivery and making the approval process \n     more transparent. Additionally, it creates a new, national \n     emphasis on freight movement, and it targets resources at \n     projects of national and regional significance.\n       As you know, we need a long-term solution. We cannot afford \n     to wait. Thousands of Operating Engineers depend on these \n     investments for their livelihoods. We cannot rely on \n     ``aspirational thinking'' about comprehensive agreements that \n     could include funding for this essential program.\n       The transportation advocacy community believes \n     wholeheartedly that now is the time to build on the \n     bipartisan momentum generated in the Environment and Public \n     Works Committee to move a robust, long-term bill through the \n     Senate before the summer break. We look forward to working \n     with you to enact such a long-term highway and transit bill \n     as soon as possible.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                James T. Callahan,\n     General President.\n                                  ____\n\n  \n\n                                                    July 29, 2015.\n       Dear Senator: The 31 national associations and construction \n     trade unions of the Transportation Construction Coalition \n     (TCC) urge you to support passage of the ``Developing a \n     Reliable and Innovative Vision for the Economy (DRIVE) Act.'' \n     The bipartisan surface transportation reauthorization bill \n     would guarantee three years of increased highway and public \n     transportation investment and provide further certainty to \n     states by distributing six years of contract authority.\n       The Highway Trust Fund has suffered five cash flow crises \n     requiring $65 billion in temporary cash infusions since 2008. \n     With a sixth trust fund revenue shortfall less than a month \n     away, seven states have delayed or canceled projects valued \n     at $1.6 billion. Furthermore, the Congressional Budget Office \n     projects the trust fund will be unable to support any new \n     highway or transit spending in FY 2016 without remedial \n     action.\n       This repeating cycle of uncertainty and piecemeal \n     management undermines the ability of state transportation \n     departments to implement multi-year transportation plans and \n     discourages the private sector from making investments in new \n     capital and personnel. By supporting the DRIVE Act, senators \n     not only have an opportunity to stabilize surface \n     transportation investment, but to do so as part of \n     legislation that would enact a series of meaningful policy \n     reforms to help grow the economy and promote improved \n     mobility for all Americans.\n       The DRIVE Act includes provisions that would streamline the \n     transportation project review process to expedite the \n     delivery of needed highway and bridge improvements. The \n     measure would also create a dedicated freight program and a \n     major projects assistance program--both of which would help \n     enhance U.S. economic competitiveness.\n       The members of the TCC remain concerned about the need to \n     enact a permanent solution to stabilize and grow Highway \n     Trust Fund revenue. The Senate surface transportation \n     reauthorization construct would provide ample time to develop \n     and enact such a plan while federal highway and transit \n     investment is unthreatened over the next three years.\n       We strongly urge all senators to support the DRIVE Act to \n     provide your states with the stable and growing resources \n     they need to help them deliver the highway and public \n     transportation improvements the U.S. economy and all \n     Americans need.\n           Sincerely,\n                                   The Transportation Construction\n     Coalition.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    July 29, 2015.\n\nStatement of the Highway Materials Group (HMG) as the Deadline Nears on \n                    Highway Funding Reauthorization\n\n       The Highway Materials Group applauds the efforts by all \n     Senators--notably Majority Leader McConnell, Chairman Inhofe \n     and Ranking Member Boxer and their staffs--in support of a \n     long term reauthorization bill that increases funding for the \n     nation's highways and transit systems.\n       We fully support final Senate passage this week and urge a \n     YES vote on the bipartisan, multi-year Developing a Reliable \n     and Innovative Vision for the Economy (DRIVE) Act which \n     offers great hope to the modernization of our nation's \n     infrastructure.\n       We urge House Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman \n     Shuster and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Ryan to \n     utilize the hours of hearings, site visits and stakeholder \n     input they have held and bring together their Committees soon \n     after the August recess to produce a multiyear, fully-funded \n     bill that warrants House support.\n       Most importantly, before departing for the August recess, \n     we urge House and Senate leadership to unequivocally state \n     their commitment to send to the President a well-funded, \n     multiyear highway bill by the end of October.\n       The Highway Materials Group (HMG), comprised of nine \n     national associations listed below, represent companies that \n     provide the construction materials and equipment essential to \n     building America's roads, highways, and bridges. We employ \n     tens of thousands of men and women in well-paying American \n     jobs, and we stand in support of this important legislative \n     action.\n         American Coal Ash Association, American Concrete Pavement \n           Association, Association of Equipment Manufacturers, \n           Associated Equipment Distributors, Concrete Reinforcing \n           Steel Institute, National Asphalt Pavement Association, \n           National Ready Mixed Concrete Association, National \n           Stone, Sand & Gravel Association, Portland Cement \n           Association.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is rare to have the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers and the Chamber of Commerce in agreement \nwith the entire structure of the construction industry workers, all of \nthose unions. I put their names into the Record. It is unique to have \nMothers Against Drunk Driving in that coalition and to have the \nNational Governors Association in that coalition and to have the mayors \norganization in that coalition.\n  My friend from Oklahoma and my friend from Illinois, Senator Durbin, \nwhom I thank from the bottom of my heart--we were kind of smiling the \nother day because we had the mayor of Oklahoma City and the mayor of \nNew York ask us for a long-term bill; no more short-term extensions. \nThat is the kind of coalition building we are seeing out in the country \nand one that I think we are living proof of here today.\n  So I will close with where I started. To me, this is the poster child \nfor why we have to act today. There are more than 60,000 bridges that \nare obsolete or deficient. If we don't pass this bill today and the \nHouse doesn't take it up and pass it or something else similar to it or \nget to conference, we are back to, I think it is, the 34th short \nextension. That is doomsday--doomsday.\n\n  I am sad the House went out for a 5\\1/2\\-week break. It is the first \ntime in 10 years they went out for an August break before August. I \nfind it ironic that they went out even a day earlier so they are not \nthere if we do, in fact, pass our legislation and send it over.\n  Why are they doing this? They need to act. I am encouraged that \nSpeaker Boehner said that he has asked his committee to act. If we can \ndo it over here, they can do it over there.\n  I will close with this: I am very pleased that we have reached this \npoint. It has taken a lot of work and a lot of compromise. We had to \ngive some ground, but we found common ground. We all believe this bill \nis so important for our Nation.\n  I urge everyone, regardless of how we voted before, to understand \nthis is not what we want to see in America. We can't have more of these \nbridge collapses, and we can't have more of these streets falling \napart. Now, 50 percent are in disrepair. This is the day.\n  I thank Senator Inhofe. I thank Senator Durbin. I thank Senator \nMcConnell. I thank Senator Nelson. And later, when we finish with this, \nI will thank many others. The staffs have been unbelievable. We were \nworking into the wee hours of the morning for the last week.\n  I also thank you, Madam President, for your role in this and your \nhelp in this. I am proud that I serve on the committee with you. We \nhave worked well together. I hope we have a good vote, a solid vote for \nthis bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). All postcloture time is \nexpired.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed, and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                            The Highway Bill\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I know the Senator from California, Mrs. \nBoxer, and I both want to thank a lot of people who worked very hard. \nPeople don't realize how many people are involved. Quite frankly, a \nlittle bit of guilt always comes to me, because this is my sixth \nhighway reauthorization bill, and it always ends up that I don't work \nas long as all the staff works. They are up many nights until midnight \nand many nights all night long.\n  This was a good bill. It was tough doing it. From this point forward, \nwe have the opportunity to send it to the House. I have already had \ncommunication with some of the House Members who do want a multiyear \nbill. The staffs are working together as we speak to pull it together \nso we can pass one and get out of this long string of short-term \nextensions. They don't serve any useful purpose.\n  I wish to mention the names and to get them in the Record of those \npeople who really put in the long hours. In my office is Alex Herrgott. \nHe has been with me--we have been together, I guess--over a dozen \nyears. He is the leader on our side. He put together a great team, \nincluding Shant Boyajian, who is the guy who was the transportation \nexpert on our end, and he did a great job. We have had others just \nabout as good as he is in the past, but they all sweat. This guy \ndoesn't do it. He does it with a smile on his face. We have Chaya \nKoffman. She came with incredible experience. We couldn't have done it \nwithout her. It is equally important to thank David Napoliello and \nAndrew Dohrman. David and Andrew work for Senator Boxer and are experts \nwithin the office, working on this alongside our staff.\n  It is kind of interesting because Senator Boxer and I can't get any \nfurther apart philosophically. She is a very proud liberal, and I am a \nvery proud conservative. We would be fighting like cats and dogs over \nthese regulations that are putting Americans out of business. But, \ntoday, we think alike, and we are working together. I am so proud of \nher staff working with my staff.\n  Bettina. There is Bettina, and she is probably the No. 1 hard working \nperson, sitting in the back here on that side, and whom we really \nappreciate. Some days I don't appreciate her, but I have all during \nthis process.\n  So many others have made contributions to the success today. It is \nimportant to thank on my staff Susan Bodine, for her work on \nenvironmental provisions, and also Jennie Wright and Andrew Neely. I \nwish to thank my communications team, including Donelle Harder, Daisy \nLetendre, and Kristina Baum. They have to get the message out as to \nwhat we are doing, how significant it is.\n  People who are witnessing this today are witnessing the most popular \nbill of this entire year. We can go back to any of the 50 States, and \nthey are all going to say the one thing we want is a transportation \nsystem. It is not just that they want this bill. This is what the \nConstitution says we are supposed to be doing. Article I, section 8 of \nthe Constitution says to defend America and provide for roads and \nbridges, and that is what we accomplished today.\n  There are some others outside of our committee I want to thank: \nChairman Hatch, Chairman Thune, Chairman Shelby, and their staffs, \nincluding Chris Campbell, Mark Prater, David Schweitert, Shannon Hines, \nand Jen Deci. I want to thank our leader, Mitch McConnell, who really \ncame through to put this at top priority. Without that priority, we \ncouldn't have done it. I know Sharon Soderstrom, Hazen Marshall, Neil \nChatterjee, Jonathan Burks, and Brendan Dunn were all involved.\n  If my colleagues would just permit me, 10 years ago today is the last \ntime we passed a significant, multiyear bill. I remember standing right \nhere at this podium, right when this moment came, and it was time to \nthank all of these people who worked so hard. All of a sudden the \nsirens went off and the buzzers--evacuate, evacuate; bomb, bomb. \nEveryone left, but I hadn't made my speech yet. So I stood there and \nmade it longer than I probably should have. There is nothing more eerie \nthan standing here in the Chamber when nobody else is here and \neverybody else is gone. After a while, I thought that I had better get \nout of here.\n  As I walked out the front door and down the long steps--they had \nalready shut off the elevators and all of that; it was dark--I saw a \nbulk of a man walking away very slowly. I saw that it was Ted Kennedy. \nI said: Ted, we better get out of here; this place might blow up.\n  He said: Well, these old legs don't work like they used to.\n  So I said: Here, put your arm around my shoulders. And I put my arm \nout to steady him. Someone took our picture. It was in a magazine, and \nit said: Who said that Republicans are not compassionate.\n  I always think of that when I think of these bills. I say to my \nfriend, Senator Boxer, with whom I have worked so closely during this \ntime--and I actually enjoyed it: Any time we get a coalition between \nyour philosophy and my philosophy, it has to be right. It was, and it \nis over.\n  I yield the floor to Senator Boxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, my friend and I have long worked \ntogether on infrastructure, and we did it this time under very \ndifficult conditions. I would say to him that with his leadership on \nEPW, going to a markup, proving to the rest of the Senate that, in \nfact, our committee could work together, we got a 20-to-nothing vote. \nAs a result of that, and as my friend has often said, our committee is \nreally responsible for about 70 to 75 percent of the funding. So we \nwere the key committee, and we proved that we could work together.\n  It was a little tougher on the other committees. That is when it took \nLeader McConnell's leadership, Senator Durbin's leadership, and we came \ntogether.\n  But I must say that those top staffers from Senator Inhofe's team, \nMcConnell's team, Boxer's team, including Bettina Poirier, Neil \nChatterjee, and\n\n[[Page S6162]]\n\nAlex Herrgott really--friendships forged--worked on, and it was a \npleasure to work with them. I will never forget this as long as I live. \nThis has been a highlight of my career, and I have been here a very \nlong time.\n  I want to thank Andrew Dohrmann, David Napoliello, Tyler Rushforth, \nJason Albritton, Ted Illston, Mary Kerr, Kate Gilman, Colin McCarthy, \nand Kathryn Backer in addition to Bettina, on my team. I want to thank \nRyan Jackson, Shant Boyajian, Susan Bodine, Andrew Neely, and Chaya \nKoffman, along with Alex, on the Inhofe team. I want to thank Alyssa \nFisher on the Durbin team. I want to thank Shannon Hines, Jennifer \nDeci, and Homer Carlisle on the Banking Committee team. I want to thank \nKim Lipsky so much. What a job she did for Bill Nelson, and her team, \nDevon Barnhart and Matt Kelly, and Dave Schweitert on the Thune team.\n\n  Notice we said ``team.'' This was about teamwork. This was not about \nme, me, me or I, I, I. It was all of us in friendship, in sincerity. We \nnever surprised each other. When we couldn't do this, something \nhappened, we would tell each other, and we never left the room until we \nfigured it out.\n  I will have more to write about this and say about it because truly \nthese moments don't happen often around here. In my career this will \nstand out as truly spectacular--spectacular--the people who were so \ndedicated, and my friendship with my friend is just extraordinary. It \nstood the test of time. My new collegiality with Mitch McConnell, which \nhas not existed until now, this is a miraculous thing that has \nhappened.\n  One of the things I have learned in life is it goes so fast and \nsometimes you don't mark those special moments. This moment will be \nforever marked with me and with my friends.\n  We now are going to look forward to working with our friends in the \nHouse. We are going to infuse our spirit over there. We are going to \nmake sure they know we can work together and be friends, and it has \nalready started, as Alex has stated today.\n  So we are ready for the next phase, the next step. What is most \nimportant? We are going to make sure we have infrastructure that works \nfor this Nation; that you and I, Jim, don't have to stand here and show \ntragic photos, bridge collapses, and hear terrible stories about \nconstruction workers who can't make it and have to have food stamps, \nand businessmen who have literally cried in my office because they have \nno certainty, they can't function, and they may have to shut down. This \nis not what we want.\n  We did the right thing for the country. It wasn't about us--we were \nthe ones who made it happen--it was about America, and I couldn't be \nmore proud.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                 Remembering Reverend Clementa Pinckney\n\n  Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, before I start my prepared remarks, I did \nwant to note that today would have been the birthday of Pastor Reverend \nClementa Pinckney, a friend of mine, who was the pastor of Emanuel 9, \nthe Emanuel Church, the Mother Emanuel Church in Charleston, SC. Today \nbeing his birthday, I thought it would be a good opportunity to share \nwith the public that we miss him. We thank God for the family and the \namazing roles they have played in South Carolina and around this \ncountry.\n  Certainly, as we tackle issues going forward, I think we should keep \nin mind, bear in mind, the civility, the grace, and the compassion we \nsaw from Reverend Pinckney and the way he tackled issues with such an \nimportant ingredient to keeping our communities together.\n  I hope as we discuss other challenging issues, we will have an \nopportunity to remember that civility, that notion that we are better \ntogether. The desire to build a bridge should be seen and displayed in \nthe public forum as we discuss issues that sometimes pull at the very \nfabric of who we are as a nation.\n\n\n             Safer Officers and Safer Citizens Act of 2015\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to offer a solution. I will tell you solutions \nare hard to find at times, but today I think I have found a solution \nthat will help law enforcement officers and our citizens go home \nsafely. That solution is body-worn cameras to be worn by our law \nenforcement officers throughout this country. Just yesterday, in \nCincinnati, we were unfortunately given yet another example of how \nimportant body cameras are when they are worn by law enforcement \nofficers.\n  We, those of us who viewed the video, watched in disbelief as the \nofficer shot the driver in the head. Difficult, difficult video to \nwatch. Cincinnati officials said in their investigation of the death of \nSamuel Dubose, after being shot by the University of Cincinnati police \nofficer, that body camera footage was invaluable. I want to say that \none more time; that the police chief said, without any question, what \nallowed them to find conclusion, to actually arrest the officer, was \nthe presence of a video that was undeniable.\n  Unfortunately, we have seen too many of these incidents around the \ncountry. I will tell you that I struggle with this issue sometimes \nbecause I have so many good friends who are officers, who serve the \npublic every single day with honor, with dignity, and amazing \ndistinction. I am talking about guys and young ladies who put on the \nuniform with pride. I see that pride as I walk through the \nneighborhoods as I talk to folks.\n  So many of our officers serve this Nation, serve their communities so \nwell, keeping all of us safe, but sometimes, and too often we have seen \nrecently, the videos suggest we have to take a deeper look. Our \ncitizens deserve for us to take that deeper look. I think that without \nany question a body-worn camera will protect the public, but it will \nalso protect the officer. That is why I am here today.\n  I have said a couple of times that if they say a picture is worth a \nthousand words, then a video is worth a thousand pictures. Let me say \nthat one more time. If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a \nvideo is worth a thousand pictures. I believe strongly that an \nimportant piece of the puzzle to help rebuild trust with our law \nenforcement officers and the communities they serve is body-worn \ncameras.\n  I say it is only one piece of that very important puzzle because I do \nnot know that there is a single solution. I have looked for a panacea, \nbut I do not know if there is a panacea. As a matter of fact, I think \nthere is not a panacea, but there are many critical steps we must take \nto tackle an array of issues confronting the distressed communities and \nchallenging circumstances, whether it is poverty, criminal justice \nreform or, as we have seen on the video, instances of police brutality.\n  With body cameras, we have seen some amazing studies. At least one \nstudy has confirmed there is a 90-percent drop in complaints against \nofficers. That is an astounding number, a 90-percent drop in complaints \nagainst officers. The same study shows there is a 60-percent drop in \nthe use of force by officers. This should be good news for everyone on \nevery side of the issue--if there are sides of the issue. I would \nsuggest there are not sides to this issue.\n  There is not a Republican side, there is not a Democratic side, there \nis not a Black side, there is not a White side, there is only a right \nside and a wrong side. If we can find ourselves in a position where \nofficers go home at night to a loving family, arms wide open, and \ncitizens within the community go home at night to loving families and \nwarm embraces, that perhaps the body-worn camera by officers will make \nthis happen more every day someplace in our country.\n  With those sorts of numbers, how can we not figure out the best way \nto get these devices into the hands of our police officers? This does \nnot even touch on the fact that when we ended up with the video, a very \nunfortunate video, on April 4, this year, my hometown, North \nCharleston, SC--a video of Walter Scott being shot in the back, it \nhelped bring clarity to an incredibly painful situation.\n  That is why, after months of meetings with dozens of police \norganizations, civil rights groups, privacy\n\n[[Page S6163]]\n\ngroups, and others, yesterday I introduced the Safer Officers and Safer \nCitizens Act of 2015. My goal is simple. It is to simply provide local \nand State law enforcement agencies with the resources to equip their \nofficers with body-worn cameras. My legislation creates a dedicated \ngrant program, fully paid for--I know there are those in the Senate, \nsuch as myself, who like those words ``fully paid for''--to help local \nlaw enforcement agencies purchase body cameras.\n  I am opposed, very opposed, to any notion that we should federalize \nin any way, shape or form local law enforcement. I believe local law \nenforcement should be in charge of local law enforcement and State law \nenforcement should be in charge of State law enforcement. But if we can \nprovide some tools, some resources, to make sure the situation I \ndescribed earlier from a positive standpoint of an officer going home \nto their house and members of the community going home to their houses \nafter having an interaction, if there is a solution and/or an \nopportunity to see that happen more often, we should go there.\n  My grant program would provide $100 million over the next 5 fiscal \nyears: $100 million each year, 2016 through 2021, and only requires a \nsimple 25-percent match. It certainly suggests that we will give \npreferences to departments that are applying for grants. They will need \nto have their own policies in place regarding data retention, privacy \nrequirements, and other areas because I believe local and State \ndepartments, as I have said, can best determine their own procedures \naround the body cameras.\n  As States and localities around the country implement body-worn \ncamera programs, I believe this is the best way we can help--not take \nover but provide that seed capital, the resources to start a brand-new \nconversation all over the country about how many lives have been saved, \nhow many folks get to go home.\n  I will say this on some other points. I had the privilege of speaking \nat the graduation of who I call my brother, who is the son of my \nmentor, John Moniz, who helped change my life when I was a kid on the \nwrong course for a long time--I had the privilege of speaking at Brian \nMoniz's graduation from the police academy just 2 years ago, July 18--a \ncouple of years ago. He is an amazing young man who wants to serve his \ncommunity. His brother Philip is also a fellow sheriff's deputy.\n\n  So when I think about the words I am speaking today, I don't think \nabout it in legislative terms, I think about it in terms of real places \nand real people, such as my brothers and others who want to serve the \ncountry. But I also think about it in terms of real people who have \nsuffered through those violent interactions.\n  I am thankful that cosponsors such as Senator Lindsey Graham of South \nCarolina and Cory Booker of New Jersey have joined me in making sure we \nstart the conversation that I hope to continue with Senator Grassley on \nthis important topic.\n  I ask that we all remember the words of Mrs. Judy Scott, the mother \nof Walter Scott, who lost her son in my hometown of North Charleston. I \nhave had the chance to speak to her on a number of occasions since the \nincident. She has taught me a lot. She has taught me the power of \nforgiveness. Very quickly afterward she showed no animus toward the \nofficer. She was praying for the officer. She forgave the officer. But \nher request to me was a very simple request. It was simply that no more \nmothers have to unnecessarily bury their sons the way she did. That is \na very simple request.\n  I think my body camera legislation will help us achieve that goal. I \nbelieve this legislation will protect citizens and law enforcement \nofficers. It will bridge the gap that seems to be growing in some \ncommunities around the country. It will provide resources without \ntaking over local law enforcement. I believe this is critically \nimportant, and the sooner we get there, the better off our Nation will \nbe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n\n                       Trans-Pacific Partnership\n\n  Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, as we speak, there are American trade \nnegotiators in Hawaii from the Pacific Rim and South America \nnegotiating the final terms of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP.\n  I rise today to speak about an element of those negotiations which I \nfind troubling and which I believe, if it goes on its current path, \nwill produce a gross injustice that will be harmful to American job \ncreators and could potentially threaten the passage or ratification of \nthe TPP.\n  I understand that the current proposal of the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership calls for discriminatory treatment of tobacco--specifically \nsingling out an entire industry. It is an industry that is vitally \nimportant to my home State of North Carolina. Tobacco continues to be \nvitally important among North Carolinian agricultural exports, and the \nonly path to sustaining this industry is to preserve the place for the \nAmerican leaf in the world. The industry supports more than 22,000 jobs \nin North Carolina, my home State.\n  I rise today to defend farmers, manufacturers, and exporters from \ndiscriminatory treatment in our trade agreements. Today it happens to \nbe tobacco, but I will do this for any crop for as long as I am in the \nSenate. I am well aware that many States aren't touched by tobacco \nfarming or tobacco product manufacturing, but this is not just about \ntobacco; this is about American values and fairness.\n  I believe free trade is good, and a balanced free trade benefits all \nparties. For those who think free trade is bad for America, I don't \nagree. When America and Americans compete on a level playing field, we \nwin the vast majority of the time. It is what we do.\n  But the United States, over the years, has tried to do more with \nthese agreements than just haggle for market access and tariff \nproductions. Over the past 30 years, the United States has commonly \nnegotiated what is called the investor-state dispute settlement--or \nISDS--language in a number of international agreements. The ISDS \nprovisions are fairly simple. They give someone who believes their \ntrade agreement rights have been violated by another government trading \npartner the ability to bring a claim against that government before an \ninternational arbitration panel.\n  All kinds of offenses can be addressed through the ISDS process--\nprotecting American-owned businesses by requiring our trading partners \nto meet minimum standards of treatment under international law; \nprotecting American-owned businesses from having their property taken \naway without payment or adequate compensation; and protecting American-\nowned businesses from discriminatory, unfair, or arbitrary treatment. \nThat is a fundamental protection. If these sound like American ideals, \nit is because they are. American ingenuity, combined with these values \nand ideals, has produced the world's greatest economy, the American \neconomy.\n  Regions of the world that do not share the same views of due process, \nequality under the law, and protection of private property rights would \ndo well to follow our model. It will make them a better trading \npartner, and it will help their economies thrive.\n  Yet, even the U.S. negotiators apparently want to be selective in \napplying these ideals, and that is really the root of the concern I \nhave with the discussions going on now in Hawaii. We cannot afford to \nbe selective when it comes to fairness. Our negotiators have concluded \nthat while some investors are entitled to equal treatment under the \nlaw, others aren't. It is odd to me that this would be the posture of \nany nation, but it is particularly troubling that this is the current \nposture of the negotiators who were responsible for negotiating the \nTrans-Pacific Partnership.\n\n  It is ironic that the ideal of equal treatment and due process is \nbeing peddled with our trading partners as equal treatment and due \nprocess for everyone but some members of the minority. So let's say, my \nfellow Senators, that you are not from a State that is harmed by the \ncurrent negotiations. You may feel comfortable that this could never \nhappen to you, to a sector in your State's economy, but I believe you \nshould be worried. The current proposal on the TPP creates an entirely \nnew precedent, a precedent that will no doubt become the norm for \nfuture trade agreements where the negotiators get to pick and choose \nwinners and losers and American businesses and American industries will \nsuffer as a result. Once we\n\n[[Page S6164]]\n\nallow an entire sector to be treated unfairly in trade agreements, the \nquestion is, Who is next?\n  I hold a sincere belief that unfair treatment for one agricultural \ncommodity significantly heightens the risk that more unfair treatment \nfor another commodity lurks right around the corner.\n  I have not spoken with a single organization, agricultural or \notherwise, that believes this sets a good precedent--quite the \ncontrary. I encourage my colleagues to speak to their State's \nagricultural community and simply ask them what they think about \nsetting this kind of standard.\n  To my fellow Senators--and, incidentally, I should say for those of \nyou in the Gallery, we are working today; we are just outside of the \nGallery. I know this is kind of like showing up at the zoo and one of \nyour favorite animals being off of an exhibit. But they are out \nworking; they will be back at about 1:45.\n  To get back to the script, if you believe that this unfair treatment \nis OK because it is about tobacco and that it is a fair outcome, I \nthink you ought to think again because I will remind you--and our \nfellow Senators need to understand this--that Congress has spoken on \nthis issue. We exist to make sure we take care of the voice that may \nnot be heard, the minority who may be cast aside because of some agenda \nor because of it just being an easy negotiating tactic.\n  But in this particular case, Congress has spoken loudly. I will \nremind my Members that Congress has said opportunities for U.S. \nagricultural exports must be ``substantially equivalent to \nopportunities afforded foreign exports in U.S. markets.'' Now, with \nthis trade agreement, if you have a trading partner agree with the \nbehavior or decisions made in the United States, they are going to be \nsubject to due process. But this trade agreement would actually allow \nour trading partners to not allow us to be held to that same standard \nin their country of jurisdiction and not go to international \narbitration. Congress has stated that dispute settlement mechanisms \nmust be available across the board, not selectively.\n  I also voted to give the President trade promotion authority to allow \ntrade agreements like the TPP to move through Congress in a quick, \norderly, and responsible process. That is the process we are going \nthrough right now. I did not vote to give our negotiators the freedom \nto indiscriminately choose when fairness should be applied and when it \nshouldn't be applied. The Congress has already spoken. I hope you will \nat least share the expectation that our negotiations carry out our \nwill.\n  I applaud the efforts of the U.S. negotiators. I know it is difficult \nwork, and I congratulate them for getting closer to completing the \nTrans-Pacific Partnership agreement. I hope, however, that they will \nconsider the risk of losing support for the Senate to ratify the \nagreement.\n  In closing, I would offer this to anyone who believes my sticking up \nfor tobacco or for equal treatment and American values is shortsighted: \nI want you to know that I would do this for any commodity, any \ncategory, and any industry. I hope our trade negotiators will work hard \nto ensure that American values are upheld in the final agreement they \nbring before Congress, and that goes for language in the entire \nagreement, even that which appears in the annexes and the footnotes.\n  I, for one--and I think many of my colleagues--am concerned with the \ncurrent status of the trade negotiations in this particular area. There \nare a number of good things in it. This needs to be worked out. And I \nwill not support and I will work hard against any trade agreement that \ndeparts from our core values.\n\n\n                          Veterans Health Care\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I wish to address the status of VA health \ncare and the Department's current budget shortfall.\n  I am grudgingly supporting the bill before this body to extend \nhighway funding for 3 months and to provide budget transfer authority \nto VA because, without it, highway contracts in Vermont and all across \nthe country will be halted and VA will be unable to provide health care \nservices to our veterans. These initiatives are too important not to \nsupport, but I want to be on record as saying this is a very dangerous \npath to be treading down--playing politics with the VA's funding. It is \ndisingenuous and is a disservice to the brave men and women who have \nserved our country.\n  On July 31, 2014, 1 year ago tomorrow, the Senate passed the Veterans \nAccess, Choice, and Accountability Act to address the crisis at the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs. As chairman of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, one of my top priorities during the negotiation of that \nlegislation was to ensure VA had the resources needed to prevent a \nsimilar crisis in the future.\n  I believed then--and I believe now--that, overall, the Department of \nVeterans Affairs provides high-quality health care; health care that \nveterans consistently give high satisfaction scores. But the crisis at \nVA last year was real--too many veterans were waiting far too long for \ncare. And some VA employees were manipulating data to make it appear \nthese wait times did not exist.\n  At the time, we took serious, important steps to address the crisis. \nWe gave the Department tools to hold staff accountable, provided \nfunding for veterans who had trouble accessing care at VA to get that \ncare in the private sector, and gave VA resources to ramp up capacity--\nto hire health care providers and make improvements to the agency's \ncrumbling infrastructure. The bill we passed last year was to ensure \nthat a similar crisis wouldn't happen again.\n  But here we are, 1 year later, facing another crisis in VA health \ncare. But this crisis is different. This is a funding crisis. A crisis \nCongress could have prevented.\n  Given the increased demand for care and volume of veteran patients, I \nhoped Congress would have understood the need at VA and provided the \nfunding needed by the Department. But that hasn't happened. Instead, \nthis Republican-led Congress underfunded VA by $1 billion in their \nbudget resolution. And they have continued the bad policies of the \nBudget Control Act, subjecting VA to funding caps that hamstring the \nDepartment's ability to provide needed care.\n  And let me be clear about something here: these caps are arbitrary \nspending cuts and have nothing to with how much money VA actually needs \nto operate. And, despite common misconception, VA is subject to these \ncaps just like every other Federal Department. I believe we must lift \nthese caps. Lift them so VA has the money it needs to take care of \nveterans, period.\n  And if we are unwilling to lift the budget caps, we should at least \nbe providing this funding through an emergency appropriation. We should \nbe acknowledging that the caps mean we are coming up short--that \nCongress has insufficiently funded VA, tying their hands so they are \nleft unable to pay for the health care services veterans want and need.\n  But instead, we are considering transferring money from one bucket at \nVA to another. The bill we are considering today will move money from \nthe Choice Program to the general operating budget. Congress created \nthe Veterans Choice Program to address a specific problem. And we \nprovided $10 billion to fix that problem. And now, instead of lifting \nthe budget caps or providing emergency funding for VA, we are just \ngoing to use the Choice Program as a piggy bank. We are simply robbing \nPeter to pay Paul. This approach is a short-term fix, keeping VA's \ndoors open for the next 60 days. But is does nothing to address the \nlong-term budget shortfall VA will face next year, and the year after \nthat. And I worry, if we fail to act responsibly now, we'll be right \nback here in 2016 and again in 2017, when we will no longer have the \nluxury of being able to raid billions from the Choice Program, and our \nveterans will be no better off.\n  Not only is this method of funding VA irresponsible, my Republican \ncolleagues are using this funding crisis to jam bad policies down our \nthroats without careful consideration or a real debate. With just days \nto go before we adjourn for the August recess, and with our colleagues \nfrom the House having already skipped town, we are being backed into a \ncorner--told the only way to get VA the money they need is to pass a \nbad piece of legislation filled with unrelated policies.\n\n[[Page S6165]]\n\n  Last week, during a markup of legislation in the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, Chairman Isakson stated multiple times that he wanted new \npolicies to go through regular order, to be considered by the committee \nin a legislative hearing before being voted on by committee members and \ncertainly before being voted on by the full Senate. He also stated \nnumerous times that we should not be passing legislation without paying \nfor it.\n  The Congressional Budget Office score of the bill appears to show the \nlegislation is paid for. However, the reality is there are $1.2 billion \nin lost revenues included in the VA title of the bill that are being \nswept under the rug. These enormous, unnecessary costs are being \ncovered up by offsets intended to pay for transfers from the general \nfund to the highway trust fund. These are not savings or revenue that \nwill actually pay for the lost revenues in the VA title. They are \nsavings and revenue intended to make much-needed repairs to roads and \nbridges. And I fully support those funds being used the way they were \nintended. But what I do not support is that we are turning a blind eye \nto $1.2 billion in costs in the VA title of this bill that have nothing \nat all to do with the funding shortfall at VA. So what are these \npolicies that are so important that they should not be considered \nthrough regular order and take money out of critical transportation \ninfrastructure projects?\n  They are anti-veteran, anti-small business provisions that threaten \nto strip veterans of their access to affordable health care and treat \nthem as second-class citizens in the workplace while putting new \nadministrative burdens on small business owners.\n  If Members really believe these unrelated policies are necessary, we \nshould spend time on them. We should use the committee process that \nSenator Isakson talked about just last week in the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee markup to consider them through regular order. We should \ndebate them on the Senate floor. But we should not link these \npolitically motivated provisions to must-pass legislation to provide \ncritical health care services to millions of veterans who need it.\n  It used to be the case that Congress kept veterans above politics. \nDespite fierce debate over going to war, we all agreed that when \nservicemembers came home from war, we would take care of them.\n  It is sad to say, that is no longer the case. Today, powerful \npolitical contributors like the Koch brothers are using veterans to \npush forward anti-worker, anti-union legislation under the guise of \ncaring for veterans. They want to strip away the rights and protections \nof workers and will use any means necessary to accomplish those goals, \neven if it means using VA employees who serve veterans every day--and \nmany of whom are veterans themselves--as the target.\n  Congress should stand up and be honest with the American people about \nthe reason for the VA budget crisis--that members of this Chamber would \nrather stand here trying to score political points. They would rather \nuse veterans as pawns to promote their anti-worker, anti-union, anti-\nhealth care agenda, even if it means closing hospitals and local \nclinics.\n  Let us not do that, instead let us say to the brave men and women who \nhave served our country in uniform that we will put aside our \ndifferences and give VA the funding they need. Just as our veterans \npromised to fight for our country, we promised to take care of them \nwhen they came home. They fulfilled their promise to us. It is time for \nus to fulfil our promise to them.\n  Mr. TILLIS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, in a couple of minutes we will be \nvoting on a bill that includes a transfer of $3.4 billion within \naccounts of the Veterans' Administration to make possible, literally \nenable VA to continue providing health care for millions of veterans \nacross the United States. We are in this situation because of, quite \nfrankly, gross ineptitude in planning that can be characterized only as \nmanagement malpractice.\n  This crisis emphasizes the importance of accountability, and I thank \nthe chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, Senator Isakson, for \nhis leadership in addressing the shortfall and also in his cooperation \nin meeting the crisis and accountability of management that the VA \ncontinues to face.\n  This crisis must stop. Congress cannot be expected to continue to \nbail out the VA because of mismanagement and management malpractice.\n  In the longer term, there is a need for fundamental reform. There are \nsome good ideas in this bill. I have supported many of them. I thank \nSenator Tester for his leadership as well in framing a proposal that \naddresses these issues.\n  But make no mistake. This bill is only one small step toward the \nreform that I have been advocating and will continue to champion, and \nhope to continue to work on specifics to advance, as the ranking member \nof the Veterans' Affairs Committee.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues and our chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate has a previous order at this time.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I thank the ranking member for his comments.\n  This is the first step for reform in the VA.

The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n               50th Anniversary of Medicare and Medicaid\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as you may have heard, today marks the 50th \nanniversary of both Medicare and Medicaid. While the last half century \nhas seen a pretty robust debate about the merits of these programs, \ntoday there is no question that they provide significant and vital \nelements to our Nation's safety net.\n  This week many are celebrating the lives that have been saved and \nimproved by Medicare and Medicaid over the last 50 years. While this is \nappropriate, I hope that we will also take the time to look at how \nthese programs will function over the next 50 years.\n  Let's start with Medicare. Medicare is, quite simply, a massive \nprogram designed to provide care to our Nation's seniors. Currently, it \ncovers more than 50 million beneficiaries--roughly one-sixth of the \ncurrent U.S. population--and processes more than 1 billion claims a \nyear.\n  Last week the Medicare board of trustees issued its report for 2015, \nwhich once again detailed the fiscal challenges facing the Medicare \nProgram. For example, in 2014 alone, we spent roughly $613 billion on \nMedicare expenditures. That is roughly 14 percent of the Federal budget \nand 3.5 percent of our gross domestic product for a single health care \nprogram. In coming years, these numbers are only going to go up as more \nbaby boomers retire and become Medicare beneficiaries.\n\n  Over the next 10 years, the trustees project that the number of \nMedicare beneficiaries will expand by 30 percent. We will spend roughly \n$7 trillion on the program as it expands, and by the end of that 10-\nyear period we will be spending more on Medicare than on our entire \nnational defense. Over the next 25 years, spending on the program as a \npercentage of GDP will grow by 60 percent, and by 2040 about $1 out of \nevery $5 spent by the Federal Government will go to Medicare.\n  As spending on the program expands, so does its unfunded liabilities. \nUsing the most realistic projections of the Centers for Medicare & \nMedicaid Services--remember, this is the government agency's most \nrealistic projections--Medicare Part A by itself faces long-term \nunfunded liabilities of nearly $8 trillion. The story is even worse \nwith Medicare Part B and Part D, which unlike Part A, do not have a \ndedicated revenue stream. Medicare's trustees estimate $24.8 trillion \nin additional taxes will need to be collected over the next 75 years to \npay for Medicare Part B and Part D services.\n  When we look at the entire Medicare Program over the next 75 years, \nonce again using CMS's most accurate projections, we are looking at $37 \ntrillion of spending in excess of dedicated revenues. Those numbers are \nastronomical. They are too large to even comprehend. So rather than \ntalk about the numbers in broad terms, let's talk about what they mean \nfor seniors and beneficiaries.\n  As I mentioned, Medicare Part A, which includes the Hospital \nInsurance, or HI, Program has a dedicated funding stream. It is paid \nfor by a 2.9-percent payroll tax split between employers and workers, \nand under ObamaCare that rate went up by an additional 0.9 percent on \nwages over $200,000 for single tax filers and $250,000 for married \ncouples.\n  Due in large part to the financial downturn, Part A ran a deficit--\nmeaning that expenditures for the program exceeded income from the \ntax--every year between 2008 and 2014. Last year that deficit reached \n$8.1 billion in just 1 year.\n  Because of the economic recovery and the increased tax rates, Part A \nis projected to generate surpluses between 2015 and 2023. However, \nafter that, deficits are projected to return, and by 2030 the Part A \ntrust fund will officially be bankrupt and the Medicare Program will be \nunable to pay full benefits to seniors. Let me say that again. In 15 \nyears, Medicare Part A will be bankrupt.\n  All of this, of course, assumes that current law remains unchanged \nand Congress is unable to reform the program. I don't think I would be \ngoing too far out on a limb to suggest that reforms to Medicare are \nabsolutely necessary if we are going to preserve the program for future \ngenerations. Furthermore, I don't think it would be outlandish to \nsuggest that Congress should begin working on such reforms immediately \nto avoid future cliffs, standoffs, and the usual accompanying political \nbrinkmanship. I am not the only one saying that.\n  The Medicare trustees themselves said in last week's report that \n``Medicare still faces a substantial financial shortfall that will need \nto be addressed with further legislation. Such legislation should be \nenacted sooner rather than later to minimize the impact on \nbeneficiaries, providers, and taxpayers.''\n  These are not the words of fiscal hawks in the Republican Congress. \nThe Medicare board of trustees is comprised of six members, four of \nwhom are high-ranking officials in the Obama administration, including \nTreasury Secretary Jack Lew, Labor Secretary Thomas Perez, Health & \nHuman Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell, and acting Social Security \nCommissioner Carolyn Colvin.\n  All of these officials signed on to a report recommending ``further \nlegislation'' to reform Medicare and suggesting that it happen ``sooner \nrather than later.''\n  Let's keep in mind that we are only talking about Medicare. I haven't \nsaid anything yet about Medicaid, our other health care entitlement \nprogram, which also faces enormous fiscal challenges. Currently, \nMedicaid covers more than 70 million patients, and that number is \ngrowing thanks to expansions mandated under the so-called Affordable \nCare Act. Since the passage of ObamaCare, more than a dozen States have \nchosen to expand their Medicaid Programs and enrollments have surged \nwell beyond initial projections. This has a number of people worried \nabout added costs and additional strains on State budgets, particularly \nwhen the Federal share of the expanded program is set to scale back in \n2 years. Already, without the expansion under ObamaCare, Medicaid took \nup nearly one-quarter of all State budgets. That is right: Nearly $1 \nout of every $4 spent at the State level goes to Medicaid, and that \nnumber is going to get much higher.\n  In the recent years, combined Federal and State Medicaid spending has \ncome in around $450 billion a year. By 2020, that number is projected \nto expand to around $800 billion a year or more, and with all of this \nexpansion--that increased fiscal burden and instability--we are not \nseeing improvements in care provided by the program.\n  Put simply, Medicaid is probably the worst health insurance in the \ncountry and the President's health care law did nothing to improve the \nquality of care provided by the program. Fewer and fewer doctors accept \nMedicaid because\n\n[[Page S6167]]\n\nit pays them so little, and the program's reimbursement formulas for \nprescription drugs limit beneficiaries' access to a number of important \nmedications.\n  Ultimately, we are going to be spending more and more on Medicaid in \nthe coming years--and as a result expanding our debts and deficits--\nwithout providing better care for beneficiaries.\n  Between Medicare and Medicaid, we will spend more than $12 trillion \nover the next decade with precious few improvements to show for it. \nFormer CBO Director Doug Elmendorf referred to these two programs as \n``our fundamental fiscal challenge.'' If you look at the numbers and \nthe dramatic expansion projected in the coming years, he was right. \nKeep in mind, we still have Social Security, which faces nearly $11 \nbillion in unfunded liabilities over the long term as well as the \nexhaustion of one of its trust funds, the disability trust fund, by the \nend of next year and complete exhaustion by 2034.\n  Separately, these three major entitlement programs present unique \nchallenges that have to be addressed in order to preserve them--and our \nNation's safety net--for future generations. Combined, they threaten to \nswallow up our government and take our economy down with it.\n\n  Once again, these aren't doomsday scenarios. No one seriously \ndisputes the fact that absent real and lasting reforms, our entitlement \nprograms present real threats to our fiscal well-being. The disputes \ntypically arise when we begin talking about the specifics of reform. \nSome would just as soon use the looming entitlement crisis as a \npolitical weapon to scare current and near beneficiaries into believing \nthe other side wants to take their benefits away. Others support the \nidea of entitlement reform in principle but are too afraid to sign on \nto any specific proposals out of fear it would be used against them in \nthe next election cycle.\n  This dynamic has resulted in a longstanding stalemate, where the \npossibility of real reform has, for years now, seemed remote. However, \nrecently we have seen signs that it may in fact be possible to overcome \nthis stalemate.\n  Earlier this year, Congress passed the Medicare Access and CHIP \nReauthorization Act of 2015, a bipartisan bill, which among other \nthings repealed and replaced the Medicare sustainable growth rate, or \nSGR, formula. Now, repealing SGR was, in and of itself, a significant \nimprovement to the Medicare Program, but there are other Medicare \nreforms in the law as well. These include a limitation on so-called \nMedigap first-dollar coverage and more robust means testing for \nMedicare Parts B and D.\n  These aren't fundamental Medicare reforms, and they will not move the \nprogram from its massive projected deficits into future solvency, but \nkeep in mind that for years the idea of bipartisan Medicare reform \nseemed like a pipedream. Yet with passage of the SGR bill, we were able \nto take a meaningful first step toward this all-important goal.\n  Of course, the first step is only a first step if it precedes \nadditional steps, and that is what we need now. Congress must take \nadditional steps to improve these programs and preserve them for our \nchildren and grandchildren. As the chairman of the committee with \njurisdiction over these programs, I have been actively engaged in the \neffort to reform our entitlement programs.\n  In 2013, when I was still the ranking member, I put forward five \nseparate proposals to reform Medicare and Medicaid. All of them were \nserious, commonsense ideas that had received bipartisan support in the \nrecent past. I shared these ideas at every opportunity. I put out \ndocuments, fact sheets, and gave numerous speeches on the floor. I even \npassed them along directly to President Obama, although I didn't ever \nget a response from him. Two of those ideas were, at least partially, \nincluded in the legislation we passed to repeal SGR. The other three \nideas, as far as I am concerned, are still on the table.\n  I have also teamed up with leaders in the House to call on the \ndisability community and other stakeholders to help us come up with \nideas to address the impending exhaustion of the Social Security \ndisability trust fund. I have introduced legislation to improve the \nadministration and fiscal integrity of the disability insurance \nprogram.\n  In other words, I stand ready and willing to work with any of my \ncolleagues--from either party or from either Chamber--to address the \ncoming entitlement crisis before it is too late. I have put my own \nideas on the table, but I don't think the debate should be limited to \nmy ideas. I invite all of my colleagues to come forward so we can work \ntogether to find solutions to these massive problems.\n  I know that when I think about these problems, my thoughts turn to my \n23 grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren--and everybody else's \ngrandchildren and great-grandchildren--who will suffer from any \npromises we fail to keep and will pay the price of any mistakes we fail \nto correct.\n  On this landmark anniversary of the Medicare Program, I urge my \ncolleagues to also consider future generations of Americans and the \ncosts and burdens we will pass on to them if we fail in this endeavor.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                      Nuclear Agreement With Iran\n\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the important \nagreement that we are debating here on the Senate floor--the Iran \nnuclear agreement. I want to begin by saying that there seems to be, as \nwe debate this and as we hold hearings, a growing sense of frustration \nas we do what is really our sacred duty here in the Senate--to review, \ndebate, and, ultimately, to vote on this agreement as to whether it is \nsomething that is going to keep our country secure or undermine the \nnational security of the United States and our allies. This frustration \nstems from a number of sources. Let me just name a few.\n  First, I think many Democrats and Republicans feel there has been a \ndismissive attitude from the administration with regard to this \nagreement and a dismissive attitude, actually, towards the American \npeople on whether the Congress should weigh in on this agreement, \nshould represent their constituents on something that is this important \nto the national security of the United States of America.\n  I mention this because if you look at the last several months, every \nstep of the way the administration has tried to cut out the role of the \nCongress. Initially, they said it was an Executive agreement and \nCongress would have no role. Well, I don't think our constituents liked \nthat, and certainly, the Senate didn't like that. So we started \ndebating the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act.\n  The President said he was going to veto it. Again, that was \ndismissive of this body and the American people. Fortunately, this body \nhad a very strong veto-proof majority. We are debating it--but not \nbecause they wanted us to but because we are representing our \nconstituents who know how important this is.\n  Then the agreement is taken to the United Nations before we weigh in \non it at all. Members of the United Nations, citizens from other \ncountries, are voting on this agreement before we had the opportunity. \nAgain, bipartisan Democrats and Republicans said: Secretary Kerry, \ndon't do that. It is an affront to the American people. But they did \nit. So we are debating it, and that is important. But that attitude of \ndismissiveness of this body and the people we represent is frustrating.\n  There is a second reason there is frustration in the Senate, and it \nstems from the fact that we are not sure that we are getting the \nstraight scoop. We are not sure we are getting all the documents. The \nlaw requires every document to this agreement come to this body. Yet we \nfound out 2 weeks ago that there is a very important agreement, the \nagreement between the IAEA and Iran on implementation of this \nagreement. How did we find out about that? One of my colleagues, \nSenator Cotton, got on a plane, went to IAEA headquarters in Vienna, \nand found that\n\n[[Page S6168]]\n\nout--again, frustration. We are not receiving all of the documents, as \nrequired by law, to be able to review.\n  Third, in terms of frustration, there is a sense that as we are doing \nour duty here, as we are digging into this agreement, as we are reading \nit, as we are reaching out to experts, as we are trying to understand \nit, as we are questioning administration witnesses at hearings, as we \nare doing our required and sacred due diligence, we are told time and \nagain that the plain language of the agreement doesn't appear to mean \nwhat it means. This is frustrating. This is particularly true with \nregard to sanctions.\n  Let me give you a few examples. First we had a closed briefing. \nAlmost every Member of the Senate came to that briefing a couple of \nweeks ago. There was a big question. Was there a grandfather provision \nwith regard to sanctions; meaning, if you are a company and you rush to \nIran right now and cut some deals and sanctions are later imposed, does \nthe mere fact that you jumped in early mean that you are grandfathered \naway from these sanctions? Well, a lot of people had questions.\n  The Secretary of State looked at 100 Members of the Senate and said: \nThere is no grandfather clause in this agreement. There is no \ngrandfather clause in this agreement.\n  This is paragraph 37 of the agreement. I am just going to quote it, \nbecause it certainly sounds like a grandfather clause to me: ``In such \nevent [that sanctions are reimposed], these provisions''--in this \nparagraph--``would not apply with retroactive effect to contracts \nsigned between any party and Iran or Iranian individuals and entities \nprior to the date of application . . .'' That is when the agreement \nstarts to be implemented.\n  That sounds like a grandfather clause. Now, maybe there are elements \nhere, maybe there are special circumstances that make it not a \ngrandfather clause, but the Secretary of State was in front of all of \nus saying that there is no grandfather clause. It is hard to square \nthat with the plain language of this agreement.\n  Let me give another example--the much-touted snapback provisions in \nthe agreement. Secretary Lew, the Secretary of the Treasury, has talked \nabout how we have a strong snapback provision, how it is going to be \nprompt, and how it is powerful. These are terms that he has been using \nin testimony. In many ways I think Members of this body, Democrats and \nRepublicans, see that the effectiveness of this entire deal might hinge \non this so-called snapback provision. The more I read about our \nsanctions and how they work in this agreement, the more questions I \nhave, because to this Senator the snapback provision seems to be an \nillusion. It actually seems to be aimed back at the United States. I \ndon't think we should be calling it a snapback provision. Maybe it \nshould be called the boomerang provision, because it is aimed at us.\n  Let me talk a little bit more in detail about this. First, the term \n``snapback'' was not in the agreement. It is a good term--catchy--and \nsounds good. It is actually a term used in trade negotiations when a \nparty violates a trade agreement. Trade agreements will have snapback \nprovisions where we raise tariffs on goods immediately. That is a \nsnapback. But that is not what is going on here. That is not what is \ngoing to happen here. The practical reality of sanctions, particularly \neconomic sanctions, is that there is no snap when you put them in. It \nis a slog.\n  Let me give you an example. In my experience, I worked with many \npeople at the beginning of our efforts in the Bush Administration, \nduring 2006, 2007, and 2008, to start economically isolating Iran. What \ndoes that mean? Well, what we did is we leveraged the power of the U.S. \neconomy in close coordination with the Congress of the United States, \nand we went to countries and companies that were big investors in Iran, \nsay, in the oil and gas sector, and we told them that they needed to \nstart divesting out of the largest sponsor of terrorism in the world or \nthe Congress of the United States might look to sanction their company \nor limit their access to the American market. We were leveraging the \nauthority of the Congress and the power of our economy to get \ncountries--yes, many of which were our allies--such as Norway, Germany, \nFrance, and Japan to divest and economically isolate Iran. That took \nmonths and years to accomplish. It was a slog. There was no snap.\n  What do we see today? European companies--it is in the newspapers \nevery day--European CEOs, senior administration officials in Germany, \nand government officials are already in Tehran. Already, there are \ncompanies looking to set up shop, looking to invest billions, as they \ndid before. They are there now. This deal is not even done yet. They \nare there. They cannot wait, licking their chops to reinvest in one of \nthe--not one of the biggest, the biggest terrorist regime in the world, \nwhich has done more to kill Americans than probably any country in the \nworld in the last 30 years. Of course, this is disappointing, but this \nhistory is a reminder to all of us that the sanctions regime Secretary \nKerry talks about--and we certainly did have Iran surrounded in terms \nof sanctions--which was a 110-percent-American-led sanctions regime, \ninvolving Democrats, Republicans, this Congress, and the Bush \nadministration. Yes, a lot of credit goes to the Obama administration \non this economic isolation of Iran, which is what brought them to the \ntable to begin with.\n\n  If we reimpose sanctions, there certainly won't be a ``snap'' when it \nhappens. It will be slow. It will be a slog again trying to convince \nreluctant Europeans, Russians, and Chinese to pull out of the market \nonce again.\n  Finally, I just want to say one other thing, and it goes back again \nto the plain language of the agreement, where again the snapback \nprovision, so-called snapback provision, seems aimed back at us, the \nboomerang provision.\n  I posed a hypothetical to Secretary Kerry, Secretary Lew in a closed \nsession, in a Senate Armed Services session yesterday to try and get \nspecifics on what would happen in certain situations. I gave them this \nhypothetical: Let's assume sanctions are lifted in the next 6 to 9 \nmonths. These are called Annex II sanctions. It is a huge list of \nsanctions, the most powerful sanctions our country has placed on Iran. \nAll of them--financial, oil, market--are going to be lifted in 6 to 9 \nmonths. Let's assume that happens.\n  As we are already seeing, European companies, other countries, \ncertainly the Chinese, Russians, Japanese, are going to be rushing into \nthis market, investing billions once again. Assume the Iranian economy \nis going to start humming with all of this new investment, the lifting \nof sanctions. A senior Iranian official recently said they are looking \nfor $120 billion of new investment by 2020. They are likely going to \nget a lot of it, and they are abiding by the deal--no violations of any \nof the nuclear aspects of this deal. Then, what I think is very likely, \nsometime within the next 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 years, Iran commits a major act \nof terrorism. Let's say they kill more American troops. Let's say they \nblow up a consulate or embassy somewhere. They are the world's largest \nstate sponsor of terrorism. It doesn't look as though they want to do \nanything but continue to do that, so that is a very likely scenario. \nWhen that happens, this body reapplies sanctions. It looks at Annex II, \nsome of our most powerful sanctions. We are very upset--bipartisan. We \nreapply sanctions. The President, whoever that is, signs it because \nthat President, he or she is very upset, and we reimpose serious Annex \nII sanctions.\n  Now, what happens then? I think what is going to happen, very likely \nat that point, is Iran is going to look at this agreement, and they are \ngoing to cite either paragraph 26 or paragraph 37. Let me read you both \nof those. Again, this is the plain language of the statute.\n  Paragraph 37. Iran has stated that if sanctions are reinstated in \nwhole or in part, Iran will treat that as grounds to cease performing \nits commitments under the entire agreement.\n  Another provision. Iran has stated it will treat the reintroduction \nor reimposition of the sanctions specified in Annex II as grounds to \ncease performing its commitments under the agreement.\n  That is in the agreement. So, you see, if we reimpose sanctions as \npart of the snapback, Iran can look at this agreement and say: I'm \ndone. I'm walking. I can legally leave this agreement. They can legally \nleave this agreement with a humming economy, on the verge\n\n[[Page S6169]]\n\nof a breakout of a nuclear weapon, still being the largest state \nsponsor of terrorism, and they can say: Hey, I complied with the \nagreement. The United States reimposed sanctions. I told them what I \nwas going to do, and they do it.\n  Again, bottom line, if we use the so-called snapback provision, it \ncertainly appears from the language of this agreement that the deal is \ndone. So I have asked Secretary Kerry and Secretary Lew twice now: How \nis that an improper reading of the agreement? Secretary Lew, the \nSecretary of the Treasury, is trying to argue we are reading that \nlanguage wrong. He says Annex II sanctions--the big American sanctions, \nwhich are what has kept Iran down and what has brought them to the \ntable--can be reimposed if they are reimposed for nonnuclear violations \nlike terrorism.\n  When I read this agreement, that seems to be a bit of a stretch. \nCertainly there is a lot of ambiguity, but it is also clear the \nIranians clearly won't agree with that reading. They don't agree with \nthat reading. This was filed--I ask unanimous consent to have this \nprinted in the Record. This is the Iranian letter dated 20 July 2015, \nto the United Nations Security Council. It is their interpretation of \nthe agreement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              United Nations Security Council,\n\n                                      New York, NY, July 20, 2015.\n     Re Letter dated 20 July 2015 from the Permanent \n         Representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the \n         United Nations addressed to the President of the Security \n         Council\n\n       I have the honour to enclose herewith a text entitled \n     ``Statement of the Islamic Republic of Iran following the \n     adoption of United Nations Security Council resolution 2231 \n     (2015) endorsing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action'' \n     (see annex).\n       I should be grateful if you would arrange for the \n     circulation of the present letter and its annex as a document \n     of the Security Council.\n                                               Gholamali Khoshroo,\n                             Ambassador, Permanent Representative.\n\n     Re Annex to the letter dated 20 July 2015 from the Permanent \n         Representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the \n         United Nations addressed to the President of the Security \n         Council\n\n  Statement of the Islamic Republic of Iran Following the Adoption of \n United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231 (2015) Endorsing the \n                   Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action\n\n       1. The Islamic Republic of Iran considers science and \n     technology, including peaceful nuclear technology, as the \n     common heritage of mankind. At the same time, on the basis of \n     solid ideological, strategic and international principles, \n     Iran categorically rejects weapons of mass destruction and \n     particularly nuclear weapons as obsolete and inhuman, and \n     detrimental to international peace and security. Inspired by \n     the sublime Islamic teachings, and based on the views and \n     practice of the late founder of the Islamic Revolution, Imam \n     Khomeini, and the historic Fatwa of the leader of the Islamic \n     Revolution, Ayatollah Khamenei, who has declared all weapons \n     of mass destruction (WMD), particularly nuclear weapons, to \n     be Haram (strictly forbidden) in Islamic jurisprudence, the \n     Islamic Republic of Iran declares that it has always been the \n     policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran to prohibit the \n     acquisition, production, stockpiling or use of nuclear \n     weapons.\n       2. The Islamic Republic of Iran underlines the imperative \n     of the total elimination of nuclear weapons, as a requirement \n     of international security and an obligation under the Treaty \n     on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The Islamic \n     Republic of Iran is determined to engage actively in all \n     international diplomatic and legal efforts to save humanity \n     from the menace of nuclear weapons and their proliferation, \n     including through the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free \n     zones, particularly in the Middle East.\n       3. The Islamic Republic of Iran firmly insists that States \n     parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \n     Weapons shall not be prevented from enjoying their \n     inalienable rights under the Treaty to develop research, \n     production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes \n     without discrimination and in conformity with articles I and \n     II of the Treaty.\n       4. The finalization of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of \n     Action (JCPOA) on 14 July 2015 signifies a momentous step by \n     the Islamic Republic of Iran and the E3/EU+3 to resolve, \n     through negotiations and based on mutual respect, an \n     unnecessary crisis, which had been manufactured by baseless \n     allegations about the Iranian peaceful nuclear programme, \n     followed by unjustified politically motivated measures \n     against the people of Iran.\n       5. The JCPOA is premised on reciprocal commitments by Iran \n     and the E3/EU+3, ensuring the exclusively peaceful nature of \n     Iran's nuclear programme, on the one hand, and the \n     termination of all provisions of Security Council resolutions \n     1696 (2006), 1737 (2006), 1747 (2007), 1803 (2008), 1835 \n     (2008), 1929 (2010) and 2224 (2015) and the comprehensive \n     lifting of all United Nations Security Council sanctions, and \n     all nuclear-related sanctions imposed by the United States \n     and the European Union and its member States, on the other. \n     The Islamic Republic of Iran is committed to implement its \n     voluntary undertakings in good faith contingent upon same \n     good-faith implementation of all undertakings, including \n     those involving the removal of sanctions and restrictive \n     measures, by the E3/EU+3 under the JCPOA.\n       6. Removal of nuclear-related sanctions and restrictive \n     measures by the European Union and the United States would \n     mean that transactions and activities referred to under the \n     JCPOA could be carried out with Iran and its entities \n     anywhere in the world without fear of retribution from \n     extraterritorial harassment, and all persons would be able to \n     freely choose to engage in commercial and financial \n     transactions with Iran. It is clearly spelled out in the \n     JCPOA that both the European Union and the United States will \n     refrain from reintroducing or reimposing the sanctions and \n     restrictive measures lifted under the JCPOA. It is understood \n     that reintroduction or reimposition, including through \n     extension, of the sanctions and restrictive measures will \n     constitute significant non-performance which would relieve \n     Iran from its commitments in part or in whole. Removal of \n     sanctions further necessitates taking appropriate domestic \n     legal and administrative measures, including legislative and \n     regulatory measures to effectuate the removal of sanctions. \n     The JCPOA requires an effective end to all discriminatory \n     compliance measures and procedures as well as public \n     statements inconsistent with the intent of the agreement. \n     Iran underlines the agreement by JCPOA participants that \n     immediately after the adoption of the Security Council \n     resolution endorsing the JCPOA, the European Union, its \n     member States and the United States will begin consultation \n     with Iran regarding relevant guidelines and publicly \n     accessible statements on the details of sanctions or \n     restrictive measures to be lifted under the JCPOA.\n       7. The Islamic Republic of Iran will pursue its peaceful \n     nuclear programme, including its enrichment and enrichment \n     research and development, consistent with its own plan as \n     agreed in the JCPOA, and will work closely with its \n     counterparts to ensure that the agreement will endure the \n     test of time and achieve all its objectives. This commitment \n     is based on assurances by the E3/EU+3 that they will \n     cooperate in this peaceful programme consistent with their \n     commitments under the JCPOA. It is understood and agreed \n     that, through steps agreed with the International Atomic \n     Energy Agency (IAEA), all past and present issues of concern \n     will be considered and concluded by the IAEA Board of \n     Governors before the end of 2015. The IAEA has consistently \n     concluded heretofore that Iran's declared activities are \n     exclusively peaceful. Application of the Additional Protocol \n     henceforth is intended to pave the way for a broader \n     conclusion that no undeclared activity is evidenced in Iran \n     either. To this end, the Islamic Republic of Iran will \n     cooperate with the IAEA, in accordance with the terms of the \n     Additional Protocol as applied to all signatories. The IAEA \n     should, at the same time, exercise vigilance to ensure full \n     protection of all confidential information. The Islamic \n     Republic of Iran has always fulfilled its international non-\n     proliferation obligations scrupulously and will meticulously \n     declare all its relevant activities under the Additional \n     Protocol. In this context, the Islamic Republic of Iran is \n     confident that since no nuclear activity is or will ever be \n     carried out in any military facility, such facilities will \n     not be the subject of inspection.\n       8. The Joint Commission established under the JCPOA should \n     be enabled to address and resolve disputes in an impartial, \n     effective, efficient and expeditious manner. Its primary role \n     is to address complaints by Iran and ensure that effects of \n     sanctions lifting stipulated in the JCPOA will be fully \n     realized. The Islamic Republic of Iran may reconsider its \n     commitments under the JCPOA if the effects of the termination \n     of the Security Council, European Union or United States \n     nuclear-related sanctions or restrictive measures are \n     impaired by continued application or the imposition of new \n     sanctions with a nature and scope identical or similar to \n     those that were in place prior to the implementation date, \n     irrespective of whether such new sanctions are introduced on \n     nuclear-related or other grounds, unless the issues are \n     remedied within a reasonably short time.\n       9. Reciprocal measures, envisaged in the dispute settlement \n     mechanism of the JCPOA, to redress significant non-\n     performance are considered as the last resort if significant \n     non-performance persists and is not remedied within the \n     arrangements provided for in the JCPOA. The Islamic Republic \n     of Iran considers such measures as highly unlikely, as the \n     objective is to ensure compliance rather than provide an \n     excuse for arbitrary reversibility or means for pressure or \n     manipulation. Iran is committed to fully implement its \n     voluntary commitments in good faith. In order to ensure \n     continued compliance by all JCPOA participants, the Islamic \n     Republic of Iran underlines that in case the mechanism is \n     applied against Iran or its entities and sanctions, \n     particularly Security\n\n[[Page S6170]]\n\n     Council measures, are restored, the Islamic Republic of Iran \n     will treat this as grounds to cease performing its \n     commitments under the JCPOA and to reconsider its cooperation \n     with the IAEA.\n       10. The Islamic Republic of Iran underlines the common \n     understanding and clearly stated agreement of all JCPOA \n     participants that affirms that the provisions of Security \n     Council resolution 2231 (2015) endorsing the JCPOA do not \n     constitute provisions of the JCPOA and can in no way impact \n     the performance of the JCPOA.\n       11. The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran is \n     determined to actively contribute to the promotion of peace \n     and stability in the region in the face of the increasing \n     threat of terrorism and violent extremism. Iran will continue \n     its leading role in fighting this menace and stands ready to \n     cooperate fully with its neighbours and the international \n     community in dealing with this common global threat. \n     Moreover, the Islamic Republic of Iran will continue to take \n     necessary measures to strengthen its defence capabilities in \n     order to protect its sovereignty, independence and \n     territorial integrity against any aggression and to counter \n     the menace of terrorism in the region. In this context, \n     Iranian military capabilities, including ballistic missiles, \n     are exclusively for legitimate defence. They have not been \n     designed for WMD capability, and are thus outside the purview \n     or competence of the Security Council resolution and its \n     annexes.\n       12. The Islamic Republic of Iran expects to see meaningful \n     realization of the fundamental shift in the Security \n     Council's approach envisaged in the preamble of Security \n     Council resolution 2231 (2015). The Council has an abysmal \n     track record in dealing with Iran, starting with its \n     acquiescing silence in the face of a war of aggression by \n     Saddam Hussain against Iran in 1980, its refusal from 1984 to \n     1988 to condemn, let alone act against, massive, systematic \n     and widespread use of chemical weapons against Iranian \n     soldiers and civilians by Saddam Hussain, and the continued \n     material and intelligence support for Saddam Hussain's \n     chemical warfare by several of its members. Even after Saddam \n     invaded Kuwait, the Security Council not only obdurately \n     refused to rectify its malice against the people of Iran, but \n     went even further and imposed ostensibly WMD-driven sanctions \n     against these victims of chemical warfare and the Council's \n     acquiescing silence. Instead of at least noting the fact that \n     Iran had not even retaliated against Saddam Hussain's use of \n     chemical weapons, the Council rushed to act on politically \n     charged baseless allegations against Iran and unjustifiably \n     imposed a wide range of sanctions against the Iranian people \n     as retribution for their resistance to coercive pressures to \n     abandon their peaceful nuclear programme. It is important to \n     remember that these sanctions, which should not have been \n     imposed in the first place, are the subject of removal under \n     the JCPOA and Security Council resolution 2231 (2015).\n       13. Therefore, the Islamic Republic of Iran continues to \n     insist that all sanctions and restrictive measures introduced \n     and applied against the people of Iran, including those \n     applied under the pretext of its nuclear programme, have been \n     baseless, unjust and unlawful. Hence, nothing in the JCPOA \n     shall be construed to imply, directly or indirectly, an \n     admission of or acquiescence by the Islamic Republic of Iran \n     in the legitimacy, validity or enforceability of the \n     sanctions and restrictive measures adopted against Iran by \n     the Security Council, the European Union or its member \n     States, the United States or any other State, nor shall it be \n     construed as a waiver or a limitation on the exercise of any \n     related right the Islamic Republic of Iran is entitled to \n     under relevant national legislation, international \n     instruments or legal principles.\n       14. The Islamic Republic of Iran is confident that the \n     good-faith implementation of the JCPOA by all its \n     participants will help restore the confidence of the Iranian \n     people, who have been unduly subjected to illegal pressure \n     and coercion under the pretext of this manufactured crisis, \n     and will open new possibilities for cooperation in dealing \n     with real global challenges and actual threats to regional \n     security. Our region has long been mired in undue tension \n     while extremists and terrorists continue to gain and maintain \n     ground. It is high time to redirect attention and focus on \n     these imminent threats and seek and pursue effective means to \n     defeat this common menace.\n\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. You want to know what the Iranians say about the \nreimposition of so-called snapback sanctions? Here is what they say: It \nis clearly spelled out in the agreement that both the European Union \nand the United States will refrain from reintroducing or reimposing the \nsanctions--now they are talking about Annex II sanctions--and \nrestrictive measures lifted under the agreement. It is understood that \nreintroduction or reimposition, including through extension of the \nsanctions and restrictive measures, will constitute significant \nnonperformance which would relieve Iran from its commitments to this \nagreement in whole or in part.\n  My colleague Senator Ayotte from New Hampshire yesterday asked \nSecretary Kerry and Secretary Lew about this provision. They did not \ngive a clear answer because there is no clear answer. Right now there \nis huge disagreement between the United States and Iran on the language \nin the agreement on whether, to what degree, these so-called snapback \nprovisions will work or will undermine our national security interests, \nwhich is what I believe they will do.\n  I have asked the administration to quit using that term. It is not in \nthe agreement. The language makes clear that it is going to take years. \nThere is no ``snap.'' If we ever use it, that is it for the agreement. \nThey have not given the Members of this body a straightforward answer \non that issue. We need to keep asking these kinds of questions. We need \nto keep doing our due diligence, but we need clarity. The American \npeople need clarity, not spin, on critical issues such as this side \nIAEA agreement, which nobody seems to have read, and we certainly have \nnot seen; the grandfather clause, which certainly looks like a \ngrandfather clause, but now we are told by Secretary Kerry is not a \ngrandfather clause; and perhaps, most importantly, this so-called \nsnapback provision which I believe is illusory and is aimed at us, not \nat the pariah state that we are all concerned about, and that is Iran.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Delaware, Mr. Coons, and I be permitted to proceed as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Collins and Mr. Coons pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 1911 are printed in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n               50th Anniversary of Medicare and Medicaid\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, 50 years ago today, President Lyndon \nJohnson signed into law the Social Security Act amendments that created \nMedicare and Medicaid. Our country slammed the door on the days when \nfar too many older people languished in poverty without the financial \nsecurity that comes from affordable, high-quality health care. It was a \nday when sick, older people were warehoused on poor farms and in \nalmshouses. Just picture that. On the edge of town we had older people, \nliterally without a shred of dignity, in what came to be known as \nalmshouses. But Lyndon Johnson and others said that had to be changed, \nand five decades ago it did. Today, more than 100 million Americans \nhave access to high-quality health care thanks to Medicare and \nMedicaid.\n  We can measure the remarkable success of these programs in so many \nways, but in my judgment, one of the most important and most appealing \naspects of Medicare and Medicaid is their ability to grow, their \nability to change, and their ability to evolve to meet the needs of our \ncountry. The reality is that Medicare in 2015 is very different from \nMedicare in 1965. Medicare in 1965 was about something like a broken \nankle. If it was a serious break, you would be in the hospital--Part A. \nIf it was not a particularly serious break, you would go to the \ndoctor--that was Part B. That was Medicare circa 1965. Today, Medicare \nis about chronic illness, it is about cancer, it is about diabetes, it \nis about stroke, and it is about heart disease. You put Alzheimer's in, \nand that is well more than 90 percent of the Medicare Program. So it is \na very different Medicare Program today than it was in 1965.\n\n  One of the aspects of Medicare and Medicaid I find so appealing is \nthey have shown a certain ability, a sense of creativity, to always \nevolve with the times.\n  What I would like to do is take a few minutes to describe how I think \nMedicare and Medicaid are going to change in the next 50 years because \nI think there are some remarkable developments ahead. I see my \nwonderful colleague from the Senate Committee on Finance. She has been \nvery involved in a number of these changes that have been so exciting \nin Medicare and Medicaid.\n  What I am going to do this afternoon is just take a few minutes to \ntalk about four or five trends that I think\n\n[[Page S6171]]\n\nare going to be led by these two programs that have done so much for \nseniors and vulnerable people in our country.\n  The first is, I believe Medicare and Medicaid are going to lead a \nrevolution in caring for vulnerable people at home. Our health care \nprograms are going to give seniors more of what they want, which is to \nsecure treatment at home where they are more comfortable. I think \npeople are going to be amazed to see that seniors will get more of what \nthey want, which is treatment at home--in Michigan, in Oregon, in \nNebraska--and we now have hard information that it will be less \nexpensive for older people to get what they want.\n  In the Affordable Care Act, I was able to author a provision with our \ncolleague, the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Markey, \nthe Independence At Home Program. This program has already shown it can \nsave more than $3,000, on average, for every patient who takes part.\n  So picture that. This is not an example of reducing the Medicare \nguarantee--these guaranteed secure benefits that older people in every \npart of America rely on. This is about protecting the Medicare \nguarantee and doing it in a way that keeps seniors happier and costs \nless money. That is a pretty good package by anybody's calculation.\n  In my home State of Oregon, the Medicaid Program also has a smart \npolicy that tracks this focus on caring for the vulnerable at home. In \neffect, what Oregon Medicaid has done is allow health care providers to \noffer services that go beyond what many might consider the textbook \ndefinition of a medical service. It is all about keeping people \nhealthier at home and out of the emergency room. So instead of waiting \nto treat broken ankles or wrists, perhaps in a hospital emergency room, \nafter a senior falls again and again and again, what we are now doing \nin Oregon Medicaid is saying the staff of this program will visit the \nsenior's home and perhaps replace the broken floorboards or the \ndangerous rugs that are causing the seniors to slip again and again and \ngo to the hospital emergency room.\n  Think about that. You could help a little bit at home by replacing a \ndangerous rug or you could have somebody slip and fall again and again \nand again and go to the hospital emergency room. Again, replacing that \ndangerous rug wouldn't probably meet the clinical definition of a \nmedical service as it was always determined in years past, but now we \nare seeing it as part of having older people in a position to be at \nhome, where they are more comfortable, for less money.\n  The second significant development where I think Medicare and \nMedicaid are going to lead is on pharmaceuticals. I think the pricing \nof prescription drugs in the future is going to be connected in some \nfashion to the value of treatment. We have seen remarkable changes in \npharmaceuticals. The reality is that in the last 10 years we have seen \nreal cures for illnesses where there was a death sentence perhaps a \ndecade ago, but the sticker prices on some of these pharmaceuticals are \nastronomical. For so many working-class families and seniors of modest \nmeans, they look at these prices and say this just defies common sense, \nand they seem to get more expensive over time. Sometimes there is a \nsix-figure pricetag.\n  The reality is Medicare and Medicaid weren't set up for these kinds \nof costs. The experts at the Congressional Budget Office are starting \nto ring the alarm bell, particularly about the health of Medicare Part \nD. Addressing this issue is going to take a lot of vigorous debate in \nthe Congress, but it can't be ducked any longer.\n  Senator Grassley and I have been working for about a year now in \nlooking into SOVALDI, one of the hepatitis C drugs, which has had \nenormous ramifications for health programs--Medicare, Medicaid, and \nothers--and we are continuing our work.\n  Third, in addition to pharmaceuticals and home care, I think Medicare \nis going to lead the revolution for open access to health care data. \nAgain, Senator Grassley and I have put a lot of sweat equity into the \nissue of data transparency in Medicare. It paid off in 2014, when the \nObama administration, to its credit, opened up a massive trove of \ninformation. The wave of disclosure that began, particularly with \ndoctors--and the Wall Street Journal reported this very extensively--\nmust keep rolling forward.\n\n  The next step is turning open data into valuable tools and getting \nthem into patients' hands. Health care data, packaged the right way, \nought to help seniors and others choose doctors and nursing homes. It \nought to help figure out which hospitals and specialists excel in \ncertain areas, and it ought to help show exactly what you get for your \ndollar with various treatments or doctors.\n  Fourth, I believe Medicare is going to lead the debate on improving \nend-of-life care. All the roads with respect to end-of-life care, in my \nview, point toward patients having more choices and a better quality of \nlife. In my view, we ought to make sure patients are in the driver's \nseat. In this regard, I was very pleased the Obama administration \nannounced just a few days ago a real breakthrough in terms of end-of-\nlife care. I think we have all had the debate. We certainly had that \ndebate in the Affordable Care Act, where we heard about seniors not \nbeing given the opportunity to choose life, to choose cures, and they \nwere going to, in effect, be receiving what amounted to death \nsentences.\n  In the Affordable Care Act, I was able to get included a provision \nthat made it clear that is not what this debate would be all about. For \nthe first time it would be possible for an individual who is receiving \nhospice care to also have the option for curative care. In other words, \nthey would not have to sacrifice one for the other. That is very \nimportant to patients because even when patients are contemplating the \nprospect of hospice care, they want to know--because it is almost in \nour gene pool as Americans, as Nebraskans, and Oregonians--whether \nthere may be a cure. Maybe our ingenuity will come up with a cure, and \nthey want to have that hope. Now they are going to have it.\n  The result of the change is called concurrent care--the Care Choices \nmodel. For the first time patients and families will be in the driver's \nseat and they will not have to give up the prospect of curative care in \norder to get hospice. For the first time we are giving those who want \ntreatment in hospice some real flexibility.\n  Next, I think Medicare is going to go further to protect Americans \nwith catastrophic coverage. The reality is that millions of Americans \nwho are younger than 65 are protected against the huge expense of an \naccident or serious illness. This is an area where I think Medicare, \nhaving led in so many areas with the kind of creative genius I have \ndescribed--going to show the way on home care, pharmaceuticals, end-of-\nlife care, and more access to data--that most advocates for seniors say \nMedicare has a little catching up to do. Seniors ought to have the \nsafety of an out-of-pocket maximum in Medicare.\n  I know this is an area I very much look forward to talking to my \ncolleague from Michigan about. She has been a wonderful advocate for \nseniors throughout all her career in public service. I think colleagues \non the Committee on Finance of both political parties are going to say, \nif there is catastrophic protection in the private sector, it is high \ntime we have it for seniors on Medicare. I think this is an area we \nwill also be talking about.\n  I want to wrap up with one last point; that is, about Medicaid. I \nalso believe more States are going to come around and expand their \nMedicaid Programs. It took nearly two decades for all 50 States to \nadopt Medicaid initially, so there is already a history of this \nunfolding over time.\n  When we look at the numbers, we see the proposition and the benefit \nof expanding Medicaid is not exactly some kind of theoretical notion. A \nnew study shows there is a gulf opening in terms of access to health \ncare between States that have expanded Medicaid and States that have \nnot.\n  In our country, everybody should have access to medical care, \nregardless of their ZIP Code, but it is not only a question of what is \nbest for the health of our people, it can often be pretty important to \na State's economy. A recent study found that Kentucky and their cost of \ncovering new Medicaid patients will be far outstripped by the other \neconomic benefits of expanding the program. In my view, more States are\n\n[[Page S6172]]\n\nlikely to do the right thing by their citizens and their economies, and \nthe gulf between those States that cover individuals on Medicaid and \nthose that do not will narrow.\n  Mr. President, I am going to close on a little bit of a personal \nnote. My background is working with older people. Years ago I was \ndirector of the Oregon Gray Panthers. It was an extraordinary honor to \nbe able to do this. Those were the days when if a town had a lunch \nprogram for older people, it was considered a big deal. Senator \nStabenow was starting her career in the Michigan Legislature, and she \nremembers those days. It was a big deal when a town just had a lunch \nprogram where older people could congregate. That was considered a \npretty serious array of senior services because you could get a few \nthings there where older people got lunch.\n  So as we have heard, now we are looking at the opportunities for \nextraordinary innovation.\n  Elizabeth Holmes was here today and had a chance to visit with \nseveral Members. She has taken the whole notion of personalized \nmedicine--and personalized medicine where in effect an individual could \norder their own test, and it costs only a few dollars. The State of \nArizona has already embraced it. She is talking to government officials \nabout something that would empower patients and would make sense from a \nhealth quality standpoint and from the standpoint of cost.\n  She is a young, very gifted woman. I believe she is a graduate of \nStanford, my alma mater. I talked yesterday to her about this. I could \njust see the enthusiasm for the future of health care and what she has \nalready been able to accomplish and what she is going to be able to do \nin the days ahead with this new focus on personalized medicine and \ntests that empower patients to make their own decisions about health \ncare. As to the sums of money that are involved for the tests, I am not \nsure they are even going to be able to be processed by government \ncomputers because they are too small. We are going to save too much \nmoney. So there are going to be very exciting developments ahead for \nMedicare and Medicaid.\n  The last 50 years have been an extraordinary run for these programs. \nIt is a personal thrill for me to have been involved in the early years \nof these programs. Now they are essential to the well-being of more \nthan 100 million Americans.\n  We take this special day to kind of savor how much progress has been \nmade from the days when America had poorhouses and almshouses for \nseniors to today, where Medicare is leading the way on home care and \ndisclosing data and looking at new approaches with respect to health \ntests, such as what Elizabeth Holmes has been here to visit on. We can \nsee that with Medicare and Medicaid, their particular genius is that \nthey are always keeping up with the times and looking to new approaches \nthat better meet the needs of older people and do it in an affordable \nfashion.\n  I will close by way of saying that I don't think there is a single \narea I have talked about--I know my colleague and the Chair are members \nof a different political parties--or I don't think there is a single \nissue that I have brought up here in the last 15 or 20 minutes that \nDemocrats and Republicans can't find common ground on. In fact, \nChairman Hatch in the Finance Committee, to his credit, has said that \nby the end of the year he wants Democrats and Republicans on our \ncommittee to produce a bill dealing with chronic illness--which, as I \nsuggested, is what Medicare is all about and is responsible for 90 \npercent of the spending. So on that hopeful note, after an incredible \n50-year run, I think the next 50 years are going to be even better. In \nthe four or five areas that I have been talking about for a few \nminutes, I don't think there is a one of them where Democrats and \nRepublicans can't find common ground.\n  I know my colleague from Michigan is waiting to speak. I will note as \nI wrap up that she has really been a leader in this field, particularly \nin getting Democrats and Republicans together. By the way, as she \nbegins her speech, I would note that many Americans are going to \nreceive better mental health care services in the years ahead largely \ndue to the work--the bipartisan work--of my colleague on these issues.\n  So I am happy to wrap up my comments and look forward to hearing from \nmy colleague from Michigan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, before my friend from Oregon leaves, I \nwish to make a couple of comments about our leader on the Finance \nCommittee. Sitting and listening to him about his optimism and \nhopefulness really helps me have optimism so we can actually come \ntogether and get things done.\n  I can't think of anybody who, first of all, is more creative or \nwilling to look at all kinds of ideas in order to be able to strengthen \nhealth care--Medicare, Medicaid--for quality and cost containment \nissues. Back during health care reform, I was proud to join Senator \nWyden on what I believe was an extremely thoughtful approach around \nhealth care. Again, I very much appreciate all that he does.\n  I have to say that I know he has reminded me many times about coming \nto the Senate and elected office from the early years with Gray \nPanthers and organizing for seniors. I come to public-service elected \noffice after a big fight to save the county nursing home in Ingham \nCounty, Michigan. So we both came to public service fighting for health \ncare for older Americans. It is my honor to continue to serve with him \nand also with the Senator from Pennsylvania, who has joined us on the \nfloor as well.\n  I do in fact come to recognize the 50th anniversary of the signing of \nMedicare and Medicaid into law. I view these as great American success \nstories and the best about us in terms of our values. I think it is \nimportant, though, when we look at this, to sort of say: This is \nThursday; we are going to do a ``Throwback Thursday'' moment here, and \nlook at the context in which these programs were created.\n  There was the early 1960s. It was a time of great social upheaval. It \nwas a time, frankly, of segregation and Jim Crow laws and a time also \nwhen there was no safety net for older Americans or Americans with \ndisabilities when it came to the possibility of going to the doctor or \ngetting the medical care that people needed. If someone was living in \npoverty, they simply could not afford to see a doctor to be able to get \nmedical care for them or for their family.\n  But within the civil rights movement, our Nation became more attuned \nto the injustices of society for people of color as well as those in \nsociety who were struggling with illnesses--just basic health care \nneeds--or with poverty.\n  In 1963, in his ``I Have a Dream'' speech, Martin Luther King \nchallenged Americans to live out the true meaning of the creed of our \nNation, the Declaration of Independence: that all men and women are \ncreated equal, and that all of us are entitled to life and liberty and \nthe pursuit of happiness. I think that includes access to health care \nfor ourselves and our families. Our country responded to that challenge \nthrough the passage of the Civil Rights Act and through the passage 50 \nyears ago of legislation that created Medicare and Medicaid. This was a \nmomentous event in our Nation's history. It demonstrated our \nwillingness to take action to ensure that our Nation's laws were in \nline with our core values as a country. It is so important that we be \nworking together to do that again. That is what we should be doing \nevery day.\n  Let's remember that before the creation of Medicare, only half of our \nseniors had health insurance or could even find health insurance. That \nmeant half of them were struggling probably to get the medical care \nthey needed or they were going into an emergency room--which, by the \nway, is the most expensive way--to be treated rather than going to the \ndoctor and getting preventative care and so on. We saw about half of \nour seniors and people with disabilities in that situation.\n  President Lyndon B. Johnson was the strong principled leader we \nneeded in that moment, and 50 years ago he signed the Medicare bill \ninto law. When he did, he said:\n\n       No longer will older Americans be denied the healing \n     miracle of modern medicine. No longer will illness crush and \n     destroy the savings that they have so carefully put away over \n     a lifetime so that they might enjoy dignity in their later \n     years.\n\n\n[[Page S6173]]\n\n\n  The Medicare Program really is a great American success story that \nconnects all of us together--each generation--and each generation has \ndone its part to strengthen that, including our own. That is why it is \nso important that we not go backwards at this time. This is where, \nunfortunately, we see a real difference here in the Senate and the \nHouse and in the political discourse more broadly, because we have \nseen, unfortunately, a Republican budget--House and Senate--that has \npassed this year with almost $500 billion in Medicare cuts, efforts to \nturn the system away from a universal program into something that--\nwhether we call it vouchers or whether we have other names for it--\nwould take away the confidence and ability for older people and people \nwith disabilities to know they have health care, which is what Medicare \nis all about.\n  What we need to be doing instead of those things--and we even have \nPresidential candidates saying we should phase out Medicare. We should \nnot be doing that. We should be working to ensure the programs' health \nand longevity so people are confident that, as they work and pay into \nthe system--because, by the way, people are paying into this system--it \nwill be there when they retire in terms of a health care system for \nthem.\n  I also very much appreciate our ranking member in the Finance \nCommittee talking about the new things we need to do. I will just \nmention one. When we look at Medicare, $1 out of $5 today is spent on \nAlzheimer's, as our ranking member knows. So many of us are working \ntogether. There are bipartisan efforts going on to tackle this \nquestion. Senator Collins from Maine and I have what is called the HOPE \nfor Alzheimer's Act. Senator Collins is also working very hard and has \nin fact increased research, which is so important. But we need to know \nthat we are doing everything we can to support Alzheimer's patients and \ntheir families and to find cures.\n  The exciting part is that we are seeing more and more opportunities \nthrough research. I have had so many conversations with researchers in \nMichigan and across the country. We are so close in so many areas to be \nable to break through if we don't go backwards on research funding, as \nunfortunately happens if we are not coming together and appropriately \nfunding the budget.\n  So there are a lot of things we need to do: save dollars, increase \nquality, and make sure we are tackling the challenges right now of \nhealth care for older Americans. I am constantly reminded that in my \nState there are nearly half a million people right now who get their \nhealth care through Medicare and some 40 million nationwide.\n  I will talk for a minute now about the other path on that \nlegislation, which is Medicaid. Now, that program came in response to a \ncrisis in health care for low-income Americans and those with \ndisabilities as well, and it has been nothing less than a lifeline for \npeople, saving lives now for 50 years. During this last great recession \nthat we had, there were so many families struggling to pay for basic \nhealth care needs that Medicaid literally was the saving grace that \nhelped them and their families get back on their feet.\n  Medicaid is especially vital to women. Nearly half of all births in \nour country are funded through Medicaid. It gives young women access to \npreventative services such as cancer screenings.\n  I would also again thank our ranking member and our chairman for \nincluding legislation on Medicaid and a series of bipartisan bills that \njust passed the Senate Finance Committee. The Quality Care for Moms and \nBabies Act is about making sure we have quality standards across the \ncountry for low-income moms who are pregnant, going through prenatal \ncare, delivery, and for babies. Senator Grassley from Iowa is my \npartner in that effort.\n  It is also critical to note that on Medicaid, actually 80 percent of \nthe dollars goes to long-term care for low-income seniors. As I said in \nthe beginning, when I got involved in this whole process of public \nservice and elected office, it was because of a nursing home that took \nMedicaid and helped low-income seniors be able to have a nursing home. \nIn fact, 80 percent of Medicaid goes for seniors in nursing homes and \nlong-term care.\n  Unfortunately, as with Medicare, what we have seen in the budgets is \nthis: Rather than working together to strengthen Medicaid, we have seen \ncountless attacks over and over to cut funding, to block grant the \nprogram. Over $1 trillion in the next 10 years to cut Medicaid was \nactually passed by the Republican majority in the House and the Senate.\n  That is not the direction we need to go in as we are celebrating the \n50th anniversary of Medicare and Medicaid. We still have Governors who \nrefuse to use funding that is available to them to cover their seniors \nin nursing homes under Medicaid or moms and babies, families--low-\nincome working families.\n  We put into the Affordable Care Act the ability for people who are \nworking in low-paying jobs to be able to have access to health care \nthrough Medicaid. Yet we still have 3.7 million Americans who can't get \nhealth care. It is not because the money is not there but because of \npolitics. I think that is pretty outrageous.\n  Of the 3.7 million, 2 million are women. That is 2 million women who \ncan't get health care services, whether it is screenings or mammograms, \nthey can't get coverage for labor, delivery, and prenatal care. It is \navailable. It is right there. It is not happening because of politics.\n  I am determined--as I know our ranking member is and my Democratic \ncolleagues are as well--to make sure we are standing up for Medicare \nand Medicaid every single day. Medicaid is a program that allows 72 \nmillion Americans--including nearly 13 million working Americans, low-\nincome working Americans who have gotten coverage because of the \nAffordable Care Act--to be able to go to bed at night with the \nknowledge that if their children get sick, they will be able to take \nthem to the doctor or for any of us, if our parents or grandparents \nneed a nursing home, they will be able to have one.\n  Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program together provide \n33 million children with the ability to see a doctor, to get the \noperation they need, to be able to have their juvenile diabetes taken \ncare of or other health care issues.\n  Today is not just an anniversary of programs. I think it is an \nopportunity to recommit ourselves to the ideals that created these \nprograms, the values that are behind these programs, and to say that \nhealth care is pretty important to families.\n  Now, 50 years ago we decided for our seniors we were going to make \nsure they could live in dignity in retirement and know they were going \nto be able to get the health care they needed. People are living longer \nand healthier lives. People are living today because of Medicare, \nSocial Security, and Medicaid, all together. That is a great thing. We \nshould be celebrating the fact that President Johnson, working with the \nCongress, got that done.\n  I believe this is the kind of approach we need to continue to \nstrengthen for future generations. There is a huge divide right now \nabout what to do on these programs, unfortunately, but I can say that \nwe as Democrats are recommitting ourselves to a strong Medicare Program \nand a strong Medicaid Program for the future for American families.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise as well--as the senior Senator from \nMichigan just told us--to highlight and celebrate this anniversary, 50 \nyears for both Medicare and Medicaid.\n  I am going to focus my remarks on Medicaid and to say, first, that \ncontrary to what we often hear about an important program such as this, \nMedicaid is working. Medicaid is helping tens of millions of Americans. \nWe can all come up with ways to make changes, and we probably will over \nthe next couple of years, but Medicaid is maybe one of the most \nunderrated health care programs in recent American history, for sure, \nand it is not simply millions who are benefiting from Medicaid but tens \nof millions. There are 68 million Americans who are Medicaid \nbeneficiaries nationally and 36 million of them are children.\n  When folks talk about families and children and the priority we place \non helping our families, I hope that means\n\n[[Page S6174]]\n\nstrengthening Medicaid, not slashing it, not destroying it, and not \ntaking some of the steps that have been proposed in Washington over the \nlast couple years.\n  It is interesting, about 45 percent of all births in the country are \npaid for by Medicaid. So 45 percent of the babies born in America are \non this Earth because they have the Medicaid Program to pay for the \ncost of the birth, which is not inexpensive. On the other end of the \nage spectrum, about 60 percent of nursing home placements in the \ncountry come through Medicaid. This isn't a program for someone else \nfar away. This is a program that affects most of America. A lot of \nlower middle income families and others have the opportunity to place a \nloved one in a nursing home because of Medicaid, as well as what I said \nabout the births.\n  Another way to think about Medicaid is the impact on children across \nthe country--not only children in urban areas or children in \ncommunities where most families are low-income. When you examine both \nhealth care for children as it relates to Medicaid and to children who \nreceive health care through the Children's Health Insurance Program--\nwhich in Pennsylvania we call CHIP--in rural areas that number is very \nhigh. There was a study done last fall that 47 percent of rural \nchildren get their health care from either Medicaid or from the CHIP \nprogram--actually, a higher percentage of the children in rural areas \nthan in urban areas.\n  This is serious business when we talk about highlighting the benefits \nof Medicaid--not just celebrating an anniversary but celebrating \nworking and having a sense of purpose and solidarity about preserving \nMedicaid for our families and strengthening it where we can.\n  One of the reasons Medicaid has been so successful over time is \nbecause of some of the strategies that were embedded in the program \nmany years ago, especially as it relates to children. We know Medicaid \nserves children. It serves individuals with disabilities. In fact, that \nis a big number as well. Now, 8.8 million nonelderly individuals with \ndisabilities are Medicaid beneficiaries nationally. It serves \nindividuals with disabilities. But when you focus just on children as a \nsegment of Medicaid, here is what we find in one of the strategies put \nin place years ago: The so-called EPSDT--Early Periodic Screening, \nDiagnosis, and Treatment Program--that benefit is of substantial \nsignificance for the future of our children and therefore the future of \nour country. Early periodic screening, diagnosis, and treatment is \nresponsible for making sure vulnerable children receive quality and \ncomprehensive care. Private insurance companies should emulate in their \ncare what is provided in the so-called EPSDT.\n\n  Twenty-five million low-income children have access to this important \nprogram through Medicaid. What is it? I think it is evident from the \nname, but it is good to highlight what it means. First of all, the \n``early'' part of it is the early access in identifying problems early. \nThe second word is ``periodic,'' which means checking children's health \nat periodic age-appropriate intervals. ``Screening'' is self-evident, \nbut maybe you don't remember what is behind the screening. It is \nproviding physical, mental, developmental, dental, hearing, vision, and \nother screening tests to detect potential problems. The ``screening'' \npart of early periodic screening, diagnosis, and treatment is vital. \n``Diagnostic'' is performing a diagnostic test to follow up when a risk \nis identified. ``Treatment'' is control, correct or reduce health \nproblems when they are found.\n  This isn't just vital to the life of that child and his or her family \nand his or her ability to grow and learn in school and then succeed and \nget a job and contribute to our country, it is also important to the \nrest of us. We are going to be a much stronger country if children are \nthe beneficiaries of preventative health care. We all know that. The \ndata has been telling us that for decades. We are just starting to get \nabout the business of finally, at long last, doing more preventative \nwork in our health care system, just like Medicaid has been doing on \nbehalf of children for many years. I think we are learning some lessons \nfrom Medicaid that can be applied to the rest of our health care \nsystem.\n  I know we are short on time because we have a number of people who \nwant to make presentations today. I will reduce my remarks in this \nfashion. I will tell one story from my home State. Here is one example \nof a particular family, the Sinclair family. In this case, Owen \nSinclair was born with a genetic defect with wide-ranging effects. His \naorta wraps around his trachea and esophagus. He has trouble \nswallowing, jaundice, and has other organs that are malformed because \nof his condition. He needed extensive treatment at a specialized unit \nof the local children's hospital in Pennsylvania. After birth, he had \nto stay in the hospital on and off for most of the first 6 months of \nhis life, but his parents' insurance only covered him for 30 days after \nbirth. The tests and treatments and the surgeries and medications were \nfar beyond the income of his parents. In the first 30 days, their \ncopays alone were more than $15,000--30 days, $15,000. Medicaid \nliterally saved this child's life. Owen Sinclair needs continuing \ntesting, treatment, and nutrition support. The Sinclairs worry about \ntheir little boy, but at least they don't have to worry about going \nbankrupt because they love him and want him to get the medical care he \nneeds.\n  That is the real world of the substantial and immeasurable benefits \nthat Medicaid provides in the life of a child, the life of a family, \nand obviously in the life of our Nation's future.\n  We have to do more today than just celebrate 50 years. That is nice. \nWe should all take time to celebrate, but we have to be committed and \nrecommitted to the future of Medicaid, to strengthen it, to support \nit--not to undermine it and not to destroy the benefits we all know are \nvital to our children, vital to their future development, and vital to \nhelp them learn. If kids learn more when they are young, they are going \nto earn more later. We are all better off for that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Barrasso). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I also rise to celebrate this important \nanniversary. Fifty years ago today, President Lyndon Baines Johnson \nsigned into law Medicaid and Medicare with my favorite President \nsitting next to him, President Harry S. Truman.\n  Mr. President, I came up and asked you a question, and I am proud to \ntell the whole Chamber, as everybody is listening, there is only, I \nthink, one Member of the current U.S. Senate who was at the \ninauguration of LBJ, and it is the Presiding Officer, the Senator from \nWyoming, who was at that inauguration in January of 1964.\n  Clearly, the signature of Medicare and Medicaid was one of President \nJohnson's and one of our Nation's proudest legislative achievements. \nMedicare is the landmark program which makes sure seniors have access \nto health care, and Medicaid is equally critical. It helps low-income \nseniors, children, and people with disabilities get their necessary \nhealth care.\n  Today I wish to talk about Medicaid. Others have spoken about \nMedicare earlier. Senator Casey did a good job speaking about Medicaid, \nand I want to do the same because I have seen the success of Medicaid \nas a mayor and as a Governor, and now as a Senator, it is absolutely \ncritical.\n  In 2014, as Senator Casey mentioned, Medicaid provided health \ncoverage to nearly 70 million Americans, including 1 million \nVirginians. In Virginia, about 600,000 children, 2 out of every 7 kids, \nare covered through Medicaid or its companion program CHIP. Medicaid is \nimportant. The Presiding Officer is a physician, so he knows that \nMedicaid is not just coverage to get health care when you need it, it \nis also about financial security because health care bills are often \nwhat push families into bankruptcy or into financially stressful \nsituations, so the Medicaid coverage that covers 70 million Americans \ngives them financial stability.\n  Medicaid is about peace of mind. If you are completely healthy, but \nyou are going to sleep at night wondering what will happen if your wife \nis in an auto accident or if your child becomes ill, that is a source \nof anxiety that is helped a little bit by having the coverage that \nMedicaid provides.\n  It is also for people with disabilities. This is important to note. \nIt is about independence. A lot of citizens with disabilities, because \nthey are able to be on Medicaid, are able to work part\n\n[[Page S6175]]\n\ntime because Medicaid provides them with coverage that enables them to \nlive independent lives. That is what Medicaid is about.\n  Now, today at 50, we think Medicaid is a given, but let me remind \neverybody that Medicaid was controversial when it was passed 50 years \nago. In the House and Senate there were a lot of ``no'' votes, and \nMedicaid was an opt-in program, not a mandate. States could decide \nwhether to opt-in or not. A lot of States chose not to be a part of \nMedicaid. They were the slowpoke States.\n  I think every family knows what I mean. Every family probably has a \nslowpoke. Frankly, I have a sister-in-law who is a slowpoke. If we are \ntrying to go to church, a restaurant, or anywhere, we can always know \nthat whatever time we say we will go, we will have this one family \nmember who will likely be the slowpoke and hold everybody back.\n  Well, States were like that in 1965. A lot of States wouldn't sign on \nto Medicaid. By 1972, 7 years later, 49 States had embraced Medicaid, \nbut the 50th State, Arizona, didn't embrace Medicaid until 1982. It \ntook them 17 years to embrace Medicaid. Arizona was the original \nMedicaid slowpoke. So Medicaid is now 50 years old. It was \ncontroversial at first, increasingly accepted, and later embraced. It \nkind of sounds familiar to me.\n  The biggest change in the health care system since the signing of \nMedicaid and Medicare was the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care \nAct has so many benefits, such as protecting people with preexisting \nconditions, rebating premiums back to folks if they have to overpay \ntheir health insurers, making sure women don't have to pay different \npremiums than men, and there are so many other benefits. But the \nbiggest benefit of the Affordable Care Act is that in the United States \nright now there are 16 million people with health insurance coverage \nwho didn't have it before and are now able to walk around, go to work, \nand be with their families because of the expansion of Medicaid. \nSixteen million is a very big number. I will put that in perspective. \nThere are 16 million people who didn't have health insurance before and \nnow have health insurance coverage because of the ACA. Sixteen million \nis the combined population of Alaska, Delaware, the District of \nColumbia, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New \nMexico, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, West \nVirginia, and Wyoming. The combined population of 15 States, plus the \nDistrict of Columbia, has health care coverage because of the \nAffordable Care Act. But there is more to do.\n  One piece of the ACA is the ability of States to expand Medicaid to \ncover those who make up to $16,000 a year. It is optional, just as \nMedicaid was in 1965. Thirty-one States have embraced the Medicaid \nexpansion, but as of today, we have 19 slowpokes, and I am sad to say \nthat Virginia is one of the slowpokes. Despite the best efforts of our \ncurrent Governor, working so hard to try to get the State to accept \nMedicaid expansion, so far the legislature has blocked him from doing \nso.\n  This is just like 1965, 50 years ago. There are States that get it \nand embrace the program, and then there are the slowpoke States.\n  I am here today not just to say happy birthday to Medicaid and \nMedicare, but to urge Virginia and the other slowpokes to get with the \nprogram. Here is what it would mean in Virginia: If Virginia accepts \nthe Medicaid expansion, it will open up the possibility of health care \ncoverage to another 400,000 people. It would provide health care, \nfinancial security, independence for those with disabilities, and peace \nof mind even when you are well. If all 19 slowpoke States get on board, \nan additional 4 million Americans would get health insurance, which \nwould take the ACA coverage number up to 20. Those are all the States I \nmentioned earlier, plus the State of Nevada--16 States and the District \nof Columbia.\n  Now, you shouldn't be consigned to second-class health status in this \ncountry because you live in one of the 19 slowpoke States, especially \nsince your taxpayers are paying taxes to provide you coverage.\n  Senator Brown and I have authored a letter, which has been signed by \nmany in this body, to the 19 slowpoke States. We asked them to join the \nprogram during Medicaid's 50th year. The program has an amazing legacy \nand a bright future. Don't be a slowpoke.\n  Remember how I said that Arizona was the original slowpoke? It was \nthe last State--17 years later--to embrace Medicaid in 1982. Well, they \nmay have been the original slowpoke, but when it came to the ACA, they \nlearned something. Arizona--with a Republican Governor, two Republican \nSenators, a Republican State legislature, an overwhelmingly Republican \ncongressional delegation, and votes for Republican candidates in \nPresidential elections--is not a slowpoke. Arizona has embraced the \nACA. They are now a jackrabbit. Good for them. I hope Virginia joins \nthem soon. I hope that all remaining 19 States join them soon, and I \nhope that 4 million more Americans can have health insurance coverage \nwith the health, financial security, and peace of mind that that will \nprovide.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                     Drinking Water Protection Act\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the Drinking Water \nProtection Act. This is commonsense, bipartisan legislation. Nobody \nopposes it on the merits, and it is urgent we get it done for my home \nState of Ohio and States all around the country.\n  What could be more important than having access to clean drinking \nwater? There are a lot of pollutants in the water that contribute to \nnot having clean drinking water. Of particular concern to us right now \nin Ohio are the toxins in the harmful algal blooms. This is blue-green \nalgae that appears in both fresh water and saltwater. In the case of \ndrinking water, unfortunately, it is finding its way into more and more \nfresh water bodies that provide drinking water.\n  This is something that is a big concern, not just for drinking water, \nbut it can also cause illness or death in humans, pets, wildlife, and \nit is doing so, unfortunately, in my State of Ohio and around the \ncountry. If not confronted, these toxins will continue to contaminate \nour lakes and other fresh water bodies. Unfortunately, in Ohio we are \nall too familiar with this.\n  About a year ago, last summer, Toledo had to actually shut down the \nuse of their water supply. They had to tell people there was a ban on \ndrinking water. It was a big deal. Up to 500,000 people were affected. \nI was actually back home in Ohio because this happened over a weekend, \nand I filled up my pickup truck with bottled water and made a beeline \nfor Toledo because people were desperate. I was able to pass out \nbottled water and also work with the local officials to try to get the \ntesting done by EPA and to be sure that we could clean up the water \nsupply.\n  It took a while, and you can imagine the impact on Toledo and the \nimpact on so many other people now all over the northern part of Ohio \nwho depend on Lake Erie for their water supply because they are \nwondering--again, this year we have a heavy toxic algal bloom forming. \nWhat is going to happen to their water supply?\n  Unfortunately, it not just Cleveland, Toledo, and cities along the \nlake. Celina, OH, which is further south but gets its water from Grand \nLakes St. Marys, which is another fresh water lake. It is actually a \nreservoir and the water supply for Celina, among other things. Celina \nhas spent over $400,000 annually just to combat the algae in Grand \nLakes St. Marys.\n  Columbus was forced to spend over $700,000 to mitigate an algae \noutbreak at the Hoover Reservoir in 2013. Buckeye Lake in Ohio has also \nbeen affected by this. Again, it is not just Ohio; it is happening, \nunfortunately, around the country.\n  These harmful algal blooms continue to put public safety and health \nat risk. We have to keep our fresh water resources safe so our drinking \nwater isn't threatened, and natural habitats and echo systems are \nprotected.\n  By the way, this isn't just about drinking water either. Our \nwaterways are important economic engines as well. Lake Erie, as an \nexample, brought in $1.8 billion in business activity last year just \nthrough the fishing industry, and $226 million in taxes in 2013 alone. \nTourism around the lake now supports one in four private sector jobs.\n\n[[Page S6176]]\n\n  I was at Lake Erie last weekend, and I had the chance to go out on \nLake Erie. I was out there with Captain Dave Spangler. This is Dave \nSpangler. Dave was the charter boat Captain of the Year in 2014, and \nthe reason he became the charter boat Captain of the Year is not only \nbecause he is a great fishermen and knows how to find the fish, but he \nis a good steward of Lake Erie. He gets out there, along with other \ncharter boat captains, and they actually monitor the quality of the \nwater, including taking samples.\n  This is one of the samples that he took. This is what I saw when I \nwas on Lake Erie. If you look at it, you can see that it is a jar. I \nwas told I couldn't bring it on the floor today because I brought it \nback to DC with me from Ohio, but I wanted to have a photograph of it.\n  This is what it looks like. This is the blue-green algae that are in \nthat water. This is the stuff that is cutting off the oxygen supply for \nthe fish, creating toxins so you can't swim in it, and it is also \ncontaminating the drinking water if you get too much of it, as we did \nlast year. We are fearful that it might happen again this year because \nit is another bad year. The weather patterns were all wrong. There was \na lot of rain early on; therefore, a lot of runoff, and now a lot of \nheat and stillness on the lake which creates the algal bloom. This is a \nreal problem for us right now, and it is a real concern to the people I \nrepresent in Ohio but also to places all over the country that are \ndealing with this issue.\n  After we were out on Lake Erie, we hosted a townhall meeting where \npeople came in from the area. This included not only fishing boat \ncaptains, but also small business owners, marina owners. It included \npeople who are living along the lake, residents who are very concerned \nabout the future of the lake. We had a bunch of experts there. We \ntalked about the algal blooms and how to deal with it. It all came back \nto the fact that we have to take action at the local, State, and \nFederal levels.\n  We have passed legislation on this. We passed it last year. It has \nbeen helpful at the Federal level. We have come up with a new bill that \nwill help to deal with this issue by forcing the Federal departments \nand agencies to work better together to come up with a report on how to \nbetter monitor what is happening, how to ensure that we have a \nstrategic plan that actually identifies the human health risks from \ncontaminated algal toxins and recommends feasible treatment options, \nincluding procedures on how to prevent algal toxins from reaching these \nlocal supplies in the first place, and of course to mitigate adverse \npublic effects of algal toxins.\n  This is an appropriate role for the EPA. It is an appropriate role \nfor NOAA, by the way, to do the monitoring because they have satellites \nthat can help us to monitor what is happening on Lake Erie and other \nfresh water supplies for drinking water around the country.\n  This is a critical piece of legislation. It was introduced in the \nHouse by Congressman Bob Latta. It was supported on a bipartisan basis \nin the U.S. House. They have already passed it in the House of \nRepresentatives. They passed it in February. It passed by an \noverwhelming vote of 375 to 37.\n  It then came over here to the Senate where Sherrod Brown, my \ncolleague from Ohio, and I had drafted legislation on this. I commend \nSenator Brown, who was just down here on the floor. We were just \ntalking about this legislation. We put it into the process here to \nbegin getting it cleared by Democrats and Republicans back in March. So \nfor 4 and \\1/2\\ months, we have been trying to clear this legislation.\n  This week, I learned that the legislation is cleared, that nobody has \nsubstantive concerns with it, and we can finally move forward with it, \nand none too soon. We need this help, and we need it now. The people \nwho live along the lake and get their drinking water from these \nreservoirs and other lakes I talked about are worried, and for some \nvery good reasons. By the way, they are closing down beaches in my area \nbecause of this. There are pets and people who are seeing negative \nhealth effects from it.\n  We need to get the EPA more engaged and involved. We have a \nbipartisan way to do that. Again, it passed the House by an \noverwhelming 375 to 37 vote.\n  I am hopeful we can get this legislation passed tonight by a voice \nvote. We need to do everything we can to bring the Federal resources \ntogether, along with State and local governments and local conservation \ngroups to combat this threat.\n  This is something, again, that is a no-brainer, as they say. It is \none that everybody supports. It is one that is an urgent matter for us \nin Ohio. It is a matter that is of great concern to us right now. We \nneed to get it moving, and it is one where we have bipartisan and \nbicameral support.\n  If we act tonight to clear this legislation and get it done, it will \ngo to the President's desk for signature. And, of course, the President \nwill sign it. Why? Because it is good, commonsense, bipartisan \nlegislation that engages the EPA in an appropriate role to ensure that \nwe can deal with these harmful algal blooms before they cause more \ndamage and before we have another huge drinking crisis, just as we had \nlast summer, in Toledo, OH.\n  So tonight I am going to ask my colleagues to pass this legislation. \nI am going to ask that there be a voice vote on it. I hope that this \nwill go smoothly and that we can get this done.\n  Again, for 4\\1/2\\ months we have had this out there. Everybody has \nhad a chance to look at it. There are no substantive concerns with it.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 212\n\n  So at this time I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed \nto this legislation, which is H.R. 212, which is at the desk; that the \nbill be read a third time; and that the Senate vote on passage of the \nbill with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, with great respect for my colleague from \nOregon, I object. But I object because there is an additional \nbipartisan proposal that is out there and another unanimous consent \nrequest where this bill is paired with another bill.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 212 and S. 1523\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the EPW Committee be discharged from \nfurther consideration of H.R. 212, a bill to provide for the assessment \nand management of the risk of algal toxins in drinking water, and S. \n1523, a bill to reauthorize the National Estuary Program; further, that \nthe Senate proceed to their immediate consideration en bloc; that the \nSenate proceed to vote on passage of the bills and the motions to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard to the request of the \nSenator from Ohio.\n  Is there objection to the request of the Senator from New Mexico?\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I don't \nknow what the Senator from New Mexico is talking about, to be honest. \nHe is my friend and colleague. I will say that I am from Ohio, not \nOregon.\n  We just talked about the importance of this bill to Ohio. It is also \nimportant to Oregon and to the Senator's State of New Mexico and to \nother States around this country. There is no paired bill with this. I \nam talking about a bill that has been around here for 4\\1/2\\ months. It \nhas been cleared. There are no substantive concerns. My understanding \nis that the Senator from New Mexico is talking about a bill that is \nstill in committee. It has not even come out of committee. It is not a \nHouse bill. In other words, it hasn't been passed in the House. It is \nnot going to go to the President's desk for his signature.\n  I would be shocked if my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nsay they are going to block this commonsense, bipartisan bill that \nSenator Sherrod Brown and I have worked steadfastly on with both sides \nof the Capitol to get this done tonight on an urgent basis because we \nhave to get it done. Ours has been out here for 4\\1/2\\ months; we \ndidn't hear about yours until 45 minutes ago--45 minutes versus 4\\1/2\\ \nmonths.\n  If the Senator from New Mexico wants to block this for other reasons, \nhe ought to say so. But if he is blocking it because there is a \npairing--there is no pairing. Maybe he is trying to pair it with \nsomething in committee.\n  But let's get this done. This is not a difficult issue. This is one \nwhere we\n\n[[Page S6177]]\n\nhave total agreement. There is no substantive concern. I would urge my \ncolleague to allow us to get this done tonight, and then I am happy--\nhappy--to work on this other bill, whatever it is--of course, we don't \nknow because I just heard about it 45 minutes ago. In fact, I just \ndirected the staff, because I just heard about it when I came here, to \ngo ahead and run the hotline on the other bill. So we have already done \nthat, and we will see what comes back. I know what is going to come \nback, which is people are going to say, probably on both sides of the \naisle, we haven't had a chance to look at this. It hasn't been out for \n4\\1/2\\ months; it has been out here for a couple of minutes. It was \njust a couple of minutes ago that we heard about it.\n  So I can't believe we are going to block this tonight in order to say \nwe have to move something that is in committee, has not been passed by \nthe House, will not go to the President for his signature, and has not \nbeen through any process, as this has been.\n  I urge my colleague and my friend to withdraw his objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection from the Senator from Ohio?\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, just to clarify, the bill that it is being \npaired with is S. 1523. It is a bipartisan bill in the same committee. \nThe proposal to pair them has come from the committee chairman, \nChairman Inhofe. So that is the reason for the pairing. They are both \nsitting in the EPW Committee. The chairman believes this is the way to \nproceed.\n  That is the state of play as it is right now. I would say that with \nall due respect to my colleague from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I find it very strange that Senator \nInhofe has somehow objected since he has signed off on this. It has \nbeen totally cleared. This has been cleared to have a voice vote and to \nhave it done tonight. There is no objection from Senator Inhofe. He has \ncleared it. So I would check the Senator's sources on that.\n  I would just say I am really disappointed that this legislation that \nmakes so much sense, that is needed right now in my home State of Ohio, \nis being blocked, and I don't know why it is being blocked. I assume \nthere are some reasons that aren't being discussed tonight. This is \nvery disappointing to me.\n  We are going to try this again on Monday. We are going to try it \nagain on Tuesday. We are going to try it again on Wednesday. I would \nurge my colleagues on that side of the aisle to please allow us to get \nthis done. Allow us to provide some relief right now.\n  If my colleague was up there with me in Lake Erie talking with these \npeople--talking to the folks who had to go through this water crisis \nlast summer; who are worried about what is going to happen this summer; \nwho are being told they can't use the beaches; the fishing captains are \nworried about their businesses; the small businesses; the marinas; the \nfolks who are not allowing their pets to walk along the lakes and drink \nthe water--I think he would feel differently about it.\n  Let's get this done. This is not an example of something that should \nrequire some sort of partisan exercise. Let's do this in a nonpartisan \nway. Senator Sherrod Brown and I have been working on this for 4\\1/2\\ \nmonths. I am disappointed we can't move it tonight--very disappointed--\nbut I am very hopeful we can move it on Monday or Tuesday. We are going \nto keep trying, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfor as much time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Nuclear Agreement With Iran\n\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, today we are considering a diplomatic \nagreement about the future of a nuclear-armed Iran. Most of us in this \nbody have strong opinions about that agreement. Some believe it will \nweaken our position. I believe the opposite, and I have come to the \nfloor to express my support.\n  Republican and Democratic Presidents have all at times used the tools \nof diplomacy. Those efforts made us stronger and in some cases brought \nus back from the brink of nuclear disaster. President Reagan negotiated \ndisarmament with the Soviet Union. President Nixon reengaged with \nChina. President Kennedy used diplomacy--not war--to resolve the Cuban \nMissile Crisis. These were heroic initiatives. In each case, they were \nattacked for weakness, and in each case they made us safer.\n  I begin my remarks with the power of diplomacy because I want to echo \npoints Senator Durbin made so well last week. I urge my colleagues to \nreview his remarks, to better understand the history and importance of \ndiplomacy in our country. None of the historical deals we reference was \nperfect. All were fiercely attacked. But they made the world a safer \nplace. They moved us forward. And this agreement will also move us \nforward.\n  When it comes to our relationship with Iran, there is much we need to \ndo, but there is one thing we must do: Stop Iran from building a \nnuclear weapon, period. That is our priority. That is our goal. And \nthat is what we all agree on.\n  The sanctions did what they were intended to do--they brought Iran to \nthe table and enabled our diplomats to effectively stop Iran's nuclear \nweapons program. The results are clear: multiple centrifuges--ready to \nbe disconnected; uranium levels--insufficient for a nuclear weapon or a \nquick breakout; and no access to plutonium.\n  This is a historic moment. This agreement has profound impact if we \napprove it and, make no mistake, if we fail to approve it, because \nlet's be clear on one reality: This is a multilateral agreement. It was \nconfirmed by the U.N. Security Council just last week. The sanctions \nregime cannot be sustained by U.S. action alone.\n  This is a time for careful review, and I hope we can take a step back \nand take a clear view. In this debate, we need to consider three basic \npoints of the agreement: No. 1, what it does; No. 2, what it does not \ndo; and No. 3, what it will require of us in the future. I wish to \nstart by talking about what this agreement does.\n  To build a nuclear weapon, we need either weapons-grade uranium or \nplutonium, and we need infrastructure. Those are the pathways, and this \nagreement will block them all.\n  Before the negotiations began, Iran was well on its way to enough \nuranium, enriched to nearly 20 percent, for breakout to weapons grade--\npossibly within 2 to 3 months. With this agreement, the breakout time \nwould increase to 1 year, giving the United States and the \ninternational community more than enough time to respond. Under this \ndeal, Iran's uranium stockpile is cut by 98 percent. I will repeat. \nThis is a surprising development. Under this deal, Iran's uranium \nstockpile is cut by 98 percent. Enrichment is limited to 3.67 percent \nfor 15 years. Centrifuges are reduced by two-thirds. Enrichment \ncapability at the Fordow facility will also be limited and closely \nwatched. The International Atomic Energy Agency will be able to verify \nthat Iran is abiding by its uranium limits by monitoring every stage of \nthe nuclear supply chain. Plutonium will be blocked. The reactor core \nat Arak is a heavy water reactor and can produce plutonium. The core \nwill be removed. Its openings will be filled with concrete in a way \nthat the IAEA can verify--those international inspectors can verify--so \nit will not be used for plutonium application.\n  Critics rightly ask: How will we be sure? Iran has cheated before, \nand they may cheat again. That is why the P5+1 will be closely involved \nin the redesign and rebuilding of this reactor. If it has plutonium, we \nwill know it. A modernized reactor will not use heavy water and will be \nlimited to 3.67 percent enriched uranium. A violation at Arak would be \nnearly impossible to hide.\n  It doesn't stop there. Iran will have to abide by and ratify the \nadditional protocol of the nonproliferation treaty before the deal is \nfinalized. Contrary to detractors, this is not an 8-year or 10-year or \n15-year deal but a deal that lasts.\n  We all agree on one thing: Verification is key. I don't think any of \nus have any illusions here. Iran has had a long and troubling history \nof deception.\n\n[[Page S6178]]\n\n  I am pleased the administration included Secretary of Energy Moniz in \nthese discussions. The Department of Energy is one of the world's \nforemost experts on nuclear energy and nuclear weapons. Any agreement \non nuclear weapons must be guided by science--not politics, not \nspeculation, science. Our scientists at New Mexico's two National Labs, \nLos Alamos and Sandia, and scientists at Lawrence Livermore and Oak \nRidge National Laboratories--all have played a key role in these \nnegotiations.\n  The physics of nuclear weapons is complex. You can't make a bomb out \nof thin air. I have met with our scientists. I have listened to the \nexperts at the Department of Energy. Iran may be able to break the \nrules of the deal, but it can't break the rules of physics. Nuclear \nmaterials give off telltale signatures. The radioactive decay of \nuranium and plutonium is detectable even in the event of delayed \naccess. Uranium in nature has a half-life of 4.5 billion years. \nEnriched uranium 235, which can be used in a weapon, has a half-life of \n700 million years. In effect, you can delay, but you still can't hide.\n  Verification will be strong, and that means continuous monitoring, it \nmeans tamper-proof electronic seals, and it means dedicated facilities \nto inspect the Iranian nuclear program. It will include up to 150 \ninspectors with long-term visas. We will have the best inspectors in \nthe world in Iran. They will have unprecedented access 24/7 to all \ndeclared sites. I would add that they are all trained by nuclear \nexperts at our National Laboratories. I may not trust Iran, but I do \ntrust the science and our National Laboratories.\n  This is a serious debate and one of the greatest challenges of our \ntime. This agreement will meet that challenge ongoing and for years to \ncome. But let's not kid ourselves. There are other challenges. There \nare continued dangers posed by the Iranian regime. We all know this. \nThat is why sanctions against Iran's support for terrorist groups will \nremain and we will stand by our allies in the region. The President has \nmade this very clear.\n  This agreement will take the nuclear threat off the table. That is \nwhat it will do, but here is what it will not do: It will not diminish \nour resolve to combat other threats or to defend our allies in the \nregion. That resolve will be and must be stronger than ever.\n  To my colleagues who argue that we should walk away from the \nagreement which has already been approved by the world's leading \npowers, I would ask, walk away to where, to what end, to what \nalternative? Has an alternative been proposed?\n  I would make two proposals:\n  First, I urge my colleagues to support this agreement. We have a \nchoice between this deal or no deal. I do not believe we will get \nanother chance.\n  Second, I ask that we be open to ways that Congress can reinforce the \nagreement--and that should be part of this process, too--with \ninvestment in people and technology to support nonproliferation \nenforcement with strong oversight of the implementation plan--not to \nembarrass or score political points but to ensure Iran is abiding by \nits part of the deal--and with increased support for our allies in the \nregion and with a clear provision for a quick snapback of existing \nsanctions should that be necessary.\n  We have a strategic opportunity, just as Presidents Kennedy, Nixon, \nand Reagan did with adversaries in the past. We need to act now from a \nposition of strength and not wait until another day when the danger may \nbe greater and our options may be more limited.\n  I began my remarks with a reference to history. I would conclude with \none other, closer in time and devastating in consequence, and that is \nIraq. Instead of exhausting our diplomatic options, we opted for war. \nInstead of measured resistance, we opted for regime change. The result \nwas and is tragic.\n  Diplomacy takes time. It is often imperfect. But there are times when \nit is our best option and our best course, and this is one of those \ntimes.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to my colleague from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, at a time when we have so many urgent \nissues on our national agenda--our economy, jobs, all the issues we \nneed to address, such as making sure every American has a fair shot to \nget ahead after college, has retirement security, and all of the other \nissues we know Americans care about--unfortunately, we are revisiting a \nvery old debate that doesn't seem to want to go away, and that is \nwhether we will provide funding for preventive health care for women, \nspecifically for family planning clinics that provide essential primary \nhealth care services for women and men for things such as wellness \nvisits, mammograms, and breast cancer screenings.\n  In 2013, Planned Parenthood performed 500,000 breast exams, including \n15,000 for women in Michigan. Planned Parenthood provides screenings \nfor cancer, heart disease, and HIV. In 2013, 400,000 Pap tests and 4.5 \nmillion STI tests and treatments were conducted. Women go to Planned \nParenthood for cervical cancer screenings, for life-and-death cancer \nscreenings, for vaccines, and for blood pressure checks.\n  In States where Republican Governors have refused to use the funding \nthat is available to expand Medicaid health care under the Affordable \nCare Act, Planned Parenthood provides services critical to low-income \nAmericans.\n  In 2013, more than half the people seeking health services at Planned \nParenthood clinics were covered by Medicaid. Nearly 80 percent of these \nmen and women have incomes at or below the poverty level. We are \ntalking about all across the country, many places where there is no \nother access to health care, no other place to get a mammogram or a \nbreast cancer screening, where these services that are literally life-\nand-death are being provided.\n  So when we talk about Planned Parenthood, we are talking about the \nfull spectrum of women's health care, including contraception and \nfamily planning services that serve both women and men. One out of five \nwomen has been to a Planned Parenthood clinic at some point in her \nlife. In 2013, 2.7 million women, men, young people, relied on Planned \nParenthood for preventive care, and about 70,000 of those were in my \nState of Michigan.\n  In my State, 40 percent of the Planned Parenthood health clinics are \nlocated in areas we call medically underserved. There isn't access to \nother kinds of clinics or health care. There may not be a hospital \nnearby or there may not be many doctors nearby. We are talking about \nbasic health care.\n  Unfortunately, we see politics played with women's preventive health \ncare and family planning over and over again in attacks on Planned \nParenthood. As I see it, this is really an attack on every woman who \nneeds preventive health care services.\n  This is what this is about. Instead of focusing on jobs and closing \nloopholes that are causing our manufacturing jobs to go overseas; \ninstead of making sure we are focussed on equal pay for equal work or a \nstandard of living that will allow everyone to be successful and \neconomically independent and care for their families; instead of \nfocusing on robustly moving forward as a country in a global economy; \ninstead of focusing on that or continuing to focus on making sure \npeople have access to college without getting out of college with so \nmuch debt that they can't buy a house because they can't qualify \nbecause they already have so much debt, it is as if they have a \nmortgage--instead of focusing on all of that, one more time we are \nseeing an attack on Planned Parenthood and women's preventive health \ncare.\n  Fortunately, the vast majority of the American people recognize the \nvalue of having health clinics like Planned Parenthood that are \ndedicated to serving women's health care needs in every community \nacross the country. That is why a poll shows that 64 percent of voters \noppose the move by congressional Republicans to defund Planned \nParenthood and therefore preventive health care services such as \nmammograms, cancer screenings, blood pressure checks, and access to \nbirth control. Unfortunately, what is the majority view of the public \nis not what we see debated in the House and in the Senate.\n  We have come a long way in actually strengthening our health care \nsystem, making sure that women and men, older people and younger \npeople, can get preventive health care services, annual wellness visits \nwithout having to pay a copay. We have seen a lot of strengthening of \naccess to health care\n\n[[Page S6179]]\n\nfor women through the Affordable Care Act.\n  Finally, actually being a woman isn't viewed as a preexisting \ncondition anymore. In too many cases, that had been the situation. \nWomen in childbearing years had to pay higher rates, or someone who \nsurvived breast cancer or cervical cancer or some other kind of \nchallenge in their life. Under the Affordable Care Act, we are finally \nable to say: No, you don't carry that with you as a preexisting \ncondition for the rest of your life. That is a good thing. A lot of \nwomen are sleeping better at night as a result of that.\n  When it comes to basic preventive health care, access to birth \ncontrol, access to screenings, and so on, it seems that somehow we have \nto speak out over and over again to defend these basic health care \nservices. One more time we are headed for a big debate, a big fight on \nthe budget. We are hearing people say they won't allow the United \nStates of America to have a budget for next year unless we defund \nPlanned Parenthood and health care access for millions of women in this \ncountry. It doesn't speak well for what the priorities are of Congress.\n  I challenge colleagues across the aisle to join with Democrats, to \njoin with the majority of the American people, who support the ability \nof women to get a full range of health care services through clinics--\nwhere they don't have any other kind of access--through Planned \nParenthood and other community clinics that allow them to get the basic \nhealth services they need. Women should not be treated as second-class \ncitizens. We have come too far, as we look at the Affordable Care Act \nand health care access, and it will be incredibly disappointing, \ndisheartening, and maddening, frankly, if we end up in a fight one more \ntime. I have seen it before, and I have had to participate in holding \nback efforts to say we are not going to fund anything unless we defund \nwomen's preventive health care. It is wrong, and this Senator can state \nas one woman--as well as all of the Democratic women and men who are \nhere--that we don't intend to allow that to happen.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise today to speak against the bill to \ndefund Planned Parenthood. I see this bill and others like it as \nnothing less than an assault on women's health. What else can you call \nit when defunding Planned Parenthood will result in 2.7 women in this \ncountry--that is more than twice the population of the State of \nHawaii--not getting the cervical cancer screenings, mammograms, \ntreatment for sexually transmitted diseases, and other health care they \nneed.\n  For over 100 years Planned Parenthood has been a leader in improving \nthe health and well-being of women throughout the United States.\n  For many women, especially low-income women, survivors of domestic \nand sexual assault, young women, and others, Planned Parenthood health \ncenters are their primary health care provider that they go to for \nlifesaving cancer screenings, birth control, disease testing, and other \nessential health care services.\n  One out of five women in this country will pass through a Planned \nParenthood health center for health services at some point in her life. \nThese numbers matter. One out of five women in this country will go to \na Planned Parenthood center, and here we are debating whether or not to \nclose these centers. I find it astounding that some--especially on the \nother side of the aisle--think this is a good idea. Six out of ten \nwomen who access family planning services rely on Planned Parenthood as \ntheir primary point of care.\n  In the State of Hawaii, my State, over 7,000 women annually have \nrelied on Planned Parenthood for their basic health services--services \nthat help individuals maintain their health so they can live full, \nproductive lives.\n  This latest attack--basically fearmongering by the fringes of some on \nthe other side--against Planned Parenthood is unwarranted and \nunnecessary. This Senator considers it mean-spirited, on top of \nthat. Defunding one of the largest health providers to women shows how \nfar some of my Republican colleagues will go to restrict women's access \nto basic health care. As previously noted, this latest attack on \nwomen's access to care will impact nearly 2.7 million women across the \ncountry who benefit from Planned Parenthood's services. Some 2.7 \nmillion women--that, again, is nearly double the entire population of \nthe State of Hawaii. Lots of women are going to be impacted by this \ndrive to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\n  These 2.7 million Americans do not deserve to have their access to \nhealth care terminated just so politicians can score political talking \npoints. If these women can't go to Planned Parenthood, where will they \ngo? Women who rely on Planned Parenthood for essential health care \nservices will be forced to find medical care elsewhere or, tragically, \ngo without.\n  Defunding Planned Parenthood means there will be 400,000 fewer \ncervical screenings. There will be 500,000 fewer breast exams. There \nwill be 4.5 million fewer tests and treatments for sexually transmitted \ndisease like HIV.\n  In Indiana, when the State defunded Planned Parenthood, several \nclinics closed. The clinic in Scott County was the only testing \nfacility for STDs. Scott County today is in the middle of an HIV \noutbreak, and the State had to open a popup clinic to offer such \nservices. Defunding led to residents in Scott County being unable to \nget services due to partisan statesmanship. We do not want these \nresults replicated throughout the United States.\n  On behalf of the thousands of women in Hawaii and millions across the \ncountry who rely on Planned Parenthood for health care services, I \noppose this politically motivated attack that will set women's health \ncare back. I will stand vigilant against those attempts to defund \nPlanned Parenthood and will continue to defend the good work this \norganization does for women across this country every single day.\n  Planned Parenthood has long been on the ideological hit list of those \nwho want to block abortion. That is the reality. That is being honest. \nSo, today, we are talking about defunding Planned Parenthood as a way \nto get to that goal of stopping abortions, and tomorrow we will be \ntalking about some other way to limit a woman's right to choose. This \nbill is dangerous to women's health. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nvoting against this bill and any like it that come our way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, later this week we are going to have our \nfirst Republican Presidential debate, the official one that is on TV, \nand a lot of people are going to be watching. There has been a lot of \nspeculation as to who is going to be in the debate, who is not going to \nbe in the debate, who will do well, who will not, who will rise in the \npolls, and who will fall in the polls.\n  Frankly, we don't need to wait for that debate because the Republican \nPresidential primary campaign is playing out right now on the floor of \nthe Senate, I think, to the detriment of the institution. How else \nwould you explain a threat from Members of this body and frankly from \nMembers of the House--many of whom are not running for President--to \nshut down the government over the issue of funding for Planned \nParenthood. We have been through this before. We have been through \ngovernment shutdowns prompted by ideological politics before, and a lot \nof people got hurt--a lot of people got hurt.\n  The life of a woman in Bridgeport, CT, was torn apart because her \nHead Start Program was shut down because of the Federal Government \nshutdown. She was just beginning a new job, and she had to make a new \nchoice between continuing in this new place of employment that was \ngoing to lift her out of poverty, essentially sending her kids out on \nthe street while they didn't have care, or leaving the job and taking \ncare of her kids while Head Start was shut down. Those are the \nconsequences of a government shutdown.\n  So if you are going to shut down the government, your reason for \ndoing it better be pretty good. The reason a\n\n[[Page S6180]]\n\ncouple of years ago was a miserable one--taking health care away from \nmillions of Americans who are getting it because of the Affordable Care \nAct.\n  But this one is just as insidious. I don't know where women in my \nState would be without Planned Parenthood. My wife is one of tens of \nthousands--probably hundreds of thousands--of Connecticut women who got \ntheir preventative care from Planned Parenthood. She did that when she \nwas young, didn't have a lot of income, and needed to find a primary \ncare provider who could get her access to basic health care services. \nThere are 2.7 million patients all across the country who receive their \nhealth care, their preventative health care, from Planned \nParenthood. More than 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does all \nacross the country is engage in preventive health care.\n\n  In 2013, 400,000 Pap tests, 500,000 breast exams, 4.5 million STI \ntests and treatments, including HIV tests. In Connecticut, there are 17 \nPlanned Parenthood centers and they serve--here is the number--64,000 \npatients in the State of Connecticut.\n  So we are going to shut down the government in order to take health \ncare away from 64,000 women in Connecticut, all in order for a handful \nof people to make an ideological point that may get some additional \nvotes within a Republican Presidential primary, despite the fact that \nsince the 1980s the law in this country has been clear: You can't use \nFederal dollars for abortions.\n  I oppose that law because I believe abortions are part of a panoply \nof medical services that should be available to people in this country \nat their choice. Frankly, I think the government should stay out of the \nbusiness of deciding what medically necessary health care choices women \ncan make. I don't think we should be involved in that. So I don't \nactually support the underlying law that prevents those dollars from \nbeing used, but it is the law of the land, it has been the law of the \nland, and it will be the law of the land.\n  We are saying we are going to shut down access to 64,000 women in \nConnecticut because the place they are getting health care also \nperforms a health care service that is objectionable to people who are \nrunning for President, but let us take that logic to its natural \nextrapolation. Let's take it to its logical end point. If you believe \nno one should be eligible to get health care services from any \ninstitution that has anything to do with abortions or the full array of \nreproductive health care services, then you can't actually stop at \nPlanned Parenthood. You have to stop funding any hospital that has \nanything to do with offering a full array of health care services. You \nhave to stop funding for health care centers that do the same.\n  Why wouldn't you stop sending Medicaid dollars to States such as \nConnecticut that have codified Roe v. Wade? What is the logical end to \nthis policy if all of a sudden an organization that spends 90-plus \npercent of its resources simply engaging in the good stuff of \npreventive health care now all of a sudden can't serve anybody because \nthey engage in a service that is a politically hot topic in Congress, \ndespite the fact that there is a law on the books that says they can't \nuse any of their Federal dollars for that particular service.\n  Take this to its logical end, and we cut off Federal funding for not \n64,000 patients in Connecticut but virtually every patient in \nConnecticut if any association with the provision of abortions all of a \nsudden denies you Federal funding. I don't concede the fact that the \nHyde amendment is the law of the land, but I acknowledge that it is and \nit will be.\n  This is just Presidential Republican primary politics finding its way \nonto the Senate floor. What this could lead to is not the defunding of \nPlanned Parenthood, because they will not get the votes nor the \nPresidential signature to defund one of the most important primary and \npreventive health care providers in our States--I will not do that. I \nwill not deny health care to 64,000 Connecticut women. So all they do \nby creating this line in the sand, once again, is shut down the Federal \nGovernment, sucking thousands of jobs out of our economy, leading to \ntens of thousands of stories of individual misery, such as the woman \nfrom Bridgeport who all of a sudden awoke to find her kid couldn't go \nto his Head Start Program and so she had to think about quitting her \nnew job in order to take care of her child.\n  I get it that threats about shutdowns make good headlines. They play \nto a slice of a Presidential primary electorate, but they are big \nheadaches for real people. We are not playing with politics when we \ntalk about shutting down the government over defunding Planned \nParenthood or over repealing the Affordable Care Act. We are playing \nwith people's lives.\n  So I hope this is just the issue of the week in the Republican \nPresidential primary. I hope when we come back in September we are not \nseriously talking about another government shutdown. I hope we \nseriously are not talking about an attack on women's health care all \nacross this country. I hope we are not entertaining the idea that tens \nof thousands of women in my State are all of a sudden going to lose \naccess to services or tens of thousands of women and men are going to \nlose access to programs such as Head Start, job training, and all the \nother things that get affected when the government shuts down.\n  I am sick of shutdowns. I have only been in the Congress for less \nthan a decade, and I have been through more of them, real and \nthreatened, than I care to remember. I am certainly not going to stand \nfor a shutdown threatened on the basis of denying health care to women \nin the State of Connecticut or anywhere else across this country.\n  I hope we can spend some time after this vote next week--that even my \nRepublican friends in the Republican Presidential primary will admit is \na showboat--and get down to the real business of passing a budget that \nrespects the values and priorities of this country, that keeps our \ngovernment operational, and separates, to the best we can, the business \nwe do on the Senate floor from the business of sorting out who is going \nto be the next Republican nominee for President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today, I pay tribute to Duchesne County--a \nremarkable Utah county that is celebrating its 100th birthday.\n  Located in northeastern Utah, Duchesne County is rich with natural \nresources and home to some of the State's most majestic scenery. \nThousands flock to the region each year to fish its streams, which \ninclude the Strawberry, Duchesne, Lake Fork, and Yellowstone Rivers. \nEven more enjoy its mountains, including Utah's highest, King's Peak, \nwhich is 13,528 feet above sea level. Its vistas are breathtaking and \nits valleys are serene and beautiful.\n  The county has a meaningful history that traces its roots to Native \nAmerican culture. In fact, much of present-day Duchesne County was \noriginally part of the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservations. In the \nearly 1900s, other settlers began arriving in the region after Congress \npassed the Dawes Act. To farm and make improvements to the land, the \ngovernment offered these individuals 160 acres under the Homestead Act. \nToday, approximately 18,000 Utahns live in Duchesne County and \ncontribute to its quality of life.\n  Livestock and farming along with oil and natural gas resources \ncontinue to drive the local economy. Just like its early pioneers, \nDuchesne County's citizens work hard not only to support their \nfamilies, but also to make their\n\n[[Page S6181]]\n\ncommunities and our State a wonderful place to live.\n  Duchesne County captures the best of small town America. Its towns \nare charming and its people are dedicated and patriotic. I have always \nenjoyed visiting the many wonderful towns in Duchesne County and \ngetting to know its citizens.\n  Again, I wish to congratulate Duchesne County on the marking of its \ncentennial. This is a noteworthy time indeed, and I want to wish the \nmany Utahns who call this place home many more years of happiness \nliving and working in this beautiful county.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/30/senate-section/article/S6181-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING ERMA ARVILLA RUPP FRITCHEN\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the life of Erma \nArvilla Rupp Fritchen. Ms. Fritchen devoted her life to justice, \nnotably as a Freedom Rider in the summer of 1963.\n  Ms. Fritchen was born and raised in Reno, NV. She strove to be the \nfirst in her family to graduate from high school, but nothing was \nhanded to her. Erma worked to pay the rent and still managed to \ngraduate from Reno High School in 1948. Following high school, she \npursued adult education classes in psychology before moving to Fort \nBenning, GA, as a military wife. When she arrived in Fort Benning, she \nwas shocked by the racial disparities in her new city.\n  After moving back to Nevada, Erma began attending college while also \nraising her two children on her own. Education and family were \nimportant to her, but she was never too busy to take a stand for the \nprinciples she believed in. When she had the opportunity to make a \ndifference by joining a civil rights caravan headed for Washington, DC, \nin 1963, she jumped at the opportunity and added her voice to the \nFreedom Rider demonstrations that were taking place throughout the \ncountry.\n  Through her years of fighting for justice and equality, Ms. Fritchen \nproved that everyone can do their part if they work and fight hard \nenough. I appreciate her dedication to her five sons and contributions \nto making our country a better place.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/30/senate-section/article/S6181-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECOGNIZING NEVADA PEP\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Nevada PEP for its \nmore than 20 years of service to children with disabilities and their \nfamilies.\n  Nevada PEP was founded more than two decades ago by a handful of \nfamilies who wanted for their children what every parent wants for \ntheir child: the opportunity to learn, grow, and succeed in all areas \nof life, regardless of their ability. Since then, this organization has \nhelped children with disabilities by increasing opportunities for home, \ncommunity, and school success. Although Nevada PEP started as a small \norganization with meetings around a kitchen table, the organization has \nnow served more than 17,000 people throughout the State and has had a \npositive impact on many more Nevadans through its greater advocacy \nefforts.\n  The ``PEP'' in the organization's name has a number of meanings, \nincluding, ``Parents Encouraging Parents,'' ``Parents Educating \nProfessionals,'' and ``Professionals Empowering Parents.'' Nevada PEP \ntruly embodies all of these meanings through the services it provides. \nThe organization offers support groups, webinars, and other skill-\nbuilding activities to help the families of children with disabilities \nbecome effective advocates for their child. Nevada PEP also works to \nconnect families to essential community resources, including \norganizations and professionals in the fields of education, health \ncare, housing, and employment. Additionally, the organization raises \nawareness and engages the community through events, such as the ``Baldy \nBash,'' the ``Run, Walk, Roll Against Bullying,'' and an annual art \nshow.\n  I applaud Nevada PEP for their years of dedicated service to children \nwith disabilities and their families. Their work is truly appreciated \nand admired. I also commend Karen Taycher, a parent and passionate \nadvocate, as well as founding member and the executive director of \nNevada PEP, for her fine leadership throughout the past two decades. As \nNevada PEP begins the next chapter, I wish them continued success for \nyears to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/30/senate-section/article/S6181-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               50TH ANNIVERSARY OF MEDICARE AND MEDICAID\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we celebrate a true milestone in our \nNation's history, and we mark this reminder that basic health insurance \nis not a privilege for the wealthy, but a right, for every American. On \nJuly 30, 1965, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Social Security \nAmendments of 1965 into law, establishing the Medicare and Medicaid \nprograms. For 50 years, these two programs have offered health care and \neconomic security to millions of Americans and their families.\n  The debate over the right to basic health insurance began in the \n1940s with President Harry Truman. At a time when just one in eight \nseniors had health care and were earning less than $1000 on average \nannually, President Truman sought to create a safety net to meet the \nneeds of a growing population. It may be difficult for all of us in the \ngenerations of Americans born since that era to fully understand today, \nbut before Medicaid and Medicare, when private health insurers could \nstill discriminate against individuals based on their health, many \nseniors were either denied coverage entirely or priced out of health \ninsurance. And for Americans living in poverty, health care was simply \nout of reach.\n  The Social Security Amendments of 1965 offered a path forward. Today, \nMedicare and Medicaid cover a combined 110 million Americans, including \nseniors, persons with disabilities, and low-income Americans and their \nfamilies. From cancer screenings to hospital coverage, yearly well-\nvisits, flu vaccinations, pediatric dental care and caregiver support, \nMedicare and Medicaid provide access to the basic health care services \nthat all Americans deserve. And what a dramatic and tangible difference \nthat has made and continues to make in the lives of millions of people.\n  Through the Affordable Care Act, Medicare and Medicaid took a step \nfurther. States that expanded Medicaid under the law saved nearly $2 \nbillion in health care costs while extending coverage to many, many \nmore Americans. Closing the coverage gap known as the ``donut hole'' \nsaved seniors on Medicare $15 billion in health care costs--a savings \nto seniors of $28 million in my home State of Vermont alone. The \nAffordable Care Act strengthened Medicare for future generations, \nextending the trust fund an additional 13 years as a result of savings \nto the program.\n  It is worth remembering as well that in the early years of Medicare \nand Medicaid, as these programs were established and went through some \ngrowing pains, public opinion at first was tentative in supporting \nthese major reforms. Over time, public support for and appreciation of \nthe benefits of these programs has grown significantly. We can see some \nparallels in the way public opinion about the Affordable Care Act has \ncontinued to grow, as its benefits have become more widespread and more \napparent in our daily lives.\n  As we celebrate this important anniversary, I hope we all will \nremember how far these programs have come and commit to keeping them \nstrong for future generations. Strengthening Medicare and Medicaid is \nan economic investment in the well-being of our country, and I will \nfight for these programs for my children and my grandchildren.\n  I am proud to celebrate an anniversary marking the Federal \nGovernment's promise of providing reassurance and stability for our \nNation's most vulnerable citizens. I look forward to celebrating the \nsuccess of Medicare and Medicaid for generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/30/senate-section/article/S6181-4", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6181-S6182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               DRIVE ACT\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased by Senate passage today of \nthe DRIVE Act, a long-overdue, multiyear surface transportation bill to \nauthorize and fund our Nation's highway, bridge, and transit programs. \nThis bill would provide the certainty needed for State and local \nplanning organizations to set transportation priorities and begin long-\nterm investments to modernize our Nation's aging infrastructure.\n  This bill is also a win for the State of Arizona. Included in the \nDRIVE Act are critical measures, sponsored by\n\n[[Page S6182]]\n\nmyself and Senator Flake, that would pave the way for the establishment \nof the Sonoran Corridor and the future Interstate 11, I-11, ensuring \nArizona has the critical infrastructure it needs to develop significant \ninternational trade routes for the Western United States. These \nprovisions would designate the Sonoran Corridor as a future interstate \nto connect I-19 to I-10 south of the Tucson International Airport and \nextend the future I-11 through the State of Nevada to I-80 and south \ntoward Arizona's southern border.\n  As the population in Arizona continues to grow and innovative \nbusinesses increasingly settle in our State, we must ensure that we \nhave the infrastructure in place to foster economic development, \ninternational trade and job creation. These two top-priority \ntransportation projects will make Arizona a key part of an \ninternational trade route that reaches all the way to the southern \nborder. I appreciate Chairman Inhofe's support of these important \nprovisions, as well as Senator Flake, Governor Doug Ducey and leaders \nfrom across the State of Arizona for their strong partnership in \nadvancing these designations that will connect Arizona businesses and \ncommunities to major domestic and international trade partners.\n  I am proud of the bipartisan effort that went into this bill. It is \nunfortunate that we ultimately had to pass yet another short-term \nhighway extension today to avoid a transportation shutdown across the \ncountry. This stop-gap measure should be the last. When we return \nfollowing the August break, I urge the House to take up and pass this \nbill and send it to the President's desk for signature.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/30/senate-section/article/S6182-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              REBUILD ACT\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I join with my House colleague from \nBaltimore, Congressman Elijah Cummings, to introduce the REBUILD Act. \nThe people who live in our most distressed neighborhoods deserve a \ngovernment on their side--one that works as hard for them as they work \nfor their own families and communities. This bill is about \nrehabilitating neighborhoods, making them healthier and safer, and \ncreating jobs today and jobs tomorrow for communities that need it \nmost. By supporting small businesses, rebuilding infrastructure, \nexpanding opportunity for our young people and tackling crime, we will \nlay the foundation for a brighter future.\n  The REBUILD Act is an emergency supplemental bill for fiscal year \n2015 to help inner-city neighborhoods across the United States. It \nfocuses on four key areas: physical infrastructure, meeting compelling \nhuman needs, community safety, and assistance to small business owners.\n  This bill provides robust funding for U.S. Department of Housing and \nUrban Development programs that will remove blight, rehabilitate aging \nhousing properties, including those with lead paint, and fund youth and \nsenior centers. I especially want to highlight the Community \nDevelopment Block Grant funding to help those communities most impacted \nby violence and civil unrest this year. That includes my hometown of \nBaltimore. This bill also extends the moving-to-work contracts through \n2028.\n  For meeting compelling human needs, this bill funds U.S. Department \nof Labor's job training and apprenticeship programs to help dislocated \nworkers, veterans and youth make a living wage and learn new job \nskills. It also funds the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' \nHealthy Start Initiative. This program helps moms and infants get \naccess to primary and preventative health care to reduce infant \nmortality rates.\n  In the area of community safety, there is significant funding for \ntargeted U.S. Department of Justice grant programs. This funding will \nhelp reduce youth violence, tackle crime hot spots controlled by gangs \nand rampant with gun violence, and reduce methamphetamine and heroin \ntrafficking. There is additional funding for drug, mental health and \nveterans courts to break the cycle of drug use and criminal behavior.\n  For our small business owners and entrepreneurs, this bill provides \nloans, grants, training and counseling services. There also is money to \nhelp underserved businesses with Federal contracting.\n  Recent events like the riots in Baltimore remind us of the unmet \nneeds of our Nation's inner city neighborhoods. We must do more. This \nmeans immediately getting to work on a sequel to the landmark Murray-\nRyan budget deal to replace sequester. The impact of the status quo and \ndeep cuts to our Federal programs on the mission to lift up these \ncommunities is unacceptable. The opportunity of the American Dream \nshould be within every American's reach.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/30/senate-section/article/S6182-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6182-S6183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 VETERAN HOUSING STABILITY ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, yesterday, as ranking member of the \nSenate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I introduced S. 1885, the \nVeteran Housing Stability Act of 2015. I would like to thank Senators \nSanders, Brown, and Hirono for joining me to introduce this bill, and \nthe National Coalition for Homeless Veterans and the National Alliance \nto End Homelessness for their support of this legislation. At a time \nwhen the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, has taken on an aggressive \ninitiative to end homelessness among veterans by the end of 2015, much \nprogress has been made yet there is still more progress needed.\n  The VA initiative has led to a 33 percent decrease in the homeless \nveteran population since 2010. These declining numbers are a reflection \nof the combined efforts of VA and its Federal, State, local, tribal, \nand community partners as they continue aggressive efforts to decrease \nveteran homelessness and implement a system through which veterans who \nbecome homeless can be rapidly placed in appropriate housing situations \nthat meet their needs. The statistics are staggering--49,000 veterans \nare homeless in America today, 1 in 10 of all homeless men and women--a \nsearing failure in the greatest, strongest Nation in the world's \nhistory. It reflects a failure to keep faith that this legislation will \nhelp correct. We cannot allow another veteran to slip through the \ncracks. We must give communities the flexibility and tools they need to \ncreate housing systems that can maximize existing resources \ncollaboratively in order to identify and sustain appropriate housing \nplacements for vulnerable veterans.\n  The legislation would reaffirm this Nation's commitment to safe and \naffordable housing for veterans by improving and expanding upon VA's \nprograms to prevent and end homelessness among veterans. VA's housing \nprograms for homeless and at-risk veterans must modernize to ensure \nthat they are meeting the needs of the very veterans they are intended \nto serve. One of the challenges many identify as causing difficulty is \none that mainstream housing programs also struggle with--insufficient \navailability of safe, affordable, permanent housing options.\n  This measure will address the egregious, abhorrent problem of veteran \nhomelessness with several common-sense, effective steps to increase \nhousing for homeless and at-risk veterans. The Homeless Veterans \nPrevention Act of 2015 would expand access to housing by requiring VA \nto collaborate with U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development \nand other entities to conduct more robust landlord outreach and \nencourage more landlords to rent to veterans.\n  Further, this bill would modify a VA program that provides critical \nsavings to transitional housing providers, allowing these groups to \nspend limited funding to provide high-quality services rather than to \nretire the debt they would take on to acquire a facility in which to \noperate. VBA's Acquired Property Sales for Homeless Providers Program \nsells homes from VA's foreclosure inventory at a discount to nonprofit \norganizations for use as transitional housing for homeless veterans. As \nVA continues to shift its homeless programs into an approach that meets \nveterans at their point of need, rather than choosing a one-size-fits-\nall solution, more services are being provided under the housing-first \nmodel, which pairs housing with appropriate levels of case management. \nThis pairing allows veterans to deal with the underlying issues that \ncaused homelessness, rather than attempting to work through them while \nsimultaneously looking for housing. It is critical that programs that \noffer more than transitional housing be\n\n[[Page S6183]]\n\nallowed to benefit from this discount as well.\n  As VA focuses on resolving homelessness, instead of just managing it, \nhousing stability is increasingly a focus across the continuum of \nprograms VA offers to eligible veterans. This bill will also modify \nVA's Grant and Per Diem Program, its largest transitional housing \nprogram, to allow VA to incentivize grantees to increase their focus on \npermanent housing and housing stability in support of the transitional \nhousing program. More specifically, this bill provides VA with much \nneeded authority to allow transitional housing providers to utilize \ntheir facility for permanent housing, and to receive a reduced per diem \npayment to provide case management for participating veterans. This \nwould allow communities that are reaching critical junctures in the \nfight to end homelessness to repurpose existing transitional housing \ncapacity for more pressing needs, such as permanent housing \nopportunities for veterans.\n  As many initiatives across VA have faced performance challenges, it \nis paramount that we continue to examine all VA initiatives and \nidentify metrics that can be tracked to keep the Department \naccountable. This legislation includes a provision that would require \nVA to set national performance targets for entities that receive per \ndiem funding for transitional housing and examine them to determine \nwhether the grantee's performance merits continued funding. Further, \nthis bill also contains a provision that would prompt VA to utilize the \ndata it collects to better target interventions offered by its \nassertive community teams engaging homeless veterans on the street. \nRequiring a more targeted effort focused on homeless veterans who are \nhealth care ``super-utilizers'' will reduce unnecessary utilization of \nhealth care and, subsequently the costs for care.\n  Research has indicated that housing can be an effective health care \nintervention when paired with appropriate services and resources. At \nits very simplest, homelessness among veterans is preventable when \nthere is coordination among the many services and resources available \nto lift a veteran up. We cannot sit by idly and allow another veteran \nto slip through the cracks. We must reach out and let them know when, \nwhere, and how to get the help that they need and that they have \nearned.\n  This is not a full recitation of all the provisions within this \nlegislation. However, I hope that I have provided an appropriate \noverview of the major benefits this legislation would provide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/30/senate-section/article/S6183-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             SAFER OFFICERS AND SAFER CITIZENS ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I join Senators Tim Scott and Lindsey \nGraham in introducing the Safer Officers and Safer Citizens Act of \n2015. This critical legislation moves our Nation a step forward in \nrebuilding the trust gap between law enforcement and communities by \ncreating a Federal grant program to supply local, State, and tribal law \nenforcement with body-worn cameras. I thank Senator Scott for his work \non this bill and his leadership on such a critical issue.\n  Trust between law enforcement and communities is critical to the \nfoundation of our democracy. It reinforces the legitimacy of the State \nto the people that the State serves. It assures the public that the \npeople sworn to protect them will do so honorably or be held \naccountable when they don't. It builds transparency and promotes open \ngovernment by shining a spotlight on police-citizen interaction so that \nno misconduct occurs in the dark. It ensures police officers that the \ncommunity will see their side and not cast unmerited aspersions.\n  But recent police-citizen encounters in our Nation have created a \ntrust deficit between law enforcement and the communities that they \nserve. Over the past year, troubling use of force incidents have \noccurred between police officers and citizens in places like Ferguson, \nMO, Baltimore, MD, and North Charleston, SC. These events spurred a \nnational dialogue about the state of policing in America, and created \nan urgency for body-worn cameras.\n  When I served as mayor of New Jersey's largest city, I saw firsthand \nthe difficulties law enforcement faced in keeping our communities safe. \nThe overwhelming majority of police officers in the United States are \ndecent and hardworking Americans who have dedicated their lives to a \ngreater calling. But let us not mistake ourselves--we have a problem in \nour country. Over the past few years, trust has eroded between law \nenforcement and the communities they serve. The unfortunate actions of \na few have cast a long shadow over the good work of many.\n  I am also concerned that systemic issues have contributed to eroding \nthe trust between communities and police. It comes from decades of a \nfailed War on Drugs. Minority communities are routinely subject to stop \nand frisk policies. People are stopped for ``suspicious'' activities \nlike acting too nervous, acting too calm, dressing casually, or wearing \nexpensive clothes or jewelry. The fact is that five times as many \nWhites report using drugs as African Americans, yet African Americans \nare sent to prison for drug crimes ten times that of whites. Of course \na lack of trust will exist when our criminal justice system as a whole \ndisproportionately targets minorities.\n  It is time we start rebuilding that trust. This bill is about \ntransparency. The Safer Officer and Safer Citizens Act of 2015 would \nrequire that the Department of Justice give priority to States, \nlocalities, and tribal areas that have developed comprehensive body-\nworn camera policies that address such issues as privacy, data \nretention, and victim protection. It would also give priority to \njurisdictions that consult victim and juvenile advocacy groups, labor \norganizations, civic leadership, law enforcement professionals, and the \ndefense bar. The bill requires States, localities, and tribal units to \ncollect data on the effectiveness of body cameras.\n  Body-worn cameras will protect communities from police abuses of \npower and simultaneously protect police from false complaints. I am \nproud to join with Senators Scott and Graham in introducing the Safer \nOfficer and Safer Citizens Act of 2015, and I urge its speedy passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/30/senate-section/article/S6183-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6183-S6184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, this week we celebrate the 25th \nanniversary of the passage of landmark civil rights legislation, the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act. The ADA outlawed discrimination on the \nbasis of physical or developmental ability and sought to grant those \nwith disabilities the same opportunities as other Americans.\n  In the past quarter century, this law has changed our social fabric \nas well as of our physical surroundings. Every newly built building or \nsidewalk with basic accommodations lets more and more of our fellow \ncitizens live fuller lives as self-sufficient members of our \ncommunities.\n  Before there were curb cutouts, some Rhode Islanders couldn't cross \nthe street. Before there were wheelchair lifts on public buses, some \nRhode Islanders couldn't commute to work. Before there were assisted \nlistening devices, some Rhode Islanders couldn't follow a professor's \nlecture or a pastor's sermon. Before there were Braille signs, some \nRhode Islanders couldn't find a doctor's office or a child's classroom \nwithout assistance. Before there were accessible voting systems, some \nof us couldn't even exercise our most basic rights as citizens.\n  My colleague in Rhode Island's congressional delegation, Congressman \nJim Langevin, has a special perspective on this groundbreaking law. \n``As someone who has lived with the challenges of a disability both \nbefore and after the enactment of the ADA,'' he has said, ``I have \nexperienced firsthand the profound changes of this law on our \nsociety.''\n  Jim was only sixteen when an accidental injury left him paralyzed. In \nan amazing example of optimism and courage, Jim went on to serve the \npeople of our State in the Rhode Island House of Representatives and as \nour Secretary of State. Today he is the first quadriplegic to serve in \nthe U.S. House of Representatives. On the day he was the first person \never to preside in the House in a wheelchair, I trooped over from the \nSenate to watch history made.\n\n[[Page S6184]]\n\n  Jim Langevin is living proof of the promise of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act and a champion of expanded opportunity for people with \ndisabilities. He fought hard for the ADA Amendments Act of 2008. He is \nfounder and cochairman of the Bipartisan Disabilities Caucus in \nCongress. And he is a living example to his colleagues that a \ndisability need not be a limitation. Americans of every level of \nability are better off for Jim's passion and determination.\n  For 25 years, as the Americans with Disabilities Act removed barriers \nto buildings and transportation, it eliminated obstacles that once kept \npeople from contributing to our society, growing our economy, and \nrealizing their dreams. The equality of opportunity embodied in this \nlaw is at the very heart of our American notion of liberty. There is \nstill work to be done, but we should cheer how far we have come, and \nrededicate ourselves to fulfilling the promise of the ADA. This is \ntruly the work of forming a more perfect union.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/30/senate-section/article/S6184-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RECOGNIZING THE KEEP THE SPIRIT OF '45 ALIVE COALITION AND BRIGADIER \n                        GENERAL JAMES B. THAYER\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as our Nation commemorates the 70th \nanniversary of the end of World War II, I would like to recognize and \nhonor the achievements of the Keep the Spirit of '45 Alive coalition, \nas well as the remarkable legacy of BG James B. Thayer, Sr. I am proud \nto speak today in recognition of the devotion exhibited by the Oregon \nSpirit of '45 organization, and by one of Oregon's finest.\n  Over the past 5 years, the Keep the Spirit of '45 coalition has been \ninstrumental in convincing Congress, and various State legislatures, to \ndesignate an annual Spirit of '45 Day in August. I am incredibly proud \nthat Oregon is our Nation's first State to legislate a permanent State \nSpirit of '45 Day to honor the valiant men and women who served on the \nbattlefields and on America's home front. However, I am even more proud \nof Governor Brown's recent decision to designate the week of August 9-\n16 to be WWII 70th Anniversary Spirit of '45 Commemorative Week, a \nperiod of profound appreciation and reflection for the actions of a \ntruly inspirational generation.\n  It has been wonderful to witness the hard work of Oregon's Spirit of \n'45 organization this year. From six performances across the State by \nOregon's 234th Army Band to wreath laying ceremonies, all of the events \ntook an extraordinary amount of planning and initiative. Oregon has \ntruly developed a unique State plan to commemorate the end of WWII; a \nplan that not only involves an unprecedented concert tour, but that \nalso includes a worldwide tribute coordinated with WWII allies. I also \nlook forward to what is unfolding on the national level: the flyovers \nby WWII aircraft, the swing dances and concerts, and the performance of \n``Taps'' during a wreath laying ceremony that will bring many great \nNations together. Across Oregon and the United States, younger \ngenerations will truly appreciate our Nation's successful efforts to \ndefend freedom worldwide, as well as the 70th anniversary of VJ Day--\nwhich marked the end of the conflict on August 14, 1945.\n  As I recognize the efforts of the Keep the Spirit of '45 Alive \ncoalition, I must also express my gratitude for General Thayer, who \nserves as the coalition's ground forces spokesperson in Oregon. He has \nserved as a guiding force behind the Spirit of '45 organization in \nOregon. The recipient of numerous military awards, including the Silver \nand Bronze Stars, General Thayer helped save the lives of over 15,000 \nHungarian Jewish refugees. But his legacy does not end there. Following \nhis heroic liberation of the Nazi Death Camp Gunskirchen-Lager, General \nThayer served in the Oregon State Defense Force, eventually ascending \nto the rank of commander. His willingness to serve his country after \nWWII, and work his way through the ranks, as well as his distinguished \ncivilian career, speaks highly of his character.\n  It is our Nation's responsibility to ensure that the men and women \nwho stand by our country are honored for their individual and \ncollective sacrifices. Observing the Spirit of '45 Day begins the \nprocess of properly commemorating the sacrifices of our Nation's \nveterans and home front, at a time when democracy and human rights were \nthreatened around the world.\n  It is also an opportunity for us to remember the shared sacrifice, \ncommitment to service to community and country, and national unity of \nour WWII generation so that their example will continue to inspire \nfuture generations of Americans, especially the youth of our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/30/senate-section/article/S6184-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO COLONEL LEON PARROTT\n\n  Mrs. CAPITO.

Since the beginning \nof his tenure, Colonel Parrott has dutifully served our great State and \nwas honored earlier this month during a Change of Command ceremony in \nHuntington.\n  As District Commander, his jurisdiction encompassed an area of \napproximately 45,000 square miles in 5 States--West Virginia, Kentucky, \nOhio, Virginia, and North Carolina. The District's staff of more than \n800 employees supports their mission of operating and maintaining 35 \nmulti-purpose reservoirs and 9 dams in addition to providing flood \ndamage reduction, commercial navigation, recreation, and water supply \nprotection. Colonel Parrott and his staff oversaw significant planning, \ndesign and construction efforts that imitated the replacement of \noutdated navigation structures, dam safety measures and other \nsignificant water resource challenges including emergency management.\n  Throughout his career, Colonel Parrott has held a variety of command \nand staff assignments including: platoon leader, company executive \nofficer and construction officer with the 94th Engineer Battalion, 18th \nEngineer Brigade and 249th Engineer Battalion; battalion maintenance \nofficer and company commander with the 37th Engineer Battalion, 20th \nEngineer Brigade; assistant construction and operations officer with \nthe 416th Engineering Command; environmental project officer and \ndistrict executive officer, Europe District, U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers; battalion operations and executive officer with the 1st \nBattalion, 395th Engineer Regiment; group engineer with the 5th Special \nForces Group, deputy and then chief of the Emergency Operations Center \nfor the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; Commander of the 326th Engineer \nBattalion; deputy engineer for installations, Environment and Civil/\nMilitary Operations, U.S. European Command; chief of engineering at the \nDefense Intelligence Agency; and, most recently, as corps engineer of \nthe XVIII Airborne Corps.\n  Colonel Parrott is an outstanding soldier, friend, husband, father \nand student. A 1988 graduate of the Citadel, he holds a bachelor of \nscience degree in civil engineering as well as master's degree from the \nUniversity of Phoenix and the U.S. Army War College. In addition, \nColonel Parrott has received numerous awards for his heroism and \nmilitary duty.\n  I have had the honor to work with him as a Member of the U.S. House \nof Representatives and now in the U.S. Senate. During that time, I have \ncome to admire his dedication and selfless commitment to the mission of \nthe Huntington Corps and its employees. I would like to wish Colonel \nParrott and his wife Judy well in his next command at the North \nAtlantic Division of USACE in Brooklyn, NY, where he will serve as \ndeputy division commander. I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking \nColonel Parrott for his service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/30/senate-section/article/S6184-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6184-S6185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    CONGRATULATING MICHAEL HERNANDEZ\n\n Mr. HELLER.

He earned a bachelor \nof science in government and a master of education from Texas A \nUniversity. He later obtained his executive fire officer credential \nfrom the National Fire Academy. Mr. Hernandez began his fire service \ncareer over 30 years ago as a firefighter medic.

He \nworked tirelessly to ensure that the Reno Fire Department maintained \nexcellent fire services for Nevada residents, even in some of the most \ntumultuous economic times. As chief, Mr. Hernandez provided fellow \nfirefighters with the training and tools necessary to keep our local \ncommunity safe. Mr. Hernandez is also a member of the International \nAssociation of Fire Chiefs, the National Fire Academy Executive Fire \nOfficer Alumni Association, the National Fire Protection Association, \nand the Nevada Fire Chiefs Association. I am grateful for all Mr. \nHernandez has done for the City of Reno.\n  It is the brave men and women who serve in our local fire departments \nthat help keep our communities safe. These heroes selflessly put their \nlives on the line every day. I extend my deepest gratitude to Mr. \nHernandez for his courageous contributions to the people of Reno and to \nthe silver State. His sacrifice and courage earn him a place among the \noutstanding men and women who have valiantly put their lives on the \nline to benefit others.\n  Mr. Hernandez has demonstrated professionalism, commitment to \nexcellence, and dedication to the highest standards of the Reno Fire \nDepartment. I am both humbled and honored by his service and am proud \nto call him a fellow Nevadan. Today, I ask all of my colleagues to join \nme in congratulating Mr. Hernandez on his retirement, and I give my \ndeepest appreciation for all that he has done to make Nevada a safer \nplace. I offer him my best wishes for many successful and fulfilling \nyears to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/30/senate-section/article/S6185-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR.

Mr. President, today I recognize Dr. Gerald M. \nCross, a dedicated public servant who will be retiring from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs at the end of August.\n  Before joining the VA, Dr. Cross served in the U.S. Army for nearly \n30 years.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize Joseph A. \nViolante, national legislative director for the Disabled American \nVeterans, DAV, who will be retiring at the end of this week after over \n20 years of service to DAV.\n  Joe's career of service started long before his tenure at DAV. As a \nU.S. Marine, he served in combat in Vietnam. Following his honorable \ndischarge from the Marine Corps, Joe began practicing law in \nCalifornia, and in 1990, Joe joined the DAV Washington staff in its \nappellate work before the VA Board of Veterans Appeals, lending his \nlegal expertise to serve his fellow veterans. Joe became DAV's national \nlegislative director in 1996.\n  It is an incredible service to defend the United States in combat. \nJoe went above and beyond that. He came home and started fighting for \nothers who served, helping countless veterans through his work at DAV. \nOver the past 2 decades, he has played a role in crafting major \nveterans legislation, and his work has affected policies at the VA, the \nDepartment of Labor, the Department of Defense, and other Federal \nagencies. Joe has helped spur internal VA reforms, establish increases \nin VA's annual appropriations, expand primary care for veterans, expand \nthe National Cemetery system and establish caregiver benefits for \nwounded veterans. These accomplishments, just few of many, will \ncontinue to help veterans for years to come.\n  Joe served as national legislative director for three Presidential \nadministrations and testified at my very first hearing as chairman of \nthe Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs. It was an honor to work with \nhim, and I know I am not alone when I say I am sad to see him go. His \nretirement is well-deserved, and I wish Joe and his wife Debbie all the \nbest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/30/senate-section/article/S6185-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO RICHARD DEAN ROGERS\n\n Mr. MORAN.

A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to allow \nthe Secretary of Education to award job training Federal Pell Grants; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, by 2020, it is estimated that 65 percent of \nall jobs will require at least some form of postsecondary education and \ntraining. The National Skills Coalition estimates that nearly half of \nall job openings between now and 2022 will be middle skill jobs that \nrequire education beyond high school, but not a 4-year degree. While \nthe number of students pursuing postsecondary education is growing, the \nsupply of skilled workers still falls short of industry demand. \nAccording to one estimate, the U.S. faces a shortfall of as many as 4.7 \nmillion new workers with postsecondary certificates by the year 2018 \nand according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, 3.7 million U.S. jobs \nare currently vacant because of a shortage of qualified workers.\n  Our current Federal higher education policy could be improved to help \nsolve this problem. Pell Grants--the primary form of Federal tuition \nassistance for low-income and working students--can only be awarded \ntowards programs that are over 600 clock hours or at least 15 weeks in \nlength. These grants cannot be used to support many of the short-term \noccupational training programs at community and technical colleges and \nother institutions that provide skills and credentials employers need \nand recognize. When it comes to higher education, Federal policies need \nto support the demands of the changing labor market and support \nalternate career pathways that align with industry demand. According \nthe Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, \nshorter-term educational investments pay off--the average postsecondary \ncertificate holder has 20 percent higher lifetime earnings than \nindividuals with only a high school diploma.\n  I am pleased to introduce the Jumpstart Our Businesses by Supporting \nStudents or JOBS Act. The JOBS Act would amend the Higher Education Act \nby expanding Pell Grant eligibility to students enrolled in short-term \nskills and job training programs that lead to industry-based \ncredentials and ultimately employment in in-demand industry sectors or \ncareers. Since job training programs are shorter and less costly, Pell \nGrant awards would be half of the current discretionary Pell amount. \nThe legislation defines eligible job training programs as those \nproviding career and technical education instruction at an institution \nthat provides at least 150 clock hours of instruction time over a \nperiod of at least 8 weeks and that provides training that meets the \nneeds of the local or regional workforce. These programs must also \nprovide students with licenses, certifications, or credentials that \nmeet the hiring requirements of multiple employers in the field for \nwhich the job training is offered.\n  The JOBS Act also ensures that students who receive Pell Grants are \nearning high-quality postsecondary credentials by requiring that the \ncredentials meet the standards under the Workforce Innovation and \nOpportunity Act, are recognized by employers, industry, or sector \npartnerships, and align with the skill needs of industries in the \nStates or local economies.\n  We need to make sure that Federal student aid supports the demand of \na 21st century economy. As Congress works to reauthorize the Higher \nEducation Act, I hope that my colleagues ensure that Pell Grants are \naccessible for individuals participating in high-quality, short-term \noccupational training programs that are leading to industry-recognized \ncredentials and certificates.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED:\n  S. 1902. A bill to provide for the treatment and extension of \ntemporary financing of short-time compensation programs; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Layoff Prevention \nExtension Act. This bill would extend the financing and grant \nprovisions for the successful work sharing legislation I authored and \nworked to include in the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act \nof 2012.\n  The concept of work sharing is simple. It helps people who are \ncurrently employed, but in danger of being laid off, to keep their \njobs. By giving struggling companies the flexibility to reduce hours \ninstead of their workforce, work sharing programs prevent layoffs and \nhelp employers save money on rehiring costs. Employees who participate \nin work sharing keep their jobs and receive a portion of unemployment \ninsurance benefits to make up for lost wages.\n  Since becoming law, work sharing has helped save over 110,000 jobs, \nincluding 1,200 jobs in my State of Rhode Island, according to \nestimates from the Department of Labor. And it has saved States $225 \nmillion by reimbursing them for work sharing benefits they paid out to \nworkers--benefits that helped keep people on the job.\n  Before my bill became law in 2012, only a handful of States had work \nsharing programs. Now, these programs enjoy broad bipartisan support \nand have been established in 29 States and the District of Columbia. \nHowever, the $100 million in implementation grants expired at the end \nof 2014, and the 100 percent Federal financing of these work sharing \nbenefits will expire next month.\n\n[[Page S6190]]\n\n  The legislation I am introducing today would extend these deadlines \nby 2 years so that states with existing work sharing programs, and \nthose that are looking to enact a program, can qualify for Federal \nsupport.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting passage of this bill to \nkeep American workers on the job, save taxpayers money, and provide \nemployers with a practical, positive, and cost-effective alternative to \nlayoffs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Coons):\n  S. 1911. A bill to implement policies to end preventable maternal, \nnewborn, and child deaths globally; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I am very pleased to be joined by \nmy colleague from Delaware, Senator Chris Coons, in introducing the \nReach Every Mother and Child Act of 2015. The purpose of our bill is to \nimprove the health and well-being of women and children in developing \ncountries. Every day approximately 800 women will die from preventable \ncauses related to pregnancy and childbirth.\n  In addition, more than 17,000 children under the age of 5 will die \neach day of treatable conditions such as prematurity, pneumonia, and \ndiarrhea, with malnutrition being the underlying cause in nearly half \nthose deaths. While progress has been made in improving the health of \nmothers and their children, it is a tragedy that so many preventable \ndeaths still occur, especially given that there are many effective and \nestablished lifesaving maternal and child health protocols and \npolicies.\n  These lifesaving interventions include clean birthing practices, \nvaccines, nutritional supplements, hand washing with soap, and other \nbasic needs that remain elusive for far too many women and children in \ndeveloping countries.\n  Our legislation would strengthen the American government's commitment \nto ending preventable deaths of mothers, newborns, and young children \nin the developing world. There are simple, proven, cost-effective \ninterventions which we know will work if we can reach the mothers and \nchildren who need them to survive. Our bill will also allow us to \nleverage greater investments from other parties, especially the private \nsector, partner governments, private foundations, and multinational \norganizations.\n  According to USAID, a concentrated effort could end preventable \nmaternal and child deaths worldwide by the year 2035. However, U.S. \nleadership and support of the international community are critical to \nmeeting this goal.\n  The U.S. Agency for International Development--USAID--has set an \nambitious interim goal of preventing the deaths of 15 million children \nand 600,000 women in the next 5 years to ensure steadfast progress \ntoward the ultimate goal. Due in part to American leadership and \ngenerosity, many lives have already been saved. Since 1990 the annual \nnumber of deaths of children under the age of 5 has been cut in half. \nNevertheless, far too many mothers, newborns, and young children under \nthe age of 5 still succumb to disease and malnutrition that could \neasily be prevented. The deployment of interventions that have proved \nto be successful must be accelerated.\n  Our bill would require the administration to develop a 10-year \nstrategy to achieve the goal of preventing these deaths by the year \n2035. Our bill would charge USAID with meeting that goal.\n  One provision of our bill would establish a maternal and child \nsurvival coordinator at USAID who would focus on implementing the 10-\nyear strategy and verifying that the most effective interventions are \nscaled up in target countries. Our bill would also establish an \ninteragency working group to assist the coordinator in promoting \ngreater collaboration among all the Federal agencies involved in this \neffort.\n  To promote transparency and greater accountability, our bill requires \nthat detailed reporting be published on the Foreign Assistance \nDashboard, where it can be assessed by the public, Congress, and \nnongovernmental organizations to track the implementation of the \nstrategy and the progress being made.\n  Finally, the United States cannot and should not take on the goal of \neradicating these preventable deaths alone. Our bill recognizes this \nreality and requires the administration to develop a financing \nframework which would allow the use of U.S. Government dollars to \nleverage additional commitments from the private sector, nonprofit \norganizations, partner countries, and multinational organizations. As \nother investments grow, the need for U.S. Government assistance would \ndecline. At a time when we must make very difficult decisions regarding \nFederal priorities in our budget, this is an important and responsible \nprovision that ultimately will reduce the reliance on U.S. Government \ncontributions.\n  Improving the health and well-being of mothers and children around \nthe world has far-reaching social and economic benefits as well. An \nindependent group of economists and global health experts from around \nthe world, known as the Lancet Commission, indicated that the return on \ninvestment in global health initiatives is very high. In fact, for \nevery $1 invested, there is a return of $9 to $20 in growing the gross \ndomestic product of the country receiving the investment.\n  Other global health initiatives, such as the successful President's \nEmergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, which was started by \nPresident George Bush, demonstrate that results-risen interventions can \nturn the tide for global health challenges such as maternal and child \nsurvival. Taking lessons learned from past initiatives, our bill would \nprovide the focus and the tools necessary to accelerate progress toward \nending preventable maternal and child deaths.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a close look at the bill we are \nintroducing today and to join Senator Coons and me in supporting this \nbill to save the lives of mothers and children around the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Maine on the floor \nthis afternoon to talk about what we can do to save the lives of \nnewborn children and their mothers in some of the poorest communities \naround our globe.\n  I wish to start by thanking Senator Collins for her impressive \nleadership and for the energy she has brought to this work. I share her \nbelief that our bipartisan bill, which is called the Reach Every Mother \nand Child Act or just the REACH Act, will go a long way toward \neliminating preventable maternal and child deaths and will do so in an \nimpressively targeted and cost-effective way.\n  The preventable death of newborns, their mothers, and children under \n5 is a genuine tragedy that remains a widespread reality in far too \nmany places around our world today. As Senator Collins said, 17,000 \nchildren a day lose their lives to preventable diseases such as \npneumonia, diarrhea, and malaria--illnesses we know how to not just \ntreat but prevent--and worldwide, 3 million children will lose their \nlives to malnutrition this year. Nearly 3 million newborns die every \nyear, 1 million of whom don't live to their second day, and 300,000 \nwomen don't get to experience the joy of raising their child as either \npregnancy or birth takes their lives. I doubt it would come to any \nsurprise to those in this Chamber today that it is the families who are \nliving in the poorest communities in the developing world who are most \nat risk.\n  So what brings Senator Collins and me to the floor today is the fact \nthat there are things we can do to prevent these deaths from ever \nhappening and to do so in a cost-effective and transparent way. Since I \nfirst entered office, I have been confronted with challenges both at \nhome and around the world that demand our action but where real \nsolutions remain out of the reach of this Senate or our government. \nThis is not one of those issues.\n  Some doubt that we can make a lasting and meaningful impact on the \npoorest of the poor in the developing world, but the fact is, we have \nmade real progress. It was time spent in east Africa 30 years ago that \nfirst really changed my life and engaged me passionately in these \nissues. What is striking is how much progress we have actually made. \nOver the past 25 years, we have cut in half the number of children and \nmothers who have died, the number of children under 5, and mothers who \ndie in illnesses associated with\n\n[[Page S6191]]\n\nchildbirth. Mortality rates are now declining faster than ever. And \nwhile we do face real and seemingly intractable challenges across the \ninternational landscape, our progress on this issue remains a telling \nsign of what is possible when we pull together and apply thoughtful \ninterventions.\n  Just last year the administration took an important next step, laying \nout a new strategy with ambitious goals--saving the lives of 15 million \nchildren and 600,000 women by the end of this decade. Think about the \nscope and reach of the change that would mean for families and for \ncommunities in some of the poorest places on this planet. These goals \nare based in the lessons we have learned about what really works. \nProviding neonatal care to expectant mothers works. Vaccinating young \nchildren works. Providing access to clean water so that children don't \ndie from diarrhea works. Providing HIV-positive mothers with \nantiretroviral drugs works.\n  I am hopeful about our ability to find cost-effective solutions \nbecause many of these remedies are simple things which are already at \nwork here in our own country and which we as Americans take for \ngranted. In the United States, what would be a fairly routine \ncomplication of childbirth would, in many communities in the developing \nworld, be a life-or-death situation.\n  For example, let me talk for a moment about something called a \nresuscitation bag--a simple piece of plastic that costs just a few \ndollars. Most American parents have either seen one used or ready to be \nused in the delivery room. We know that in an American hospital--and it \nshould be in the hospital of any developed country--when a nurse needs \na resuscitation bag for a newborn who is struggling to breathe, it is \nright there and waiting. But in the poorest communities, where newborns \nare losing their lives at astounding rates, a significant factor is the \nsimple absence of these bags to save the lives of newborns. When a \nnurse--if there is even a nurse--reaches for one, there is none to be \nfound. Yet these simple devices that cost just a few dollars could save \nliterally hundreds or thousands of lives.\n  So what our bipartisan REACH Act does is recognize that many of the \nsteps we can take are very much within our grasp, and our bill would \ntake these solutions a step further by reforming them and scaling them \nup so they have a larger, longer term impact.\n  Our bill would increase coordination to better implement U.S. \nstrategies with the goal of ending preventable maternal, newborn, and \nchild deaths within 20 years. It would build new partnerships with the \nprivate sector, improve coordination across agencies, and insist on \nreal targets and transparent and measurable progress. It would also, as \nSenator Collins referenced, allow U.S. Government dollars to be \nleveraged. And I love it when we leverage our resources with the \nprivate sector, with multilateral donors, and with our partner \ncountries in the developing world. Critically, it would focus on the \nmost effective interventions in the poorest and most vulnerable \ncommunities and put in place targets that can be effectively tracked.\n  These communities in the poorest parts of our planet face many \nchallenges, but when it comes to saving the lives of young mothers and \nchildren, we know exactly what it will take to make a meaningful \ndifference. Today, together, we are offering a strong path forward.\n  I close by urging my colleagues to follow the real leadership of \nSenator Collins and to join both of us in ensuring that American \ningenuity and leadership can continue to save lives and to offer \ncommunities around our world a brighter future.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from Delaware \nfor his very eloquent statement. I know how passionate he is about \nhelping people, particularly in Africa. He has extraordinary expertise \nabout that region of the world, about that continent, and has been \nthere many times. I look forward to working with him to make this bill \na law. It is bipartisan, and it should bring people together across \nparty lines. I hope we will be able to get it signed into law this \nyear.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KAINE (for himself and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 1914. A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act with \nrespect to the guidelines for specification of certain disposal sites \nfor dredged or fill material; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join my bipartisan \nVirginia colleagues Senator Mark Warner and Congressmen Robert Hurt and \nMorgan Griffith in introducing the Commonsense Permitting for Job \nCreation Act of 2015, a bipartisan, bicameral piece of legislation to \naddress an aspect of water permitting law that has touched several \neconomic development projects in Virginia.\n  Southern Virginia has seen great economic challenges in recent years \ndue to the overall economic downturn compounded by fundamental changes \nto the region's traditional industries such as manufacturing, textiles, \nand tobacco. Throughout this region there are several business park \nsites that could be developed to accommodate one or multiple \nmanufacturing operations. County economic development authorities have \nworked to secure all necessary permits and authorities to develop these \nsites but have encountered an issue pertaining to Clean Water Act \nSection 404 permits.\n  Several of these counties have had difficulty securing approval from \nthe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for 404 permits because the Corps is \nreluctant to issue a permit without a company that has committed to the \nsite and prepared detailed development blueprints. In speaking to \npotential companies, county officials have heard that it is difficult \nfor a company to commit to a site without assurance that all government \npermits are secured. This has created a ``chicken and egg'' conundrum--\na company will not relocate to the site without an approved permit, but \na permit cannot be approved without a company willing to relocate.\n  This legislation simply addresses that regulatory ambiguity by \nspecifying that the lack of a committed end-user shall not be the sole \nreason to deny a Corps permit that meets all other legal requirements \nunder Section 404.\n  I believe Federal, State, and local stakeholders can work in good \nfaith to follow all laws protecting our water resources, while taking \nreasonable steps to make it easier to pursue economic development \nopportunities in economically distressed communities. My colleagues and \nI introduced a version of this bill in the previous Congress, and we \nwere pleased to help speed the process that led to the approval of a \npermit for the Commonwealth Crossing Business Center in Henry County, \nVA, last year.\n  I am optimistic that this bill will help expedite approval of \nimportant economic development projects in a manner that is acceptable \nto all stakeholders. We are proud to be able to work across the aisle \nand with state and local officials on this commonsense, bipartisan \nsolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/30/senate-section/article/S6191-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6191-S6192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 236--DESIGNATING JULY 30, 2015, AS ``NATIONAL \n                    WHISTLEBLOWER APPRECIATION DAY''\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Wyden, Ms. Collins, Mr. Tillis, Mr. \nKirk, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Carper, and Mrs. McCaskill) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

22 \n     U.S.C. 2151 note) by working with regional governments toward \n     a comprehensive and permanent resolution to the conflict in \n     northern Uganda and other affected areas through the \n     provision of political, economic, military, and intelligence \n     support to protect civilians, apprehend or remove Joseph Kony \n     and his top commanders from the battlefield, and disarm and \n     demobilize the remaining Lord's Resistance Army fighters;\n       Whereas, in June 2012, the United Nations Security Council \n     endorsed the Regional Strategy of the United Nations to bring \n     an end to the Lord's Resistance Army by focusing on the \n     implementation of the Regional Cooperation Initiative of the \n     African Union and to support the governments affected by the \n     ongoing conflict;\n       Whereas, on September 18 and 19, 2012, the Governments of \n     the Central African Republic, South Sudan, and the Republic \n     of Uganda dedicated contingents of their armed forces to a \n     unified African Union Regional Task Force mandated to \n     permanently end the Lord's Resistance Army threat, with the \n     Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo following \n     suit on February 14, 2013;\n       Whereas Joseph Kony remains a Specially Designated Global \n     Terrorist and, on January 15, 2013, the Department of State \n     under its Rewards for Justice Program announced a reward for \n     information leading to Kony's arrest or conviction;\n       Whereas, on December 10, 2014, the United Nations Security \n     Council issued a presidential statement welcoming the \n     continued advisory and logistical support provided by the \n     United States to the African Union Regional Task Force, while \n     noting continued reports of the presence of senior Lord's \n     Resistance Army leaders in the disputed Kafia Kingi enclave \n     and reports of opportunistic collaboration between the Lord's \n     Resistance Army and ex-Seleka forces in the Central African \n     Republic;\n       Whereas, on March 25, 2014, President Barack Obama notified \n     Congress of the increased commitment of approximately 250 \n     members of the United States Armed Forces to the Regional \n     Task Force to assist regional forces in their efforts to \n     protect civilians, encourage defections from the Lord's \n     Resistance Army, and bring Joseph Kony and his senior \n     leadership to justice;\n       Whereas reports from nongovernmental organizations \n     operating on the ground indicate that local communities and \n     civil society leaders in the region have welcomed and \n     continue to support the presence and continued assistance of \n     United States military advisors;\n       Whereas, due to the continued efforts of the Regional Task \n     Force of the African Union and United States military \n     advisors, killings carried out by the Lord's Resistance Army \n     have dropped 90 percent since 2011 and approximately 25 \n     percent of the core fighting force of the Lord's Resistance \n     Army has defected or been otherwise removed from the \n     battlefield since January 2013;\n       Whereas over 120 women and children held in long-term \n     captivity by the Lord's Resistance Army escaped from the \n     rebel group in 2014;\n       Whereas reports from nongovernmental organizations and the \n     United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian \n     Affairs demonstrate an increase in attacks and abductions by \n     the Lord's Resistance Army in 2014 compared to 2013, as well \n     as an increase in internally displaced persons in the \n     northeastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo \n     in late 2014;\n       Whereas the African Union Regional Task Force reported in \n     January 2015 that Okot Odhiambo, a senior Lord's Resistance \n     Army officer indicted by the International Criminal Court on \n     charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity, was killed \n     in battle in 2013;\n       Whereas, on January 5, 2015, Dominic Ongwen, a senior \n     Lord's Resistance Army officer indicted by the International \n     Criminal Court on charges of war crimes and crimes against \n     humanity, defected to forces from the United States and \n     African Union Regional Task Force;\n       Whereas the inability of the Central African Republic and \n     the Democratic Republic of the Congo to defuse violence, \n     establish legitimate and effective governance, or achieve \n     basic development objectives throughout their countries has \n     provided safe haven for the Lord's Resistance Army and the \n     failure to immediately de-escalate and resolve the broader \n     national crisis risks eclipsing gains made by United States \n     efforts to prevent atrocities in the southeastern region of \n     the Central African Republic; and\n       Whereas targeted United States assistance and leadership \n     has made a significant impact on preventing further mass \n     atrocities and curtailing humanitarian suffering in central \n     Africa and must be reinforced to maintain these gains: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns Joseph Kony and the Lord's Resistance Army for \n     continuing to perpetrate crimes against humanity and mass \n     atrocities, and supports ongoing efforts by the United \n     States, the African Union, the international community, and \n     governments in central Africa to remove Joseph Kony and \n     Lord's Resistance Army commanders from the battlefield and \n     promote protection and recovery for affected communities;\n\n[[Page S6193]]\n\n       (2) commends the continued efforts by the African Union, \n     the United Nations, and regional partners to end the threat \n     posed by the Lord's Resistance Army;\n       (3) supports efforts to provide the Regional Task Force \n     with the logistics support and authorizations needed to \n     access all areas of suspected Lord's Resistance Army activity \n     in the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic \n     of the Congo;\n       (4) urges the President to reauthorize the deployment of \n     United States Armed Forces personnel in support of Operation \n     Observant Compass until senior Lord's Resistance Army \n     commanders are removed from the battlefield and the group no \n     longer poses a significant threat to civilians;\n       (5) urges the Secretary of State and the Secretary of \n     Defense to support the African Union and the Regional Task \n     Force, as well as regional partners, in their efforts to deny \n     the Lord's Resistance Army safe haven in Sudan and in the \n     disputed Kafia Kingi enclave, by expanding defection \n     messaging initiatives, urging the African Union to engage \n     more proactively in diplomatic outreach to the Government of \n     Sudan, and removing Joseph Kony and his top commanders from \n     the battlefield through the sharing of intelligence and other \n     military assistance;\n       (6) urges the African Union and the Regional Task Force, \n     with the support of the European Union, as well as the \n     Governments of Uganda, South Sudan, the Central African \n     Republic, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to \n     implement the Regional Strategy of the United Nations by--\n       (A) fully implementing the Regional Cooperation Initiative \n     developed by the African Union to bring an end to the Lord's \n     Resistance Army;\n       (B) enhancing efforts to promote the protection of \n     civilians in all areas in which the Lord's Resistance Army \n     operates; and\n       (C) broadening current efforts of disarmament, \n     demobilization, repatriation, resettlement, and reintegration \n     to all areas affected by the Lord's Resistance Army, as well \n     as humanitarian and child protection efforts;\n       (7) welcomes the continued defections of men, women, and \n     children from the Lord's Resistance Army, and calls on \n     governments in the region and the international community to \n     support their demobilization and safe return;\n       (8) calls on the Secretary of State, the Secretary of \n     Defense, the Administrator of the United States Agency for \n     International Development, and the heads of other relevant \n     United States Government agencies to utilize authorized and \n     appropriated funds--\n       (A) to continue efforts to enhance intelligence, \n     surveillance, and reconnaissance support to the African Union \n     Regional Task Force, and specifically to encourage additional \n     enablers and actionable intelligence to increase the \n     effectiveness of partner operations;\n       (B) to work with the United Nations, the African Union, and \n     regional government partners to encourage and help non-\n     indicted Lord's Resistance Army members, abductees, and \n     noncombatants to defect safely from the group through the \n     distribution of aerial leaflets, the broadcast of ``come \n     home'' radio programs, and the continuation of flights \n     utilizing helicopter-based speaker systems over known areas \n     of Lord's Resistance Army operation;\n       (C) to expand efforts to prevent the Lord's Resistance Army \n     from funding its operations through the theft and trade of \n     illicit ivory, gold, and diamonds; and\n       (D) to support rehabilitation and reintegration programs \n     led by nongovernmental organizations and regional government \n     partners for children, youth, and adults that have been \n     abducted and indoctrinated by the Lord's Resistance Army;\n       (9) commends those members of the United States Armed \n     Forces previously or currently deployed to serve in support \n     of Operation Observant Compass for their critical \n     contributions to efforts to remove Joseph Kony and Lord's \n     Resistance Army commanders from the battlefield, protect \n     civilians, and encourage members of the Lord's Resistance \n     Army to peacefully defect; and\n       (10) urges the President, with input from United States \n     Government agencies, regional governments, multilateral \n     partners, and nongovernmental organizations, to develop a \n     strategy aimed at supporting sustainable recovery and \n     security within areas affected by the Lord's Resistance Army, \n     with existing resources, and in partnership with other donors \n     and multilateral bodies, including the World Bank, the \n     European Union, and others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/30/senate-section/article/S6193-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6193-S6194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 238--EXPRESSING THE DETERMINATION OF THE SENATE THAT \n  THE 60-CALENDAR DAY PERIOD FOR CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW OF THE NUCLEAR \nAGREEMENT WITH IRAN DID NOT BEGIN WITH THE TRANSMITTAL OF THE AGREEMENT \n    ON JULY 19, 2015, BECAUSE THAT TRANSMITTAL DID NOT INCLUDE ALL \n   MATERIALS REQUIRED TO BE TRANSMITTED PURSUANT TO THE IRAN NUCLEAR \n                      AGREEMENT REVIEW ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. CRUZ submitted the following resolution;

which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 239\n\n       Whereas the Virginia General Assembly, with Professor \n     Donald W. Davis of the College of William & Mary, envisioned \n     a center for marine research and education in the \n     Commonwealth of Virginia;\n       Whereas the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (referred \n     to in this preamble as ``VIMS''), originally known as the \n     Virginia Fisheries Laboratory, began operation in 1940;\n       Whereas the early work of VIMS assured the future of the \n     fishery industry in Virginia by improving the general \n     knowledge of the resources of fisheries so that they might be \n     properly conserved and managed, and by meeting the need for \n     training in practical marine biology;\n       Whereas VIMS is now the home of the School of Marine \n     Sciences of the College of William & Mary, a university \n     research and teaching center with a strong element of public \n     service, and is the leading marine center that focuses on \n     estuarine and coastal environments in the nation; and\n       Whereas VIMS continues to serve the Commonwealth of \n     Virginia and the United States by advancing the frontiers of \n     marine science and sharing the knowledge gained through \n     research with the users and stewards of the environment and \n     future scientists: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates the College of William & Mary and the \n     Virginia Institute of Marine Science on the 75th anniversary \n     of the Virginia Institute of Marine Science; and\n       (2) expresses appreciation for the 75 years of service to \n     the environment by the faculty, staff, and students of the \n     Virginia Institute of Marine Science and the School of Marine \n     Sciences of the College of William & Mary.\n\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, Virginia has a proud tradition of academic \nexcellence dating back to Thomas Jefferson and a deep appreciation for \nour beautiful and bountiful coastal waters that predates that. For 75 \nyears, one Virginia academic institution has built a sterling \nreputation as a national leader in environmental education and a \ntrusted source of information and analysis for generations of \npolicymakers. The Virginia Institute of Marine Science at the College \nof William & Mary is celebrating its 75th anniversary in 2015. I am \nproud to join my bipartisan colleagues Senator Mark Warner and \nCongressman Rob Wittman in submitting a resolution to commemorate this \nmilestone.\n  VIMS research has yielded critical insights into the water quality of \nthe Chesapeake Bay and its rivers, informing the work of Virginia and \nother Chesapeake Bay States in striving to reduce pollution while \ngrowing outdoor recreation and the economic activity that goes with it. \nIt has produced data and analysis that has contributed to the \ndevelopment of strategies to maintain robust oyster and crab \npopulations, particularly through cooperative partnership with \nVirginia's commercial watermen. It has also developed technology and \nexpertise that allows more precise projections than ever before of \nrates of sea level rise and recurrent flooding in the Hampton Roads \nregion.\n  Elected officials of both parties and at all levels of government in \nVirginia have benefitted from the expertise and objectivity that this \ninstitution brings to environmental policy. I was fortunate to have \naccess to this valuable scientific asset as Governor of Virginia, and I \ncontinue to consider its thoughtful views on policy issues that come \nbefore Congress.\n  I congratulate VIMS for 75 years of dedication to academic excellence \nand scientific achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/30/senate-section/article/S6194-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2542.
