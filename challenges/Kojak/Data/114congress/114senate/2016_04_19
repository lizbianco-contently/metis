Mr. President, later this morning the Senate will have \nan opportunity to pass the FAA reauthorization and security bill, which \naims to secure our airports and look out for American travelers.\n  This legislation received bipartisan support from the start, and it \nshows what is possible with a Senate that is back to work. Under the \nguidance of Senator Thune, the Commerce Committee chairman, and Senator \nAyotte, the Aviation chair, this FAA reauthorization and security bill \nincorporated ideas from both sides as it moved through the legislative \nprocess. I also appreciate the work of Ranking Member Nelson and \nRanking Member Cantwell in working with them to advance it.\n  After 7 hearings and nearly 60 amendments accepted, the bill passed \nthe Commerce Committee by a voice vote. On the floor, the bill managers \ncontinued listening and working with Senators from both sides to \nprocess more amendments that Members thought would make this good bill \neven stronger. For instance, they worked to include a number of \nadditional security measures in an amendment that earned bipartisan \nsupport. That amendment aims to enhance inspections and vetting of \nairport workers to improve security for international flights arriving \nat U.S. airports and to help ensure perimeter security is reviewed.\n  In addition to these important security provisions, we accepted an \namendment from Senator Heinrich to shore up security in prescreening \nzones, which could be particularly vulnerable to attacks. We also \nadopted an amendment from Senators Toomey and Casey that addresses the \nsecurity of cockpit doors. I appreciate these and other Senators who \nput forth ideas to make the final product something both sides can \nsupport.\n  The FAA reauthorization and security bill will make important strides \nfor our national security and for travelers. It does so without \nincreasing fees or taxes on passengers. It does so without imposing \nheavyhanded regulations that can stifle consumers' choices. I look \nforward to supporting this legislation later this morning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/senate-section/article/S2131-6", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2131-S2132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ENERGY POLICY MODERNIZATION BILL\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, moving forward, the Republican-led \nSenate will have another opportunity to pass bipartisan legislation--\nlegislation aimed at modernizing America's energy policies. The Energy \nPolicy Modernization Act is the result of more than a year's worth of \nwork by our Energy and Natural Resources Committee chair Senator \nMurkowski, and ranking member Senator Cantwell. These Senators know it \nhas been nearly a decade since the Senate considered major energy \nlegislation, so they worked to do something about it. They also know \nthat good policy results from good process, as this bill certainly \ndemonstrates. It has meant working through countless listening sessions \nand oversight hearings; it has meant working through numerous amendment \nvotes and debate hours; it has meant working to move this bipartisan \nEnergy bill to final passage.\n  The Energy Policy Modernization Act aims to bring our energy policies \nin line with the demands of today and to position us to benefit from \nthe energy opportunities of tomorrow. Here is how it can help achieve \nthat goal: It expands domestic supply and improves efficiency. It \naddresses aging infrastructure and enhances safeguards. It promotes \naccountability and cuts through needless redtape. This broad, \nbipartisan bill does all these things. It builds on technological \nprogress in order to strengthen and sustain America's energy advances. \nIt protects our environment at the same time. It does all of this \nwithout raising taxes or adding a dime to the deficit.\n  Here is what that means for our country: It will help Americans save \nenergy. It will help Americans produce more energy. It will help \nAmericans pay less for energy. And, like the airport security \nlegislation I mentioned earlier, the Energy Policy Modernization Act \nwill help keep Americans safe.\n\n[[Page S2132]]\n\nIt includes provisions to bolster our national security by \nstrengthening our cyber security defense mechanisms.\n  This legislation will make significant strides for American energy \npolicies, and it wouldn't have been possible without the bill managers' \nleadership and dedication. So I want to thank them again for their \ndiligence in advancing this critical legislation closer to passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/senate-section/article/S2132-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO POLICE CHIEF RICK McCUBBIN\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about \nmy good friend Police Chief Rick McCubbin of the Bardstown Police \nDepartment. We learned yesterday that he will be retiring from service \nafter 5 years as chief and nearly 30 years in law enforcement.\n  Chief McCubbin led his officers through some of the most troubling \ntimes in the police department's history. He did so with rigor and \nresolve, with grit and with grace.\n  Nearly 3 years ago, the Bardstown Police Department took a blow to \nits very core with the tragic assassination of Officer Jason Ellis, who \nwas killed in an ambush while driving home in uniform and in a marked \nvehicle. Authorities have strong reason to believe the killing was \nretaliation from drug traffickers against a police department that was \nmaking significant progress in rooting out trafficking and making drug \narrests.\n  Chief McCubbin was the leader of that effort to stamp out drug crime. \nHe spoke eloquently on behalf of the whole department about the loss of \ntheir brother Jason, who will never be forgotten. I know that while the \ncase remains unsolved today, he has led the effort to see Officer \nEllis's killers brought to justice.\n  Chief McCubbin continued the fight against drug trafficking by seeing \nto it that Bardstown's surrounding Nelson County earned inclusion in \nthe Appalachia High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area program, which we \ncall HIDTA, back in 2014. HIDTA is not just another government acronym \nbut a model that works. It couples Federal law enforcement with State \nand local task forces and the supplies, training, and technology they \nneed. By getting Nelson County included in the HIDTA program, Chief \nMcCubbin brought a powerful force multiplier to his department's own \nefforts to fight drug trafficking and keep the citizens of Bardstown \nsafe.\n  It has been an honor to work with Chief Rick McCubbin over the years. \nHe received the honor of Kentucky's Police Chief of the Year in 2015, \nand I know the people of Bardstown and Nelson County certainly \nappreciate his diligence and determination to fight crime and to keep \nthem safe. I thank him for his service to Bardstown, to Kentucky, and \nto the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/senate-section/article/S2132-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I appreciate the Republican leader talking \npositively about the Energy bill, which we called the energy efficiency \nbill in the last two Congresses, when we tried so hard under the \ndirection of Senator Shaheen from New Hampshire to get this done. We \ntried so very hard. We had many runs at it. There were promises from \nthe Republicans; I don't need to mention names, but they know who they \nare: Let's get back on this bill. We will get it done. We have only \nthree amendments. We have only two amendments. We did that time after \ntime over 4 years. Every time, the obstruction would not go away, and \nwe could not do the bill.\n  I am grateful that we have a bill now dealing with energy efficiency. \nThe name has been changed, but it is the same bill. I hope that Senator \nShaheen from New Hampshire has some degree of pride over what she \nstarted a long time ago. Her name is not on the legislation anymore, \nand I appreciate the junior Senator from Washington and the senior \nSenator from Alaska working hard to bring it to the floor today. We \nbrought it to the point where we are today as a result of a very long \nstruggle.\n  The Republican leader talks about the many years since we have had an \nEnergy bill. The reason we didn't have one 4 years sooner is that they \nwouldn't let us. Gridlock, obstruction--the Republicans blocked Energy \nbills any chance they got. They insisted on offering amendments that \nweren't germane or relevant.\n  We are not acting the way they did. We want to get it done also. It \nis important for our country, and it is a positive step forward. I want \nto make sure there is a full understanding of the history behind this.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/senate-section/article/S2132-4", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2132-S2133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBING ANNIVERSARY AND NOMINATION OF MERRICK GARLAND\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, 21 years ago today, in Oklahoma City at 9:02 \na.m. Oklahoma City time, Timothy McVeigh detonated a bomb at the \nFederal building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 innocent people, and 19 \nof them were children who were there with their parents on business the \nfamily had. This was a work day, and Timothy McVeigh detonated that \nhuge explosion. People could see the smoke from miles and miles away. \nIt was the deadliest terrorist attack on American soil before 9/11.\n  I think we can all see--I know I can see in my mind's eye the images \nthat were on television and the huge Federal building destroyed. It had \nbeen ripped in half. I recall, as I am sure people within the sound of \nmy voice recall, the images of chaos: bloody, disoriented victims \ntrying to determine if they were alive, if they had their arms, if they \nhad their legs, if they had their mind, if they had their eyes. As soon \nas they got that straightened out, they started desperately trying to \nfind and assist the injured.\n  This was a heart-wrenching day for our Nation. People watched the \naftermath and wanted to help in any way they could.\n  One of those eager to help was a lawyer from the Department of \nJustice named Merrick Garland. His boss at the time was a well-known \npolitical figure, Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick. She explained \nGarland's desire to go to Oklahoma City and help with the \ninvestigation. She said:\n\n       Both of us had kids about the ages of the kids in the day \n     care center [in Washington]. We were just sick to our \n     stomachs. And Merrick said, ``I need to go.''\n\n  Merrick Garland went home that evening knowing that he would be gone \nfor a while. He kissed his wife and his children, and he arrived in \nOklahoma City less than 48 hours later.\n  At this time, Garland was a seasoned Federal prosecutor, having \nserved as U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia prior to taking a \nsenior role in the Department of Justice. Those who knew him recall how \ncompetent he was. Having done some criminal defense work in my past, I \nknow how difficult it is for somebody trying to defend somebody when \nyou come up against a prosecutor with the reputation of Garland. They \nhave a way about them to make the case simple in the minds of a judge \nand jury, even though there could be a very complicated set of \nfacts. Those who worked with him recall him as unwavering in his \ncommitment to the law. He followed the law. He followed procedure. He \nwas guided by an acute sense of fairness. The New York Times reported:\n\n       Former colleagues also recalled that Mr. Garland insisted \n     on doing the investigation by the book, like obtaining \n     subpoenas even when phone and truck rental companies \n     volunteered to simply hand over the evidence, to avoid any \n     future trial problems. He also made sure there was a \n     prosecutor responsible for keeping relatives and victims \n     informed about the case as it developed.\n\n  In speech after speech, the senior Senator from Iowa has insisted \nthat a nominee to the Supreme Court should be ``supreme,'' should be \nsomeone who--and I quote him--``adheres to the Constitution and the \nrule of law and decides cases based on wherever the text takes him or \nher.''\n  Merrick Garland is the person the senior Senator from Iowa described. \nWith an entire nation wanting justice served immediately to those \nresponsible for the bombing, Garland and his team refused to take \nshortcuts. They did it the right way. They did it the Garland way. They \nadhered to the law every step of the way.\n\n[[Page S2133]]\n\n  So impressive was Mr. Garland throughout the investigation and \nprosecution, that Steven Jones, the attorney for Timothy McVeigh--\nlisten to this. Here is what the attorney for McVeigh said about \nMerrick Garland.\n\n       Personally he's above reproach. He has integrity. He has \n     the skills.\n\n  Merrick Garland was also devoted to the victims and their families. \nClaudia Denny was the mother of children in the building's daycare \ncenter. Her children were critically injured, but they survived. They \nare alive. This is what she said of Merrick Garland:\n\n       Early on we got invited to the U.S. attorney's office. They \n     wanted all of our concerns, and I think Judge Garland set \n     that up where we all got our voice heard.\n\n  The Oklahoma City prosecution ended with convictions and guilty pleas \nfor all who were involved. To this day, Oklahomans still revere Merrick \nGarland for his good work. Frank Keating, the Governor of Oklahoma at \nthe time of the attack, has been outspoken in his praise of Judge \nGarland. He told NPR recently:\n\n       People don't understand when they're eating a good dinner \n     on Friday night, there is a chef in the kitchen that did it. \n     And in the case of what we saw after April 19, there was a \n     chef in the kitchen that did it, and it was Merrick Garland.\n\n  The junior Senator from Oklahoma recently praised Judge Garland \nsaying, ``I do plan to meet with Merrick Garland in my office in the \nweeks ahead to say thank you for what he did for Oklahoma during the \nbombing trial.\n  But that is as far as Senator Lankford has said he will go. He has \nmade it clear that he will do nothing to help Garland get a hearing or \na vote.\n  Following his work in the Oklahoma City case, Merrick Garland \ncontinued to work on other notable criminal cases. He oversaw the \nprosecution of the Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski, this evil man who is now \nin prison. Garland ran the investigation on the Atlanta Olympics \nbombing. He then went on to serve with distinction on the DC Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, where he now serves as the chief judge.\n  Supreme Court Justice John Roberts once said of Garland's judicial \nexpertise: ``Anytime Judge Garland disagrees, you know you are in a \ndifficult area.'' It is time for Republicans to allow the American \npeople to see Merrick Garland themselves, not have me talking about him \nbut see him for themselves. This is a super star. This is somebody who \nshould be on the Court. Republicans should allow the American people to \nsee this man for what the people of Oklahoma and litigants in the \ncourtrooms have known for many years: This is a special man.\n  Last year, as part of the 20th anniversary of the Oklahoma City \nattack, Judge Garland and some of his fellow prosecutors were awarded \nthe Reflections of Hope Award by the Oklahoma City National Memorial. \nThe honor is awarded to those who exemplify the belief that ``hope can \nsurvive and blossom amidst the tragedy and chaos.''\n  That is the hope Merrick Garland brought to Oklahoma in the aftermath \nof that vicious day. We are reminded of Judge Garland's contributions \nin securing justice in Oklahoma City and wherever he has gone. He is a \nbrilliant man. He is academically brilliant. He is a man who was not \ngiven anything on a silver platter. In my meeting with him, I asked him \nhow he handled the situation at Harvard. It is an expensive place. He \nsaid: Well, among other things, I sold my comic book collection.\n  Now, that does not sound like much to most people. But those coins, \nfor example, that my little brother--we are separated by 22 months--has \nbeen collecting since he was a little boy mean a lot to him. Most of \nthem are not worth too much. Some of them are.\n  Merrick Garland collected comic books. One of my best friend's sons \ncollects comic books. It is something they do. It meant a lot to him. \nHe had to get rid of them to get through college. He has inspired those \naround him through his hard work and commitment and fairness always. \nThat is why it is so disappointing that Republicans are denying this \nman the common decency of a hearing so the American people can see him.\n  Why not let Merrick Garland speak for himself at a hearing? Why not \nlet him make his own case to the American people and their elected \nSenators? There is no excuse to delay his nomination any longer. Senate \nRepublicans should give Merrick Garland the hearings and the vote he \ndeserves. Republicans need to simply do their job.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/senate-section/article/S2133-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               BOKO HARAM\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to say just a brief word on another \nsubject. Last week marked another horrible anniversary, the 2-year \nanniversary since the terrorist group Boko Haram invaded a school in \nNigeria and took away 300 little girls. They were girls. They were not \nyoung women. They were little girls.\n  The world watched as parents of the girls pleaded for help. People \nall over the world, including First Lady Michelle Obama, rallied behind \nthe campaign ``Bring Back Our Girls.'' Despite the global outcry, most \nof these girls--the vast majority of these girls--are still missing 2 \nyears later. But here is the horrible part about this--the shocking \nfate of some of these girls.\n  It has been a couple of years. They are older--teenagers. Boko Haram \nis weaponizing them, turning these little girls--they are now not so \nlittle--into suicide bombers. According to the United Nations \nChildren's Emergency Fund, or UNICEF, in the 4 countries where Boko \nHaram operates, the number of children used in bombing attacks has \nsharply increased from 4 in 2014 to 44 last year. That record will be \nbroken this year.\n  Nearly one out of every five bombers where Boko Haram is active is a \nchild. Seventy-five percent of the child bombers are girls. As a father \nand grandfather of 19 children, I am sickened by what has happened to \nthose schoolgirls. Although 2 years has passed since the abduction, the \nworld must not forget the evil of this organization. We must be as \nresolved as ever to fight terrorism wherever it rears its ugly head. \nWhether it is ISIS or Boko Haram, we cannot stop. We must be vigilant.\n  Mr. President, the Chair announce the business that we are going to \nproceed with today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/senate-section/article/S2133-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today we are going to remember the victims \nand families whose lives were forever changed by the bombing in \nOklahoma City 21 years ago. This homegrown terrorist attack--this \nbombing shook our Nation to its core. In fact, it remains the worst act \nof homegrown terrorism our Nation has endured.\n  The destruction and the loss of life were overwhelming. This \nphotograph I have never forgotten. The firefighter is carrying the limp \nand bloodied body of a toddler from the wreckage. Those of us who are \nparents and grandparents know the joy we have had in caring for \nchildren this age. You can only imagine the sadness of that \nfirefighter. It symbolized the horror of the attack: 168 innocent lives \nperished that day; 19 of them were children.\n  The impact, of course, and the loss in the Oklahoma City community \nwas enormous. Nearly everyone knew someone who had lost a friend or \nfamily member. The city's emergency services and their victims support \nresources were quickly overwhelmed. As the days went by and the needs \nmounted, it became clear that the existing State and Federal resources \nwere simply insufficient to respond to such a massive attack.\n  So to respond to the victims' needs, I proposed, and Congress passed, \nthe Victims of Terrorism Act of 1995. Among important matters, the \nlegislation I wrote created an emergency reserve as part of the Crime \nVictims Fund to serve as an emergency resource in the wake of an act of \nterrorism or mass violence. Even though every one of us, Republicans \nand Democrats alike,\n\n[[Page S2134]]\n\nprayed there would never be such another act, we had, in my \nlegislation, an emergency reserve, because without such a fund, State \nvictim compensation and assistance programs are quickly overwhelmed. \nThis new fund was critical to ensuring that additional resources got to \nthe field quickly.\n  Over the last two decades, this fund has been instrumental in \nallowing the Federal government to immediately respond to the victims \nof other unspeakable acts of mass violence, including the 9/11 \nterrorist attack and more recently, the domestic terror attack in the \nEmanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South \nCarolina.\n  Last month I met with the former Federal prosecutor who managed the \ninvestigation and the prosecutions of the Oklahoma City bombers. We \ntalked about the prosecution. That former prosecutor was Chief Judge \nMerrick Garland. He was nominated to the Supreme Court last month. But \nbefore he was a judge and a nominee to serve on the highest Court in \nthe land, he was a prosecutor and a senior official at the Justice \nDepartment. Those of us who have had the privilege of being \nprosecutors, none of us could ever think of facing what he did.\n  Immediately after hearing the news of the devastation in Oklahoma \nCity, Merrick Garland turned to the Deputy Attorney General. He said, \nvery simply: ``You need to send me there.'' The next day, Merrick \nGarland became the highest ranking Department of Justice official on \nthe ground in Oklahoma City after the bombing. He helped to oversee \nevery aspect of the criminal investigation and response. Years later, \nhe still considers his work in Oklahoma City the most important in his \nlife.\n  Chief Judge Garland's commitment to fairness during that difficult \nperiod and his work with the citizens of Oklahoma City were formative \nfor him. I know from talking with him that it left a lasting impression \non him, but it left especially a lasting impression on the people he \nserved.\n  Last year, the Oklahoma City National Memorial & Museum honored \nMerrick Garland with a Reflections of Hope Award for his work on behalf \nof victims. After his nomination to the Supreme Court last month, the \nOklahoma museum's Executive Director said: ``We are so proud that Judge \nGarland, who kept the family members and survivors front and center \nduring his work in Oklahoma City, has been nominated.''\n  We have also heard from a team of former prosecutors, law enforcement \nagents, and victims' advocates who worked directly with Chief Judge \nGarland in the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing. They have \nwritten to the leadership of the Senate and the Judiciary Committee to \nhighlight Chief Judge Garland's work on this terrorism case. They \nstrongly support his nomination to the Supreme Court. The law \nenforcement team writes of Chief Judge Garland:\n\n       Twenty years ago, the nation could not find a better lawyer \n     to manage the investigation and prosecution of what was then \n     the worse crime ever committed on American soil. Today, our \n     nation could not find a better judge, nor a more honorable \n     man, to join its highest court.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter highlighting Chief Judge Garland's work on the Oklahoma City \nbombing.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   April 19, 2016.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader McConnell, Minority Leader Reid, \n     Chairman Grassley, and Ranking Member Leahy: As former \n     prosecutors, law enforcement agents and victim advocates who \n     worked as a team with Merrick Garland, as well as state and \n     local authorities, to secure justice for the thousands of \n     victims of the Oklahoma City bombing, we write to offer our \n     enthusiastic support for Chief Judge Garland to serve on the \n     Supreme Court of the United States.\n       We are a diverse group: we live in different parts of the \n     country and work in a variety of fields, we have no common \n     political affiliation, and indeed some of us are occasionally \n     adversaries in court. But despite those differences we are \n     united today, as we were united two decades ago, in our \n     respect and admiration for the integrity, brilliance, \n     leadership, and judgment of Merrick Garland. Twenty years \n     ago, the nation could not find a better lawyer to manage the \n     investigation and prosecution of what was then the worst \n     crime ever committed on American soil. Today, our nation \n     could not find a better judge, nor a more honorable man, to \n     join its highest court.\n       On April 19, 1995, while first responders were still \n     searching for the injured and the dead in the ruins of the \n     Alfred J. Murrah Federal Building, Merrick Garland worked \n     with the folks on the ground to provide the best federal \n     resources, personnel and counsel to assist with the \n     investigation and prosecutions. He knew that the best thing \n     he could do was to leave Washington and travel to Oklahoma \n     City to ensure that the investigators, the prosecutors, the \n     victims and the survivors had the full support of the Justice \n     Department. He arrived to find the largest and most complex \n     crime scene anyone in American law enforcement had ever \n     encountered. He helped to ensure that the many different \n     local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies worked \n     together as a team, despite their sometimes differing ideas \n     about how best to build a case. At the same time, he made \n     sure the victims, the survivors and their families had the \n     critical resources they needed to deal with the unspeakable \n     losses they had suffered.\n       Once the two men responsible for the bombing had been \n     identified and arrested, Judge Garland was careful to ensure \n     that each was treated fairly and with dignity to ensure that \n     no one could reasonably accuse the government of a rush to \n     judgment. He meticulously oversaw every step of the \n     prosecution's initial proceedings, building an overwhelming \n     case and ensuring that no legal error would allow the bombers \n     to escape responsibility for their atrocity. And with the \n     victims' families and the nation desperate for information \n     and justice, Judge Garland ensured that they would have both.\n       After the case was on a sound footing, Judge Garland \n     returned to his critical responsibilities at the Justice \n     Department, but maintained close contact with the rest of us \n     who continued to work on the case. With his towering \n     intellect, exceptionally sound judgment, and extraordinary \n     decency, he provided the leadership and wise counsel that \n     helped us face both novel legal issues in the courtroom and \n     unprecedented challenges in supporting a community of victims \n     that numbered in the thousands.\n       On a personal level, we all benefitted from having Judge \n     Garland in our corner. For some of us, the bombing had ripped \n     through our home town and killed and wounded neighbors and \n     colleagues; for the rest of us who came to the task force \n     from across the country, the case required many months away \n     from friends and family. For all of us, working to secure \n     justice for the victims and to reassure the nation that our \n     judicial system could respond fairly but forcefully to such \n     an act of domestic terrorism, the pressure to get it right \n     was unyielding--and Judge Garland's support was critical. He \n     was not just a supervisor; he was a mentor, a counselor, and \n     a friend.\n       From the day of the Oklahoma City bombing until his \n     judicial appointment at the start of the first of the trials, \n     Merrick Garland provided our team with leadership, \n     confidence, determination, and hope. If confirmed, he will \n     bring to the Supreme Court the same humanity, talent, and \n     judgment that we have seen in him for two decades. We \n     unconditionally support his nomination and urge you to \n     support his confirmation as an Associate Justice of the \n     Supreme Court.\n           Very truly yours,\n         Donna Bucella; Vicki Zemp Behenna; Sean Connelly; David \n           Chipman; Aitan Goelman; Jamie Gorelick; Joseph \n           Hartzler; Carolyn Hightower; Arlene Johnson; Wan Kim; \n           Larry Mackey; Scott Mendeloff; James Orenstein; Patrick \n           Ryan; Beth Wilkinson.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. The American people need to know that it is this dedicated \npublic servant who is now being denied a public hearing by Senate \nRepublicans. No nominee to the Supreme Court has ever been treated the \nway Senate Republicans are treating Chief Judge Garland. Since public \nconfirmation hearings began in 1916, the Senate has never denied a \nSupreme Court nominee a hearing and a vote. I say to my friends the \nRepublicans, you have no good reason for your obstruction of Merrick \nGarland.\n  Americans by a 2-to-1 margin want Chief Judge Garland to have a \npublic hearing in the Judiciary Committee. Based on more than four \ndecades of that precedent, that hearing should take place in the \nJudiciary Committee next week. Instead, Senate Republicans continue to \nignore the American people.\n  Neil Siegel, a law professor at Duke University, said: ``It does not \nmatter constitutionally, nor as a matter of tradition, whether a \nnomination is made in an election year. Numerous\n\n[[Page S2135]]\n\nnominations have succeeded during election years. Without exaggeration, \nSenate Republicans have made up a distinction without a relevant \nconstitutional difference.'' Even school children know that Presidents \nare elected to 4-year terms and they have to carry out their \nconstitutional duties each and every year right up until noon of \nJanuary 20 of their last year. It is no different for Senators. We \ncan't just sit this year out because an election will be held in \nNovember. As Professor Siegel concludes, Senate Republicans ``are \nharming the court without a justification that passes the laugh test.''\n  Today, as we remember the victims, their families, and the entire \nOklahoma City community, let's also remember the good the Senate has \ndone when we have put aside destructive partisanship and come together \nto act for the good of the country. This body has done that time and \nagain, under both Democratic and Republican leadership, as it has \ncarried out its constitutional duty to consider nominees to the Supreme \nCourt. I hope the Senate will carry out that duty for a public servant \nnamed Merrick Garland who has served this country so well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/senate-section/article/S2135-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 INVESTING IN INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on April 12, 2016, the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on State and Foreign Operations held a hearing on violent \nextremism and the role of U.S. foreign assistance. We heard testimony \nfrom four distinguished witnesses, including my good friend and partner \nin humanitarian work, Bono, the lead singer of U2 and cofounder of ONE. \nAs I said at the hearing, there are millions of people who may never \nknow Bono by name or have the privilege of listening to his music, but \ntheir lives are better because of the profound impact his advocacy has \nhad on the world's efforts to combat poverty.\n  At the hearing, Bono testified about what he called the three \nextremes: extreme ideology, extreme poverty, and extreme climate. His \ntestimony was powerful. It complemented the opinion piece he wrote that \nwas published in the New York Times on the morning of the hearing in \nwhich he highlighted the importance of investing in international \ndevelopment in a way that empowers local populations, including \nrefugees and other displaced persons.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na copy of Bono's article entitled ``Time to Think Bigger About the \nRefugee Crisis.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the New York Times, April 12, 2016]\n\n          Bono: Time to Think Bigger About the Refugee Crisis\n\n                               (By Bono)\n\n       I've recently returned from the Middle East and East \n     Africa, where I visited a number of refugee camps--car parks \n     of humanity. I went as an activist and as a European. Because \n     Europeans have come to realize--quite painfully in the past \n     year or two--that the mass exodus from collapsed countries \n     like Syria is not just a Middle Eastern or African problem, \n     it's a European problem. It's an American one, too. It \n     affects us all.\n       My countryman Peter Sutherland, a senior United Nations \n     official for international migration, has made clear that \n     we're living through the worst crisis of forced displacement \n     since World War II. In 2010, some 10,000 people worldwide \n     fled their homes every day, on average. Which sounds like a \n     lot--until you consider that four years later, that number \n     had quadrupled. And when people are driven out of their homes \n     by violence, poverty and instability, they take themselves \n     and their despair elsewhere. And ``elsewhere'' can be \n     anywhere.\n       But with their despair some of them also have hope. It \n     seems insane or naive to speak of hope in this context, and I \n     may be both of these things. But in most of the places where \n     refugees live, hope has not left the building: hope to go \n     home someday, hope to find work and a better life. I left \n     Kenya, Jordan and Turkey feeling a little hopeful myself. For \n     as hard as it is to truly imagine what life as a refugee is \n     like, we have a chance to reimagine that reality--and \n     reinvent our relationship with the people and countries \n     consumed now by conflict, or hosting those who have fled it.\n       That needs to start, as it has for me, by parting with a \n     couple of wrong ideas about the refugee crisis. One is that \n     the Syrian refugees are concentrated in camps. They aren't. \n     These arid encampments are so huge that it's hard to fathom \n     that only a small percentage of those refugees actually live \n     in one; in many places, a majority live in the communities of \n     their host countries. In Jordan and Lebanon, for example, \n     most refugees are in urban centers rather than in camps. This \n     is a problem that knows no perimeter.\n       Another fallacy is that the crisis is temporary. I guess it \n     depends on your definition of ``temporary,'' but I didn't \n     meet many refugees, some of whom have been displaced for \n     decades, who felt that they were just passing through. Some \n     families have spent two generations--and some young people \n     their entire lives--as refugees. They have been exiled by \n     their home countries only to face a second exile in the \n     countries that have accepted their presence but not their \n     right to move or to work. You hear the term ``permanent \n     temporary solution'' thrown around by officials, but not with \n     the irony you'd think it deserves.\n       Those understandings should shape our response. The United \n     States and other developed nations have a chance to act \n     smarter, think bigger and move faster in addressing this \n     crisis and preventing the next one. Having talked with \n     refugees, and having talked to countless officials and \n     representatives of civil society along the way, I see three \n     areas where the world should act.\n       First, the refugees, and the countries where they're \n     living, need more humanitarian support. You see this most \n     vividly in a place like the Dadaab complex in Kenya, near the \n     border of Somalia, a place patched together (or not) with \n     sticks and plastic sheets. The Office of the United Nations \n     High Commissioner for Refugees is doing noble and exceedingly \n     hard work. But it can't do everything it needs to do when it \n     is chronically underfunded by the very governments that \n     expect it to handle this global problem.\n       Second, we can help host countries see refugees not just as \n     a burden, but as a benefit. The international community could \n     be doing much more, through development assistance and trade \n     deals, to encourage businesses and states hosting refugees to \n     see the upside of people's hands being occupied and not idle \n     (the World Bank and the Scriptures agree on this) The \n     refugees want to work. They were shopkeepers, teachers and \n     musicians at home, and want to be these things again, or \n     maybe become new things--if they can get education, training \n     and access to the labor market.\n       In other words, they need development. Development that \n     invests in them and empowers them--that treats them not as \n     passive recipients but as leaders and partners. The world \n     tends to give humanitarian efforts and development efforts \n     their own separate bureaucracies and unlisted phone numbers, \n     as if they're wholly separate concerns. But to be effective \n     they need to be better coordinated; we have to link the two \n     and fund them both. Refugees living in camps need food and \n     shelter right away, but they also need the long-term benefits \n     of education, training, jobs and financial security.\n       Third, the world needs to shore up the development \n     assistance it gives to those countries that have not \n     collapsed but are racked by conflict, corruption and weak \n     governance. These countries may yet spiral into anarchy. \n     Lately some Western governments have been cutting overseas \n     aid to spend money instead on asylum-seekers within their \n     borders. But it is less expensive to invest in stability than \n     to confront instability. Transparency, respect for rule of \n     law, and a free and independent media are also crucial to the \n     survival of countries on the periphery of chaos. Because \n     chaos, as we know all too well, is contagious.\n       What we don't want and can't afford is to have important \n     countries in the Sahel, the band of countries just south of \n     the Sahara, going the same way as Syria. If Nigeria, a \n     country many times larger than Syria, were to fracture as a \n     result of groups like Boko Haram, we are going to wish we had \n     been thinking bigger before the storm.\n       Actually, some people are thinking bigger. I keep hearing \n     calls from a real gathering of forces--Africans and \n     Europeans, army generals and World Bank and International \n     Monetary Fund officials--to emulate that most genius of \n     American ideas, the Marshall Plan. That plan delivered trade \n     and development in service of security--in places where \n     institutions were broken and hope had been lost. Well, hope \n     is not lost in the Middle East and North Africa, not yet, not \n     even where it's held together by string. But hope is getting \n     impatient. We should be, too.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see my distinguished colleague on the \nfloor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have the honor to represent the tip of \nAmerica's spear--Fort Bragg, NC. Fort Bragg is the largest military \ninstallation in the United States, and it is the home to the most \ndecorated combat forces of the military, the All-American Division, the \n82nd Airborne.\n  The 82nd is a subordinate command of the XVIII Airborne Corps, \nAmerica's Global Response Force. Whenever a threat occurs, units of the \nXVIII Airborne can be wheels up and on top of any target in the world \nin just 48 hours.\n  In the 15 months that I have had the privilege to represent North \nCarolina\n\n[[Page S2136]]\n\nin the Senate, I have made the readiness of the XVIII Airborne one of \nmy top priorities. In fact, you would think it would be everybody's top \npriority, but I have watched budget cutters in the Air Force slowly \nchip away at the ability of the commanders at Fort Bragg to adequately \ntrain their paratroopers at Pope Army Airfield.\n  This year, the Air Force began dismantling the one Air Force tactical \nunit at Pope--the 440th Airlift Wing--capable of providing daily and ad \nhoc support for Fort Bragg soldiers. I said at the time that the \nremoval of the 440th created unreasonable risks to the readiness of \ncritical airborne units. They must be prepared to respond to a range of \ncontingencies in very short timeframes. I have pointed out repeatedly \nthat the deactivation of the 440th comes at a time when the Nation is \nfacing growing uncertainty and increasing threats abroad that could \nrequire a military response, and it is a response that only forces at \nFort Bragg can fulfill.\n  Over the last 7 years, the 440th has provided the Army with \nunparalleled support, tailored training opportunities without the \ntyranny of distance that comes through logistical, bureaucratic, and \noperational delays by having aircraft stationed somewhere other than \nPope Army Airfield.\n  The Air Force leadership stated that after any deactivation of the \n440th, out-of-State aircraft would support all airlift requirements for \nFort Bragg units at Pope. The Air Force asked me to suspend disbelief. \nThey told me to accept that it is more cost-effective for units to fly \nfrom Little Rock, AK, or McChord Air Force Base in Washington State and \nsupport Fort Bragg in North Carolina rather than having planes \nstationed at Fort Bragg.\n  I did my best to ensure that the Air Force understood the Army's \nrequirements, and I promised them that if they removed the 440th, I \nwould be monitoring their progress and their ability to satisfy the \nArmy's requirements for as long as I am in the Senate.\n  The first warning signs that the Air Force was in trouble came in \nDecember at the annual Operation Toy Drop. Operation Toy Drop is the \nworld's largest combined airborne operation at Fort Bragg. The drop is \nactually a daytime, nontactical, airborne operation supervised by \nforeign military jumpmasters. They view it as a rare treat to \nparticipate so that they can get jump wings from a foreign country.\n  This year's operation was purposefully designed by the Air Force to \nprove to Congress--to prove to me--that they could support the training \nmission at Fort Bragg. To prove the point, the Air Force Reserve went \nso far as to reduce the 440th's role in the operation. However, when \nthe Air Force planes could not get to Pope because of weather, \nmechanical, or other delays, the 440th had to step in and make up the \ndeficit, as they have done so many times before.\n  This is the real world in action. Bad weather and mechanical problems \nhappen. The Air Force knows this exercise happens every year. They know \nit is highly visible. They knew they were under a microscope. Still \nthey couldn't meet the requirement. In fact, during Operation Toy Drop, \nthe 440th provided for about 40 percent of the chutes and 43 percent of \nthe lift for the entire operation.\n  Fort Bragg leadership has been clear to the Air Force in terms of \ntheir combat requirements, their training requirements at Fort Bragg. \nThey have told the Air Force that they have to drop 10,000 paratroopers \na month. Eight thousand drops a month is considered the bare minimum \nfor the XVIII Airborne Corps. Sadly, the Air Force is not meeting those \nrequirements. Only 6,100 paratroopers exited from Air Force planes in \nMarch. That is 1,300 fewer paratroopers dropped than in February, which \nis 77 percent of the 8,000 sustainable threshold and 61 percent of the \nArmy's overall requirement. Where I went to high school, 61 percent was \na D-minus, bordering on an F. They are failing.\n  The Air Force has missed the Army's minimum jump requirements every \nmonth this year. These numbers are illuminating and concerning because \nin the Southeast, this is the best flying weather. January, February, \nand March have the best flying weather in the Southeast. What is going \nto happen when the Southeast thunderstorms and tornado season kicks in? \nIf the Air Force can't meet Fort Bragg's need when the skies are clear, \nhow is it going to do when the storm clouds gather?\n  I hope the Air Force knows I have their back as a member of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee. But in this case, this is about \nfulfilling the Army's requirement. This is about me having the Army's \nback. This is about making sure the men and women who will be asked at \na moment's notice to assemble on the Green Ramp at the Pope Army \nAirfield and go wherever they must go to defend freedom and save lives \nare at their highest state of readiness. But the performance to this \npoint suggests that the Air Force is failing its customer service to \nthe Army. No business in America would be able to dictate to the \ncustomer how and when they are going to get their product, but that is \nexactly what is happening with the Air Force's relationship with the \nArmy--and they are failing.\n  I will ask Senator McCain to inquire as to whether the Air Force \nexpects to meet the needs of the Global Response Force. They haven't in \nthis first quarter, and this is the first quarter that they were trying \nto transition to a Pope Army Airfield without the 440th. If they can't \nanswer the question, then it is time for us to consider other options.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, when Republicans took the majority in the \nSenate last January, we were determined to get the Senate working \nagain.\n  By 2014, the Democratic-controlled Senate had largely ground to a \nhalt. Serious legislation had been replaced by political messaging, and \nthe Democratic leadership refused to allow votes on amendments. In \nshort, despite Democratic control of the Senate, Democrats and \nRepublicans alike were shut out of the legislative process. Republicans \nwere determined to change that.\n  Since we took control of the Senate in 2015, we have focused on \ntaking up substantial legislation that addresses the challenges facing \nthe country. We have made sure individual appropriations bills get \nwritten in committees with input from Senators of both parties, and we \nhave opened the Senate floor to debate and amendment.\n  Why is that important? Because an open legislative process in the \nSenate means all Americans get represented. When legislation is written \nin the open using the committee process and Senators have a chance to \nhighlight their constituents' concerns, the final bill is a lot more \nlikely to reflect the American people's priorities.\n  One of our most basic responsibilities as Members of Congress is to \npass appropriations bills. Appropriations bills give Senators and \nCongressmen a chance to take a look at where taxpayer dollars are being \nspent and how we can spend this money more efficiently and effectively. \nUnfortunately, too often Congress ends up skipping the appropriations \nprocess and rolling a number of the appropriations bills into one giant \nspending bill. That means we lose the opportunity to closely examine \nour spending priorities and make sure we are spending money wisely.\n  Since we took control of the Senate, Republicans have been determined \nto make sure Congress takes the appropriations process seriously. We \nhave made sure individual appropriations bills are developed in \ncommittee, where Senators of both parties have the opportunity to help \ndevelop the bill and make sure their constituents' concerns are heard.\n  This week Congress is taking up the Energy and Water appropriations \nbill. This legislation funds a number of priorities: rural water \nprojects, critical infrastructure projects, nuclear deterrence efforts, \nenergy research, flood control, and environmental cleanup, to name a \nfew. I am particularly pleased\n\n[[Page S2137]]\n\nthat this bill funds important projects--like the Lewis & Clark \nRegional Water System--that will help provide communities with access \nto steady, reliable water sources.\n  I am also pleased that this bill invests in next-generation, high-\nenergy physics research, including the Deep Underground Neutrino \nExperiment, which could revolutionize our understanding of some of the \nmost fundamental elements of our universe. This funding demonstrates \ncontinued U.S. commitment to a project that will help train the next \ngeneration of scientists and engineers, retain and attract the best \nscientific minds to the United States, and garner additional investment \nfrom global partners. I am proud that South Dakota's Sanford \nUnderground Research Facility will continue to play a leading role in \nthis major international scientific effort.\n  The Energy and Water appropriations bill passed the Senate \nAppropriations Committee with the unanimous--unanimous--support of \nDemocrats and Republicans with a 30-to-0 vote. I am hoping it will \nreceive the same strong bipartisan support on the Senate floor. This \nbill will boost our Nation's energy security, making our economy more \ncompetitive, and promote energy innovation. It will help us produce \nmore and pay less for energy.\n  This legislation is an important first step in our commitment to \nrestore order to the appropriations process, and I look forward to \nconsideration of additional appropriations bills on the Senate floor in \nthe coming weeks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/senate-section/article/S2137-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nRECOGNIZING THE RAPID CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PENNINGTON COUNTY \n                            SHERIFF'S OFFICE\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes to talk about \nthe two ride-alongs I was privileged to take with Rapid City, SD, law \nenforcement officers at the end of March.\n  We live in a climate where police officers are often made to sound \nlike criminals and criminals are often portrayed as victims. The result \nis, we forget about the real victims--the people who have suffered \ncrimes or are forced to live in crime-ridden neighborhoods--and we \nforget about the work police officers do in making our communities \nplaces we can live.\n  Three weeks ago, I got to meet with law enforcement officers from the \nRapid City Police Department and the Pennington County Sheriff's \nOffice. After our meeting, I got to take a ride through Rapid Valley \nwith Sheriff's Deputy Brandon Akley and a ride through Rapid City with \nRapid City Police Officer Jim Hansen.\n  Not very long ago, some neighborhoods in Rapid City had their share \nof challenges. Law enforcement officers frequently responded to drug \nand alcohol calls, abuse calls, domestic violence, break-ins, and other \nviolent crimes. Imagine what it is like to live in a neighborhood like \nthat. Coming home after dark is dangerous. It may not be safe for your \nchildren to play in the yard. It is certainly not safe to send them to \nthe playground. Your children constantly see things no child should see \nand hear things no child should have to hear. Your property isn't \nsecure. Your car and your home are at risk all the time. There are no \neconomic opportunities in your area because businesses don't want to \nlocate in areas where it is not safe to do business. That is what life \nis like in some of these neighborhoods. In one instance in Rapid City, \nlaw enforcement officers responded to over 600 calls to one building \nover a period of a single year.\n  By partnering with residents in impacted neighborhoods, Rapid City \nlaw enforcement stepped in and conducted an aggressive, years-long \ncampaign to rid this area of crime. Today, residents can let their \nchildren play outside without fear, and new economic opportunities are \nopening for residents as businesses move in. It is no exaggeration to \nsay that what these police officers did changed the lives of countless \nRapid City residents.\n  Every day, in every community in the United States, the men and women \nwho make up our Nation's police forces and sheriff's departments put \ntheir lives on the line for the rest of us. They are first on the scene \nwhen someone is in danger, the first to come running when you call for \nhelp, and when evil threatens they step in.\n  I am grateful to the men and women of the Rapid City Police \nDepartment, the Pennington County Sheriff's Office, and to all the law \nenforcement officers keeping the peace in South Dakota and around the \nNation. Because of their service, we can live in safety.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/senate-section/article/S2137-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2137-S2139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBING ANNIVERSARY AND NOMINATION OF MERRICK GARLAND\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I come to the Senate floor to once \nagain urge my Republican colleagues to do what they are elected to do: \nlisten to their constituents and give Judge Garland the fair \nconsideration he deserves.\n  As some of my colleagues have already noted, today marks 21 years \nsince the Oklahoma City bombing, an attack that shocked the world and \ntook 168 innocent lives. I had the honor of meeting with an individual \nlast week who was not only involved in the immediate aftermath of this \nterrible attack but who went above and beyond to make sure justice was \nserved on behalf of those who lost their lives.\n  Judge Merrick Garland, the President's nominee for the Supreme Court, \nwas at the scene of the bombing within 2 days. With debris from the \nAlfred P. Murrah Federal Building still smoldering in the streets, \nJudge Garland was helping first responders and working with local law \nenforcement.\n  As a top official in the Justice Department, he led a massive \ninvestigation of the bombing and supervised the prosecution of Timothy \nMcVeigh. He did all of that, even if it meant more work and more time \naway from his family, with incredible delicacy and thoroughness. He \ncalled his work for the Justice Department following the Oklahoma City \nbombing the most important thing he has ever done in his life.\n  As we remember those who were lost on that day in 1995, and in light \nof last week being National Crime Victims' Rights Week, we remember how \nJudge Garland honored those victims with his dedicated service. Judge \nGarland not only did his job with a great deal of heart, working with \nfamilies who had lost loved ones, but with the vigor to demand that \njustice be served. His fairness and diligence earned him praise from \nMembers of both parties, from victims' families and law enforcement \nofficers, and even from the lead lawyer defending McVeigh.\n  A person like that, driven by the desire to help people and serve the \npublic, is someone who deserves fair consideration by all of us in the \nU.S. Senate. Unfortunately, that is not what is happening right now. We \nare 66 days into the Supreme Court vacancy, and so far Republican \nleaders are still refusing to do their jobs. They will not say they are \nopposed to Judge Garland. They are refusing to even live up to their \nconstitutional responsibility and consider him. That kind of pure \nobstruction and partisanship is absolutely wrong. People across the \ncountry are not going to stand for that.\n  Last week I met with Judge Garland and talked through his background, \nhis experiences, his philosophy, his judicial philosophy. What I found \nout--and it would be difficult for any right-minded person not to come \nto this conclusion after meeting with him--is that Judge Garland is \nhighly passionate, he is highly respected, and highly qualified to \nserve on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I am very glad some Republicans have started meeting with him. That \nis a great first step, but it cannot be the last step. Families across \nthis country deserve to hear from Judge Garland in a Judiciary \nCommittee hearing, under oath, and in public, and then he should get a \nvote where every Senator will have the opportunity to do their job and \nweigh in.\n  If any Member doesn't think Judge Garland should serve on the highest \nCourt in the land, they should feel free to vote against him, but give \nhim a\n\n[[Page S2138]]\n\nhearing, give him a vote, and stop this partisanship and obstruction. \nEvaluating and confirming Supreme Court Justices is one of the most \nimportant roles we have in the United States, and it is this issue that \nactually pushed me to run for the Senate in the first place.\n  In 1991 I was a State Senator, a former school board member, and a \nmom. Similar to so many people across the country back then, I watched \nthe Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings in frustration over how the \nnominee wasn't pushed on the issues that I and so many others thought \nwere so important to the future of our country. I saw how a woman who \ncame to talk about her experiences, Anita Hill, was treated by this \nSenate. I decided then and there to run for the U.S. Senate, to give \nWashington State families like mine a voice in this process.\n  I have had the opportunity to use that voice in the Senate and to \nmake sure Washington State families had a seat at the table in Supreme \nCourt nominations and confirmations over the years. I voted to support \nsome of the candidates, including the Chief Justice nominated by a \nRepublican President. I voted to oppose others, but I always thought it \nwas important that a nominee got the consideration he or she deserved, \nand I always worked to make sure the people I represented got their \nquestions answered as best as I could and that they could have a view \ninto the process that should be above partisanship and politics.\n  If Republicans continue to play election-year politics and continue \nto refuse to do their jobs, my families in Washington State will not \nhave a voice. Families across America will not have a voice. The tea \nparty gridlock and dysfunction that has dominated too much of our work \nin Congress will have claimed another victory. That is unacceptable.\n  Once again, I am on the floor to call on my Republican colleagues to \ndo your job; meet with Judge Garland, hold a hearing, and give him a \nvote. We owe that to our constituents. It is our constitutional \nresponsibility, and we should get it done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, today, the 19th, marks the anniversary \nof one of the worst terrorist attacks ever to hit the United States. On \nApril 19, 1995, at 9:02 a.m., a rented truck filled with fertilizer and \ndiesel fuel exploded in front of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building \nin Oklahoma City. The impact of the blast was devastating. One-third of \nthe Federal Building was destroyed, and 168 men, women, and children \nlost their lives, with several hundred seriously wounded. At that time, \nit was the deadliest terror attack ever to take place on American soil.\n  The Oklahoma City bombing shocked America. In the days after April \n19, Americans mourned the lives which were lost and called for those \nwho committed this evil act to be brought swiftly to justice.\n  It was in this context that the U.S. Department of Justice sent one \nman to head this investigation and prosecution. His name is Merrick \nGarland. Merrick Garland was the Principal Associate Deputy Attorney \nGeneral. He had volunteered to lead this investigation, telling his \nboss, Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick, he had to do it.\n  Garland would stay in Oklahoma City for a long period of time. By all \naccounts, he worked around the clock, coordinating the efforts by law \nenforcement to gather evidence, building the case against Timothy \nMcVeigh and Terry Nichols. Every step along the way, Merrick Garland \nwas meticulous. He made sure no corners were cut in the investigation \nor the prosecution. There was so much at stake.\n  One of the roles Merrick Garland took most seriously was to be in \ntouch with the survivors and the victims' families, keeping them \ninformed, keeping them in the loop. He carried with him at all times a \nlist of the names of the victims so he would never forget the historic \nimportance of his assignment.\n  Merrick Garland would later call his work in Oklahoma City ``the most \nimportant thing I have ever done in my life.'' His work helped bring \nthe perpetrators of this terrorist attack to justice and earned him the \nrespect and gratitude of those he worked with and served. That is the \ndefinition of public service.\n  The record is clear that Merrick Garland has always done his job \ndiligently and conscientiously. Throughout his decades in public \nservice at the Justice Department and later on the Federal bench, Judge \nGarland has earned a reputation as a workhorse who leaves no task \nunfinished.\n  It is instructive to hear what his former law clerks say about him. \nSeveral dozen of them recently sent a letter to the Senate. Here is \nwhat they said about Judge Garland: ``Unrelenting work ethic.'' They \nsaid Judge Garland ``treated every matter before him with the same care \nand attention to detail, whether it affected the national interest or a \nsingle ordinary life.''\n  Judge Garland's devotion to his work is admired by many. This is a \nman who has received extraordinary praise because he did his job and \ndid it well. It should come as no surprise, when President Barack Obama \nannounced that Merrick Garland was his choice to be the nominee to fill \nthe vacancy on the Supreme Court, he dwelled on this experience in \nOklahoma City.\n  Unfortunately, Merrick Garland faces a historic blockade in the \nSenate. The Senate has never in its history denied a hearing to a \nPresidential nominee to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court. It has \nnever ever happened before.\n  The death of Antonin Scalia, about 2 months ago, led to an almost \nimmediate announcement by the Republican Senate leader, Senator \nMcConnell, that there would be no consideration, no hearing, and no \nvote for any nominee sent by President Barack Obama to this U.S. \nSenate. Senator McConnell went further to say that he would not even \nmeet with the nominee.\n  It has been more than a month since Judge Garland was nominated to \nthe Supreme Court. It has been over 2 months now since Supreme Court \nJustice Antonin Scalia has passed. Why has the Republican majority \nleader decided to ignore the precedent of history? Why is he turning \nhis back on our Constitution? That Constitution says explicitly, \narticle II, section 2: The President of the United States shall appoint \na nominee to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court.\n  Our Founding Fathers understood that you can play politics with \nvacancies, and they didn't want that to happen. So the President met \nhis constitutional obligation but, sadly, this U.S. Senate has refused \nto meet its constitutional responsibility to advise and consent on that \nnominee. It is not automatic. There is no guarantee that any nominee \nsent by the President would be approved by the Senate, but it is our \nresponsibility to ask the questions of that nominee.\n  People across the United States have a right to hear this nominee, \nMerrick Garland, under oath answer important questions about whether he \nis prepared to serve on the Supreme Court and, if he serves, whether he \nwould bring integrity to that appointment.\n  We have extended that courtesy to every Presidential nominee to fill \na vacancy on the Supreme Court until this moment. The argument that is \nmade on the other side of the aisle is that we have to go through an \nelection--we have an election coming up--and let the American people \ndecide, not the Senate. Let the American people decide, whether it will \nbe a Democratic President or a Republican President.\n  What my friends on the other side of the aisle ignore is that when \nPresident Barack Obama was reelected, he was not elected to a 3-year \nterm, he was elected to a 4-year term. He is the President of the \nUnited States this year. He has the power of that office this year not \nbecause I willed it--although I certainly did--but because by a \nplurality of 5 million votes the American people made that decision. \nFive million votes were cast for Barack Obama over Mitt Romney. The \ndecision of the American people was that this President shall govern \nnot for 3 years, not for 3 years and 2 months, but for 4 years.\n\n[[Page S2139]]\n\n  A lot of people say: As a Democrat in the Senate, it is easy for you \nto say that Republicans should treat this Democratic President a little \nbetter. What if the shoe were on the other foot?\n  Well, we have a chance to take a look back and see exactly what \nhappened when the roles were reversed. In 1988, during the last year of \nRepublican President Ronald Reagan's term, we had a vacancy on the \nSupreme Court. He sent his nominee to the Senate, which was then \ncontrolled by the Democrats. Did we have an announcement from the \nSenate Democratic leadership that we will not consider any nominee sent \nby a Republican President in the last year of his term? Did we have an \nannouncement by the Democratic leaders in the Senate that we won't even \nmeet with the nominee? Exactly the opposite occurred. Anthony Kenney \nwas given the opportunity to have a hearing, where he answered \nquestions under oath, and had a vote which confirmed him on the Supreme \nCourt. A Republican President, during the last year of his Presidency, \nfilled a vacancy on the Supreme Court with the cooperation of a \nDemocratic majority in the Senate.\n  The tables are turned now. We have a Democratic President with a \nRepublican-controlled Senate, and they are ignoring the history and \nprecedent of the Senate and they plan on ignoring this nominee. There \nis no basis in the Constitution for the position taken by the Senate \nRepublicans. This is an unprecedented obstruction of a nomination to \nfill a key Supreme Court vacancy.\n  Yesterday I was across the street. It was the second time I have been \nhonored to be included in a very small audience of about 250 people to \nlisten to the oral arguments in a case before the Supreme Court on a \ncritical decision that will affect the lives of millions of people in \nthe United States. I looked up to the chairs on the Supreme Court, and \nobviously one was vacant. There are only eight Justices. If this Court \non this case--or others--cannot resolve it with a majority and has a \nvote of 4 to 4 on a case, it invites confusion and chaos in one of the \nmost critical branches of our government. It is confusion and chaos \nthat can be avoided if the Senate Republicans simply do their \nconstitutional duty: advise and consent.\n  Give Merrick Garland a hearing under oath so the American people can \ndraw their own conclusions about whether this man is the right person \nfor the Supreme Court, and then let's have a vote on the floor. In the \npast, even when the Senate Judiciary Committee rejected a Presidential \nnominee for the Supreme Court, the committee sent that nomination to \nthe floor anyway for a vote so that the whole Senate could speak to the \nworthiness of that nominee. Merrick Garland deserves nothing less.\n  The Senate Republicans refusal to do their job under the Constitution \nhas real-world consequences. Recently the solicitor general of \nIllinois, Carolyn Shapiro, came to the Capitol to talk to the Senators \nabout how the vacancy on the Supreme Court is actually hurting States \nby leaving important legal questions unresolved.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that her speech be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Statement on the Importance of a Nine-Member Supreme Court for State \n                          and Local Government\n\n[Before the Senate Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee, April 6, \n2016, Carolyn E. Shapiro, Solicitor General of Illinois, Office of the \n                       Illinois Attorney General]\n\n       Good morning. Thank you very much for the opportunity to \n     talk with you about the importance of a fully functional \n     Supreme Court to state and local governments.\n       My name is Carolyn Shapiro, and I am the Illinois Solicitor \n     General. I am also a tenured faculty member at IIT Chicago-\n     Kent College of Law where I founded the Institute on the \n     Supreme Court of the United States and where my research and \n     scholarship focuses largely on the Supreme Court as an \n     institution.\n       State and local governments regularly rely on the Supreme \n     Court to provide clarity and certainty in numerous areas of \n     law, many of which do not involve the headline-grabbing, hot-\n     button issues we hear about on the news.\n       But in some of these areas, the risk of an equally divided \n     court is real, and a Supreme Court unable to provide clarity \n     and certainty would have very real and harmful effects.\n       I could talk about a variety of different areas of law, but \n     my focus here will be on the Fourth Amendment. The Fourth \n     Amendment of course regulates what law enforcement can and \n     cannot do in investigating crime and it protects the privacy \n     interests of the citizenry. It is crucial for law enforcement \n     to know what the rules are and it is crucial for the \n     citizenry to have confidence that law enforcement is \n     following the rules and doing so uniformly.\n       These things cannot happen without the Supreme Court being \n     able to resolve some of the difficult and contested issues in \n     this area of law.\n       In the past three years, the Supreme Court has decided at \n     least eight Fourth Amendment cases by close votes, and in \n     several of those cases, Justice Scalia was in a five-member \n     majority. In other words, without nine justices, the court \n     might well have been unable to resolve the issues presented \n     in those cases, leading to ongoing uncertainty. And some of \n     those cases, as often happens in the Fourth Amendment area, \n     have created new areas of uncertainty that must be resolved--\n     but that may require a nine-member court to do so.\n       I will briefly mention two such areas. In 2013, the Supreme \n     Court decided Florida v. Jardines, in which Justice Scalia \n     wrote the opinion on behalf of five justice majority. \n     Jardines held that when police bring a drug dog onto the \n     front porch of a single family home, that constitutes a \n     search for purposes of the Fourth Amendment.\n       This holding has led to new questions. Earlier this year, \n     the Illinois Supreme Court held that Jardines extends to a \n     drug sniff outside an apartment door in the common area of a \n     building. But in similar cases around the country, other \n     courts have reached different conclusions. Not only can this \n     lead to inconsistent law from state to state, but even within \n     a jurisdiction. A search held constitutional in state court \n     might be held unconstitutional in federal court in the same \n     state. This kind of uncertainty is untenable.\n       A second issue involves the implications of the 2013 case \n     of Missouri v. McNeely in which Justice Scalia joined a five-\n     member majority to hold that the natural dissipation of \n     alcohol in the blood does not in and of itself create exigent \n     circumstances allowing the police to obtain a blood test \n     without a warrant. This term the court is poised to hear a \n     case, Birchfield v. North Dakota, about the implications of \n     some of McNeely's reasoning for state statutes that \n     criminalize the refusal to submit to a blood or breath test \n     when pulled over for a DWI. Illinois does not have such a \n     statute, but we do have a statute making refusal to submit to \n     such a test grounds for the suspension of a license. And a \n     case challenging that statute is apparently being held by the \n     Supreme Court pending the result in Birchfield. So if the \n     court is unable to resolve Birchfield because it is equally \n     divided, or is unable to resolve our case, should the Court \n     later decide to hear it, those statutes will remain under a \n     constitutional cloud and neither law enforcement nor state \n     legislatures will know the scope of their authority in this \n     area.\n       There are of course other areas of law I could discuss, but \n     the point I want to leave you with is that state and local \n     governments, and the citizenry, depend on a functional court \n     to provide clarity and certainty in areas of law that affect \n     government officials and citizens on a daily basis.\n       Thank you.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. As an example, Solicitor General Shapiro pointed out how \nright at this moment numerous States and Federal circuits are governed \nby different standards on important Fourth Amendment search and seizure \nissues. These cases are working their way through the courts, but only \nthe Supreme Court can finally resolve the issues. But the Court may be \nunable to do that. A 4-to-4 Court with a tie will not resolve an issue. \nUnless the Senate Republicans do their job, the Supreme Court will be \nstuck with eight members for more than a year.\n  I have a trivia question. When was the last time the Senate left a \nvacancy on the Supreme Court for a year or more? During the Civil War. \nIt took a war between the States for us to leave a vacancy that long in \nthe Court--a vacancy which the Senate Republicans are continuing by \nthis obstruction.\n  As we reflect on the anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing, I hope \nmy friends on the other side of the aisle will take a step back from \npolitics. I hope they will acknowledge that Merrick Garland stepped up \nfor this Nation, did the right thing, and proved he could do his job. \nSenate Republicans have no less responsibility. It is time for the \nSenate Republican majority to do its job.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, over this last weekend and through \nyesterday, large parts of central and southeast Texas experienced \ntorrential\n\n[[Page S2140]]\n\ndownpours. The Houston region in particular experienced so much rain, \nit led to widespread flooding. I know many people have seen that on TV, \nin news reports, or online.\n  Many will recall that last year over Memorial Day weekend, Harris \nCounty, which is where Houston is located, suffered from similar \nflooding. This year's rain seems to be even more widespread, with some \nareas receiving as much as 20 inches of rain in a relatively short \nperiod of time. Whole subdivisions were submerged, interstate highways \nwere impassable, and power was knocked out, which affected more than \n100,000 people at one point. Tragically, several people have died as a \nresult of these floods.\n  Amidst this tragedy, Texans have been quick to help one another. \nCrews had performed more than 1,000 rescues as of yesterday afternoon, \nand even one TV reporter on location covering the story rushed to \nrescue an elderly man from a flooded underpass. The rescue is on \nYouTube. I recommend anybody who is interested to watch it. It is \nreally quite a rescue.\n  This morning I spoke to County Judge Ed Emmett of Harris County, and \nI will continue to stay in close contact with him, as well as the chief \nof the Texas Department of Emergency Management, in the coming days.\n  The one thing I do know is that Texans are resilient. In particular, \nthe people in the Houston region, where I happen to have been born, are \nused to storms that cause that kind of flooding. But the rebuilding \neffort will be long and one that will require support from officials at \nall levels.\n  Going forward, I will do everything I can to help mobilize Federal \nresources for the Houston area should the Governor determine a Federal \ndisaster declaration is necessary. In the meantime, our thoughts and \nprayers are with the people of Houston and other affected areas in \nTexas, and we hope and pray for their safety and their fast recovery.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/senate-section/article/S2140-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2140-S2141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               JUSTICE AGAINST SPONSORS OF TERRORISM ACT\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I will spend a few minutes talking about \na piece of legislation that is bipartisan and deserves this Chamber's \nconsideration.\n  Last year, around the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, I reintroduced \nthe Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA. This bill \nmakes minor adjustments to our laws to help Americans who are attacked \non U.S. soil get justice from those who sponsored and facilitated that \nterrorist attack on U.S. soil.\n  When the Judiciary Committee considered this bill earlier this year, \nit was reported out without objection. I think the reasons for that are \npretty clear. We should use every means available to prevent the \nfunding of terrorism, and the victims of terrorism in our country \nshould be able to seek justice from people who do fund that terrorist \nattack. We have to maintain our diligence to hold those who sponsor \nterrorism accountable, particularly on our own soil, and we must \nleverage all of our resources--or as many as possible--to shut off the \nfunding sources for terrorists. Using civil liability to do so has been \nFederal policy for decades, and JASTA would strengthen that.\n  It is my hope that this legislation will serve as a defective \ndeterrent and will make foreign governments think twice before sending \nmoney to terrorist groups who target our homeland. Our country \nconfronts new and expanding terror networks that are focused on \ntargeting our citizens, and we need to do everything we can to stop it, \nincluding passing this legislation.\n  JASTA is also important because it would help the victims of the 9/11 \nattacks achieve closure from that horrific tragedy.\n  I mentioned that this is a bipartisan bill, and I am glad to \nintroduce it with my colleague Chuck Schumer of New York. But \nunfortunately the President doesn't seem to share these bipartisan \nconcerns about helping the victims of terrorism or deterring others \nfrom funding and facilitating it in the future. Unfortunately, the \nadministration has worked to undercut progress of this legislation at \nevery turn.\n  Yesterday the White House insisted that the President does not oppose \nJASTA on behalf of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia even though the \nadministration has made that argument in private. In light of his \nupcoming trip there this week, it appears that the Obama administration \nis pulling out all the stops to keep this bill from moving forward \nbefore the President's visit to Riydah. I wish the President and his \naides would spend as much time and energy working with us in a \nbipartisan manner as they have working against us trying to prevent \nvictims of terrorism from receiving the justice they deserve.\n  I was glad to see the President abandon an argument that I always \nfound strange, especially coming from him. He didn't seem to care that \nmuch about our relationship with Saudi Arabia when he ran through his \nmisguided nuclear deal with Iran, running roughshod over serious \nconcerns raised by the Kingdom. He didn't seem to care much about our \nrelationship with Saudi Arabia when he contended that they should learn \nto ``share the neighborhood with its mortal enemy Iran.'' In a very \nreal way, the President's opposition to this bill looked like it was \nasking the victims of 9/11 and their families to pay some of the \npolitical price for the President's mishandling of our relationship \nwith Saudi Arabia.\n  Well, yesterday the White House claimed it opposed the bill because \nit undermined the principle of sovereign immunity. In the past, the \nPresident said U.S. citizens could sue foreign governments and the \nUnited States would get sued abroad. Now, sovereign immunity is an \nimportant principle to be sure, but the fact is, the White House is \nmisrepresenting the law. We have had statutory exemptions to this \nimmunity for years for business conduct, torts, and many things, \nincluding terrorism. We already had these exceptions in the law, and \nthat has been the law for decades. The only real change is allowing \nvictims of terrorist attacks on the homeland to sue even if the \ndefendant is not designated by the State Department as a state sponsor \nof terrorism. That is right. All this would do would be to allow \nvictims of terrorist attacks on our homeland to sue even if the sponsor \nof the terrorist activity was not a State Department designated state \nsponsor of terrorism. This is a narrow piece of legislation, and it \nwould not upend traditional principles of sovereignty.\n  Yesterday a White House spokesman claimed that JASTA would lead to \nliability for U.S. humanitarian aid work. That is just false. I am \nconfident that Senator Schumer and I can make that abundantly clear to \nanybody who shares that misconception.\n  The President's attempt so far to derail this legislation that would \nhelp the victims of 9/11 pursue justice under the law is completely \nunacceptable. Unfortunately, this shouldn't be a surprise. The \nPresident has steadfastly refused to declassify and release 28 pages of \nthe ``9/11 Commission Report'' that pertain to allegations of Saudi \nArabia's support for the 9/11 terrorists. According to some news \nreports, President Obama has vowed several times to release this \ninformation, but he hasn't followed through on that promise yet. His \nactions to shield the Saudi Government instead of advocating on behalf \nof his own citizens rings much louder than his words. That doesn't \nsound to me like the most transparent administration in American \nhistory, which is what the President promised the Nation at his \ninauguration.\n\n  The good news is that there is bipartisan support in this Chamber for \nthose who will stand up for these victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks \nand hold the people responsible accountable. I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with our colleagues to get this critical legislation \npassed.\n  The President has his prerogatives under the Constitution. If he \nwants to veto legislation passed by the Congress on a strong bipartisan \nvote, he can do that, but 67 Senators and two-thirds of the House can \noverride a Presidential veto. That is in the Constitution too. So the \nPresident needs to step up, instead of trying to kill this legislation \nby private conversations in the Senate. The Senate needs to do its \nwork: Pass this bipartisan legislation, help the victims of the 9/11 \nterrorist attacks, and hold those who fund and facilitate terrorist \nattacks responsible. If the President wants to get in the way, he can \nveto the legislation, and we can override that veto. That is the way \nthe Constitution works.\n\n[[Page S2141]]\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/senate-section/article/S2141-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2141-S2142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CHILD NICOTINE ADDICTION\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I rise today to call attention to a \ndangerous complacency that threatens the health and the lives of our \nchildren, and I rise today to urge our administration to take long \noverdue action to protect our children.\n  Two years ago this month, the Food and Drug Administration, or the \nFDA, released a proposed tobacco deeming rule, which is a blueprint for \na regulatory framework for e-cigarettes and other tobacco products. \nAdministration officials believed and conveyed that the final rule \nwould be out by the end of the summer 2015. Well, the summer of 2015 is \nnow history, and soon it will be the summer of 2016, and we wait. We \nhave been waiting a very long time.\n  In total, it has been 7 years since the Family Smoking Prevention and \nTobacco Control Act was passed by the Senate and the House and signed \nby President Obama. This legislation gave the Food and Drug \nAdministration the authority to regulate tobacco products.\n  This legislation was sponsored by Senator Ted Kennedy. It was passed \nin the final months of his life. It was a tribute to his long advocacy \nfor the regulatory control of tobacco--a dangerous, destructive drug \nwidespread throughout America. The passage was part of his legacy. But \nnow we are failing that legacy, and we are failing millions of our \nchildren.\n  When the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act was passed \ninto law, it was heralded as a major victory, giving the FDA real power \nto crack down on the marketing of tobacco products to our children. \nAfter a year, there is no action--2 years, no action. That took us to \n2011--3 years, no action; 4 years, no action; 5 years, no action; 6 \nyears, no action; 7 years, no action. Over the course of those 7 years, \na lot more Americans have become addicted to nicotine products.\n  In 7 years, the industry has had time to develop new innovative \nproducts to entrap our youth, and they have utilized that time well. \nHow much longer will this inaction continue while our children are \naddicted to products newly invented and aimed directly at them? Each \npassing month, thousands of children become addicted to these new \nproducts. Each passing month, the nicotine addiction industry becomes \nmore deeply entrenched and determined to prevent the regulation that we \nauthorized back in 2009. It has been said that while Nero fiddled, Rome \nburned. In this situation, while the administration has failed to act, \nmillions of children have become addicted to nicotine, with profound \nconsequences for their health.\n  Once this rule is final, the FDA will be able to regulate new tobacco \nproducts in important ways, including imposing minimum age standards, \nlimits on advertising, health warnings on the products, child-proof \npackaging, and requiring the registration of tobacco product \nmanufacturers by the FDA and FDA approval of some novel products.\n  It is time to get this done because lives are at stake. We all are \nfamiliar with the cycle: Tobacco use leads to tobacco addiction. \nTobacco addiction leads to disease. Disease leads to suffering and \noften to death. In fact, tobacco use is the leading cause of \npreventable death in the United States--the leading cause. It imposes a \nterrible toll on health and lives and dollars. It affects families and \nbusinesses and government.\n  So the best way to improve the health of Americans 10, 20, 30 years \ninto the future or 40 years down the line is to stop the process by \nwhich this industry is targeting our youth. Here is what they know. \nThey know that after the age of 21, very few people become addicted to \nnicotine. It is a product that people try in their youth, and with \nrepeated use they become addicted to it and then continue, normally for \nyears and years. That makes for a very good customer of the tobacco \nindustry, a very good customer of the nicotine industry, and very bad \nconsequences for the health of our children, who become our young \nadults, who become our middle-aged adults--very bad costs for health at \neach stage.\n  According to a Surgeon General's report released in March 2012, \ntobacco use among youth is a ``pediatric epidemic.'' But the thing is \nthat our children just aren't starting to smoke because of \nhappenstance. No, they are aggressively targeted by the tobacco \nindustry. Big Tobacco is working day and night to design products to \nappeal to kids, to get them hooked on this deadly habit so that they \nwill be reliable consumers or reliable customers.\n  In fact, the industry calls them ``replacement smokers.'' The \nproducts we supplied before have resulted in a whole lot of our \ncustomers dying. So we need replacement smokers; we need replacement \nconsumers.\n  This clearly is a product with great harm associated with it. There \nare cigars, cigarillos, tobacco candy, snus, and e-cigarettes, and the \nlist goes on and on. Products cost often as little as 99 cents and are \nsold in colorful or cool packaging, and nowhere is that more true than \nin the burgeoning e-cigarette industry.\n  This chart shows very readily the strategy of using candy flavors and \nfruit flavors targeted at kids. They have everything from cherry and \nwatermelon, and the list continues with all kinds of--check this out--\ngummy bear flavors. When you advertise e-cigarette flavors like gummy \nbears, you are not targeting people over 21. You are targeting our \nchildren. You are targeting them with bubble gum flavor and wild cherry \nflavor and candy apple flavor. These flavors are not for adults. They \nmask the taste of the product and make it more tempting, more exciting \nfor our young people.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to use a prop.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I thank the Chair.\n  This is an actual container, like these containers that are shown on \nthe poster. This is called JJuice. They call it juice. They put juice \nin the title, as if to imply it is healthy. This is liquid nicotine \ntargeted at our children with all of these kinds of flavors.\n  This particular container was a response to the advocacy of myself \nand others to say that this targeting of our children is not OK. So the \nindustry decided to create a ``Senator's Choice'' flavor, and they call \nthis flavor ``the greatest blend to date'' using ``the purist, highest \nquality liquid essence of guava, combin[ing] it with all-natural, \nAmerican-made raw ingredients.'' It is almost like a review of a fine \nwine, this ``Senator's Choice.'' Again, they created this specifically \nto protest the fact that Senators were standing up and saying that this \ntargeting of children is not OK. It is immoral, and it is wrong. We \nhave a law in place to end it, but the administration must act or that \nlaw has no impact.\n  What is actually in this? Well, the ingredients list does not have \nessence of guava on the ingredient list. It has glycerin and propylene \nglycol, nicotine, and artificial flavorings, which somehow doesn't \nsound nearly as nice as the description on their Web site.\n  Let's see the impact of this targeting of our youth because, \nunfortunately, Big Tobacco's--the nicotine addiction industry--\nstrategies work. That is why they are continuing to employ them. High \nschool e-cigarette use tripled in just 1 year, from 2013 at 4.5 percent \nto 2014 at 13.4 percent. When we have the numbers for 2015, I am sure \nwe will find that it is substantially higher because of this aggressive \nmarketing campaign aimed at our junior high and high school students.\n  Nearly one in seven high school students have used an e-cigarette in \nthe last 30 days. That represents 2 million of our children--2 million \nof our teenagers nationwide.\n  An updated CDC study released recently confirmed that youth tobacco \nuse is continuing to grow. Our children are not using e-cigarettes to \nquit smoking; they are using e-cigarettes to start smoking. So when the \nindustry claims that all of these e-cigarettes are improving the health \nof those who currently use cigarettes, it is another tobacco industry \nbig lie. Big Tobacco brings us another big lie. Children are using \nthese products to start smoking, not to stop smoking. Every day that we \ndon't act, more of our children are at risk for a lifetime of tobacco \nand nicotine addiction.\n  The choice is simple. Let's end this irresponsible inaction. Let's \nstop enriching the multibillion-dollar tobacco\n\n[[Page S2142]]\n\nindustry by continuing to delay the regulations authorized back in \n2009. Let's do the right thing for America's children. Let's assist our \nchildren in living longer, healthier, happier lives by ending the \ntargeting by Big Tobacco.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I come to the floor to talk about \nsomething that is very important to many of us in North Carolina and to \nthe people who come to the North Carolina coast to enjoy our beautiful \nbeaches and a group of wild horses at Corolla.\n  They are called the Corolla wild horses. They are a piece of American \nheritage. They have been there since ships have been wrecked in what we \ncall the graveyard of the Atlantic. These horses of Spanish origin \nended up finding their way to shore, and they set up a habitat on the \nEast Coast that is actually an attraction to tourists and something \nthat brings a smile to your face when you are out on the water and you \nsee them coming to the shore. They have been there for almost 400 \nyears, and they are roaming over about 7,500 acres of land right now.\n  The problem we have, though, is that with development over time their \nhabitat has shrunk. As a result of that, we only have about 80 horses \nout in Corolla now. To have a healthy population, we have to figure out \na way to provide them with genetic diversity or they are going to \nbecome extinct in a very brief period of time. The entire herd is in \ngrave danger as a result.\n  The solution to the problem is to try to figure out a way to produce \ngenetic diversity, which is why the senior Senator from North Carolina, \nMr. Burr, has offered an amendment that I hope we can get support for.\n  The horses roam mostly on private land, but there are some public \nlands they roam freely on that are managed by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife. \nThe county and private philanthropic organizations are managing the \nhorses. No taxpayer dollars are being used to manage these horse \npopulations, but they do need some help and relief from the amendment \nSenator Burr has put forward.\n  To give an idea of what we are dealing with, I want to tell a story \nof a typical example of what is happening in Corolla. This is a \nheartbreaking story. It was shared with me by Karen McCalpin, the \nexecutive director of the Corolla Wild Horse Fund, who manages the \nhorses now with no taxpayer dollars:\n\n       When Cordero was first seen, the tides were too high to \n     bring a trailer up the beach so we had to wait until the next \n     day at low tide to bring panels and a trailer. We looked for \n     him every day for 4 days after that. We went through wooded \n     areas and marsh with no success. We finally found his harem \n     on July 20, 2013. It was a difficult capture and the poor \n     thing was trying to run to keep up with his mother. We had to \n     capture her as well. Due to his young age and poor condition, \n     he needed his mother's milk as well as her company to help \n     relieve some of the stress of captivity. Unfortunately, that \n     became an exercise in futility.\n\n  Cordero, because of his health problems, had to be euthanized.\n  We want a solution to this problem. It is a great solution that only \nrequires a minimum amount of influence from us to get this done--\nlargely done by private and local entities. What we need to do is put \nan amendment forward that requires the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, \nthe State of North Carolina, and Currituck County--the State of North \nCarolina and Currituck County want to do this--working with the Corolla \nWild Horse Fund to establish a management plan that would allow for the \ntransfer of horses from a related herd located at Shackleford Banks. \nThis would allow the herd size to grow and will provide more genetic \ndiversity to prevent situations that poor Cordero experienced.\n  Our amendment asks for no money. The amendment is supported by the \nHumane Society, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to \nAnimals, the Animal Welfare Institute, the Corolla Wild Horse Fund, and \nother key animal welfare organizations.\n  Contrary to what some people have said who may oppose this amendment, \nit doesn't change the mission of U.S. Fish & Wildlife Services. It \ndoesn't require any taxpayer dollars. All it simply does is allow local \ngovernment to solve this problem.\n  I hope that later today or tomorrow, when we can get on these \namendments, we can convince our Members that this is a very important \nasset not only for North Carolina but for the Nation, and a simple \ngesture on our part can solve a very difficult problem on the part of \nthe Corolla wild horses.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/senate-section/article/S2142-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2142-S2143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FAA REAUTHORIZATION BILL\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, we are close to the vote on the FAA \nbill. I want to underscore the importance for the Senate because it \ncontains some of the most significant passenger-friendly reforms and \nairport security enhancements that we have seen in years.\n  To get to this point has been no small task, especially in this era \nin which it is so difficult to find consensus and a bipartisan way to \npass something. We have been able to do it with the able leadership of \nthe chairman, Senator John Thune. The two of us have felt like we \nneeded to focus on areas where we agree, and as a result the entire \nCommerce Committee came together to get this done. Now we are about to \npass this and get it on to the House.\n  In a complicated bill like this, it doesn't contain everything that \neverybody wants, but we hope our counterparts in the House are going to \ntake up and pass this bill without delay. We have given them a good \nbipartisan blueprint to follow and one they ought to pass easily.\n  If they add controversial or partisan measures such as privatizing \nour air traffic control system, this bill will fail. The U.S. \nDepartment of Defense is unalterably opposed to private controllers \ncontrolling our military aircraft. If that path is taken in the House, \nit is going to be a big loss for consumers and for the safety of the \nflying public.\n  When thinking about some of the irritations of passengers, such as \nthe growing list of airline fees and charges, consumers feel they are \nnickel-and-dimed to death. This bill is going to require greater \ntransparency and relief. Building on a minority Commerce Committee \nreport that was released last summer, it requires fee refunds for \ndelayed baggage. It requires refunds for ancillary services, such as \nseating fees that are paid for by a customer and then not delivered by \nthe airline. It requires new standardized disclosure of fees for \nconsumers and increased protections for disabled passengers.\n  There are important safety reforms. Last night's national news was \nled by an international news report from London about an inbound \nBritish Airways flight into Heathrow that was struck by a drone. \nComputer analysis has been done. What would happen if the drone is \nsucked into a jet engine? It can certainly cause it to be inoperable \nand might start an explosion.\n  Remember what happened when two seagulls were sucked into the engine \nof a flight called the Hudson River miracle, when captain Sully \nSullenberger was able to belly it in because he had no power. That was \ncaused by a seagull with feathers, webbed feet, and a beak. Imagine \nwhat the metal and plastic of a drone being sucked into a jet engine \ncould do. Do we need any more reminders?\n  This bill has a pilot program to test and develop technologies to \nintercept or shut down drones when they are near airports.\n  Remember the tragedy in Brussels. Remember the downing of a Russian \nairliner in Egypt because somebody was on the inside and snuck a bomb \nonto the airplane. There are parts in this bill that will help reduce \nthe insider threat that terrorists have previously exploited, including \nthe soft\n\n[[Page S2143]]\n\ntargets in the queues at the TSA lines and at the ticket counters.\n  This bill will improve the background checks and security screenings \nfor airport workers and prevent hackers from potentially gaining \ncontrol of an airplane. This bill also requires that the FAA develop \nstandards on how aircraft manufacturers can keep flight control systems \nseparate from inflight passenger entertainment systems. Remember what \nwas shown on ``60 Minutes'' about the takeover and control of a car by \nsomeone going on the Internet and hacking into the car's entertainment \nsystem.\n  The bottom line is, this is a good bill. It is the result of a hard-\nearned collaborative effort. I thank Senator Thune and his staff for \ntheir good work and their good will in our negotiations. I also thank \nthe Members of our staff who worked endlessly to get us to this point. \nAfter the vote, I am going to read a list of their names because I want \nthem to be recognized.\n  To our colleagues in the Senate, I thank you for working with Senator \nThune and me on the creation and development of the bill up to this \npoint and now the passage of the bill. I suspect the Senate will \nrespond overwhelmingly and I certainly urge that result.\n  Madam President, we have just a couple minutes until the vote.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, we are trying to get clearance for a \npackage of 26 noncontroversial amendments that Senator Thune and I put \ntogether in a package. They are noncontroversial. They are amendments \nsponsored by a multiplicity of Senators, a whole array of different \nthings that are needed.\n  We have one Senator objecting to proceeding with the package of 26 \namendments. We are trying to get that objection removed; otherwise, we \nare going to be in a position of going to the bill, which we will have \nthe votes to pass, but without these 26 amendments. These are \namendments by Senators Hatch, McCain, Thune, Moran, Brown, Murphy, \nKaine, Feinstein, Johnson, Leahy, Inhofe, Cornyn, Markey, Kirk, Cornyn, \nDurbin, Moran, Warner, Sullivan, Hirono, Hoeven, Heitkamp, Isakson, \nMurray, and Tester.\n  All are noncontroversial. But we have one objection with regard to \nthis package, which is noncontroversial.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, we have pending before us final passage \non the FAA reauthorization. We have been waiting to see if there were \nnot another 26 amendments that have been cleared on both sides that we \ncan get added to the bill. Despite our best efforts, we have an \nobjection to that. We have been trying all morning to get that cleared, \nbut that has not been possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/senate-section/article/S2143-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my appreciation to \nmy colleagues for the passage of the Federal Aviation Administration \nReauthorization Act of 2016. By passing this legislation, which I \noffered with the Commerce Committee's ranking member, Senator Nelson, \nand our Aviation Subcommittee leaders, Senator Ayotte and Senator \nCantwell, the Senate is seeking to end a string of short extensions \nwith a comprehensive reform proposal now on its way to the House of \nRepresentatives. Bipartisan efforts at both the Commerce Committee and \non the Senate floor made an already strong bill even better.\n  Only weeks ago, horrific attacks by ISIS created new concern for air \ntravelers. Recognizing the need to enhance security, Senators from both \nsides of the aisle offered amendments to strengthen safety and security \nprotections for passengers in this aviation bill. To guard against the \nthreat of airport insiders helping terrorists, we added provisions that \nI authored along with Senator Nelson to improve the scrutiny of \nindividuals applying to work in secure airport areas.\n  For the first time, we put requirements in place so applicants \nneeding access to secure areas of airports can be denied security \ncredential if they have been convicted of embezzlement, racketeering, \nrobbery, sabotage, immigration law violations, or assault with a deadly \nweapon.\n  While very few criminals are terrorists, it is not at all uncommon \nfor terrorists to get their start as criminals. The Brussels attackers, \nfor example, were known to the police as criminals long before they \ncarried out terrorist\n\n[[Page S2144]]\n\nattacks. Ensuring that dangerous criminals don't work behind the scenes \nat airports is one important thing we can do to reduce the threats \nfacing airport passengers. Tightening the vetting process for airport \nemployees is especially critical, as many experts believe the recent \nbombing of a Russian passenger jet leaving Egypt had help from an \naviation insider.\n  Our bill also includes security provisions to better safeguard public \nareas outside the security checkpoints at airports and to help reduce \npassenger backups. These reforms could help prevent a future attack, \nlike the one in the Brussels terminal last month, which targeted a \ncrowd of passengers in an area where the attackers didn't even need \ntickets.\n  While many of our security enhancements addressed problems \nhighlighted by recent attacks, none of these proposals were cobbled \ntogether in a rush to do something. All of the security proposals added \nto this bill have existed for months and were developed as a result of \ncongressional oversight, independent evaluations of agencies, and the \nstudy of existing problems. What recent attacks by ISIS did create is \nnew urgency to enact these security safeguards as the threat of \nterrorism remains a menace.\n  As I have mentioned more than once, this legislation has been praised \nfor the many ways it helps airline passengers. Under this bill, \nairlines will be required to return fees if they lose or significantly \ndelay delivery of passengers' luggage. We also require airlines to \nautomatically return fees for services purchased but not delivered so \ntravelers don't have to go through the hassle of trying to reclaim \ntheir money from an airline.\n  Because many customers are frustrated by lengthy legal jargon that \ncan make it difficult to understand add-on costs, our bill creates a \nnew and easy-to-read uniform standard for disclosing baggage, ticket \nchange, seat selection, and other fees. We even help families with \nchildren find flights where they can sit together without additional \ncosts by requiring airlines to tell purchasers about available seat \nlocations at the time of booking.\n  A Washington Post consumer columnist called our bill ``one of the \nmost passenger-friendly Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization \nbills in a generation.''\n  I am proud that the FAA bill before the Senate today is the product \nof a bipartisan process. Over at the Commerce Committee, we approved 57 \namendments before this bill came to the floor, and 60 percent of those \namendments came from Members of the minority. Here on the Senate floor, \nwe approved an additional 19 amendments.\n  In addition to helping passengers and enhancing security, this \nlegislation addresses a number of other priorities, including the cyber \nsecurity of aircraft, the aircraft design approval process, undue \nregulatory burdens on noncommercial pilots, airport infrastructure, \nrural air service, lithium battery safety, mental health screening for \npilots, communicable disease preparedness, drone safety, and many other \nimportant areas. Without going through them in detail, the bill's \nprovisions for unmanned aerial systems are groundbreaking.\n  Twenty years from now, when drones play significant roles in our \neconomy and making the public safer, Congress will look back at this \nbill as landmark legislation. Provisions in this bill will give the FAA \nauthority to address safety issues unique to drones and advance the \ndevelopment of drone technology.\n  Thanks to this legislation, the FAA will be able to consider and \ngrant permission for new and safe drone usage, stop dangerous \npractices, and deploy new tools to put sensitive parts of our national \nairspace under restricted access for drones.\n  Finally, as I have noted, Ranking Member Nelson, Senator Ayotte, and \nSenator Cantwell deserve high praise for their collaboration on this \nlegislation. Senator Nelson, in particular, has been a real partner in \nthe effort, and I want to express my sincere thanks to him and to his \ntalented staff.\n  I also want to acknowledge the important contributions of Finance \nCommittee Chairman Hatch, Ranking Member Wyden, and their staffs. \nWithout the Finance Committee provisions they provided for revenue and \nexpenditure authority, we would not have an FAA bill.\n  I also want to thank Leader McConnell, his lead liaison to the \nCommerce Committee, Scott Rabb, and Leader Reid for helping us get this \nbill passed.\n  I also appreciate the Senators and their staff members who worked \nwith us so that we could include so many amendments here on the floor.\n  Finally, it goes without saying that I want to thank my own staff for \ntheir great work on this bill, especially Nick Rossi, Adrian Arnakis, \nBailey Edwards, Michael Reynolds, Jessica McBride, Missye Brickell, \nSuzanne Gillen, Jaclyn Keshian, Christopher Loring, Rebecca Seidel, \nCheri Pascoe, Peter Feldman, Andrew Timm, Frederick Hill, and Lauren \nHammond. Long hours and even a few all-nighters have been put into this \nbill over the course of many months. I am the first to say that nothing \nconsequential or substantial gets done around this place without the \nimportant, hard work of the very talented and skilled staff. I am \nblessed on the Commerce Committee to be surrounded with people who care \npassionately about these issues, who work very diligently to get the \nbest possible outcomes and results. I am grateful for the contributions \nof our staff and those of Senator Nelson's staff and of the many \nMembers who were involved in shaping this bill. It is another \naccomplishment that we can all be proud of.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, the feeling is mutual. I made my comments \nearlier, so I won't go into the substance of the bill. Senator Thune \nhas certainly been a delight to work with, as was his committee staff.\n  I wish to personally thank our staff: Tom Chapman, Jenny Solomon, \nChris Day, Mohsin Syed, Melissa Alvarado, Laura Ponto, Dan Hurd, Renae \nBlack, Maria Stratienko, Nick Russell, Christian Fjeld, Brian No, Peder \nMagee, Meeran Ahn, Brad Torppey, and our staff director Kim Lipsky. I \nalso wish to thank the Democratic staff here on the floor--they make \nthis place run day in and day out--Gary Myrick, Tim Mitchell, Trisha \nEngle, Dan Tinsley, and all the cloakroom staff.\n  I thank the Senate for responding so affirmatively to this FAA bill. \nNow let's get the House to understand the importance of this bill so we \ncan get it into law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3799\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the title \namendment at the desk be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3799) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n                     (Purpose: To amend the title)\n\n       Amend the title so as to read: ``An Act to amend title 49, \n     United States Code, to authorize appropriations for the \n     Federal Aviation Administration for fiscal years 2016 through \n     2017, and for other purposes.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to make some remarks \non the Burr-Tillis amendment No. 3175 to the Energy bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Corolla Wild Horses Protection Amendment\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President and colleagues, I am embarrassed that I am \nhaving to come to the floor to talk about an amendment that makes so \nmuch sense, that embraces everything that I think the legislative \nbranch and, more importantly, the American people support: the \nprotection of a species.\n  I rise today to ask my colleagues to support the Corolla Wild Horses \nProtection Act. The amendment mirrors legislation Senator Tillis and I \nintroduced, S. 1204. This bill passed the House twice, in 2012 and \n2013.\n  Let me be specific. This bill directs the Secretary of the Interior \nto enter into an agreement with the Corolla Wild Horses Fund to provide \nfor the management of free-roaming wild horses in and around Currituck \nNational Wildlife Refuge.\n  As I have learned, North Carolina is mostly inhabited by people from \nVirginia and Maryland--up and down the east coast--in the summer. As a \nmatter\n\n[[Page S2145]]\n\nof fact, as to the homes in the northern portion of the Outer Banks \nwhere the wild horses are found, where there isn't a road, 60 percent \nof the homes are owned by Virginians, not North Carolinians. These \nhorses have existed there for hundreds of years. As a matter of fact, \nthese horses have been such an important part of North Carolina's \nhistory that in 2010 it was made North Carolina's State horse.\n  People have seen these horses on the beach and between cottages. They \nhave co-existed with the habitat for over 200 years. The turtles, \nducks, and wildlife have thrived. The species of that habitat have \nsurvived because there is no better protector of the species than these \nanimals. They eat what they need without removing the roots, which is \nwhat helps them to repopulate and stay alive.\n  Here is the problem: This herd has been mandated to be held at 60 \nhorses, and every scientific study on genetics shows you have to have \nmore than 100 or 120 to have genetic sustainability.\n  What are we proposing? This act proposes that we bring 20 horses from \nthe Shackleford reserve and integrate them with the horses on the Outer \nBanks, which is a mere 2 hours away. This herd is similar from the \nstandpoint of its creation. By doing this, we will begin to inject \ngenetics into this so we don't have the genetic deformities that are \nbeginning to be experienced with the Corolla horses. If we don't act \nnow, we could lose these horses, and it is all due to genetic \ninbreeding.\n  The reason I am embarrassed to be here is that this is something that \nought to be done by unanimous consent. Every person in this body should \nembrace this legislation. Yet the Fish and Wildlife Service is opposed \nto this. And there is nothing that says that Fish and Wildlife can't \nbuild a fence around the wildlife reserve. It existed for hundreds of \nyears in the wildlife reserve before and after it was designated as a \nwildlife reserve. As a matter of fact, 70 percent of the land on which \nthese horses roam is private. The land for the wildlife refuge is only \n30 percent, but 70 percent of the land is privately owned, and the \nprivate landowners are all for making this herd genetically \nsustainable.\n  If we don't do this legislatively, let me assure you that the Fish \nand Wildlife Service is going to hold the number at 60. If they hold \nthe herd at 60, the herd will genetically burn out. I don't know what \nFish and Wildlife is going to do. The herd is at 80 today. The herd \nneeds new genetics entered into it to change the trend, but Fish and \nWildlife could go out tomorrow and shoot 20 horses. I am sure they \nwould probably tell us that they would take 20 horses and put them \nsomewhere else. Where are they going to put them? Inject them into \nanother genetic herd and increase their sustainability? Maybe so. But \nif you do it somewhere else, why wouldn't you do the same thing here?\n  No landowners are clamoring to let this herd die out. As a matter of \nfact, there are a million and a half people in this country who have \nexpressed support for the sustainability of this herd. But this is \nwhere science dictates. Science says that it is not sustainable if you \nleave this herd without a genetic injection from somewhere else.\n  This is not a new proposal. It passed in the House twice. It is not a \nnew proposal. Fish and Wildlife has done this in other places. For some \nreason, they don't want to do it in North Carolina.\n  The last test for any Member of Congress and anybody in this country \nshould be: What will it cost us to do this? What am I asking you to pay \nto do this? The answer is zero. There is no Federal cost to this \nlegislation. We can sustain the herd for the future, and it will not \ncost taxpayers anything. We have a private entity that will take \nresponsibility for the management of the fund.\n  We don't in any way, shape, or form limit Fish and Wildlife from the \nstandpoint of their ability to fence off whatever they believe is \nenvironmentally sensitive. And we have horses that have lived with \nducks, geese, and sea turtles for over 200 years and have never seen a \nproblem with it.\n  The Presiding Officer has been patient. I say to my colleagues: Don't \nmake a mistake. Support this legislation. It is the right thing to do. \nIt doesn't cost the taxpayers money, and it embraces everything that I \nthink America stands for, and that is the preservation of the history \nof this country. Believe it or not, these horses represent over 200 \nyears of history in North Carolina, and that is why we made it our \nState horse.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield back my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/senate-section/article/S2145-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we are back on the floor with the \nEnergy Policy Modernization Act--an act that many of us have spent a \nconsiderable amount of time not only here on the floor discussing but, \nprior to its arrival on the floor of the Senate, working through a \nprocess that, quite honestly, I am very pleased to be able to report \non.\n  As we have just heard, with the voice vote that we just took en bloc, \nwe have accepted and adopted 29 additional amendments to this broad, \nbipartisan, and, as some would suggest, long-stalled Energy bill. We \nhave been working on this now on the floor for more than 2 months. It \nactually first came to the floor on January 27 of this year. But we \nhave seen patience, a little bit of persistence, and a truly good-faith \nnegotiation. Last week we were able to clear the last of the objections \nto this bill and to define a path forward.\n  Again, we just reached unanimous consent on these 29 additional \namendments. There will be eight rollcall votes this afternoon and then \nvotes on cloture and final passage, and, hopefully, today we will see \nthe last day of debate on our Energy bill.\n  Since we have been away from EPMA for so long, I wanted to start my \ncomments this afternoon by reminding colleagues of the process we have \nfollowed and of the many good provisions we have incorporated within \nthe bill that make it worthy of the Senate's support.\n  It began with a pretty simple and straightforward recognition; that \nis, that it was time--it was actually well past time--to update and \nreform our Nation's energy policies. The last time the Congress passed \na major Energy bill was in December of 2007. So it has been almost a \ndecade's worth of changes in technologies and markets taking place \nacross the country.\n  Our energy space has changed, but what hasn't changed are the \npolicies. The policies that we see are increasingly outdated and \ndetached from the opportunities we need to advance good energy policy \nin this country.\n  So what did we do? We set out to write a bill. Our Energy Policy \nModernization Act of 2016 is the result of more than a year of hard \nwork by those of us who serve on the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee. It is the result of multiple listening sessions, multiple \nlegislative hearings, bipartisan negotiations, and then a multiday \nmarkup that we held last July. At the end of that markup, we were able \nto approve a bill by a strong bipartisan margin--18 to 4.\n  The reason the bill passed out of committee with such strong \nbipartisan support was not just because of our commitment to a good \nprocess--and it was very clear that it was a good process throughout--\nbut we matched that good process with a commitment, an equal \ncommitment, to good policy. We worked together across the aisle to \ninclude good ideas from Members on both sides of the aisle, from \nMembers on the committee, and Members off the committee. Some of the \nthings we agreed to include are going to speak to the input we \nreceived.\n  Senator Barrasso has led an effort that will streamline LNG exports. \nHe was joined by 17 other Members. That is incorporated in our bill.\n  We agreed to include a major efficiency bill that the occupant of the \nChair, the Senator from Ohio, together with the Senator from New \nHampshire, have spearheaded for years. That bill was supported by 13 \nother Members and is incorporated as part of this overall Energy Policy \nModernization Act.\n  We agreed to improve our mineral security. This is something I have \nbeen leading, along with Senators Heller and Crapo and Risch.\n  We worked to promote the use of hydropower--a renewable, emission-\nfree resource that is favored by just about everybody in this Chamber.\n  We agreed to streamline permitting for natural gas pipelines. This \nwas an effort that was led by the Senator from West Virginia, Mrs. \nCapito.\n  We agreed to a new oil and gas permitting pilot program. This was one \nof several ideas that the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Hoeven, helped \nadvance.\n  We have worked to improve our Nation's cyber security, based on \nlegislation that was advanced by the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. \nHeinrich, as well as Senator Risch from Idaho.\n  We also made innovation a key priority to promote the development of \npromising technologies.\n  As part of that, we agreed to reauthorize some of the energy-related \nprovisions that were contained in the America COMPETES Act, which was \nled by Senator Alexander from Tennessee.\n  We also agreed to reauthorize the coal R program at the Department \nof Energy. This was, again, based on another bipartisan proposal that \nwas led by both Senators from West Virginia, Senators Capito and \nManchin, as well as the Senator from Ohio who is occupying the Chair \nnow, Senator Portman.\n  What we came away with was a substantive, timely, and bipartisan \nmeasure that has a very real chance of being the first major Energy \nbill signed into law in well over 8 years.\n  So this is important, for a host of different reasons.\n  Moving forward with this act will help America produce more energy. \nIt will help Americans save more money. It will help ensure that energy \ncan be transported from where it is produced to where it is needed. It \nwill strengthen our status as the best innovator in the world, and it \nwill bring us just one step closer to becoming a global energy \nsuperpower. It will do all of this without raising taxes, without \nimposing new mandates, and without adding to the Federal deficit.\n  That was our starting point here on the Senate floor back in January. \nWhen we came to the floor with the Energy bill, I think those of us on \nthe Energy and Natural Resources Committee thought it was a pretty \nstrong bill, but we have made it better. We kept building on it. Since \nthe debate began, we have voted on a total of 38 amendments. We have \naccepted 32 of them, and we have added even more good ideas from even \nmore Members to an already very bipartisan package. Right now, the \nEnergy Policy Modernization Act includes priorities from 62 Members of \nthe Senate. In other words, more than three-fifths of the Members of \nthis body have contributed something to this overall bill, and that \nnumber will rise throughout the day as we process additional \namendments.\n\n  One amendment I am particularly pleased with is the resources title \nthat I have worked on and written with Senator Cantwell. We have agreed \nto a package of 30 lands and water bills which will address a wide \nrange of issues in Western States. That package also includes the \nbipartisan sportsmen's provisions that we have been working to pass in \nthis body for at least three Congresses. This is a measure that will \nensure that our public lands are open, unless closed for a legitimate \nreason, to require agencies to enhance opportunities for our sportsmen \non public lands and more. I want to recognize my colleague from New \nMexico who has helped us with this endeavor in making sure the \nsportsmen's package was included as this bill moved forward.\n  It is true we were a little bit delayed in reaching the point where \nwe are today as we are processing these final amendments, but I thank \nthe Senate and the majority leader for sticking with us on this. At one \npoint in time, it was suggested that we were going to\n\n[[Page S2155]]\n\nhave to pull a rabbit out of a hat in order to get this bill back on \nthe floor with a consent process that would allow us to finish. Well, \nthe rabbit has come out of the hat. Some might suggest it was a little \nbit battered, but, nonetheless, nobody gave up on this bill.\n  I acknowledge Senator Cantwell and her staff for working with us \nevery step of the way. We knew we had a path forward. We worked \ntirelessly to find it because we know this is a bill worth passing.\n  Over the next couple of hours, Members will have an opportunity to \ndeliver their final comments on the Energy bill, and after that we will \nmove to these eight stacked rollcall votes, followed by votes on \ncloture, and then, hopefully, on final passage.\n  I am pleased to be able to say we will have wrapped up our work on \nthis bill and send it over to the House of Representatives--again, \nhopefully, by the time we go home tonight.\n  I thank the Senate for working with us to get to this point, and I \nwould encourage Members on both sides of the aisle to recognize the \ngood work and the good ideas that are included within this bill. And \nwhen the time comes, I encourage every Member to vote yes on a broad \nbipartisan, good energy bill.\n  Mr. President, I recognize my colleague Senator Cantwell, the ranking \nmember on the Energy Committee and a fabulous partner throughout this \neffort. I would like to thank her for all she has done to get us to \nthis point as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to thank Chairman Murkowski for \nher leadership on the Energy bill. She and I have been working on this \nfor almost a year now, and today we are at a point where we think we \nwill see the final product of this legislation in the next 24 hours \nmove out of the Senate and over to the House of Representatives. So it \nis a good day. We are very thankful that all the hard work she and her \nteam and our side on the minority have put in will result in \nsuccessfully getting a bill to the President's desk.\n  I acknowledge our colleagues in the Senate have addressed something \nlike 40 different priority pieces of legislation. We have added, as the \nchairman has said, 60 different amendments during the floor process. We \nhave had important compromises on clean energy technology, energy \nefficiency, and infrastructure with truly bipartisan support. We need \nto pass this bill, and that is why we have been persistent.\n  It has been since 2007 that we passed an energy bill, led by Senator \nJeff Bingaman and Senator Pete Domenici, that laid down a lot of \nfundamental things in the renewable energy markets and clean energy \ninvestment, but the landscape has changed greatly since 2007. Since \nthen, because of those efforts, the United States has more than \nquadrupled the wind power than what we had before. It has more than \ntripled than what we had. Solar photovoltaic installations are up \nnearly by 15 times. The number of LED lights has grown more than 90 \ntimes.\n  From 2007 to 2014, our national energy use also fell 2.4 percent \nwhile the GDP grew 8 percent. This represents a very significant point \nin energy productivity; that is, we have continued to produce cleaner \nsources of energy and helped diversify our own energy portfolio. Yet \nour economy and GDP still grew. It is important because these policies \nthat are in this bill are continuing to move forward on energy \nefficiency, clean energy, renewables, and new technology.\n  I thank everybody who has been cooperative in this process. Clearly, \nwe could have had a my-way-or-the-highway approach that was taken on \nthe Shaheen-Portman legislation. I know my colleague is leaving the \nfloor, but Senator Portman and Senator Shaheen played a large role in \npast discussions, but the chairwoman didn't take that approach. She \nsaid: Let's all work together. In a spirit of compromise, let's pass \nlegislation that our colleagues want to see. And of course, the U.S. \nDepartment of Energy published the Quadrennial Energy Review last year, \nwhich said that we are at an energy crossroads. And we looked at what \nour Nation needed to do at this crossroad, to make investments in \nmodernizing our 21st century energy portfolio. Energy is the lifeblood \nof our economy. If we put good energy policy in place, businesses and \nconsumers get more affordable, cleaner, and more renewable energy.\n  This bill takes important steps on research and development of clean \nenergy technologies to help us integrate these new, clean energy \ntechnologies that are not already in the marketplace, and gaining a \nfoothold on new clean energy technologies in marine, hydrokinetic and \ngeothermal. I thank our colleague Senator Wyden for his leadership on \nmany of these issues.\n  The bill also takes important steps in advanced grid technology to \nhelp us with new integration of our renewable resources. It authorizes \n$2 billion for technology demonstration grants to make sure that we are \ncontinuing the development of a microgrid deployment. I know from the \nchairman of the committee it is something very important to Alaska and \nthe chairman, as they have a huge territory and lots to cover. So, \nmaking sure that microgrid development gets the technical support and \nassistance is critical.\n  The bill includes an initiative to accelerate the RD of energy \nstorage, a technology that many witnesses before our committee have \nlabeled as the game-changer--and I believe it is the game-changer. As a \nhydro State that gets more than 70 percent of our electricity from \ninexpensive renewable sources, like hydro. So making sure we can store \nsome of that energy is a game-changer for the electricity grid.\n  Just as important, this bill makes a major investment in cyber \nsecurity. We are talking about technologies that are key to making sure \nwe protect our grid, making it more resilient, basically making it more \nrobust so we can continue to improve it and face less risk in the \nfuture.\n  We have many opportunities in this Energy bill to continue to promote \nthe advanced fuels and energy information that are going to allow us to \ncontinue to diversify our energy resources. We also want to make sure \nwe are understanding how the United States can maintains its \ncompetitiveness in a clean energy economy. For example, the global \nsmart grid economy is expected to grow by $400 billion in the next 5 \nyears. It is pretty basic. Anytime you can save on the supply you \nalready have, it is a wise investment. Many people want to invest in \nmaking their electricity and the use of their current energy supply \nsmarter. I like the smart building provisions of this bill. Smart \nbuilding will end up using sensors to better direct and maintain the \nenergy flow in buildings. Why is this so important? It is important \nbecause about 40 percent of our energy use in the U.S. comes from \nbuildings today. The Department of Energy believes we can reduce the \ncost of energy in our buildings by about 20 percent. I don't think \nthere is a person in the Senate who hasn't walked into a room and felt \nlike the thermostat just wasn't right. Whatever it said, the room \nseemed to be the opposite. That is why we want buildings to have \nsmarter technology, more sophisticated technology, so we can save \nenergy and help our businesses be more competitive.\n  Energy efficiency in the Chinese market is expected to be more than \n$1.5 trillion by 2035. So continuing our leadership, this bill will \nhelp us grow jobs and grow industries in the United States. Energy \nefficiency and building standards have also lowered costs. A 20-percent \ncut of energy use in buildings would save $80 billion each year in \nenergy bills. That is something that would give any U.S. manufacturer a \ncompetitive advantage. Investing in smart building makes sense. I am \npleased that while investing in this we are also helping our \nmanufacturers.\n  We just had a hearing with the manufacturing industry in the Energy \nCommittee. They told us they were literally bringing overseas jobs home \nto the United States because we are continuing to invest in the right \nadvanced manufacturing technologies so they will continue to be \ncompetitive. I speak now of what is happening with aerospace \nmanufacturing in composite lightweight materials. The research we did \nallowed us to continue to be proficient in that area and have more jobs \nbrought back to the United States.\n  This bill invests in smart manufacturing. It would enhance fuel \nefficiency opportunities for advanced truck fleets. I thank Senators \nStabenow,\n\n[[Page S2156]]\n\nPeters, and Alexander for their work on that provision. Heavy-duty \ntrucks move 70 percent of our freight and use 20 percent of the fuel \nconsumed in the United States. This sector can continue to use the \nadvancements in these technologies to continue their competitive \nadvantage.\n  This legislation also focuses on workforce training issues. We know \nwe need more jobs as the energy profile continues to change. The good \nnews is these are high-paying jobs. In my State, the average salary for \na utility worker is 57 percent higher than the average salary of all \nother industries in the State. Our bill establishes a competitive \nworkforce grant, a job training program through community colleges, and \nhelps with registered apprentice programs so we can get the workforce \nof tomorrow that the Secretary of Energy says we need. His report says \nwe need 1.5 million new workers in the energy industry. Let's go about \nmaking sure we get that.\n  Lastly, I want to mention the Land and Water Conservation Fund, a \nprogram that was actually authored by Senator ``Scoop'' Jackson from \nWashington and he remains the longest-serving chairman of the Senate \nEnergy Committee. The Land and Water Conservation Fund was a fully \nfunctional and effective program for 50 years, until Congress allowed \nits authority to lapse last fall. This bill would make sure that never \nhappens again by making it permanent.\n  I thank the chairman for her leadership because she helped us craft a \ncompromise on making the Land and Water Conservation Fund permanent, to \nget the right focus on how the program works and to continue to make \nsure we are making investments in outdoor recreation.\n  This Land and Water Conservation Fund helps support more than 200,000 \njobs in the State of Washington and a nearly $20 billion economy. When \nwe talk about the various amendments we are going to be talking about \ntoday, I want to make sure Members understand that a lot of good work \nin the committee went into the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n  We will also be voting on a lot of public lands amendments later. I \nwant to bring up one, the Yakima River Basin bill, which we passed out \nof committee on a bipartisan vote. It's a holistic approach to dealing \nwith water management. I hope it becomes a model for the rest of the \ncountry.\n  I also thank Secretary Moniz and his staff and Secretary Jewell and \nher staff for all the work that was done in the committee on both the \nlands package and on the energy provisions. I know the chairwoman \nprobably discussed the issue of natural gas exports and Secretary Moniz \nprovided us language for how the agency is working that we put into the \nbill.\n  I again thank my two colleagues who are on the floor, Senator Shaheen \nand Senator Portman. Certainly Senator Shaheen has been dogged in her \nenthusiastic support for not just energy efficiency policy, working \nwith Senator Portman, but when she left the committee, I don't think \nshe really left the committee. She just pretended, so that she was \nsomehow still connected to our efforts. I thank her for that and also \nSenator Portman. I think we have taken the good work of these \nindividuals and probably had almost 30 different energy efficiency \nproposals in this base legislation bill that we have incorporated and \nnow are able to move forward on. I also thank my colleague Senator \nHeinrich, who has several provisions in this bill and several that will \nbe voted on shortly in the lands package.\n  These individuals, along with those I just mentioned, members of the \ncommittee, provided such great leadership for us in putting this final \nbill before the Members of the Senate. I hope our colleagues will give \nit enthusiastic support. It represents a lot of discussion. It is not \nthe perfect bill that the chairwoman would have written nor the exact \nbill I would have written.\n  But it is a compromise on the modernization of energy that this \ncountry needs to move toward a safer, more secure, cleaner energy force \nand a skilled workforce to go with delivering it.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I want to start by commending the \nPresiding Officer and Senator Cantwell for getting this bill to the \nfloor. They say the third time is the charm. I think this may be the \nfourth or the fifth time. But I will say that I marvel, Senator \nCantwell and Senator Murkowski, at your patience and your persistence.\n  You have never lost sight of the goal, which is to actually move \nlegislation that will help us create jobs, make our economy more \nefficient, as Senator Cantwell has said, and improve our energy \npolicies at a time when we are desperate to be able to address some of \nthe new changes we see in our economy and in our energy situation in \nparticular. So thank you for your persistence.\n  I also want to commend you and thank you for including as title I of \nthis legislation the energy efficiency legislation, the Portman-Shaheen \nenergy efficiency legislation that we just talked about.\n  Senator Shaheen is here on the floor with me. I hope she will talk \nabout this bill in a second. This is something we worked on a long \ntime--I think over 5 years now. It is an opportunity for us as a body \nto actually move forward with sensible legislation that makes our \nFederal Government more efficient and our factories more efficient, as \nSenator Cantwell has talked about.\n  It improves our ability to create jobs and to be able to be more \nenergy independent. It is the kind of win-win legislation that we do \ntoo seldom around here. It is an opportunity for us today to send a \nstrong message to the House that we would like to move broad energy \nefficiency legislation. Hopefully, we can get it to the President's \ndesk for signature and move it ahead.\n  There are two parts of the Energy Savings and Industrial \nCompetitiveness Act. That is our legislation that has already been \npassed by this Chamber. Those two parts have been signed by the \nPresident. They are at work now.\n  I will say that already they are helping to allow individuals to use \nless energy and, therefore, have more savings. That lets companies to \nbe more efficient, to create more jobs, and to reduce emissions. Now it \nis time to pass this remaining part of the legislation, the main part \nof the legislation which includes bipartisan reforms that we are taking \nup today.\n  It is about time we get these across the finish line. The priority I \nhave had here in the Senate has been on jobs and wages. That is exactly \nwhat this legislation does. It is really a jobs bill, among other \nthings. According to a recent study of our legislation, the Portman-\nShaheen bill, by 2030 it will help create nearly 200,000 new jobs and \nhelp the economy by saving consumers about $16.7 billion in reduced \nenergy costs.\n  So this is legislation about energy, but it is also about our economy \nand jobs. By the way, when we started this legislation, it was the \nShaheen-Portman legislation. It has remained a totally bipartisan--even \nnonpartisan--effort.\n  Our workers in Ohio and in the States represented in this Chamber are \ncompeting with countries all over the world. If you think about it, a \nlot of these companies that are in other places, strictly in Europe and \nJapan, are very energy efficient. That gives them an advantage. It \nmakes it harder for us to be able to add jobs here to be able to \ncompete because their costs are lower and their profits are up.\n  So part of this legislation is strongly supported by the \nmanufacturers in this country because they know that, by making our \nplants more energy efficient, we are going to give our workers in Ohio \nand around the country and our companies a competitive advantage. So \nthat is one thing that is very important about this legislation. This \nwill help us to be able to compete in a global economy.\n  It also creates more jobs to have more supply of energy. So it is not \njust that we are being more efficient, which is very good, but I will \nsay that in this legislation we are also encouraging more production, \nincluding energy infrastructure that the chairman talked about earlier. \nSo my view is very simple. We should be producing more and using less. \nThat combination really works for our economy.\n  Over the last 7 years on the ``produce more'' side, we have been in \nthe midst really of an energy production renaissance. This is because \nof new advances\n\n[[Page S2157]]\n\nin technology. It has dramatically changed the productivity and output \nof American energy companies.\n  I am talking about everything. I am talking about solar and wind. I \nam talking about hydro. I am certainly talking about natural gas with \nfracking. I am also talking about oil and coal. We have become the \nworld super power in energy--the world super power in energy. This is \ngood for our country. This is good for all of us as consumers. With \nlower energy costs now, it is good for the competitiveness of our \neconomy. But it is also a change. So the underlying legislation here--\nthe broad legislation--is very important because our economy and our \nenergy situation are very different than they were the last time we \nreformed energy laws.\n  That is why we need this broader legislation in my view. It does have \nsome needed changes, including bringing our permitting process up to \nspeed, our regulations up to the times, and, again, dealing with some \nof the other issues with regard to our energy sector, which has been \ntalked about this afternoon.\n  Just as it makes sense to produce more, it makes sense to use less, \nto eliminate some of the waste in our energy system, to make it more \nefficient. Production and efficiency are totally complementary. By \nimproving energy efficiency again, our jobs bill here will actually \ncreate more economic growth and create more opportunities for Ohioans.\n  The Portman-Shaheen bill will also strengthen our national security. \nWhy do I say that? Well, it makes us more energy independent. That is \ncritical. We are already doing this through some means, but if we can \nget this legislation passed, we will be doing it through better energy \nefficiency as well. The bill helps clean our environment. By some \nestimates, passing Portman-Shaheen will have an impact on our carbon \nemissions, the equivalent to taking 20 million cars off the road over \nthe next 15 years.\n  So it does have an impact in terms of dealing with the emissions \nissue. I am a really strong supporter of finding solutions that \nactually help the environment, help the economy, and help create jobs. \nWell, this is that sweet spot here. This legislation is a classic \nexample. Our bill also provides a model for how to ensure that we can \ndo it without a lot of new job-destroying mandates or regulations. \nThere are no mandates in this legislation. There are lots of incentives \nfor the private sector, but we try to make the Federal Government, in \nthis legislation, a better partner, rather than a better task master. \nAgain, I think that is the sweet spot.\n  One thing it does is it makes the Federal Government practice what it \npreaches. So it says to the Federal Government: You are the largest \nenergy user in the world. You are far from efficient. Can't we do a \nbetter job in the Federal Government by having the Federal Government \nlead by example? It does this at the State and local level by updating \nbuilding codes for government building, providing grants for \nretrofitting hospitals, youth centers, and faith-based organizations \nwith energy efficiency improvements.\n  It would get rid of some of the duplicative green building programs \nthat are at the Department of Energy, to make sure those are working \nbetter, are more consolidated. It establishes a Federal smart building \nprogram to conduct research and development on smart building \ntechnology, which was talked about by Senator Cantwell a moment ago. \nThere is a huge opportunity here because 40 percent of our energy use \nis in our buildings.\n  It would codify in statute that Federal agencies must reduce their \nenergy intensity 2.5 percent per year over the next decade. So it \ncodifies some of what is already in place as that goes forward. As I \nhave said, this bill does not impose new burdens on Americans, rather \nit creates incentives and helps small and medium-sized manufacturers to \naccess smart manufacturing technology by establishing rebates for \nupgrading electric motors and transformers, by funding career field \ntraining for students receiving a certificate for installing energy \nefficient building technologies, one of the skills gaps we have right \nnow in our economy that need to be closed for us to take advantage of \nthese new energy efficiency technologies.\n  Rather than the Federal Government telling companies what to do under \nthis bill, the Federal Government helps them to become more efficient. \nIt is not just American companies. Portman-Shaheen would help everyone. \nParticularly, it would help low-income Americans be able to retrofit \ntheir homes to be more energy efficient, which will save them money on \ntheir energy bills.\n  With the middle-class squeeze that is out there, what we see right \nnow is wages that are not just flat, but they have declined on average \nover the last several years. Expenses are up, including health care \nexpenses and including, in many cases, energy expenses, including in my \nhome State of Ohio, where we have more and more pressure on our \nelectricity costs. This will help in terms of dealing with that middle-\nclass squeeze. For people just trying to get by, a low energy bill can \nbe a real relief, and a few dollars at the end of each month can then \nbe used for a needed expenditure, for savings, maybe for investment in \na kid's college education or for retirement.\n  Finally, our bill does reauthorize the Weatherization Assistance \nProgram, which establishes building training and assessment centers at \ninstitutions of higher education around the country, which is also very \nimportant toward this efficiency of buildings.\n  The Portman-Shaheen legislation is now supported by more than 260 \nassociations, businesses, and advocacy groups, from the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers to the Sierra Club, from the Alliance to \nSave Energy to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. These are some strange \nbedfellows, I will tell you. You normally don't see these groups coming \ntogether to support legislation on the floor of the Senate. But I think \nit shows that this is a consensus win for taxpayers, for workers, and \nfor the environment.\n\n  I was really pleased to work with Senator Shaheen, Ranking Member \nCantwell, and Leader McConnell to offer a bipartisan amendment to this \nbroader bill that is supposed to clarify a Department of Energy \nefficiency standard related to external power supply drivers.\n  The existing standards are overly broad. Again, this is another \namendment we are going to be offering today, and another case where we \nare able to bring all parties to the table and negotiate a compromise \nfix to an urgent problem. I am hopeful that will soon be adopted, and \nit will provide an effective, bipartisan solution.\n  Again, I want to thank Senator Shaheen for her persistence and her \npatience with regard to our energy efficiency bill and for being a \ngreat partner from the start. This is not the precise bill that she \nwould have written or that I would have written, but it is one that \nfinds that common ground, that consensus to be able to move our country \nforward with regard to energy efficiency.\n  I also want to mention an amendment I offered with Senator Cantwell \nand Chairman Murkowski to this broader legislation that is beneficial \nto our environment and will help the National Park Service, and this is \nthe centennial legislation. As some of you know, 2016 is a big year for \nthe parks. This is the park's centennial, the 100th year. In fact, this \nweek is National Park Week. What better time is there for us to be \nadopting this amendment? The National Parks Service turns 100 years old \non August 25. We want to make sure that the National Parks Service is \nwell positioned for its next century.\n  In Ohio, 2.6 million people visit our 13 national parks sites every \nyear. So you might not think of Ohio as being a big national park \nState. It is. We are blessed to have these sites that preserve and \nprotect the national beauty of our State. We are grateful for the \nNational Parks Service and for their custodianship and their \nstewardship of treasures like the Cuyahoga Valley National Park, one of \nthe top 10 parks in the country in terms of visitation, and also of \nabout 4,000 or so Ohio sites on the National Register of Historic \nPlaces.\n  Our amendment would officially set up two funds to help the National \nPark Service be more effective going forward to help them have more \nfunds to able to address some of the challenges they face and to start, \nparticularly, to address the backlog of projects that need to be \ncompleted.\n\n[[Page S2158]]\n\n  But first it would officially authorize the National Park Centennial \nChallenge Fund, which is already leveraged with about 25 million bucks \nin appropriated dollars to an additional $45 million in private sector \nmoney--matching funds--to finance signature projects and programs of \nthe National Park System. I think this is part of our answer to our \nnational park shortfall and to the backlog, particularly the \nmaintenance backlog at the parks; that is, to get more private sector \ninterest. It is out there. This is a vehicle for that to happen.\n  The second would be a nonprofit second century endowment fund at \nNational Park Foundation to reduce the $10 billion in National Park \nService projects. This would present another opportunity to leverage \nthe willingness of the private sector to help address this backlog that \nthe National Park Service faces. It is a win-win for the taxpayer and \nfor all those who enjoy our national parks and all of our treasures.\n  Finally, it creates a new National Park Service education program to \nhelp further the educational mission of our parks. The parks are being \nwell attended right now. Attendance is up. People are excited about the \nparks. It is a great time for us to pass this centennial legislation. I \nknow there is comparable legislation on the House side. I am sure we \ncan get this to the President--to his desk for signature. We can help \nto ensure that our parks, for the next 100 years, continue to grow and \ncontinue to provide this incredible experience for all of our \nconstituents.\n  This amendment is another example of where we have come together in a \nbipartisan basis to do this. I want to thank again Senator Cantwell for \nher work on this and Senator Murkowski for putting it in this \nlegislation. Finally, I am really pleased that we were able to include \nthe Land and Conservation Fund's permanency in this legislation and \nalso the sportsmen's bill in this legislation, to expand and ensure \naccess to public lands for hunting and fishing.\n  The bottom line is that I encourage everybody to vote for this bill, \nRepublicans and Democrats alike. This is a good bill. It is a bill that \nwill drive infrastructure investments in my State of Ohio and around \nthe country. It will protect the grid from cyber and physical attacks. \nIt will allow more exports of liquefied natural gas, which is good for \nour economy.\n  It will make our Federal Government more efficient. It will make our \neconomy more efficient. It creates jobs. It helps clean up the \nenvironment. It helps modernize our government. To me, that constitutes \na victory for all of us. I congratulate Senator Cantwell and Senator \nMurkowski for getting this to the floor. I look forward to its passage \nlater on today.\n  I yield back my time, and I hope my colleague from New Hampshire will \nhave the opportunity to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I am thrilled to join my partner in \nefficiency, Senator Portman, in addressing the energy efficiency \nprovisions of the Energy Policy Modernization Act.\n  Before I get to those, I congratulate Chair Murkowski and Ranking \nMember Cantwell for everything they have done to move this Energy bill \nforward. At a time when I think most of us thought this Energy bill was \ngone for this Congress--again, for the third time--they have been able \nto rally to bring people together to get consensus to move a bill that \nnot only deals with the energy efficiency provisions that Senator \nPortman and I have championed but also improves a broad array of energy \npolicies for this country, and it would permanently reauthorize the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund. I congratulate them on giving us yet \na third opportunity--hopefully--to vote on this bill and to finally be \nable to pass it. As Senator Portman said, the third time is a charm, \nhopefully. For 5 years, he and I have worked to advance the Energy \nSavings and Industrial Competitiveness Act, or what was known initially \nas Shaheen-Portman, which has now become Portman-Shaheen in this \nCongress. Many of the provisions in that original legislation are in \nthis Energy Policy Modernization Act. While over the last 5 years we \nhave been able to get some of the original provisions in the \nlegislation through, the fact is, most of the significant provisions \nare in this current bill. I thank Senator Portman for being such a \ngreat partner on energy efficiency and for helping to advance this \nlegislation in a way that gives us another chance to hopefully vote \nsuccessfully on the bill.\n  I have been a huge fan of energy efficiency since my years as \nGovernor of New Hampshire because I believe that energy efficiency is \nthe cheapest, fastest way to reduce our energy use. Energy savings \ntechniques and technologies reduce carbon pollution. They lead to \nsubstantial energy savings that allow for businesses to expand, for us \nto create jobs, and for our economy to grow.\n  In a Congress that is too often divided along partisan lines on so \nmany issues, energy efficiency is one priority that can bring us \ntogether on a bipartisan, bicameral basis because energy efficiency is \nbeneficial to everyone, regardless of what part of the country they \nlive in and regardless of their energy source. We can all benefit from \nenergy efficiency. And those are the provisions that are in this \nlegislation.\n  I will try not to repeat too much of what has already been said by \nSenator Portman, Senator Murkowski, and Senator Cantwell about the \nbill, but I did want to go through a couple of the energy efficiency \nprovisions that are in the legislation because it reduces the barriers \nto efficiency in a number of ways.\n  First, in buildings, it would strengthen outdated, voluntary national \nmodel building codes to make new homes and commercial buildings, which \naccount for more than 40 percent of U.S. energy consumption. These \nprovisions are especially important in this legislation because much of \nthe savings in efficiency come from these national model building code \nprovisions. Again, as Senator Portman has said, these are not done \nthrough mandates, they are done through incentives, through our \nencouraging States to adopt these model building codes.\n  The energy efficiency provisions also deal with industrial \nefficiency. They assist the industrial manufacturing sector, which \nconsumes more energy than any other sector of the U.S. economy. They \nhelp that sector implement efficient production technologies and would \nencourage the private sector to develop innovative energy-efficient \ntechnologies for industrial applications, to invest in a workforce that \nis trained to deploy energy efficiency practices to manufactures.\n  Finally, the other major section of the efficiency provisions from \nPortman-Shaheen deals with the Federal Government. We encourage the \nFederal Government--which is the Nation's largest energy consumer--to \nadopt more efficient building standards, to adopt smart metering \ntechnology, and to look at our data centers and see how we can reduce \ncosts and energy use. Through doing that, not only can we save energy, \nbut we can save taxpayers millions of dollars.\n  Just the energy efficiency provisions from Portman-Shaheen in the \nlegislation would create nearly 200,000 jobs by 2030--a significant job \ncreator in the bill. It would reduce carbon emissions by the equivalent \nof taking over 20 million cars off the road, and it would save \nconsumers over $16 billion a year. There are significant benefits to \nthis energy efficiency.\n  Again, as Senator Portman has said, these are provisions that have \nbrought together a very diverse group of stakeholders, everyone from \nthe American Chemistry Council, to the National Wildlife Federation, as \nSenator Portman said, the NRDC, the National Association of \nManufacturers, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. This is a broad group \nof trade associations, labor organizations, and environmental groups \nwho have come together because energy efficiency is something on which \nwe can all agree.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a number of \nletters that have been sent by many of these organizations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S2159]]\n\n\n                                                 January 20, 2016.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Democratic Leader, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Democratic Leader Reid: \n     We are writing to express our priorities for energy \n     efficiency provisions in S. 2012, the Energy Policy \n     Modernization Act of 2015. As you know, S. 2012 was approved \n     by the U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources \n     (ENR) with strong bipartisan support on July 30, 2015, under \n     the leadership of Chairwoman Lisa Murkowski and Ranking \n     Member Maria Cantwell. We encourage the Senate to take up S. \n     2012 with the following priorities in mind to help maintain \n     bipartisan support and pass a bill that can be enacted into \n     law.\n       First, S. 2012 should preserve and strengthen the role of \n     the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) in supporting and \n     propagating updated building energy codes at the state and \n     local level. In terms of energy and cost savings, as \n     explained in more detail in the enclosed analysis prepared by \n     the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE), \n     U.S. homeowners and businesses stand to realize tremendous \n     gains from state and local adoption of current building \n     energy codes. U.S. DOE's role in code adoption is critical \n     and S. 2012 (as reported) would lead to even greater savings \n     over time. We support the building energy codes language \n     currently included in S. 2012 and encourage in the strongest \n     terms its inclusion in any comprehensive energy legislation \n     considered by the Senate.\n       Second, we encourage the Senate to adopt provisions that \n     would permit and encourage the inclusion of energy efficiency \n     in the residential mortgage underwriting process. These \n     provisions were first articulated in the Sensible Accounting \n     to Value Energy (SAVE) Act, first introduced by Senators \n     Johnny Isakson and Michael Bennett, and currently included in \n     legislation that was also favorably reported by the Senate \n     ENR Committee with strong bipartisan support. The SAVE Act \n     would allow the commonsense consideration of energy \n     efficiency during mortgage underwriting, which would help \n     homeowners realize the true value of home improvements that \n     improve comfort and generate savings. We would support an \n     amendment to add the SAVE Act provisions to S. 2012.\n       Third, we urge the Senate to approve an amendment that \n     would replace the current provisions relating to residential \n     furnace standards in S. 2012 with language that matches Sec. \n     3123 of H.R. 8, the North American Energy Security and \n     Infrastructure Act of 2015, which was approved by the House \n     of Representatives on December 3, 2015. Unfortunately, at the \n     last minute, apparently due to the time-crunch that typically \n     accompanies a committee business meeting, language was added \n     to S. 2012 that did not reflect a consensus reached by \n     stakeholders. We would support an amendment to replace the \n     current non-consensus furnace standard language in S. 2012 \n     with the House-adopted consensus language that was developed \n     over time and is broadly supported by stakeholders.\n       And fourth, we also support the retention of \n     reauthorizations of the Weatherization Assistance Program and \n     the State Energy Program in S. 2012. These provisions are \n     critical for low-income Americans in all parts of the country \n     and generate benefits across all sectors of the economy.\n       Energy efficiency is an energy resource--available to all \n     homeowners and businesses--that is essential to our country's \n     energy independence. More than half of the energy used today \n     to power our economy is wasted, which represents an enormous \n     opportunity for achieving savings and extracting gains in the \n     energy productivity of our economy. The Senate now has an \n     opportunity to pass comprehensive legislation, which \n     currently enjoys strong bipartisan support, that would \n     improve the energy efficiency of homes and commercial \n     buildings in every town, city, county, and state; help \n     consumers and businesses manage their energy consumption and \n     realize returns on their investments; and generate meaningful \n     savings for all Americans.\n           Thank you for your consideration.\n         Alliance to Save Energy, American Council for an Energy-\n           Efficient Economy, ASHRAE, Association of Energy \n           Engineers, Big Ass Solutions, Efficiency First, Energy \n           Future Coalition, Environmental and Energy Study \n           Institute, Home Performance Coalition, Institute for \n           Market Transformation, International Association of \n           Lighting Designers, International Copper Association, \n           Ltd., Large Public Power Council, National Association \n           of Energy Service Companies, North American Insulation \n           Manufacturers Association, National Association of \n           State Energy Officials, Sacramento Municipal Utility \n           District, Schneider Electric, Seattle City Light, The \n           Stella Group, Ltd., U.S. Green Building Council.\n                                  ____\n\n         NAIOP, Commercial Real Estate Development Association,\n                                    Herndon, VA, January 27, 2016.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Re support for ``The Energy Policy Modernization Act of \n         2015'' (S. 2012).\n       Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Reid: On \n     behalf of NAIOP, the Commercial Real Estate Development \n     Association, I write to express our strong support for ``The \n     Energy Policy Modernization Act of 2015'' that passed the \n     Energy and Natural Resources Committee with a bipartisan \n     vote.\n       NAIOP is the leading organization for developers, owners, \n     investors and related professionals in office, industrial, \n     retail and mixed-use real estate, and comprises 18,000 \n     members and 48 local chapters throughout the United States.\n       Specifically, we support the language that was drafted by \n     Senators Rob Portman (R-OH) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and \n     included in the energy efficiency title for buildings in the \n     bill. We have worked with staff for a number of years on this \n     issue, and we commend Senators Portman and Shaheen for \n     facilitating the numerous discussions that took place with a \n     variety of stakeholders. The latest version of this bill \n     reflects a broad compromise on a host of efficiency measures \n     that has increased support for this bipartisan legislation.\n       In order to create responsible building codes, economic \n     feasibility and initial costs need to be considered with a \n     realistic payback to the developer in order for energy \n     efficiency gains to be viable. This legislation ensures that \n     the Department of Energy will consider the recoupment of \n     investment costs when developing efficiency targets, and \n     allows for comment on those targets through a formal \n     rulemaking.\n       We are thankful for the opportunity to represent the \n     interests of the commercial real estate development industry \n     throughout this process and feel strongly that this \n     legislative approach is the best way for the federal \n     government to promote energy efficiency in the built \n     environment.\n       I respectfully urge you and your colleagues to pass this \n     important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Thomas J. Bisacquino,\n     President and CEO, NAIOP.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 January 27, 2016.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Democratic Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leaders McConnell and Reid: We the undersigned \n     businesses and trade associations are writing to express our \n     strong support for the policies included in Energy Policy \n     Modernization Act of 2015 (S. 2012) that promote energy \n     efficiency in industrial, commercial, and residential \n     applications and urge full Senate consideration early this \n     year.\n       We support low to no-cost, no-mandate bills that advance \n     energy efficiency, while preserving the critical role of \n     government oversight. American taxpayers save money on their \n     energy bills and businesses thrive when we reduce regulatory \n     burdens, increase transparency, and focus on the federal \n     government as a first mover. We believe that the energy \n     efficiency provisions in S. 2012 will have a positive impact \n     on the U.S. economy.\n       Our businesses, along with many trade associations, \n     companies and advocacy organizations, have long supported \n     common sense energy efficiency legislation, such as those \n     sponsored over the last two Congresses by Senators Portman \n     and Shaheen. We commend Chairman Murkowski and Senator \n     Cantwell for including these provisions in S. 2012. We \n     believe that the energy efficiency title of S. 2012, which \n     passed out of Committee on an 18-4 vote, is a win-win \n     approach that will reduce energy consumption, advance the \n     adoption of new technologies, produce energy savings for \n     businesses and families, and encourage private-sector job \n     creation creating a stronger and more durable American \n     economy.\n       Some of the sections we are most enthusiastic about include \n     the federal energy related provisions and the building codes \n     section, which was developed through a bipartisan, \n     transparent process and does not include state mandates. We \n     urge lawmakers to retain the current language supporting \n     strong, updated model building energy codes. Several of the \n     provisions we support have also been introduced as stand-\n     alone legislation such as S. 869, the All-of-the-Above \n     Federal Building Energy Conservation Act of 2015; S. 1046, \n     the Smart Building Acceleration Act; S. 1054, the Smart \n     Manufacturing Leadership Act; and S. 858, the Energy Savings \n     Through Public Private Partnership Act. We would further ask \n     that you include S. 1038, the Energy Star Program Integrity \n     Act and the SAVE Act, which was included in The Energy \n     Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act (S. 720) reported \n     out by the Energy and Natural Resources Committee last year, \n     and is a voluntary means to improve residential energy \n     efficiency and thereby save homeowners money.\n       We urge you to bring S. 2012 to the Senate for a vote early \n     this year. It includes pragmatic, reasonable energy policies. \n     Energy efficiency policies that enjoy strong bipartisan \n     support, do not rely on an outlay of taxpayer\n\n[[Page S2160]]\n\n     dollars, and do not impose mandates on consumers deserve \n     prompt consideration by Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n         A.O.

In closing, in a little while this afternoon, we will \nhave a series of votes on amendments to the Energy Policy Modernization \nAct, and we will have a final vote for passage of the bill. I believe \nand it is certainly my hope that the broad package will pass. I think \nit has been far too long since Congress passed a comprehensive energy \nbill. It is time for us to work together to pass this important piece \nof legislation to improve our Nation's energy policies and to help grow \nour economy.\n  I believe there is support in the other Chamber, in the House, to \ntake up this energy package and hopefully to pass it this year because \nit will improve our economy, it will improve our national security, and \nit will improve our environment. This is legislation we should all get \nbehind.\n  Again, I thank my colleague Senator Portman and applaud Senators \nCantwell and Murkowski for all of the work they have done to bring this \nlegislation to the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Madam President, I rise today to speak about this \nbipartisan energy package we are going to be voting on today. Last year \nmy colleagues and I on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee worked together to pass a package that received incredibly \nstrong and bipartisan support at a time when that is hard to come by.\n  I think it is important to start my comments today by simply thanking \nthe chair and ranking member of the Energy Committee, Senators \nMurkowski and Cantwell. As Senator Portman mentioned, they showed \nincredible leadership and also incredible patience. That patience and \npersistence on behalf of all of us is now paying off.\n  My home State of New Mexico occupies a very central and interesting \nplace in nearly every facet of our Nation's energy industry, including \nuranium enrichment, oil and gas production, refining, wind and solar \nenergy, as well as the research and development of new energy \ntechnologies--technologies of the future that come out of our National \nLaboratories and our research universities. That is why I have been \nworking so hard in the Senate to position New Mexico and our Nation to \ntake maximum advantage of new, clean energy sources and innovative \ntechnologies and transmission, while intelligently utilizing our \nreserves of traditional fuels as well.\n  This package will be the first comprehensive Energy bill to pass the \nSenate since 2007. I would like to think that it shows that we can look \nfor areas where both parties can work together even if we don't \ncompletely agree and, probably most importantly, when we don't \ncompletely agree and still move our national priorities and our energy \npolicy forward.\n  This package also includes permanent reauthorization of the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund. LWCF is one of America's most successful \nconservation programs. It has preserved our outdoor heritage, protected \nclean air and precious supplies of drinking water, and supported jobs \nacross this entire Nation. Permanent reauthorization of LWCF is a major \nvictory for conservation. I will continue to fight to fully fund LWCF \nso that we can make strong and smart investments in our public lands.\n  I wish to particularly focus my remarks today on the Bipartisan \nSportsmen's Act, which is a key part of this bill. The Sportsmen's Act \nhas been a long time in the making. I am very proud to lead this \nbipartisan effort with the Energy and Natural Resources chair, Lisa \nMurkowski of Alaska. After attempts stalled on the sportsmen's bills in \nrecent years, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee worked hard to \nfind areas of agreement. We didn't allow controversial amendments from \neither side of the aisle to derail these efforts.\n  Hunting and fishing are an integral part of our American heritage. \nWithout our public lands, that tradition would be lost to many \nwesterners. Our public lands belong to all of the American people.\n  Like many New Mexicans, some of my favorite memories with my family \nare from camping, fishing, hiking, and hunting in New Mexico's national \nforests and on our Bureau of Land Management land. I will always \nremember taking my son Carter on his first backcountry elk hunting trip \nin the Carson National Forest. The bull elk that we brought home fed \nour family for a year, but that experience of backpacking in the high \ncountry, sleeping on the ground, and hearing the elk bugle around us \nwill feed his imagination for his entire life. I look forward to having \nthat same sort of experience with his younger brother, Micah.\n  These traditions--hunting, hiking, camping, and fishing--are among \nthe pillars of western culture and a thriving outdoor industry and \nrecreation economy.\n  This bipartisan package of sportsmen's bills includes a broad array \nof measures to enhance opportunities for hunters, anglers, and outdoor \nrecreational enthusiasts of all stripes. It improves access to those \npublic lands, and it reauthorizes critical conservation programs. These \nprograms include the North American Wetlands Conservation Act, or \nNAWCA, which provides grants to organizations, State and local \ngovernments, and private landowners for the acquisition, restoration, \nand enhancement of critical wetlands for migratory birds--a program \nthat every duck hunter and birder in the United States can agree on; \nand the National Fish Habitat Conservation Program, which encourages \npartnerships among public agencies, tribes, sportsmen, private \nlandowners, and other stakeholders to promote fish conservation.\n  It reauthorizes the Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act to \ndirect revenue from the sale of public land to the acquisition of high-\npriority conservation land from willing sellers to expand fish and \nwildlife habitat and public recreational opportunities.\n  Further, this bipartisan package will help boost the outdoor \nrecreation economy writ large. Nationally, according to the Outdoor \nIndustry Association, more than 140 million Americans make their living \nor make outdoor recreation a priority in their daily lives. When they \ndo that, they end up spending $646 billion on outdoor recreation, \nresulting in quality jobs for another 6.1 million Americans.\n  In New Mexico--a small State with just 2 million people--outdoor \nrecreation generates more than $6 billion a year. It provides 68,000 \njobs and $1.7 billion in wages and salaries.\n  A survey done recently by New Mexico Game and Fish found that \nsportsmen alone spend more than $613 million a year in the State \nannually. That is an incredible contribution to our local economy. This \nboost to our economy is felt by small business owners, and it is felt \nby outfitter guides, hotels, restaurants, and the entire local \ncommunity, especially in rural areas where we need it most.\n  Yet, for far too many hunters and anglers, it gets harder and harder \neach year to find a quiet fishing hole to fish for trout or a secluded \nmeadow to chase elk. As sportsmen face more and more locked gates and \nmore ``no trespassing'' signs, it is more important than ever that we \nkeep our public lands open and welcoming to hunters and anglers. I have \nheard from sportsmen who have found roads on BLM lands closed to public \naccess without notice. I myself have experienced the frustration of \nrunning into a locked gate on roads that used to be open and even \nmaintained by public agencies.\n\n[[Page S2161]]\n\n  As opportunities for hunting and fishing shrink, we could lose the \nnext generation of hunters and anglers who will fund tens of billions \ndollars in conservation and restoration through things such as \npurchasing Duck Stamps, paying the taxes on ammunition, tackle, and \nmotorboat fuel--all of which are dedicated directly to the conservation \nof fish and wildlife.\n  This bipartisan sportsmen's package will go a long way toward solving \nmany of these problems--many of the problems that hunters and anglers \nface in accessing and using our Nation's incredible public lands. I am \nparticularly pleased that the package includes my legislation, the HUNT \nAct, which requires public land agencies such as the Forest Service and \nBLM to identify high-priority, landlocked public lands under their \nmanagement that currently lack legal public access.\n  Landlocked public lands are technically open to the public but are \nsometimes literally impossible to reach unless you own a helicopter \nbecause there are no public trails, no public roads leading to them. \nUnder the HUNT Act, Federal agencies such as the BLM and the Forest \nService are required to work with States, tribes, and willing private \nlandowners to provide public access to those landlocked areas that have \na significant potential for hunting, fishing, and other recreational \nuses.\n  A study by the Center for Western Priorities estimated that at least \nhalf a million acres of public lands in New Mexico are currently \nlandlocked with difficult legal public access. The HUNT Act is the \nfirst dedicated effort to reopen these lands to their owners. Public \nlands such as the Gila Wilderness, Valles Caldera National Preserve, \nand the Rio Grande del Norte National Monument are some of the most \nspecial places to hunt and fish on the planet. These are the places \nthat make New Mexico so enchanting and make our country so special.\n  I am incredibly excited to see that this natural resources amendment \nalso includes the establishment of two new wilderness areas within the \nRio Grande del Norte National Monument northwest of Taos, NM. New \nMexicans have a deep connection to the outdoors and benefit from the \nrecreation, wildlife, water, and tourism opportunities that wilderness \nareas provide.\n  For many years now, an incredibly broad coalition of northern New \nMexicans has worked to conserve the Rio San Antonio and Cerro del Yuta, \nor Ute Mountain, areas. What is even more special about Ute Mountain \nis, while today it is managed by the Bureau of Land Management, this is \nactually a place that the Land and Water Conservation Fund helped put \nin the public trust. I have no doubt that future generations will be \ngrateful for the many years of work and support that not only make \nthese two new wilderness areas possible but make access to special \nplaces like this possible.\n  These two roadless areas provide important security habitats for elk, \nmule deer, black bears, golden eagles, and even American pronghorn. I \nwant to say a special thanks to the local community--people who have \nworked for decades to put this proposal together--as well as to Senator \nTom Udall, my colleague from New Mexico, and former Senator Jeff \nBingaman, for their incredible leadership as well.\n  Designating these two new wilderness areas completes a national \nexample of community-driven, landscape-scale conservation that will \npreserve the culture, the natural resources, and the economy of this \nincredibly stunning piece of New Mexico.\n  I am proud to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \ntoday to make sure we are making the best use of our energy and natural \nresources. I am hopeful that, thanks to our vote today, our kids and \nour grandkids will be catching trout and chasing mule deer on our \nNation's incredible public lands for many years to come.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation. This was \nmany years in the making. It was difficult. It required an enormous \namount of compromise to get here, but it is an accomplishment worthy of \nthat effort, and I urge my colleagues to vote aye.\n  Madam President, I also wish to discuss an important component \naddressed in this bipartisan energy package: critical minerals \nretrieval from electronics and technological waste.\n  I am proud of the work accomplished in the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee and what we have achieved at this point to move \nthis bill forward. I would like to thank Senator Murkowski, along with \nSenator Wyden, for taking a lead on these issues and getting support \nfor rare earth mineral recycling adopted into the legislation.\n  This piece of the legislation provides an important solution--\nrecycling--to reducing electronics waste while ensuring our Nation has \nthe rare earth minerals to meet demand for new technologies. While the \naverage American may not have this issue on their radar, it addresses \ntwo major problems.\n  First, electronics waste is an international issue that is only \ngrowing in magnitude as consumers obtain the latest devices--from \nsmartphones to automobiles. The United Nations reported last year that \n90 percent of the world's supply of electronic waste is illegally \ntraded and dumped, imperiling lives and the environment. And more \nunfortunately, the United States generates 3.4 million tons of waste \neach year.\n  Second, rare earth minerals are crucial components of almost all of \nthe latest consumer technologies, such as hybrid cars, flat panel \ntelevisions, and wind turbines. In 2014, the United States imported at \nleast 50 percent of 43 different minerals. The overwhelming majority of \nthe rare earth reserves and production are located in China. Should a \nsupply disruption occur in China, it will be our manufacturers, \nconsumers, and everyone who depends on the latest technologies for \ntheir livelihoods who will suffer the consequences.\n  Section 3307 of the pending legislation directs the Secretary of \nEnergy to establish a program with Federal agencies, National \nLaboratories, producers, academic institutions, and other concerned \nstakeholders aimed at promoting efficient production, use, and \nrecycling of critical minerals. Section 3308 directs the Secretary of \nEnergy to put together a comprehensive analysis on rare earth mineral \nsupply and demand over multiple years, and section 3309 establishes an \nassessment for the education and training of our workforces in \nmanufacturing, development, and recycling of rare earth minerals. \nHigher education institutions would be able to apply for competitive \ngrants to help assist in this important critical mineral program work.\n  By providing support for electronics recycling, we are taking \nnecessary steps to provide economic security, while remediating an \ninternational economic and environmental problem.\n  It is important that bipartisanship does not stop with the Energy \nPolicy Modernization Act, but that we continue to support and \nincorporate technological development, create job opportunities for our \nworkers, and make our world a better one for future generations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3787 to Amendment No. 2953\n\n       (Purpose: To provide for the establishment of free market \n     enterprise zones in order to help facilitate the creation of \n     new jobs, entrepreneurial opportunities, enhanced and renewed \n     educational opportunities, and increased community \n     involvement in bankrupt or economically distressed areas.)\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 3787.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment by number.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Paul] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3787 to amendment No. 2953.\n\n  Mr. PAUL. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of April 13, 2016, under \n``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, I rise today to offer the largest, most \nsweeping anti-poverty legislation since LBJ began the War on Poverty. \nThis legislation, if passed, would return $100 billion to areas of \npoverty and high unemployment in our country--areas that have been \ndevastated by chronic unemployment and poverty. Communities like \nEastern Kentucky that have been devastated by the President's war on \ncoal would be rescued. Communities\n\n[[Page S2162]]\n\nlike Flint, MI, where the water is unsafe to drink, would be restored. \nCommunities like Ferguson, the South Side of Chicago, and the West End \nof Louisville would be given a chance to find the American dream if \nthis legislation is passed.\n  My legislation is not a gift or a grant; my legislation simply allows \n$100 billion to remain in the hands of those who earned it. My \nlegislation will provide incentive for businesses and capital to return \nto areas overwhelmed by chronic poverty and unemployment.\n  We are just past the 50-year mark on the War on Poverty. Sadly, 50 \nyears later, we are still fighting that war, and every one of our \nStates still has areas of high unemployment and poverty.\n  I think it is time we try something different: an approach that \nharnesses the ingenuity and the hard work of individuals, families, and \nbusinesses in our most afflicted communities; an approach that invites \nnew investment to these communities; an approach that is free from \ngovernment bailouts and bureaucrats picking winners and losers; an \napproach that provides hope and opportunity.\n  Economic freedom zones will be the largest anti-poverty program since \nthe War on Poverty. Economic freedom zones are areas of reduced taxes \nand reduced regulations that increase incentives for business to come \ninto these poor communities. This is about much more than a government \nstimulus or a handout. This legislation will empower communities by \nleveraging the human capital, natural resources, and business \ninvestment opportunities that already exist.\n  Reducing taxes in economically distressed areas is a stimulus that \nwill work because the money is returned to businesses and individuals \nwho have already proved they can succeed. This isn't government picking \nwhom to give the money to; this is returning the money to those who \nhave earned it and trying to get those businesses to expand.\n  Cities and counties will be designated as ``economic freedom zones'' \nif local unemployment is 50 percent above the national average or if \npoverty is 30 percent above the national average. Localities that are \nbankrupt--such as Detroit or Flint--or are in danger of bankruptcy are \nalso eligible in order to attract new investment and economic activity \nthat will help shore up the local finances without the need for a \nbailout. By slashing the Federal tax rate to 5 percent for a 10-year \nperiod, we can finally incentivize more businesses to locate in our \nstruggling communities and provide more jobs and opportunities.\n  My plan leaves the hard-earned dollars of those of the community \nright there in the community. Instead of sending your money to \nWashington and begging to get some back, we leave it in your community \nto stimulate job production and economic growth in your community. It \ndoesn't come to Washington, where politicians often pick the winners \nand losers; it stays with the community, where the consumers decide who \nsucceeds.\n  Economic freedom zones will work where Big Government has failed \nbecause the money will remain in the hands of people whom local \nconsumers have voted most able to run a business. Whereas big \ngovernment programs often send money to people who are unable to run a \nbusiness, who have no proven track record--think of Solyndra; we gave \n$500 million to people who didn't have a good business plan--economic \nfreedom zones return the money to businesses and the individuals who \nhave already proved they can run a successful business.\n  The President's big government stimulus plan was funded by debt. It \ndidn't work because government always fails to identify profitable uses \nfor capital, whereas returning capital to those who originally earned \nit will provide a stimulus that is exponentially bigger.\n  In the eastern part of Kentucky, this legislation would provide over \nhalf a billion dollars each year in much needed capital. In West \nLouisville, this legislation would provide an annual infusion of over \n$200 million. More importantly, this legislation will provide hope and \nopportunity where very little optimism currently exists.\n  For Detroit, it would mean that an extra $368 million stays in \nDetroit, in the hands of the families who earned it, and it will be \nspent locally. Businesses that have demonstrated success will be able \nto hire new employees. Businesses that move to the area and hire \nemployees will be able to take advantage of these low tax rates and \nwill be welcomed and encouraged to come to the community by the \nattraction of these low tax rates.\n  Flint--a city you see in the news every day--which is struggling even \nto keep clean water, will see an immediate cash infusion of $124 \nmillion if my bill were to pass. As business returns to Flint, as the \nlocal economy begins to grow, so too will the ability of local \ngovernment to finance their infrastructure. This legislation will help \nthe city's economy recover and its families have more of their own \nmoney to spend on their own needs. We skip the middleman. Don't send \nthe money to Washington. If you want to help poor communities in our \ncountry, leave the money there. Skip the middleman; don't send to it \nWashington.\n  Economic freedom zones will mean an extra $452 million a year left in \nBaltimore and $1.5 billion left in Chicago. These economic effects will \nbe real and will be felt immediately. Economic freedom zones will also \nprovide other reforms that set the stage for medium- and long-term \ngrowth. We will lift some of the most anti-growth regulatory burdens. \nWe will allow Federal permitting for construction projects. We will \nallow this permitting process to be streamlined so we can rebuild our \ncities.\n  Regulations that artificially drive up labor costs so public projects \ncost 20 percent, 30 percent more than private projects--we will \neliminate these rules to allow your tax dollars to go further. We will \nalso encourage foreign investment to bring jobs back to these chronic \nareas of poverty and unemployment. Outside investment into local \neducation and social services will be encouraged. To set the stage for \ncontinuous growth and opportunity for the next generation, educational \nreforms will allow parents to move their children out of failing \nschools and into the school of their choice.\n  The War on Poverty has been going on for over 50 years, and it often \nseems as though poverty is winning. They say the definition of insanity \nis trying the same thing over and over again and expecting a different \nresult. Big government programs have not cured poverty. In fact, some \nwould argue they have made it worse. Isn't it time we tried something \ndifferent?\n  Today the Senate will have a chance to try something different. Today \nthe Senate will have an opportunity to begin the rebuilding of America. \nI urge my colleagues to vote for economic freedom zones.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise to voice my support for the \npassage of the Energy Policy Modernization Act. I am pleased the Senate \nis considering and on the verge of passing legislation to update our \nNation's energy policy. I thank Chairwoman Murkowski, Ranking Member \nCantwell, and their staffs for their hard work in getting this bill to \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  The Energy Policy Modernization Act is a good bill, but it is not a \nperfect bill. It is a compromised piece of legislation, and it does \ncontain provisions I do not support, such as expediting the export of \nliquid natural gas, which I am concerned could raise domestic energy \nprices and harm steelworkers in northern Minnesota, but there are also \na number of important provisions I do support.\n  Congress has not passed a comprehensive energy bill since 2007, and a \nlot has changed in the energy sector since then. I believe \ncomprehensive energy legislation needs to promote innovation, deploy \nclean energy technology, reduce greenhouse gases, and create good-\npaying jobs. The energy efficiency title of this bill will help produce \nelectricity use, save consumers money, and increase our competitiveness \nthrough commonsense measures such as updating building codes. The bill \npermanently reauthorizes the Land and Water Conservation Fund to ensure \nthat we preserve our natural resources for generations to come. It also \ninvests billions of dollars in science and innovation through the\n\n[[Page S2163]]\n\nreauthorization of ARPA-E and the DOE Office of Science. These are the \ntypes of investments we will need to transform our energy system, an \nenergy system that has been powered by dirty fossil fuels but is \nincreasingly powered by clean, renewable technologies.\n  This bill also includes a provision I authored with Ranking Member \nCantwell to invest $50 million per year in energy storage research and \ndevelopment. Energy storage will pay a crucial role in helping unlock \nsubstantial new renewable energy resources. As you know, the Sun shines \nduring the day and the wind blows more at night. Balancing these \nintermittent resources can be a challenge for energy providers, and \nthis is where I see storage playing a critical role in ensuring that \nour electricity generation meets our demand. While storage technology \nhas been around for a long time, we need the next generation of \ntechnologies for cost-effective implementation at the grid scale. This \ninvestment will spur innovation at universities and in the private \nsector to help get us where we need to be.\n  Investing in energy storage will also position the United States to \nlead in exporting these technologies to power-hungry countries around \nthe world. Take India, for example. India's goal is to deploy 100 \ngigawatts of new solar power by 2022--a truly impressive target. As \nIndia and other countries build economies based on renewable energy, \nthey will need storage technologies to turn intermittent solar energy \ninto baseload power. I want America to develop and manufacture these \nstorage technologies which will create jobs and lower emissions at the \nsame time.\n  Energy storage also has the benefit of making our grid more \nresilient. According to the Department of Energy's 2015 Quadrennial \nEnergy Review, weather was responsible for half of the reported grid \noutages between 2011 and 2014 when customers went without power, and \nwith the climate changing, it is essential we minimize the impact of \nweather-related grid outages on American households and businesses. \nAdditional storage capacity will do just that--improving resilience to \nall types of grid disruption and allowing us to keep the lights on.\n  I also worked on a provision in this bill to reauthorize the DOE \nOffice of Indian Energy. This office provides education, training, \ntechnical assistance, and grants to American Indian tribes and Alaska \nNative villages that are looking to develop energy projects. Since \n2002, this office has provided $50 million for almost 200 renewable \nenergy and energy-efficiency projects in Indian Country. We want to \nbuild on this momentum and continue this successful program. I am \npleased we have extended the authorization of this office for another \n10 years.\n  This Friday more than 100 nations will come together in New York to \nsign the Paris Agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat \nclimate change. While commitments to reducing emissions are important, \nthey must be followed by real action to reduce our carbon footprint. \nThe Energy bill we are debating takes an important step forward in \ndoing just that, but of course we cannot stop here. Climate change is \nan existential threat to our planet and future generations. As a \ncountry, we must continue to expand clean energy and reduce greenhouse \ngases. I hope we can continue to build on the bipartisan work we did \nwith this bill to do just that.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3312 to Amendment No. 2953\n\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, first I wish to thank and congratulate \nChairman Lisa Murkowski and Ranking Member Maria Cantwell for all their \nhard work and leadership on this Energy bill. They have done a very \ngood job of getting this bill to the floor, and we now find ourselves \nin the position to offer amendments, which I am here to do. I think all \nof us are very happy to be able to be moving this legislation along and \namending it.\n  My amendment is a very simple study amendment. It directs the \nSecretary of the Treasury to study and submit a report to Congress on \npotential clean energy victory bonds. This amendment is pro-clean \nenergy. It changes no rules, it does not mandate any actual bonds, and \nbeing a study it does not score or impact the budget.\n  Citizens across this country want to see a cleaner energy future. \nThey are doing their part to conserve energy, purchase cleaner energy, \nand invest in clean energy mutual funds. They are doing this on a \nvoluntary basis. It is having a big impact and pushing clean energy \ntechnologies forward in a rather dramatic way, but we also understand \nour energy challenges are broad and require large-scale investments by \nmany investors.\n  We can harness and keep it voluntary without any cost to taxpayers \nthrough clean energy victory bonds. The Federal Government is our \nNation's largest energy consumer, with more than 350,000 buildings and \n600,000 road vehicles. Think about your own electricity bill that you \npay each month and the gas you buy at the pump. The U.S. Government has \nto pay such bills as well to the tune of over $20 billion each year. \nMost of that, about two-thirds, is for petroleum.\n  The Federal Government wants to cut its bills too. We invest in clean \nenergy through energy efficiency upgrades and through power purchase \nagreements for cleaner energy and stable, predictable energy prices. \nThe government has a choice about these options just as private \ncitizens do. Private citizens can choose the types of energy they \npurchase for their homes and their businesses, and many opt for wind \npower, solar power, or other clean energy sources, or they install \nenergy-efficient windows and appliances. Many tell me they want to help \nour government make these choices as well. Clean energy victory bonds \ncould help us move in that direction. By purchasing a Treasury bond \nspecifically devoted to clean energy, Americans can help the government \nsupplement its energy purchases with energy efficiency upgrades and \nclean energy decisions. These investments could provide additional \nsupport to existing Federal financing programs already available to \nStates for energy efficiency upgrades and clean energy. What is \nexciting about this option is that smart investments can help pay for \nthemselves and bring a return on investment to people who purchase \nthese bonds. That is why we think it is so important to study this \noption. It is a simple financial instrument that is a win for people \nsaving money and a win for reducing the government's energy bill and it \nis all on a voluntary basis.\n  During the First and Second World Wars, our country faced threats we \nhad never faced before. We rose to the challenge and gave it everything \nwe had. Everyone contributed, and for many that included investing in \nvictory bonds. They helped pay for the cost of the war--$185 billion. \nThat would be over $2 trillion today. Folks lined up to buy those \nbonds. That is the spirit of the American people--to pull together. It \nwas true then and it is still true today.\n  We face a very different challenge today. Our energy challenges are \nseen on multiple fronts, from the impacts to our environment to our \nglobal and international struggles based on our dependence on foreign \noil. Citizens want to unite and contribute. They want investments in \nhomegrown American clean energy. Many cannot afford to buy solar panels \nfor their own homes or invest $1,000 minimums to buy clean energy \nmutual funds, but many can afford $25 for a clean energy victory bond.\n  This amendment asks the Secretary of the Treasury to help inform \nCongress on the feasibility and structure of developing such a tool. It \nhas broad support from groups such as the American Sustainable Business \nCouncil, Green America, the American Wind Energy Association, Ceres, \nthe Union of Concerned Scientists, and many other groups. It has broad \nsupport out there.\n  Mr. President, I ask to call up my amendment No. 3312 and ask that it \nbe reported by number.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment by number.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Udall] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3312 to amendment No. 2953.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require the Secretary of the Treasury to develop a plan \n              for issuance of Clean Energy Victory Bonds)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n[[Page S2164]]\n\n  \n\n\n     SEC. ___. CLEAN ENERGY VICTORY BONDS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than July 1, 2016, the Secretary \n     of the Treasury, in coordination with the Secretary of Energy \n     and the Secretary of Defense, shall submit a report to \n     Congress that provides recommendations for the establishment, \n     issuance, and promotion of Clean Energy Victory Bonds by the \n     Department of the Treasury (referred to in this section as \n     the ``Clean Energy Victory Bonds Program'').\n       (b) Requirements.--For purposes of subsection (a), the \n     Clean Energy Victory Bonds Program shall be designed to--\n       (1) ensure that any available proceeds from the issuance of \n     Clean Energy Victory Bonds are used to finance clean energy \n     projects (as defined in subsection (c)) at the Federal, \n     State, and local level, which may include--\n       (A) providing additional support to existing Federal \n     financing programs available to States for energy efficiency \n     upgrades and clean energy deployment, and\n       (B) providing funding for clean energy investments by the \n     Department of Defense and other Federal agencies,\n       (2) provide for payment of interest to persons holding \n     Clean Energy Victory Bonds through such methods as are \n     determined appropriate by the Secretary of the Treasury, \n     including amounts--\n       (A) recaptured from savings achieved through reduced energy \n     spending by entities receiving any funding or financial \n     assistance described in paragraph (1), and\n       (B) collected as interest on loans financed or guaranteed \n     under the Clean Energy Victory Bonds Program,\n       (3) issue bonds in denominations of not less than $25 or \n     such amount as is determined appropriate by the Secretary of \n     the Treasury to make them generally accessible to the public, \n     and\n       (4) collect not more than $50,000,000,000 in revenue from \n     the issuance of Clean Energy Victory Bonds for purposes of \n     financing clean energy projects described in paragraph (1).\n       (c) Clean Energy Project.--The term ``clean energy \n     project'' means a project which provides--\n       (1) performance-based energy efficiency improvements, or\n       (2) clean energy improvements, including--\n       (A) electricity generated from solar, wind, geothermal, \n     hydropower, and hydrokinetic energy sources,\n       (B) fuel cells using non-fossil fuel sources,\n       (C) advanced batteries,\n       (D) next generation biofuels from non-food feedstocks, and\n       (E) electric vehicle infrastructure.\n  Mr. UDALL. I thank the Presiding Officer and will yield the floor. I \nknow Senators Bennet and Isakson are here. They are both great leaders \nwhen it comes to clean energy and working on this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Udall amendment No. 3312.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3202 to Amendment No. 2953\n\n       (Purpose: To improve the accuracy of mortgage underwriting \n     used by the Federal Housing Administration by ensuring that \n     energy costs are included in the underwriting process, to \n     reduce the amount of energy consumed by homes, to facilitate \n     the creation of energy efficiency retrofit and construction \n     jobs, and for other purposes.)\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask to call up the Isakson-Bennet \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment by number.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Isakson] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3202 to amendment No. 2953.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of February 2, 2016, under \n``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I am delighted to rise in favor of the \nIsakson-Bennet amendment, the SAVE Act, and glad to acknowledge my hard \nwork with Michael Bennet, who has been a great partner in this effort.\n  I particularly want to acknowledge the patience of Senators Cantwell \nand Murkowski in allowing this bill and amendment to come forward. They \nhave exemplified the type of patience that is necessary to do \nlegislative work and do it well.\n  Very simply, this bill allows the Federal Housing Administration, in \nthe underwriting of a mortgage loan for a family applying for that \nloan, to consider in the value of the appraisal, the enhanced over-\nminimum standards that are put in for insulation and the enhanced over-\nminimum standard savings that come to the consumer from those energy \nstandards being put in. So the borrower gets credit as if it is income \nfrom the savings that comes from putting in the insulation for the \nhigher standards. The value of the property is enhanced in order for \nthe borrower to be able to pay for the enhancements, and they are \npermanent. It is a win-win-win proposition.\n  Why are we doing this? It already worked in the United States. It \nworked in the 1980s when the savings and loan industry made most of the \nmortgage loans. In Georgia, we had a program called Good Sense Housing. \nIf you put in enhanced energy savings, you were given credit toward \nqualification on your loan. When we put them in, we had better thermal \nwindowpanes, better results, and less consumption.\n  This a good amendment that allows consumers to get what they want and \nallows Americans to enjoy more energy-efficient housing.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from Georgia \nfor his tireless work on this bill. We have been at it now for 3 years, \nand here we are on the floor close to passing it. There is not a \nSenator in this body who possesses the knowledge that Senator Isakson \ndoes about real estate and how it works in the United States. It has \nbeen a real privilege to work with him on the bill.\n  I also wish to thank the chairwoman and the ranking member of the \ncommittee for their fine work on this bill.\n  It is time to enact this commonsense bill, the SAFE Act, as it is \ncalled. It is supported by groups all across the political spectrum, \nincluding the Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of \nManufacturers, the Sierra Club, and the Natural Resources Defense \nCouncil.\n  Our amendment, as Senator Isakson said, would allow for a home's \nenergy efficiency to be considered when a borrower applies for a loan. \nSo when you apply for a mortgage, you can request an energy audit, and \nif you have a loan backed by the Federal Housing Administration, the \nenergy efficiency of your new home and your future energy bills will be \ntaken into account by your mortgage lender. Why is that important? \nWell, today, even though homeowners spend more money on energy than \nthey do on taxes or buying home insurance, energy costs are not taken \ninto account. And when they are taken into account, as a consequence of \nthis bill, the savings derived from that energy efficiency can then be \napplied to paying your mortgage.\n  I want to be clear--and Senator Isakson said this--this amendment is \nnot a mandate. It simply sets up a voluntary program.\n  It will create thousands of jobs in manufacturing and construction. \nBy 2040, the estimates are that it will save consumers $1.2 billion in \nenergy costs and save enough energy to power 100,000 homes every year.\n  I have heard from builders all across Colorado who support this \namendment--people like Gene Myers, CEO and founder of Thrive Home \nBuilders in Denver. He has built more than 1,000 energy-efficient \nhomes, but he understands that we won't fully attain the benefits of \nefficiency in the market until we properly value it.\n  For these reasons, a large and diverse coalition supports this \namendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment to improve \nenergy efficiency, save money, and create American jobs.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I thank Senator Bennet for his support, \nand I urge each Member of the Senate today to vote favorably for the \nSAVE Act and favorably for the end legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today we will take steps to secure our \nMontana heritage and ``Made in Montana'' jobs. We will stand up for the \nMontana way of life.\n  Today we will pass a bill that for the first time would permanently \nreauthorize the Land and Water Conservation\n\n[[Page S2165]]\n\nFund, an important piece of legislation ensuring that Montanans have \naccess to public lands.\n  As a fifth generation Montanan and avid sportsman, I recognize how \nvaluable public lands are and the importance of ensuring access for \ngenerations to come. In fact, during the summer recesses, when many \nSenators are traveling around the world, there is no better place that \nI like to be than the back country of Montana, like I was last summer \nwith my wife, my son, and our dog Ruby in the Beartooth Wilderness. In \nMontana and throughout the country, the Land and Water Conservation \nFund plays a critical role in achieving the goal of increased access \nand by helping to preserve and protect Montanans' opportunities to \nenjoy hunting, fishing, and other outdoor recreation.\n  LWCF keeps lands, like family ranches, in the family and working. It \nkeeps forests in productive use through the Forest Legacy Program, such \nas in the Haskill Basin, where my good friend Chuck Roady of Stoltze \nLand and Lumber works. Today will be a victory for them--like Eric \nGrove of Great Divide Cyclery in Helena, MT, who has built his mountain \nbike business around the South Hills Trail System outside of Helena, \nfacilitated by LWCF.\n  There are many other small businesses like Eric's in Montana that \ndepend on our thriving outdoor economy.\n  This bill will also streamline the permitting for the export of \nliquefied natural gas, allowing more American energy to power the \nworld.\n  Montana is the fifth largest producer of hydropower in the Nation, \nand we have 23 hydroelectric dams. This bill strengthens our Nation's \nhydropower development by defining hydro as a renewable fuel. Only in \nWashington, DC, would hydro not be defined as a renewable source of \nenergy. I am glad to see we will get that cleared up with this bill \ntoday. This is great news for Montana, and it is well overdue.\n  This energy bill will establish a pilot project to streamline \ndrilling permits if less than 25 percent of the minerals within the \nspacing unit are Federal minerals. That is of particular importance to \nMontana, given the patchwork of land and mineral ownership in the \nBakken.\n  This bill will improve Federal permitting of critical and strategic \nmineral production, which supports thousands of good-paying Montana \njobs and is essential to our national security and international \ncompetitiveness. The absence of just one critical mineral or metal \ncould disrupt entire technologies, entire industries, and create a \nripple effect throughout our entire economy.\n  For example, Stillwater mines in Montana is one of the only sources \nof palladium and platinum in the world. Currently, the United States \nhas one of the longest and most arduous permitting processes for \ncritical minerals in the world. This bill helps address those concerns.\n  Metal and nonmetal mining also has directly created more than 16,000 \ngood-paying Montana jobs. In fact, mining overall helps support more \nthan 22,000 jobs across Montana.\n  In Montana, energy supports thousands of good-paying jobs for union \nworkers, for tribal members. Access to our State's one-of-a-kind public \nlands is critical to our State's tourism economy and our way of life. \nWe in Montana say we work, but we also like to play, striking the right \nbalance towards responsible natural resource development as well as \nprotecting our public lands.\n  With today's passage of the energy bill, we will help unleash \nMontana's and our country's energy potential and uphold our country's \ncommitment to conservation.\n  I urge adoption of the bill and commend Chairman Murkowski for her \nleadership.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3210 to Amendment No. 2953\n\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 3210 and ask \nthat it be reported by number.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment by number.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Lankford] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3210 to amendment No. 2953.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To add provisions relating to acquisition of Federal land \n              under the Land and Water Conservation Fund)\n\n       On page 426, after line 23, add the following:\n       (e) Certain Land Acquisition Requirements.--Section 200306 \n     of title 54, United States Code (as amended by subsection \n     (d)), is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(e) Non-road Deferred Maintenance Backlog.--If the non-\n     road deferred maintenance backlog on Federal land is greater \n     than $1,000,000,000, acquisitions of land under this section \n     may not exceed the level of deferred maintenance backlog \n     funding.\n       ``(f) Maintenance Needs.--In making an acquisition of land \n     under this section, funds appropriated for the acquisition \n     shall include any funds necessary to address maintenance \n     needs at the time of acquisition on the acquired land.\n       ``(g) Congressional Approval of Certain Land \n     Acquisitions.--For any acquisition of land under this section \n     for which the cost of the land is greater than $50,000 per \n     acre--\n       ``(1) before acquiring the land, the Secretary shall submit \n     to Congress a report that describes the land proposed to be \n     acquired; and\n       ``(2) no acquisition may be made unless the proposed \n     acquisition is--\n       ``(A) reported to Congress in accordance with paragraph \n     (1); and\n       ``(B) approved by the enactment of a bill or joint \n     resolution.''.\n\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, there are a lot of good things in this \nbill that we are discussing. There are a lot of good amendments that \nhave been brought to the floor.\n  There has been an awful lot of conversation over the past year about \na program called the Land and Water Conservation Fund. It is a \nstraightforward program that has been around for a long time. It takes \nmoney from revenue from offshore oil drilling and it uses that money to \npurchase land, usually next to a national park or in other areas, and \nthat becomes Federal land.\n  The problem is that over the decades we have continued to accumulate \nmore money in the Land and Water Conservation Fund and we have \ncontinued to accumulate more land onto the Federal roll but we are not \ntaking care of what we have.\n  The issue with this particular version of the Land and Water \nConservation Fund is that it is not a short-term extension the way it \nhas always been in the past; it is a permanent program put in place--\npermanent meaning there are no changes. So permanently we put in a \nstructure that continues to purchase Federal lands without maintaining \nthose lands. We all know it. We all see it.\n  Year after year, everyone has said we should add more to maintenance, \nbut year after year we just buy more land using the Land and Water \nConservation Fund and never use other budget funds for maintenance \nbecause, quite frankly, there are a lot of other vital Federal issues \nthat need to be paid for.\n  The simple solution to this is to take the money from the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund and make sure that one simple thing is done: \nthat when we purchase land, we also maintain that land with that \nfunding. We also take care of the backlog.\n  This amendment is very straightforward: We use 50 percent to purchase \nland and 50 percent to maintain the land until we at least get down to \na $1 billion backlog, and then we can reconsider. A $1 billion backlog \nis the goal. In some ways, this has become controversial. I can't \nbelieve it would be controversial to say: Let's try to work our Nation \ndown to only a $1 billion backlog in our maintenance for all our \nFederal facilities.\n  We have record attendance at our national parks. They are beautiful \nnational treasures, but if we can't maintain them, then we reinforce \nwhat is already true: that the Federal Government is the largest \nlandowner, largest land controller, and the worst landowner in the \ncountry. Federal lands are maintained the least of any other large \nholder of land. Let's fix it.\n  This doesn't take away the Land and Water Conservation Fund; this \nmakes sure we take care of what we have. When we purchase land and \nbring it in, we make sure we also set aside money to fix it. Frankly, \nit is straightforward.\n\n[[Page S2166]]\n\n  Today my daughter turns 16 years old. She will at some point get a \nused car. I am sure it will be a doozy--we are thinking somewhere \naround a 1978 Volvo. Nice and tough. Indestructible. At some point she \nwill end up with a used car, but the requirement is that she has to be \na part of the purchase of it. When we buy that car, we will not use \neverything in our savings account, nor will we allow her to use all of \nher savings account. She has to have enough money to be able to put gas \nin it and maintain it when it breaks down because it is a car and it \nwill break down. This change in the Land and Water Conservation Fund is \nas simple as that. Whenever we put new land in the inventory, we make \nsure we have money set aside to make sure we can actually take care of \nit. Why have a car if you can't put gas in it? Why continue to add land \nyear after year if we are not going to maintain it? That is not good \nstewardship of our resources; that is bad stewardship of our resources.\n  This amendment says that before we make this program permanent, let's \nfix the structure of this program to make sure we are also watching out \nfor the program long term as well.\n  One other quick note. Some of the land that has been purchased has \nbeen purchased for very high amounts, such as $1-million-per-acre types \nof amounts. This amendment puts a simple block in it that says: Before \nthere is a purchase of land for more than $50,000 an acre, run that \nthrough Congress to make sure someone has had a second look at that. It \nis a straightforward provision to make sure the Federal taxpayer is not \npaying more than they should per acre for land in the Federal \ninventory.\n  I would urge the adoption of this amendment. This doesn't kill the \nprogram; it enhances the program. It allows us to take better care of \nour Federal land and to engage with that.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, before we go to the votes that have been \nscheduled on this bill, I wanted to take a few more minutes. I \nmentioned some of our colleagues from the Energy Committee and some of \ntheir contributions, but I wanted to mention a couple of other \nprovisions that are in this underlying bill and to thank our colleagues \nfor their hard work, Senator Wyden particularly for his focus on \nrenewable energy technologies, such as marine and hydrokinetic and \ngeothermal. These are important provisions because they are going to \nhelp us gain a foothold in very important areas of this development. I \nthank him for his contribution.\n  I mentioned energy storage earlier, and in committee our colleagues \ndealt with this a lot, but Senators Franken, Heinrich, Hirono, and King \nall made significant contributions on the modernization of the grid and \ngrid storage, as my colleague from Alaska knows, on how to plan for \nmicrogrid activity--and Senator Hirono, because she has a very unique \nState that she represents, Hawaii. Having an integration of those \nactivities into the grid is very important. I thank them for their \ncontributions on making our electricity grid more distributed and \nintegrating in some of the renewable energies and making sure that our \ngrid has the flexibility to do that.\n  Senator King has certainly worked hard to ensure that distributed \ngeneration gets a fair shake in the marketplace and to make sure that \nconsumers are treated fairly. This is a subject our committee will \ncontinue to work on. I am sure we are going to hear about it. For those \nindividual homeowners who are making investments in solar energy, we \nwant to make sure they are not unfairly treated by their own utilities \nin how that solar development plays out. They don't want to be \novercharged for the development of solar, if they want to put solar on \ntheir homes. They are willing to be part of the solution; they don't \nwant to be the funder of the whole solution. I think Senator King is \nrightly concerned about how distributed generation gets a fair shake.\n  I thank Senator Franken. He was out here on the floor, and he was a \nkey proponent of the Department of Energy science and investment in the \nareas of energy storage and generation, and he has been a very strong \nvoice on why storage is so important. And as I mentioned, Washington \nbeing a hydro State and having a variety of renewable energies, having \nstorage capability is very important for us in the Pacific Northwest.\n  Senator Franken is also a very strong voice in how energy programs \nare going to work in the tribal areas of our country. I thank him for \nthat.\n  I also thank Senator Manchin for working with Senator Heinrich and \nSenator Murkowski on the bipartisan sportsmen's package that is \nincluded in this bill, which is something that the Senate--well, let's \njust say that we had a lot of discussion about the sportsmen's bill \nover many Congresses, so the fact that we are actually passing a \ncomprehensive sportsmen's package is a great testament to the work of \nour committee and the work of the Senate in a bipartisan fashion.\n  I thank Senator Warren for her focus on transparency in energy \ncommodity markets and ensuring that consumers' interests are there, \nparticularly when it comes to global natural gas markets, and making \nsure we are well informed about what is happening in the marketplace. \nThese are all important because we want to have enough transparency \nthat the consumers and the government know what is happening and that \nwe never run into the kind of situation we did before with the \nmanipulation of markets because of very tight markets and people taking \nadvantage of that.\n  I appreciate all of the committee members on our side of the aisle \nand their contributions, and I certainly appreciate working on these \nissues with the chair of the committee and many members.\n  I thank Senator Stabenow and Senator Peters. I know we tried for many \nweeks to work on a solution to the Flint issue. The chair, Senator \nMurkowski, was very efficient in trying to marshal the discussions on \nher side of the aisle about how to get a resolution to this issue. I \nthank her for that. I know our colleagues, Senators Stabenow and \nPeters, will continue to work on finding solutions to this, so I thank \nthem for that, and I thank them for their leadership on manufacturing \nand vehicle technology as well.\n  Again, I know we are going to start voting, but I can't emphasize \nenough how much material is in the underlying bill, the amendments we \ncleared earlier by voice vote, and the amendments we are going to vote \non. This is a lot of work, and I want to again thank the staff for \ncontinuing to process a lot of ideas about energy policies, land \nconservation policies, and workforce and energy issues for the future \nbecause all of these are vital policies for us--modernizing our energy \ninfrastructure and making sure we continue to protect consumers and \nbusinesses and making sure we are going to be competitive in the \nfuture.\n  I again thank the chair for her leadership on this issue and look \nforward to processing the rest of these amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as my colleague on the committee \npointed out, many individuals have made great effort and have made very \npositive contributions toward where we are today with this Energy bill. \nI wanted to note very quickly some of the groups who have weighed in \nthroughout the process as we have sought input in different sectors \nacross the energy space and really across the broader economy for some \nof the ideas in efficiency, supply, infrastructure, and accountability. \nWhen we look at the list of those organizations from around the country \nin different areas, I have a seven-page, single-spaced list in very \nsmall type of those who have weighed in in support of the measures we \nhave in front of us today. From my State, it is everyone from the \nDepartment of Natural Resources, to the Alaska Power Association, the \nBristol Bay Native Corporation, the Cordova Electric Co-op, and a whole \nbunch more.\n  At the national level, we have support from the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, the American Chemistry Council, the National Electric \nManufacturers Association, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers--\nand I am picking randomly.\n  We have support from labor groups--North America's Building Trades \nUnion, the United Auto Workers, the\n\n[[Page S2167]]\n\nUnited Brotherhood of Carpenters--who all weighed in with support for \nideas that are included.\n  We have a huge coalition--from the Alliance to Save Energy, to \nSeattle City Light--that have focused on the work we have done with \nefficiency.\n  When we think about those who are focused on keeping the lights on, \nkeeping fuel affordable, those who produce the materials that make \nmodern life possible, groups such as the National Hydropower \nAssociation, the American Petroleum Institute, the National Mining \nAssociation, the American Exploration & Mining Association, the \nBusiness Council for Sustainable Energy, the American Public Power \nAssociation, and Edison Electric Institute--there is a long list of \nthose who have weighed in in support. It is all over the board--the \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship Council, the American Society of \nInterior Designers, the Nebraska Public Power District. The list is \ncomprehensive and notable.\n  I want to be clear, not all in these groups agree with all aspects of \nthe bill that we have in front of us. Those who support our work to \nstreamline LNG exports might not necessarily be supportive of what we \nare trying to do to clean up the United States Code. But I think it is \nfair to say that to craft a bill that 100 percent of everybody likes is \njust not going to happen.\n  What we have in front of us today and what the Senate will now \ncommence voting on is a bipartisan product that has gone through an \nextraordinary process in the past year, has been collaboratively built, \nand is an effort to modernize our energy policies in a smart way that \nuses common sense. It is not the government telling us what we shall \ndo; it is doing it for the right reasons.\n  With that, Mr. President, we have come to the end of our 2 hours of \ndebate, so we will commence with our series of rollcall votes that have \npreviously been agreed to.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 3234, as Modified, to Amendment No. 2953\n\n  Mr. President, at this time, I call up my amendment No. 3234.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment by number.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Ms. Murkowski] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3234, as modified, to amendment No. 2953.\n\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To add certain provisions relating to natural resources)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n                      TITLE VI--NATURAL RESOURCES\n\n            Subtitle A--Land Conveyances and Related Matters\n\n     SEC. 6001.

Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that there \nbe 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to each vote in this \nseries.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The amendment I have called up is an amendment Senator Cantwell and I \nhave been working on. It is what we are dubbing our ``Natural \nResources'' title. There are 30 different provisions--15 from the \nRepublican side, 15 from the Democratic side. Nearly all of them have \nbeen reported from the committee. They have strong bipartisan support. \nIt is a balanced collection of land and water bills.\n  We have included the sportsmen's bill, which we have heard talk of \nhere on the floor, as it was reported from the committee with some \nadditional provisions that came out of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. It includes our open and less closed provisions to make sure \nour public lands and our national forests are accessible for hunting, \nfishing, and recreational shooting. We have included several land \ntransactions involving the land management agencies, including some \nconveyances to correct Federal survey errors and to adjust boundaries. \nWe have provisions to get more renewable hydropower online and keep \nexisting projects operating in at least five different States. We also \nprotect some treasured landscapes and rivers. We reroute a national \nscenic trail, and we authorize the National Park Service to study three \nsites to determine their national significance. So, again, it is a \nbroad package, a package that is balanced, and a package that continues \nto add to the good in the overall Energy bill.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, if I may add to my colleague's comments, \nthis underlying bill supports the Yakima River Basin bill, which is an \nintegrated approach to addressing water management needs for farmers, \nfamilies, and fish. It will help restore the ecosystem, ensure that \ncommunities have access to water, and conserve and provide water for \nfarmers in times of drought. It is not only important to the future of \nour State, it is also a model for how water management should be done \nin the 21st century.\n  This legislation also includes water provisions for Senators \nFeinstein, Flake, Merkley, and Wyden, as the chairwoman said, Murkowski \nherself, and several of our other colleagues--Merkley, Burr, \nGillibrand, and Kaine.\n  Support this legislation.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the votes \nfollowing the first vote in this series be 10 minutes in length.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. If there is no further debate, I ask for the yeas and \nnays on amendment No. 3234.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Yes, all time on the Republican side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, all time is yielded back.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment, as modified.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate, equally \ndivided, prior to a vote on amendment No. 3202, offered by the Senator \nfrom Georgia, Mr. Isakson.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I just want all Members of the Senate \nto consider this amendment favorably.\n  It is an amendment that allows for consideration, in the \nqualification of the underwriting of a loan for the purchase of a \nsingle-family dwelling, of those enhanced standards for energy \nefficiency to go in over and above the minimum standard. It is \npermissive, and it is FHA only.\n  I appreciate every Member's vote.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, this amendment offered by my friend from \nGeorgia sounds good, but let's examine it for a little while.\n  This amendment is opposed by the scholars of the Heritage Foundation, \nthe Cato Institute, the American Action Forum, the American Enterprise \nInstitute, and the Competitive Enterprise Institute.\n  As we all know, the mortgage underwriting process is about evaluating \na borrower's ability to afford a mortgage, and history tells us that if \nwe play around with it, it does not end well when we forget this.\n  This amendment would weaken FHA's underwriting standards, leading to \ngreater safety and perhaps soundness concerns for FHA's portfolio, \nwhich received a $1.7 billion bailout in 2013. It would require that \nappraisals be inflated to account for the value of energy efficiency \nupgrades as determined by HUD.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. It would also project energy savings and inflated \nborrowers' income for debt-to-income valuation.\n  I think it would be dangerous for FHA loans. We don't need it. FHA \nalready has an FHA energy-efficient program, and according to HUD, \nFHA's energy-efficient program helps families save money on their \nutility bills by enabling them to finance energy-efficient improvements \nwith their FHA insurance mortgage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia has 30 seconds.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I don't know who wrote what my friend\n\n[[Page S2188]]\n\nfrom Alabama is reading, but the truth and the fact is that this is a \nrecommendation that allows the installation of more energy efficiency \nand the funding of that in terms of housing. Homebuilders have endorsed \nit. Most energy efficiency organizations have endorsed it. It is good \npractice. It is good procedure. It is not ruining underwriting in any \nway whatsoever. It is good for America. It is good for energy \nefficiency. It is good for the housing industry.\n  I would appreciate the vote of each and every Member.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate, equally \ndivided, prior to a vote on amendment No. 3175, to be offered by the \nSenator from North Carolina, Mr. Burr.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I rise to speak on my amendment very \nbriefly. Many of my colleagues may have seen these wild horses on a \nvacation to the Outer Banks or maybe you viewed the movie ``Nights in \nRodanthe.'' These horses have been there for over 200 years. What we \nare doing is we are injecting some new genetics so this herd is \nsustainable for another 200 years.\n  Let me tell my colleagues that they have never been managed by the \nFish & Wildlife Service. The Fish & Wildlife Service doesn't want to \nmanage them. They are managed by a private nonprofit that goes to great \nlengths and expense to make sure that this herd survives.\n  With that, I yield the floor. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, is all time yielded back?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a minute left in opposition and 12 \nseconds remaining to the Senator from North Carolina.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, if there is no further discussion on \nthis amendment, I call up the Burr amendment No. 3175 and ask unanimous \nconsent that it be modified with the changes at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment, as modified, by number.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Ms. Murkowski], for Mr. Burr, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3175, as modified, to \n     amendment No. 2953.\n\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To ensure that the Secretary of the Interior collaborates \n fully with State and local authorities and certain nonprofit entities \n     in managing the Corolla Wild Horse population on Federal land)\n\n       At the end of subtitle E of title IV, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 4___. WILD HORSES IN AND AROUND THE CURRITUCK NATIONAL \n                   WILDLIFE REFUGE.\n\n       (a) Genetic Diversity.--The Secretary of the Interior \n     (referred to in this section as the ``Secretary''), in \n     consultation with the North Carolina Department of \n     Environment and Natural Resources, Currituck County, North \n     Carolina, and the Corolla Wild Horse Fund, shall allow for \n     the introduction of a small number of free-roaming wild \n     horses from the Cape Lookout National Seashore as necessary \n     to ensure the genetic diversity and viability of the wild \n     horse population currently found in and around the Currituck \n     National Wildlife Refuge, consistent with--\n       (1) the laws (including regulations) applicable to the \n     Currituck National Wildlife Refuge and the Cape Lookout \n     National Seashore; and\n       (2) the December 2014 Wild Horse Management Agreement \n     approved by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the \n     North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural \n     Resources, Currituck County, North Carolina, and the Corolla \n     Wild Horse Fund.\n       (b) Agreement.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary may enter into an agreement \n     with the Corolla Wild Horse Fund to provide for the cost-\n     effective management of the horses in and around the \n     Currituck National Wildlife Refuge while ensuring that \n     natural resources within the Currituck National Wildlife \n     Refuge are not adversely impacted.\n       (2) Requirements.--The agreement entered into under \n     paragraph (1) shall specify that the Corolla Wild Horse Fund \n     shall pay the costs associated with--\n       (A) coordinating and conducting a periodic census, and \n     inspecting the health, of the horses;\n       (B) maintaining records of the horses living in the wild \n     and in confinement;\n       (C) coordinating and conducting the removal and placement \n     of horses and monitoring of any horses removed from the \n     Currituck County Outer Banks; and\n       (D) administering a viable population control plan for the \n     horses, including auctions, adoptions, contraceptive \n     fertility methods, and other viable options.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. The original Burr amendment did have a lot of \ndiscussion and passion on both sides, but the Senators were able to \ncome together this afternoon to resolve their differences over this \nissue and craft a reasonable compromise that is acceptable to both \nsides. I want to thank Senator Burr, Senator Tillis, and Senator Boxer \nfor their willingness to find a solution that we can support. So I urge \nall my colleagues to support the Burr amendment, as modified.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the 60-\nvote affirmative threshold with respect to the Burr amendment be \nvitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3175), as modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3210\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes, equally divided, \nprior to a vote on the Lankford amendment.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, it is a very straightforward Land and \nWater Conservation Fund amendment. We have common agreement on the Land \nand Water Conservation Fund--what it does, what it funds, how it is \nfunded. Where we have some dispute is in whether we are we taking care \nof the land that we have. We continue to add more acres into the \nFederal inventory, and we are not taking care of them. The original \nplan of the Land and Water Conservation Fund is that someday, out of \ngeneral budget, we will do maintenance on this, but let's keep adding \nland. We have all known for decades that has not worked. For decades we \nhave added more land, and for decades we are not maintaining it.\n\n[[Page S2189]]\n\n  The easiest way to identify this amendment is this: This amendment is \nabout not only purchasing land but taking care of the land that we \nactually purchased. It splits half and half--half for the purchase of \nland and half for the maintenance.\n  My daughter's birthday is today. She is 16. She will get a car--an \nold used car--at some point. But the requirement for her is to not only \nhelp pay for the car but to actually have enough in her bank account \nthat she can help maintain it and buy gasoline for it. She has to have \na job so she can have income.\n  We have set aside the Land and Water Conservation Fund to continually \nget more land but not be able to maintain it. We wouldn't do that with \nour children. We wouldn't do that with our homes. But we have done it \nyear after year with this.\n  Let's do something simple. Let's maintain what we actually purchased \nand make sure it comes into strict oversight of the Federal Government. \nWe should take care of our Federal treasures that are these national \nparks and other Federal lands.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. With that, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, speaking in opposition to the Lankford \namendment, it would gut the Land and Water Conservation Fund. This is a \nprogram in which the Senator's new language would produce obstacles to \nthe Federal government acquiring land that would cost more than $50,000 \nper acre, and it would simply add more redtape by having to pass \nanother law just for the land acquisition to be purchased.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Lankford amendment and keep the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund for the purposes that it was designed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

The clerk will report the amendment by number.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Boozman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3311 to amendment No. 2953.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To require a report relating to certain transmission \n                        infrastructure projects)\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 23___. REPORTING REQUIREMENT FOR CERTAIN TRANSMISSION \n                   INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS.\n\n       Section 1222 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. \n     16421) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(h) Reporting Requirement.--Before carrying out a Project \n     under subsection (a) or (b), the Secretary shall submit to \n     Congress a report that--\n       ``(1) describes the impact that the proposed Project would \n     have on electricity rates;\n       ``(2) demonstrates that the proposed Project meets the \n     requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a) and \n     paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (b); and\n       ``(3) includes a list of utilities that have entered into \n     contracts for the purchase of power from the proposed \n     Project.\n       ``(i) Decision.--The Secretary may not issue a decision on \n     whether to carry out a Project under subsection (a) or (b) \n     before the date that is 90 days after the date of submission \n     of a report required under subsection (h).''.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, this amendment provides a simple report \nfrom the Department of Energy on a specific kind of transmission \nproject. The amendment will not cause delays or add additional redtape. \nIt provides transparency and ensures that the Department follows the \nlaw.\n  This amendment just ensures that the Department provides information \nin a timely manner.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Madam President, this amendment is a job killer. It \nblocks a major new 700-mile, multistate electric transmission project.\n  The Plains & Eastern Clean Line will deliver four gigawatts of \neconomical renewable energy to the Southeast. This is $2 billion of \nnontaxpayer dollars that will lead to over $6 billion in private \ninvestment in new wind generation that will produce enough power to \npower 1 million homes.\n  During the 3 years of construction, the Clean Line will create 6,000 \nlocal construction jobs. Our Nation's grid is the energy of our economy \nand it needs modernization. I urge my colleagues to vote no on this \njob-killing amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Thank you, Mr. President.\n  This amendment is a very simple study amendment. It does nothing more \nthan ask for a study. It is pro clean energy; it changes no rules; it \ndoesn't mandate anything; it has no cost; it has no score. It simply \ndirects the Secretary of the Treasury to submit a report to Congress on \nthe issuance of clean energy victory bonds.\n  It is supported by a number of groups.

Mr. President, Jack Kemp and others who have looked at and \nexamined the issue of poverty have often found that we have not done a \ngreat job alleviating poverty. We have tried government programs. In my \nState, we tried them in rural Appalachia for 40 years. Yet we still \nhave persistent poverty.\n  Many of us believe we would have a better chance with poverty if we \nwould lower taxes in these areas, lessen regulation, and instead of \nsending the money to Washington, leave it where the poverty is. My \namendment alone would leave half a billion dollars in Eastern Kentucky, \n$200 million in Louisville.\n  We have had much discussion of Flint, MI, and the water problem \nthere. My amendment would leave $124 million in Flint, MI, next week. \nMy amendment would leave over $1 billion in Detroit.\n  If there are those in this body who can come together and say we have \na unified presence and a unified ability and desire to combat poverty, \nthis is the amendment to do it. It is called economic freedom zones. I \nhope we will get bipartisan support in favor of leaving money in these \nimpoverished communities to help them get started again.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this \namendment and this vision. Senator Paul's amendment takes advantage of \neconomically distressed communities in our country by saying we will \ntake the hedge funds, big banks, rich investors and see their capital \ngains taxes completely eliminated.\n  The amendment would allow some of the areas in the country with the \nbiggest environmental challenges, the most vulnerable communities, to \nignore environmental laws like the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, \nignore the requirements of National Heritage Areas, would lift Davis-\nBacon, and it would scar school districts in these areas by not \nallowing public education dollars but allowing them to go to private \nschools instead.\n  In short, this amendment would turn these vulnerable communities into \nan experiment I don't think we need to have.\n  I raise a point of order that the pending measure violates section \n311(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of applicable budget \nresolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections of that act and \napplicable budget resolutions for purposes of my amendment, No. 3787, \nand I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment pertains to the sale from \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It merely gives the government the \nauthority to time that sale. We can buy oil high or buy oil low, but we \nshould sell it higher.\n  All this amendment does--a commonsense, bipartisan amendment--is to \nsay that whenever the oil is sold from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, \nit should be when the best price is fetched, if you will, for the \ntaxpayers of the country. It is common sense. It protects taxpayers. It \nshould be adopted.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, Senator Cassidy and I have offered this \namendment in order to correct a problem in the bill. Without this \namendment, there would not be the kind of discipline which is necessary \nin order to make sure the Strategic Petroleum oil is sold strategically \nso that the Federal Government gets the best price for it, so that we \nsell high--or as high as we can--in order to limit the number of \nbarrels of oil that ultimately will be sold so that we can keep as many \nas possible in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n  In order to meet the budget objectives, this amendment satisfies it \nbut also ensures that we keep the maximum number of barrels of oil \nremaining in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. This is going to make \nmillions--tens of millions of extra dollars for the Federal taxpayers \nbecause it will be done in a very smart way. We will be selling as high \nas possible because we bought this oil, for the most part, in a very \nhigh-priced marketplace.\n  Senator Cassidy and I urge an ``aye'' vote on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in February of this year, Justice Scalia \npassed away. It was an enormous loss to the Nation.\n  In the hours and the days following that, Republicans in the Senate \nhad the opportunity to talk about their constitutional responsibility--\nthe responsibility of advice and consent. Supreme Court justices don't \nshow up to the Supreme Court because the President just nominates them. \nIn the Constitution, article II, section 2, lays out a 50-50 \nproposition.\n  The President has the first 50 percent. He narrows down his list, and \nhe nominates.\n  The Senate then has the second 50 percent. They have the power of \nwhat is called advice and consent. The first half of that is when. Is \nthis the right time to do a nominee? And with many nominees, \nhistorically--Ambassadors, Justices, Cabinet officers--the Senate has \nhad a long delay to be able to say: No, this is not the right time.\n  So the first question is, Is this the right time? The second question \nis, Is this the right person? That is the process of advice and \nconsent, and it has been for 200 years.\n  So what has happened since February? Since February, Republicans\n\n[[Page S2192]]\n\nhave been very consistent--myself included--to say: This is not the \ntime to have a Supreme Court Justice go through the nomination process. \nIn the hours after Justice Scalia passed away, we made it very clear so \nthat any nominee who went through the process, regardless of who they \nwere, would know in advance this: You will not move to a hearing \nbecause it is not the right time. Of our two-part test--Is this the \nright time? Is this the right person?--the first part is not complete. \nIt is not the right time. So this nominee will not move at all \nthroughout this entire year, and everyone knew that in advance.\n  So I understand Republicans have talked about the first test on that, \nthe priority of ``is this the right time?'' Democrats have focused on \n``is this the right person?'' They have focused on Judge Garland as the \nnominee. They want to be able to raise and talk about his profile, and \nI get the politics of that. But it is just the politics of it. We would \nexpect that banter back and forth on the politics, but this is a \nsettled issue among Republicans. He will not move through the \nnomination process.\n  But we hit a new low today on this floor, and I had to come and \naddress it. Today, this moved from a conversation about whether this is \nthe right time and whether this is the right person to drawing in the \nmemory of the 168 lives that were lost in Oklahoma City 21 years ago \ntoday--April 19, 1995. It was the worst act of terrorism at that time \non American soil, carried out by another American, killing 168 people \nat the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. A Ryder truck loaded \nwith fertilizer and diesel pulled up to the front and blew it up, \nkilling 168.\n  Timothy McVeigh carried that out. He got into his Ford and drove \nnorth to leave out of the State. But 90 minutes later--90 minutes \nlater--Trooper Charlie Hanger, who was just doing his job, saw a \nvehicle on I-35 without a license plate on it, pulled him over, found \nout he also had a weapon on him, and put him in jail to be able to hold \nhim. Trooper Charlie Hanger, doing his job, actually arrested the \nperson who had killed 168 people just 90 minutes before, not knowing \nit.\n  Local law enforcement and individuals quickly went through the debris \ntrying to find individuals to save and evidence to be able to identify \nwho this was. Within a few hours, they found the axle of the Ryder \ntruck. They called the rental company. They identified it. They did a \ncomposite sketch, and they figured out within hours who this might be--\na guy named Timothy McVeigh. Running a search on him, they figured out \nhe was already in jail. He had been picked up by Trooper Charlie \nHanger. Before he was released--because he was in the process of being \nreleased--they were able to hold him and unwind a horrific crime. It \nwas incredible local law enforcement. It was an incredible task that \nhappened.\n  Within 40 hours of that event occurring, a gentleman named Merrick \nGarland had come from DC, where he worked for the Department of \nJustice, to Oklahoma City to help on the Federal side of the \nprosecution, along with thousands of other people from around the \ncountry. Our State and our city was overwhelmed with the compassion of \npeople around the country as we saw what happened, and Merrick Garland \nwas one of those. We are grateful as a community for what he did in the \nprosecution of Timothy McVeigh, what he did against Terry Nichols, and \nwhat he did against Michael Fortier. We are grateful for his work \nthere.\n  But today, on the floor of this Senate, the implication was laid out \ntwofold. One is that, since Judge Garland served the country and did \nthat, he deserves something else. I have never met Judge Garland. I \nwill meet him next week and, quite frankly, look him in the face and \nsay: Thank you for your service to Oklahoma.\n  To make clear again the same position before, there will be no \nnomination this year. He does deserve our gratitude. He doesn't deserve \na lifetime appointment onto the bench because of his faithful service \nto our country and to our community as is being alluded to.\n  The politics of it really, really deeply struck me as an Oklahoman--\nthat for some reason, today, of all days, the tragedy that happened to \n168 people and their death 21 years ago suddenly became paraded out \nhere as a political prop. One of the Senators was even standing with a \npicture of a dead child behind him like she is a prop. This child is \nnot a prop for politics. She has a name. She was identified as a \ntoddler. She was 1 year and 1 day old. She was killed in the Murrah \nBuilding the day after her 1-year birthday. She is not some random \ntoddler. Her name is Baylee, and she is not to be used as a prop for \npolitics in the Supreme Court nomination process.\n  It is absolutely fair game to talk about the record of Judge Garland \nand what he has done. We are grateful as Oklahomans for his service to \nour State and to our Nation to put away those awful terrorists. But to \nuse a child who was killed in the Murrah Building bombing as a prop so \nfar exceeds the line that I had to come and speak about it and say that \nI am absolutely offended--and I should be.\n  So it was 21 years ago today. We remember. It is a statement that \ncomes up to Oklahomans over and over: We remember. We remember the \nvictims. We remember the survivors. We remember the first responders. \nWe remember the thousands of people who came from across the country to \nhelp us. We remember, and we will continue to remember. But don't do \npolitics with the life and death of the children and adults in Oklahoma \nCity. Let's keep this where it should be. We could have the debate \nabout process. Do not draw this in.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/senate-section/article/S2192-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2192-S2193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOMINATION OF MICHAEL MISSAL\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nconfirm Michael Missal, the nominee for the Department of Veterans \nAffairs inspector general.\n  For far too long, our Nation's veterans have been without a permanent \nwatchdog in place to ensure the VA affords them the care that they \ndeserve.\n  I have seen the damage that acting leadership in the VA Office of \nInspector General has done in my own State of Wisconsin. Numerous \nveterans of the Tomah VA facility suffered for years through dangerous \nprescription practices, whistleblower retaliation, and a culture of \nfear. The VA Office of Inspector General, under acting leadership, \nconducted a multiyear investigation of the Tomah VA facility but then \nswept the allegations under the rug--the secret report that was hidden \nfrom veterans, the public, and Congress.\n  Months after the report was finalized and closed, Jason Simcakoski, a \n35-year-old Marine Corps veteran, died of a lethal cocktail of over a \ndozen different drugs at the Tomah VA facility.\n  Another Wisconsin veteran, Thomas Behr, died after being treated at \nthe Tomah VA facility. Mr. Behr's daughter Candace told me that had she \nknown about the inspector general's report, she never would have taken \nher father to the facility and he might be alive today.\n  In other words, had the VA Office of Inspector General been \ntransparent and published the findings of its investigation, these \ntragic outcomes could very well have been avoided.\n  Under acting leadership, the VA Office of Inspector General has tried \nto stonewall my investigation into the tragedies at Tomah VA medical \nfacility. Its actions have shown that, under acting leadership, the VA \nOffice of Inspector General has become too close to the VA, the agency \nit is charged with overseeing. The acting leadership lacked the \nfundamental tenets of transparency and accountability that all \ninspectors general should have that could literally mean the difference \nbetween life and death.\n  I was forced to resort to a subpoena to obtain the information about \nthe investigation of the Tomah VA Office of Inspector General, and \nthere are still some documents the acting leadership has refused to \nproduce. For over a year, I have urged President Obama to appoint a \npermanent VA inspector general. I was pleased that President Obama \nfinally heeded my calls--and, quite honestly, the calls of many of my \ncolleagues--when he nominated Michael Missal to the position late last \nyear. My committee, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs, moved his nomination after carefully considering \nhis\n\n[[Page S2193]]\n\nqualifications, and we reported him out to the full Senate immediately.\n  I am hopeful that under Mr. Missal's leadership, the VA Office of \nInspector General will restore veterans' trust in the inspector \ngeneral's office, protect VA whistleblowers, and forge a new \nrelationship with Congress, but above all else, I hope Mr. Missal will \nuse his position to help ensure the finest among us receives the high-\nquality care they deserve.\n  I am confident Mr. Missal is up to the task, and I thank him for \nagreeing to serve in this supporting role.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/senate-section/article/S2193-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON.

Mr. President, after months of debate and piecemeal short-\nterm reauthorizations, the Senate has finally approved a comprehensive \nreauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration, FAA, that will \nimprove the safety and efficiency of our Nation's airline \ntransportation system. The Federal Aviation Administration Act of 2016 \nwill not only make airline travel safer and more efficient, it will \nalso strengthen our economy by creating jobs and supporting those who \nrely on the benefits of airline transportation, day to day. From \nprotecting the rights and safety of airline employees, to ensuring the \nneeds of passengers with disabilities are recognized and upheld, this \nlegislation takes necessary steps to improve travel experiences for all \nAmericans.\n  I am especially pleased that the Federal Aviation Administration Act \nincludes a number of policies that will benefit Vermont's airports, \nincluding the preservation of the Essential Air Service program, an \nimportant source of support for the Rutland-Southern Vermont Regional \nAirport. The bill also increases Airport Improvement Program funding, \nwhich is essential to the expansion and improvements of airports in \nVermont and across the country. Also importantly, the bill will not \nprivatize the Air Traffic Control System.\n  As the opportunities and challenges associated with new technology \ncontinue to evolve--both in NextGen implementation and use of drones--\nit is important that safety remains a top priority. This FAA \nreauthorization bill takes steps to address the safety and privacy \nconcerns related to the widespread proliferation of unmanned aircraft \nwithin our domestic airspace. The legislation adds several provisions \nto increase safety by adding new technical and operational standards. \nFor example, the bill requires the FAA and government agencies to \ncollaborate with industry stakeholders to develop guidelines and \nprocedures to ensure the safe integration of drones into the national \nairspace. I was also pleased that the bill addresses certain privacy \nconcerns about the use of drones by requiring the FAA to establish a \npublicly accessible website containing information about commercial and \ngovernment drone operations, the type of information those drones will \ncollect, and how that information will be used. While the drone-related \nprovisions in the bill are an improvement from the status quo, I \nbelieve that we must do more to ensure that safety and privacy \nsafeguards are improved.\n  In Vermont, our airports are essential to a strong economy. They \nfacilitate both tourism and commerce, and they are a source of economic \ngrowth for our communities. I am disappointed that, despite support \nfrom 99 other Senators, the objections of just one Senator prevented \nthe passage of an amendment that would further facilitate travel and \ncommerce between the United States and Canada, our largest trading \npartner. Expanding U.S. preclearance operations in Canada not only \nimproves the travel experience for Americans traveling back and forth \nbetween Canada, but encourages neighbors to the north to visit the \nUnited States and infuses our economies through tourism and commerce. \nImportantly, it also furthers our national security. I will be looking \nfor opportunities to advance this legislation moving forward.\n  The Federal Aviation Administration Act represents a strong step \nforward in keeping the U.S. airspace as the safest and most efficient \nin the world. I hope that, as the House takes up this important \nlegislation, they will maintain the carefully balanced proposals \nincluded in the Senate bill.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I voted no on final passage of the FAA \nreauthorization bill because I was unable to offer my amendment to \nensure that cargo pilots have the same rest and duty rules as passenger \npilots.\n  Not only was I unable to secure a vote on my amendment, my offer to \nmodify my amendment into a study by the National Transportation Safety \nBoard was objected to by the other side. We should ensure that all \npilots, whether they fly people or goods, have the same opportunities \nfor rest. As this bill has many safety implications for our aviation \nsystem, I am very disappointed that my amendment did not receive \nconsideration in the Senate.\n  However, I would like to thank the Senate Commerce Committee for \ntheir hard work on this bill, which includes many safety improvements, \nhelpful consumer protections, and enhancements to airport security. I \nam particularly pleased that the bill includes a provision to ban the \nuse of electronic cigarettes on board aircraft that I had asked to be \nincluded in this bill.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, today the Senate approved legislation to \nreauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration--FAA--for 18 months. I \napplaud the work of my colleagues, Senators Thune and Nelson, and their \nstaff who worked tirelessly to get this important legislation over the \nfinish line. I hope leaders in the House of Representatives see what we \npassed here in the Senate and ensure smooth passage of the bill. This \nlegislation truly represents bipartisan compromise. While it takes \nimportant steps forward, more work remains to be done to ensure the \nUnited States remains a global leader in aviation, safety, and \ninnovation.\n  This legislation advanced many key priorities that I was proud to \nfight for. Aviation is a critical means of travel for people in my \nState and across the country, and I am confident that this legislation \ntakes strides to improve the status quo for travelers.\n  I worked to advance provisions that help improve accessibility for \npersons with disabilities traveling through our Nation's commercial air \nsystem. The increased and improved data collected as a result of this \nlegislation and the new advisory committee put in place will help fuel \neffective policies that enhance the traveling experience for persons \nwith disabilities and remove barriers to accessibility.\n  The legislation will help improve the use of disadvantaged business \nenterprises in aviation infrastructure. I authored an amendment to \nalign the size standard used by the Department of Transportation--DOT--\nto identify small businesses, with the metric used\n\n[[Page S2194]]\n\nby the Small Business Administration--SBA. This small update will \nenable more minority and women-owned businesses to compete for \ninfrastructure work. This amendment had widespread support in the \naviation construction industry including from the U.S. Women's Chamber \nof Commerce, the Airport Minority Advisory Council, the National \nAssociation of Minority Contractors, and I was pleased to see it \nunanimously supported in this legislation.\n  I also joined colleagues on the floor and through my role on the \nSenate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation to move the \nlegislation forward on policies that embrace innovation and help the \nUnited States maintain global leadership when it comes to embracing new \ntechnology and integrating UAS into the national airspace.\n  From a floor amendment with Senator Inhofe that will improve the safe \nuse of UAS to examine and maintain our critical infrastructure to \namendments I championed in committee that will move the United States \nforward on new applications of micro-UAS, we took important strides \nforward. This technology has the power to enhance search and rescue, \ndeliver humanitarian aid, improve agriculture practices, and news-\ngathering. I introduced the Commercial UAS Modernization Act to help \nadvance this technology and was pleased to see many of our ideas \nincorporated in this reauthorization.\n  This legislation also includes provisions to bolster the use of test \nsites and further important research initiatives that will benefit \nsafety, infrastructure, and aviation technology. New Jersey is home to \nthe FAA's William J. Hughes Technical Center in Atlantic City and a UAS \ntest site in Cape May. These sites play a key role in advancing \naviation research and technology, and this legislation includes \nimportant provisions that ensure New Jersey will remain a leader in \nadvancing aviation safety and R\n  Lastly, I would like to discuss an area that is ripe for further \ncongressional action: the Transportation Security Administration--TSA. \nThe FAA reauthorization takes some steps towards stronger security, but \nmore work needs to be done to advance our Nation's security, and TSA \nplays a critical role to these endeavors. I will continue to fight for \naccountability and further resources to this important entity that \nplays such an important role in keeping travelers safe and secure. We \nmust ensure there are adequate resources and top-notch technologies \ndeployed to our airports and our surface transportation systems.\n  Again, I thank my esteemed colleagues in Senate leadership and \nSenators Thune and Nelson for their efforts on this important \nlegislation. I know this will make a difference to my constituents in \nNew Jersey and to people across the country.\n  Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/senate-section/article/S2194-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2194-S2195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            OLDER AMERICANS ACT REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2016\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, recently the Senate marked a \nsignificant achievement--the final passage of the bipartisan \nreauthorization of the Older Americans Act--and now the President has \nsigned it into law.\n  This act provides seniors access to home-delivered meals, like Meals \non Wheels; seniors centers; transportation, like rides to the senior \ncenter and the grocery store; and meals served at senior centers and \nchurches. Other services include caregiver support, preventive health \nservices, job training and support, elder abuse prevention, and the \nlong-term care ombudsman.\n  In 2012, Tennessee served 2.4 million meals to seniors through Older \nAmericans Act programs.\n  This reauthorization also will make a few important improvements.\n  One, it will provide States, area agencies on aging, and service \nproviders with information and technical assistance in collaboration \nwith relevant Federal agencies, on providing efficient, person-centered \ntransportation services, including across geographic boundaries.\n  That means that when a senior who lives Kentucky and wants to come \nsee her doctor just over the border in Tennessee, it is easier for her \nto get that ride.\n  Two, this bill addresses the tragic issue of elder abuse with \nprovisions for the prevention of abuse, neglect, and exploitation. It \nbolsters services that address elder justice and exploitation of older \nindividuals, including financial exploitation, which can be devastating \nto a senior's ability to stay independent and in his own home.\n  Three, this bill ensures States receive funding based on their senior \npopulation. Senator Richard Burr worked hard with me on this, and we \nhave him to thank for this update.\n  This bill is the product of several years of bipartisan collaboration \nand compromise. This legislation protects and strengthens the \nunderlying law's many vital programs. I look forward to seeing S. 192 \nsigned into law, and now I would like to yield to my colleague, Senator \nBurr.\n  Mr. BURR. I would also like to thank my colleagues, particularly \nChairman Alexander, Ranking Member Murray, and Senator Sanders, for \ntheir partnership in working with me to reauthorize the Older Americans \nAct. I am pleased that our efforts have resulted in sending a strong \nreauthorization of the Older Americans Act to the President's desk. The \nreauthorization of these critical support programs for seniors has been \na process that each of us has been actively involved in over the last \nfew years, and I am proud to see this bipartisan piece of legislation \non its way to becoming law.\n  I want to focus on a key aspect of this reauthorization for my \nconstituents--the change in the funding formula. In 2010, the \nGovernment Accountability Office, GAO, determined that the formula \nresponsible for the allocation of State funding in the OAA was broken. \nIt took us 6 years to act, and I am pleased to see this important \nchange included in the OAA reauthorization, allowing funds to be \ndirected where they are most needed. This is a commonsense, but \ncritical change for better ensuring that the dollars are following the \nneeds.\n  This change is especially important for North Carolina's seniors. The \nchange in the formula calculation will increase resources for these \nprograms in North Carolina and other States where seniors have moved \nsince the last reauthorization of the Older Americans Act, a decade \nago. As more and more seniors make North Carolina their home, this will \nhelp ensure that resources are being more fairly allocated based on the \nneeds of seniors today and in the future, which is a key aspect of \nhelping some of our most vulnerable seniors age with the dignity and \nrespect they deserve.\n  I often hear from my constituents--area agencies on aging, PACE \nprogram directors, and North Carolinians themselves--about the benefits \nthat come from the programs authorized by the Older Americans Act. The \ncontinuation of these programs, which provide meals, caregiver \nsupports, and help seniors stay in the comfort of their homes and local \ncommunities longer positively impacts the lives of millions of seniors \nevery day. With the passage of this legislation, almost 2 million North \nCarolina seniors may be able to benefit from State and local programs \nthat provide needed support for them and their families. I am proud to \nhave fought on behalf of North Carolina's seniors for the improvements \nreflected in this reauthorization bill, and I look forward to \ncontinuing to work to improve the quality of life for my constituents.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. In addition to providing grants to States for senior \nsocial and nutrition services, this reauthorization also aims to \ncontinue protecting vulnerable elders from abuse by ensuring access to \nabuse screening and prevention through efforts like the Senior Medicare \nPatrol, SMP, program, which helps train seniors to recognize and \nprotect themselves from Medicare and Medicaid fraud. The most recent \ninspector general report noted that the program had educated over 3.5 \nmillion beneficiaries, reached 27 million people, and saved about $106 \nmillion.\n  The programs authorized by this law provide critical services to help \nAmericans live with dignity well into their later years, but these \nservices also provide a significant return on investment for taxpayers.\n  They help decrease the increasing cost pressures on Medicare and \nMedicaid. These programs that help seniors stay healthy, independent, \nand living\n\n[[Page S2195]]\n\nin their own homes also are helping seniors stay where they want to \nbe--and that is less expensive for taxpayers than if these seniors were \ninstead in nursing homes.\n  Mr. ENZI. I would also like to highlight the National Resource Center \nfor Women and Retirement as a highly successful program run by the \nWomen's Institute for a Secure Retirement--known to most as ``WISER''--\na nonprofit organization dedicated to ensuring the security of women's \nretirement income through outreach, partnerships, and policy \ndevelopment. The staff and programs at WISER have provided important \nand effective trainings and education in my home State of Wyoming, as \nwell as around the country.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. For more than 50 years, the Older Americans Act has \nbeen effective in large part because these successful programs are \nfunded through flexible grants to States. States know best what \nservices will be most beneficial for their residents to live healthier, \nmore independent lives as they age.\n  I want to thank Senator Murray for working with me on this bill in \nour committee.\n  I want to thank Senator Collins, whose leadership on the Special \nCommittee on Aging was instrumental. Her determination to help seniors \nstay home and independent helped us get this bill through the full \nSenate.\n  I want to thank Senator Burr for his determination to get a result on \nthe funding issue.\n  Finally, I would like to thank Senator Sanders for his tireless work \non this issue and on this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/senate-section/article/S2195-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL CONGENITAL DIAPHRAGMATIC HERNIA AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today I wish to discuss S. Res. 408. I \nam delighted that the Senate has unanimously declared April as National \nCongenital Diaphragmatic Hernia Awareness Month for the fourth \nconsecutive year. I would like to thank my friend and able colleague, \nSenator Ben Cardin of Maryland, for joining me in this legislation. \nThis resolution is very important to me and my family as my grandson \nJim Beau is a CDH survivor.\n  I specifically wanted to speak today, April 19, to commemorate \nCongenital Diaphragmatic Hernia Action Day. Charities and families in \n60 countries and cities all over the U.S. are working together to raise \nCDH Awareness through State and town proclamations, lighted buildings, \nParades of Cherubs, fundraisers, and other events.\n  CDH is a birth defect that occurs when the fetal diaphragm fails to \nfully develop. The lungs develop at the same time as the diaphragm and \nthe digestive system. When a diaphragmatic hernia occurs, the abdominal \norgans move into and develop in the chest instead of remaining in the \nabdomen. With the heart, lungs, and abdominal organs all taking up \nspace in the chest, the lungs do not have space to develop properly. \nThis may cause the lungs to be small and underdeveloped.\n  A diaphragmatic hernia is a life-threatening condition. When the \nlungs do not develop properly during pregnancy, it can be difficult for \nthe baby to breathe after birth, or the baby is unable to take in \nenough oxygen to stay healthy.\n  Several members from the CHERUBS group visited my office yesterday. I \nwas encouraged by their good spirit and enthusiasm. These individuals \nhave been coming to Capitol Hill every year for the last several years \nto advocate for Federal assistance for this birth defect. Over the last \n4 years, we have made good progress.\n  We have seen an increase in funding at the National Institutes of \nHealth, NIH. In fiscal year 2015, the NIH funded approximately \n$3,300,000 in CDH research. This is an increase of $800,000 from fiscal \nyear 2014. We have also seen an increase in awareness and education. \nBut more research is needed. The cause of CDH remains unknown. Most \ncases of diaphragmatic hernia are believed to be multifactorial in \norigin, meaning both genetic and environmental factors are involved. It \nis thought that multiple genes from both parents, as well as a number \nof environmental factors that scientists do not yet fully understand, \ncontribute to the development of a diaphragmatic hernia.\n  Congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a birth defect that occurs in 1 \nout of every 3,836 live births worldwide.\n  The CDC estimates that CDH affects 1,088 babies in the U.S. each \nyear.\n  Every 10 minutes, a baby is born with CDH, adding up to more than \n700,000 babies with CDH since just 2000; yet most people have never \nheard of CDH.\n  Up to 20 percent of cases of CDH have a genetic cause due to a \nchromosome defect or genetic syndrome.\n  According to the CDC, babies born with CDH experience a high \nmortality rate ranging from 20-60 percent depending on the severity of \nthe defect and the treatments available at delivery. The mortality rate \nhas remained stable since 1999.\n  Approximately 40 percent of babies born with CDH will have other \nbirth defects, in addition to CDH. The most common is a congenital \nheart defect.\n  Awareness, good prenatal care, early diagnosis, and skilled treatment \nare the keys to a greater survival rate in these babies. That is why \nthis resolution is so important.\n  In 2009, my grandson Jim Beau was diagnosed with CDH during my \ndaughter Mary Abigail's 34th week of pregnancy. At that time, no one in \nmy family had heard of CDH before. My family was very lucky that Jim \nBeau's defect was caught before he was born and that he was in the \nright place to receive excellent care for his CDH.\n  He is now a happy, rambunctious 6-year-old.\n  The resolution Senator Cardin and I introduced is important because \nit will bring awareness to this birth defect, and this awareness will \nsave lives. Although hundreds of thousands of babies have been \ndiagnosed with this defect, the causes are still unknown, and more \nresearch is needed. Every year more is learned and there are more \nsuccesses. We are making good progress, and we must continue these \nefforts.\n  I want to thank my colleagues for joining me in supporting this \nlegislation to bring awareness to CDH.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/senate-section/article/S2195-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2195-S2196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO LARRY MacDONALD\n\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Larry MacDonald \nas he retires from the city of Bayfield, WI, after an impressive 20 \nyears as the city's mayor. Since his election in 1994, Larry has \ndedicated himself to improving the city of Bayfield and making it a \nwonderful destination in northwestern Wisconsin.\n  Larry was born in Munich, Germany, to American parents. After growing \nup in the Twin Cities area of Minnesota, Larry and his wife, Julie, \nmoved to Bayfield in 1989. They opened Cooper Hill House B, \ncontributing to Bayfield's tradition of welcoming visitors from across \nthe State to beautiful Bayfield County. The MacDonalds also opened the \nApostle Islands Outfitters that, for close to two decades, supported \nBayfield and the city's practice of providing outstanding outdoor \nrecreation opportunities to residents and tourists alike.\n  While he has served as mayor for 20 years, Larry's career in public \nservice began as a casual interest in local government. However, as a \nproactive politician, a committed environmentalist, and a savvy \nbusinessman, Larry's casual interest quickly grew into a remarkable \npassion for his work and dedication to his city. Over the past two \ndecades and despite an ill-fated attempt at retirement in 2004, Larry \nhas influenced all aspects of the Bayfield community.\n  The city of Bayfield is the smallest city in Wisconsin, but one of \nour most popular destinations. A beautiful city located on Lake \nSuperior, Bayfield draws visitors from across the State. When others \nwould be daunted, he faced head-on the challenges of a local economy \nbased on tourism, working with local organizations and listening \nclosely to his community. Larry also dedicated his career to \nmaintaining the natural beauty of Lake Superior and the Apostle Islands \nthrough his work as a board member of the Alliance of the Great Lakes \nand the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. As mayor, he led the city \nto be one of the first in the Nation to adopt an eco-municipality \nresolution, thereby codifying its commitment to sustainability, setting \nan example for others to follow, and preserving Bayfield's natural \nresources for generations to come.\n\n[[Page S2196]]\n\n  Larry's involvement in the community goes beyond his work as mayor. \nHis many civic contributions include roles as master of ceremonies for \nthe Bayfield Apple Festival for many years, an avid participant in the \nBig Top Chautauqua annual Pie & Politics event, and a regular \ncontributor to the Bayfield School Reading Days. Larry's influence can \nbe seen throughout the city, whether it is through his community work, \nthe time he has spent working at his family's business interests, or \nsimply enjoying the city.\n  However, when he looks back on his many roles in life, his greatest \naccomplishment will be his 20 years of service as mayor. Larry himself \ndescribes it as the best job he ever had. While he attributes his \nsuccess to the Bayfield community, the city council and his dedicated \nstaff, Larry's success comes from his own will. His investment in his \nstaff, his honesty and involvement, and his personal touch are what \nspurred Bayfield residents to return him to office year after year. \nAlthough in retirement he will no longer be in the mayor's office, \nLarry's legacy will remain.\n  Over the past 20 years, Larry has impacted Bayfield residents and the \ncommunity around him through his dedication, honest nature, and kind \nheart. I am so pleased to join others in recognizing Larry's success \nand accomplishments. I wish him, his wife, Julie, their children, many \ngrandchildren and great-grandchildren all the best in the next chapter \nof their lives together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/senate-section/article/S2196-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL THOMPSON\n\n Mr, SCOTT.

This is a \nsignificant achievement and a testament to his continued service to our \ncountry, State, and especially to the South Carolina community.\n  As sitting president of the Blue Ridge Council Boy Scouts, Michael \nThompson's love for service and the community, as well as his many \nachievements, place him in the company of other great individuals who \nhave received this award, such as President Gerald Ford, Neil \nArmstrong, and former Secretary of Defense Dr. Robert Gates, to name a \nfew. His involvement in the Upstate community represents what it truly \nmeans to be an outstanding leader.\n  It is with pride and honor that we recognize Mr. Michael Thompson and \nhis outstanding achievements today and add his legacy to our April 19, \n2016, Congressional Record. We will always remember his admiration for \nthe community, the Upstate, and above all for the scouts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/senate-section/article/S2196-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNTAIN INN WESLEYAN METHODIST CHURCH\n\n Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, today I wish to honor one of South \nCarolina's most impactful ministries, the Fountain Inn Wesleyan \nMethodist Church. Celebrating 100 years of faith and teachings on April \n24, 2016, the church has remained dedicated to its vision, ``To exalt \nJesus Christ by Evangelizing the Lost, Disciplining Believers, \nEquipping the Church, and Ministering to the Community,'' and intends \nto continue on this path for years to come.\n  Evangelist Rev. J.M. Hames first organized the church in 1916, and \nits official name, the Wesleyan Church, was obtained in 1968 following \nmergers with several other denominations. Following a tent revival \nmeeting at the start of its history, the church began as a place of \nworship for workers and residents of the Woodside Mill Village \ncommunity. It was later provided its permanent place of worship when \nthe Woodside Mill company deeded the building and property to the \nWesleyan Methodist Church.\n  Despite many changes incurred over time, including the leadership of \n21 pastors, the church has continued to serve the community without \nstraying from its initial mission. The Fountain Inn Wesleyan Methodist \nChurch has remained a consistent source of guidance for its community \nand has brought many individuals to know the Lord throughout its \nhistory.\n  It is with honor and admiration that we recognize the Fountain Inn \nWesleyan Methodist Church and its great impact, adding its legacy to \nour April 19, 2016, Congressional Record.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/senate-section/article/S2196-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO SOPHIE DOEDEN\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A bill to reduce housing-related health hazards, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am introducing two bills pertaining \nto healthy housing, the Healthy Housing Council Act and the Title X \nAmendments Act. These bills seek to improve federal coordination of \nhealthy housing efforts and better integrate healthy housing activities \ninto the ongoing lead poisoning prevention work at the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development.\n  The crisis in Flint, Michigan reaffirms a tragic reality; millions of \nAmericans, including thousands of children and families in Rhode \nIsland, remain at risk from lead exposure. For example, Rhode Island \nhas the highest percentage of low-income children living in older \nhousing, which poses health risks for these children because of the \nlead paint used in these older homes. Fortunately, Rhode Island has \nbeen a national leader in working to reduce lead hazards and bring down \nchildhood lead poisoning rates. The number of children with elevated \nblood lead levels has been steadily declining in all areas of Rhode \nIsland over the last decade, from 212 children under the age of 6 in \n2005 to 42 children in 2015. But as we have seen this year with the \ntragedy in Flint, MI, lead poisoning among children is still a huge \nproblem in this country. This is unacceptable, which is why I have long \nsought to improve and maximize federal finding for lead poisoning \nprevention programs.\n  The Title X Amendments Act makes important improvements to lead \npoisoning prevention programs at HUD to better serve low income \nfamilies at risk for lead poisoning. It would provide HUD with the \nnecessary authority to continue to carry out healthy housing activities \nwhile protecting important ongoing lead remediation efforts, allow \ngrantees to improve the conditions in zero-bedroom units, and \nstreamline eligibility for assistance. These are simple, yet necessary \nreforms designed to improve and expand cost-effective services, and I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues to see them enacted.\n  It is also vital that we continue the type of collaboration and \ncoordination among Federal departments and agencies, like HUD, HHS, \nEPA, and CDC, that resulted in the Strategy for Action to Advance \nHealthy Homes. Indeed, there are many programs fragmented across \nmultiple agencies that are responsible for addressing housing-related \nhealth hazards like lead and radon, and we should strive to improve the \nefficiency and efficacy of these efforts by ensuring that these \nagencies continue to work together.\n  The Healthy Housing Council Act would establish an independent \ninteragency Council on Healthy Housing in the executive branch in order \nto improve coordination, bring existing efforts out of their respective \nsilos, and reduce duplication.\n  The bill calls for the council to convene periodic meetings with \nexperts in the public and private sectors to discuss ways to educate \nindividuals and families on how to recognize housing-related health \nhazards and access the necessary services and preventive measures to \ncombat these hazards. The council would also be required to hold \nbiannual stakeholder meetings, maintain an updated website, and work to \nunify healthy housing data collection.\n  In addition to the 23 million homes with lead-based paint hazards, \nthere are nearly 6 million households with moderate or severe health \nhazards, resulting in approximately 22,600 unintentional injury and \nfire deaths and 21,000 radon-associated lung cancer deaths every year. \nThese bills seek to tackle these numbers, which contribute to \nincreasing health care costs for individuals and families, as well as \nfor Federal, State, and local governments.\n  The presence of housing-related health hazards is often overlooked \nand yet these hazards are sometimes the cause of a variety of \npreventable diseases and conditions like cancer, lead poisoning, and \nasthma.

Res. 431\n\n       Whereas in the late 1800s, 4-H clubs developed in rural \n     communities to promote agricultural education among young \n     people;\n       Whereas the Smith-Lever Act (7 U.S.C. 341 et seq.) \n     established the cooperative extension services, which \n     resulted in a national 4-H program;\n       Whereas the 4-H program and pledge are based on the values \n     of community service, public leadership, and healthful \n     living;\n       Whereas 4-H has played an indispensable role in shaping the \n     lives of young leaders in rural areas of the United States \n     for over 100 years;\n       Whereas nearly 6,000,000 young people are currently \n     involved in 4-H, 40 percent of whom are from urban and \n     suburban backgrounds;\n       Whereas the 4-H program has evolved to include \n     opportunities for 4-H youth to become proficient in--\n       (1) science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM); and\n       (2) citizenship and public speaking;\n\n       Whereas young people who participate in 4-H are twice as \n     likely as their peers who are not involved in 4-H--\n       (1) to be civically engaged;\n       (2) to participate in science, engineering, and computer \n     technology programs outside of school; and\n       (3) to make healthful life choices;\n\n       Whereas the National 4-H Congress, National 4-H Conference, \n     and Citizenship Washington Focus give hundreds of young \n     people who participate in 4-H the opportunity to exercise \n     leadership skills nationally and to learn about the history \n     and government of the United States; and\n       Whereas in April 2016, the National 4-H Council launched a \n     ``Grow True Leaders'' campaign to expand the benefits of 4-H \n     to more communities, with the goal of creating 10,000,000 \n     True Leaders by 2025: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes 4-H as a vital organization for training the \n     next generation for national leadership;\n       (2) congratulates the National 4-H Council on its ``Grow \n     True Leaders'' campaign; and\n       (3) supports the efforts of the National 4-H Council to \n     grow and diversify the 4-H program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/19/senate-section/article/S2200-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 35--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT \n THE UNITED STATES SHOULD CONTINUE TO EXERCISE ITS VETO IN THE UNITED \n     NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL ON RESOLUTIONS REGARDING THE ISRAELI-\n                       PALESTINIAN PEACE PROCESS\n\n  Mr. RUBIO (for himself and Mr. Manchin) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                            S.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2755) to provide Capitol-flown flags to the \n     immediate family of firefighters, law enforcement officers, \n     members of rescue squads or ambulance crews, and public \n     safety officers who are killed in the line of duty.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support the Fallen \nHeroes Flag Act of 2016, S. 2755. This bipartisan legislation will \ncreate a program to provide Capitol-flown flags to the immediate family \nmembers of firefighters, law enforcement officers, members of rescue \nsquads or ambulance crews, and public safety officers who are killed in \nthe line of duty. These flags are provided at no cost to the family and \nwill come with a certificate from the Senate, signed by the providing \nMember and President pro tempore, which contains our expression of \nsympathy for the grieving family. Certificates coming from the other \nbody will be signed by the Speaker of the House and the providing House \nMember and express the sympathy of the House of Representatives.\n  I hope all my colleagues will join me in support of this legislation. \nOur first responders make tremendous sacrifices for our communities. If \none of them makes the ultimate sacrifice, the least we can do to \nrecognize their life, show our gratitude, and express our sympathy for \ntheir family is present them with a flag flown over this building.\n  Under existing rules, Senate offices may not use official funds to \nsend flags to individuals. This legislation authorizes a new program, \nadministered by the Architect of the Capitol, that will make it \npossible for families who have lost a loved one in these circumstances \nto request and receive a Capitol-flown flag at no expense. We are all \ngrateful for the sacrifices these dedicated public servants make every \nday to serve and protect our communities, and this legislation will \nmake it possible to present grieving families with a symbol of our \ngratitude.\n  This legislation has been endorsed by the National Fraternal Order of \nPolice and the Sergeants Benevolent Association. I ask unanimous \nconsent that their letters of support be printed in the Record \nfollowing my statement.\n  I would like to thank all my colleagues who cosponsored this \nlegislation, particularly our ranking member of the Rules Committee, \nSenator Schumer. I would also like to thank Congressman Peter King, who \nhas championed this cause in the other body for many years. This \nlegislation includes some revisions to the previously passed version in \nthe House, but I expect they will be agreeable to the other body.\n  I hope both bodies will pass this legislation quickly and send it on \nto the President for his signature.\n  Thank you.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Sergeants Benevolent Association, Police Department, City \n           of New York,\n                                      New York, NY, April 7, 2016.\n     Hon.

We appreciate your leadership on \n     this legislation to honor those law enforcement officers and \n     other first responders who have lost their lives protecting \n     their fellow citizens.\n       In the first four months of 2016 alone, thirty federal, \n     state, and local law enforcement officers have fallen in the \n     line of duty. According to the National Law Enforcement \n     Officers Memorial Fund, sixteen of these officers perished in \n     firearms-related incidents. Statistics such as these are a \n     sobering reminder of the sacrifices that are made daily by \n     our first responders. These men and women, as well as \n     countless others who have lost their lives in the line of \n     duty, have earned the right to be honored for their heroism.\n       The legislation that you have introduced would provide this \n     opportunity by allowing the surviving family of a law \n     enforcement officer, firefighter, or EMT who dies in the line \n     of duty to request that an American flag be flown over the \n     U.S. Capitol in honor of their fallen family member. The flag \n     would be provided to the family without cost, and would \n     include a signed certificate with an expression of sympathy \n     for the family involved. It is a simple yet extremely \n     meaningful way to demonstrate to surviving families our \n     recognition of and gratitude for the tremendous sacrifice \n     their loved one made to keep our nation safe.\n       On behalf of the membership of the Sergeants Benevolent \n     Association, thank you again for your leadership on this \n     important issue.

It takes \n     a special person who is willing to sacrifice his/her life to \n     run towards danger, while everyone else is running away from \n     it. Mr. Chairman, as co-chair of the Law Enforcement Caucus, \n     you know how important it is to honor the commitment and \n     sacrifice of the men and women who died protecting their \n     communities and that of their families.\n       Nothing can take away the pain or replace a loved one whose \n     life has been unjustly taken. What we can offer is our \n     deepest condolences and a symbol of our infinite gratitude. \n     This legislation ensures that the heroes and their families \n     who gave the ultimate sacrifice are honored and recognized.\n       On behalf of more than 330,000 members of the Fraternal \n     Order of Police, I want to thank you for introducing this \n     legislation and amendment. If I can be of any further help, \n     please do not hesitate to contact me or Executive Director \n     Jim Pasco in my Washington Office.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Chuck Canterbury,\n                                               National President.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON.
