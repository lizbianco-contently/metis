Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for those kind \nwords. I am happy to report the Democratic leader of the Senate, \nSenator Reid, is making a speedy recovery from his New Year's run-in \nwith some exercise equipment. His face and ribs are still sore. He is \neager to get back to work. We met with him this morning, and we can \nexpect him back in the Senate very soon.\n  In the meantime, it is a privilege on behalf of the Democratic Caucus \nto welcome our old colleagues back to work and welcome our new \ncolleagues and their families to the U.S. Senate. I also want to wish \nLeader McConnell, as he takes up the new duties of the majority leader, \nthe very best. Senator Dirksen was a Senator from my home State of \nIllinois who served as a Republican leader of the Senate from 1959 to \n1969. He famously said, ``I am a man of fixed and unbending principles, \nthe first of which is to be flexible at all times.''\n  That may sound comical, even contradictory. But Senator Dirksen's \nability on flexible tactics and firmness on principles helped produce \nhistoric legislation such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964, one of the \ngreatest achievements in our Nation's history. I am sure we all will \nremember that with fondness and pride.\n  The American people need us to work together to solve problems and \ncreate opportunities. For their sake, let us all try to remember that \nwhat we are about is honorable compromise. The Constitution of the \nUnited States and the Senate itself are the results of just such a \ncompromise.\n  One other point. One hundred years ago this week, an American \nindustrialist and entrepreneur stunned the world by announcing he would \nstart paying his workers double the industry average and cut the hours. \nThat man, of course, was Henry Ford. He committed to pay his workers a \nminimum wage.\n  As we begin this new Congress, let us dedicate ourselves to the \nworking men and women across America, the taxpayers of this country, \nand the men and women which we so proudly serve. I hope that we will \nshow flexibility and principle. We can't solve America's challenges \nwith the same old thinking. We have to address the problems with mutual \nrespect and with a positive attitude.\n  I look forward to, on this side of the aisle, working with Senator \nReid and my colleagues to achieve that end.\n  Congratulations to Leader McConnell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/06/senate-section/article/S9-3", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Under the \ntraditions and rules of the Senate, all of the Senate committees are \norganized in a resolution, which we anticipate will be offered tomorrow \nfor the organization of the committee structure of the U.S. Senate.\n  I say to the majority leader, we will continue this conversation in a \npositive manner in an effort to come up with a mutually agreeable \napproach to consider this legislation and others, but for that reason I \nmust object.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If I may, let me just say again, nobody's rights would \nhave been in any way impaired by going forward a day earlier. We are \ngoing to pass the committee resolution tomorrow. We all know that one \nof the things the Senate is best at is not doing much. I hope we can \nwork this out so we can get started. Everyone knows the first measure \nthat is going to be up is going to come out of the energy committee. I \nwould say to my friends on the minority side, it is open for amendment. \nWhy don't we get started? Hopefully Senator Murkowski and Senator \nCantwell can work through this and we can get going and do the people's \nbusiness. We are anxious to get started.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/06/senate-section/article/S9-4", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9-S10]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   REMEMBERING SYLVIA GARCIA RICKARD\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise to \nconvey to my colleagues news of the tragic death of Sylvia Rickard--one \nof the Nation's top breast cancer advocates--a woman so full of life \nand joy, so deeply immersed in the science of her passion, that it is \nimpossible to imagine this sad, sad occurrence.\n  Sylvia was truly an amazing person who touched many lives. I first \nmet Sylvia when she visited my office so many years ago to educate me \non the need for more breast cancer research, for better breast cancer \nscreening, and for better patient navigation. Sylvia, herself a two-\ntime survivor of breast cancer, and later of ocular melanoma, made sure \nthat my staff and I, and indeed all of the Utah and Idaho delegations, \nregardless of party, were kept apprised of the latest developments in \nbreast cancer research. She patiently walked us through the science \nbehind the research--a science she made it her business to know in \ngreat detail.\n  Sylvia was such a good advocate because she had fought this dread \ndisease, and won. Not once, but twice.\n\n[[Page S10]]\n\nMoreover, Sylvia, and her husband Rick, became friends to all--to me, \nmy staff, and to my former staff--here in Washington, and in our \nbeloved State of Utah. She always had a smile and a hug for everyone.\n  Sylvia made it her business not just to talk the talk, but also to \nwalk the walk. She was a past president of the Women's State \nLegislative Council in Utah, a bipartisan group of women who meet to \ndiscuss issues of importance to Utah and the Nation. She also was the \nfounder of the Utah Breast Cancer Network, and the president of the \nHispanic Health Care Task Force in Utah. Sylvia became involved in \nbuilding awareness at the local level, as well as the national level. \nIndeed, she was very proud to have been selected to be an advisor to \nthe National Institutes of Health--a remarkable recognition of her top-\nranked talent. She was involved at all levels in advocating for better \nbiomedical research, better support for that research, and for a \nnonpartisan, commonsense approach to a disease that is now expected to \naffect one in eight women over their lifetimes.\n  I recall the twinkle in Sylvia's eye when top experts at the Huntsman \nCancer Center in Salt Lake City sought her knowledge about eye cancer, \nafter she was treated successfully. She had found a surgeon in another \nState who could treat her without the certain loss of her eye, and she \nhelped to connect the physicians so they could learn from each other.\n  It was a great loss to Utah when Rick Rickard built Sylvia the house \nof their dreams for retirement in Boise, ID this past fall. But we were \nall happy they had achieved their dream. I heard she was absolutely \ndelighted to cook in her new kitchen. I am so pleased she at least got \nto spend a few months in their new home, one they had worked for so \nhard over so many years finally to achieve.\n  So our hearts go out to the Rickard and Garcia families, to Sylvia \nand Rick's two sons, Richard, Jr. and David, and to the many millions \nof others whose lives have been made better by the significant \nachievements of my friend, Sylvia Rickard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/06/senate-section/article/S10-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE SUBSEQUENT TO SINE DIE ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n                         Enrolled Bills Signed\n\n  Under the order of the Senate of January 3, 2013, the Secretary of \nthe Senate, on December 17, 2014, subsequent to the sine die \nadjournment of the Senate, received a message from the House of \nRepresentatives announcing that the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Harris) \nhas signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 1206.

A bill to amend title 17, United States Code, with respect to \nthe definition of ``widow'' and ``widower'', and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, over the past few years we have seen \nremarkable progress in one of the defining civil rights issues of our \nera--ensuring that all lawfully married couples are treated equally \nunder the law. In 2011, when I chaired the first Congressional hearing \nto repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, only 5 States, including \nVermont, recognized same-sex marriage. With today's lifting of \nFlorida's unconstitutional same-sex marriage ban, couples in 36 States \nand the District of Columbia now have the freedom to marry. This is \nwelcome progress, and I hope we will see similar advancements in even \nmore States this year so that all Americans can marry the one they \nlove.\n  Despite this tremendous progress, there is still more to be done to \nensure that no person faces discrimination based on who they marry or \nwish to marry. As I said when the Supreme Court struck down Section 3 \nof the Defense of Marriage Act, ``All couples who are lawfully married \nunder state law, including in Vermont, should be entitled to the same \nFederal protections afforded to all other married couples.'' Court \nchallenges will continue this year in the remaining States that do not \nrecognize marriage equality. But in Congress, there are several steps \nwe can take immediately to help ensure our Federal laws treat all \nmarriages equally.\n  Surprisingly, the Copyright Act, which protects our Nation's diverse \ncreative voices, still bears vestiges of discrimination. A provision in \nthe Act grants rights to the surviving spouse of a copyright owner only \nif the marriage is recognized in the owner's State of residence at the \ntime he or she dies. This means that a writer who lawfully marries his \nor her partner in Vermont or California is not a ``spouse'' under the \nCopyright Act if they move to Michigan, Georgia, or one of the other \nStates that do not currently recognize their marriage.\n  Congress should close this discriminatory loophole to ensure our \nFederal statutes live up to our Nation's promise of equality under the \nlaw. As the Supreme Court recognized in striking down key portions of \nthe Defense of Marriage Act, it is wrong for the Federal Government to \ndeny benefits or privileges to couples who have lawfully wed.\n  Today I am reintroducing the Copyright and Marriage Equality Act in \nthe Senate to correct this problem. The bill, which I introduced in the \nSenate last Congress and which a bipartisan group of lawmakers \nincluding Representatives Derek Kilmer, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and Jared \nPolis plans to reintroduce in the House of Representatives soon, amends \nthe Copyright Act to look simply at whether a couple is lawfully \nmarried--not where a married couple happens to live when the copyright \nowner dies. It will ensure that the rights attached to the works of our \nNation's gay and lesbian authors, musicians, painters, photographers, \nand other creators pass to their widows and widowers. Artists are part \nof the creative lifeblood of our Nation, and our laws should protect \ntheir families equally.\n  When I introduced this bill last year, it failed to get the support \nof a single Republican in the Senate. I hope that in this Congress, \nRepublicans will consider joining this effort to correct\n\n[[Page S13]]\n\nthese remnants of discrimination in our Federal laws. On the issue of \nmarriage equality, the arc of history is at long last bending towards \njustice, so that all Americans one day will be free to marry the one \nthey love. Statutes like the Copyright Act, or laws governing the \nSocial Security Administration and Department of Veterans Affairs which \nalso contain remnants of discrimination, are no place for inequality in \nour country. I urge the Senate to take up and pass this important piece \nof legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 23\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to clarify that an \nauthorization to use military force, a declaration of war, or any \nsimilar authority shall not authorize the detention without charge \nor trial of a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United \nStates; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: By Mrs. FEINSTEIN \n(for herself and Mr. Lee): S. 24. A bill to clarify that an \nauthorization to use military force, a declaration of war, or any \nsimilar authority shall not authorize the detention without charge \nor trial of a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United \nStates; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Due \nProcess Guarantee Act, which passed the Senate in 2012 with 67 votes as \nan amendment to the Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2013.\n  Unfortunately, the amendment was taken out in the Conference \nCommittee that year. It is my hope that the Senate will pass this \nlegislation again this year, and this time the House will support it so \nthat it can finally be enacted into law to protect Americans from being \ndetained indefinitely.\n  The bipartisan bill I am introducing today, with Senator Lee as the \nlead co-sponsor, is almost identical to the amendment that passed the \nSenate in December 2012 with 67 votes. The previous version of this \nbill had a hearing in the Judiciary Committee on February 29, 2012.\n  This legislation is necessary to prevent the U.S. Government from \ndetaining its citizens indefinitely.\n  Unfortunately, indefinite detention has been a part of America's not-\ntoo-distant past. The internment of Japanese-Americans during World War \nII remains a dark spot on our Nation's legacy, and is something we \nshould never repeat.\n  To ensure that this reprehensible experience would never happen \nagain, Congress passed and President Nixon signed into law the Non-\nDetention Act of 1971, which repealed a 1950 statue that explicitly \nallowed the indefinite detention of U.S. citizens.\n  The Non-Detention Act of 1971 clearly states:\n\n       No citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained the \n     United States except pursuant to an act of Congress.\n\n  Despite the shameful history of indefinite detention of Americans and \nthe legal controversy over the issue since 9/11, during debate on the \ndefense authorization bill in past years, some in the Senate have \nadvocated for allowing the indefinite detention of U.S. citizens.\n  Proponents of indefinitely detaining U.S. citizens argue that the \nAuthorization for Use of Military Force, AUMF, that was enacted shortly \nafter 9/11 is, quote, ``an act of Congress,'' in the language of the \nNon-Detention Act of 1971, that authorizes the indefinite detention of \nAmerican citizens regardless of where they are captured.\n  They further assert that their position is justified by the U.S. \nSupreme Court's plurality decision in the 2004 case of Hamdi v. \nRumsfeld. However, the Hamdi case involved an American captured on the \nbattlefield in Afghanistan.\n  Yaser Esam Hamdi was a U.S. citizen who took up arms on behalf of the \nTaliban and was captured on the battlefield in Afghanistan. The divided \nCourt did effectively uphold his military detention, so some of my \ncolleagues use this case to argue that the military can indefinitely \ndetain even American citizens who are arrested domestically here on \nU.S. soil, far from the battlefield of Afghanistan.\n  However, the Supreme Court's opinion in the Hamdi case was a muddled \ndecision by a four-vote plurality that recognized the power of the \ngovernment to detain U.S. citizens captured in such circumstances as \n``enemy combatants'' for some period, but otherwise repudiated the \ngovernment's broad assertions of executive authority to detain citizens \nwithout charge or trial.\n  In particular, the Court limited its holding to citizens captured in \nan area of, quote, ``active combat operations'', unquote, and concluded \nthat even in those circumstances the U.S. Constitution and the Due \nProcess Clause guarantees U.S. citizens certain rights, including the \nability to challenge their enemy combatant status before an impartial \njudge.\n  The plurality's opinion stated:\n\n       It [the Government] has made clear, however, that, for \n     purposes of this case, the `enemy combatant' that it is \n     seeking to detain is an individual who, it alleges, was `part \n     of or supporting forces hostile to the United States or \n     coalition partners' in Afghanistan and who `` `engaged in an \n     armed conflict against the United States'' there. Brief for \n     Respondents 3. We therefore answer only the narrow question \n     before us: whether the detention of citizens falling within \n     that definition is authorized.''\n\n  The opinion goes on to say at page 517 that ``we conclude that the \nAUMF is explicit congressional authorization for the detention of \nindividuals in the narrow category we describe . . .''\n  Indeed, the plurality later emphasized that it was discussing a \ncitizen captured on a foreign battlefield. Criticizing Justice Scalia's \ndissenting opinion, the opinion says, ``Justice Scalia largely ignores \nthe context of this case: a United States citizen captured in a foreign \ncombat zone.'' The plurality italicized and emphasized the word \n``foreign'' in that sentence.\n  Thus, to the extent the Hamdi case permits the government to detain a \nU.S. citizen ``until the end of hostilities,'' it does so only under a \nvery limited set of circumstances, namely citizens taking an active \npart in hostilities, who are captured in Afghanistan, and who are \nafforded certain due process protections, at a minimum.\n  Additionally, decisions by the lower courts have contributed to the \ncurrent state of legal ambiguity when it comes to the indefinite \ndetention of U.S. citizens, such as Jose Padilla, a U.S. citizen who \nwas arrested in Chicago in 2002. He was initially detained pursuant to \na material witness warrant based on the 9/11 terrorist attacks and \nlater designated as an ``enemy combatant'' who conspired with al-Qaeda \nto carry out terrorist attacks including a plot to detonate a ``dirty \nbomb'' inside the U.S.\n  Padilla was transferred to the military brig in South Carolina where \nhe was detained for three and a half years while seeking habeas corpus \nrelief. Padilla was never charged with attempting to carry out the \n``dirty bomb'' plot. Instead, Padilla was released from military \ncustody in November 2005 and transferred to Federal civilian custody in \nFlorida where he was indicted on other charges in Federal court related \nto terrorist plots overseas.\n  While he was indefinitely detailed by the military, Padilla filed a \nhabeas corpus petition which was litigated at first in the Second \nCircuit Court of Appeals, and then in the Fourth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. In a 2003 decision by the Second Circuit known as Padilla v. \nRumsfeld, the Court of Appeals held that the AUMF did not authorize his \ndetention, saying: ``we conclude that clear congressional authorization \nis required for detentions of American citizens on American soil \nbecause 18 U.S.C.\n\n[[Page S14]]\n\nSec. 4001(a) the ``Non-Detention Act'', prohibits such detentions \nabsent specific congressional authorization. Congress's Authorization \nfor Use of Military Force Joint Resolution, . . . passed shortly after \nthe attacks of September 11, 2001, is not such an authorization.''\n  This requirement for ``clear congressional authorization'' to detain \nis known as the Second Circuit's ``Clear Statement Rule.''\n  However, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals reached the opposite \nconclusion, finding that the AUMF did authorize his detention. It is \nworth pointing out, however, that their analysis turned entirely on the \ndisputed claims that ``Padilla associated with forces hostile to the \nUnited States in Afghanistan,'' and, ``like Hamdi, Padilla took up arms \nagainst United States forces in that country in the same way and to the \nsame extent as did Hamdi.''\n  Facing an impending Supreme Court challenge and mounting public \ncriticism for holding a U.S. citizen arrested inside the U.S. as an \nenemy combatant, the Bush administration relented, and ordered Padilla \ntransferred to civilian custody to face criminal conspiracy and \nmaterial support for terrorism charges in Federal court.\n  I believe that the time is now to end the legal ambiguities, and have \nCongress state clearly, once and for all, that the AUMF or other \nauthorities do not authorize indefinite detention of Americans \napprehended in the U.S.\n  To accomplish this, we are introducing legislation again this year \nwhich affirms and strengthens the principles behind the Non-Detention \nAct of 1971.\n  It amends the Non-Detention Act to provide clearly that no military \nauthorization allows the indefinite detention of U.S. citizens or Green \nCard holders who are apprehended inside the U.S.\n  Like the amendment that passed with 67 votes in 2012, the bill \ncreates a new subsection (b) of the Non-Detention Act which clearly \nstates: ``A general authorization to use military force, a declaration \nof war, or any similar authority, on its own, shall not be construed to \nauthorize the imprisonment or detention without charge or trial of a \ncitizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States apprehended \nin the United States.''\n  Like the previous version, this bill amends the Non-Detention Act to \ncodify the Second Circuit's ``Clear Statement Rule'' from the Padilla \ncase. So new subsection (a) will read, ``No citizen or lawful permanent \nresident of the United States shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained \nby the United States except consistent with the Constitution and \npursuant to an act of Congress that expressly authorizes such \nimprisonment or detention.''\n  Making the Clear Statement Rule part of subsection (a) strengthens \nthe Non-Detention Act even more by requiring Congress to be explicit if \nit wants to detain U.S. citizens indefinitely. Subsection (b) clarifies \nthat an authorization to use military force, a declaration of war, or \nany similar authority does not authorize the indefinite detention of a \nU.S. citizen or a Lawful Permanent Resident of the U.S., also known as \na Green Card holder.\n  Some may ask why this legislation protects Green Card holders as well \nas citizens. And others may ask why the bill does not protect all \npersons'' apprehended in the U.S. from indefinite detention.\n  Let me make clear that I would support providing the protections in \nthis amendment to all persons in the United States, whether lawfully or \nunlawfully present. But the question comes, is there enough political \nsupport to expand this amendment to cover others besides U.S. citizens \nand Green Card holders?\n  Wherever we draw the line on who should be covered by this \nlegislation, I believe it violates fundamental American rights to allow \nanyone apprehended on U.S. soil to be detained without charge or trial.\n  The FBI and other law enforcement agencies have proven, time and \nagain, that they are up to the challenge of detecting, stopping, \narresting, and convicting terrorists found on U.S. soil, having \nsuccessfully arrested, detained and convicted hundreds of these heinous \npeople, both before and after 9/11.\n  Specifically, there have been 556 terrorism-related convictions in \nfederal criminal court between 9/11 and the end of 2013, according to \nthe Department of Justice.\n  Also, it is important to understand that suspected terrorists who may \nbe in the U.S. illegally can be detained within the criminal justice \nsystem using at least the following 4 options:\n  They can be charged with a Federal or State crime and held; they can \nbe held for violating immigration laws; they can be held as material \nwitnesses as part of Federal grand jury proceedings; and they can be \nheld for up to 6 months under Section 412 of the Patriot Act.\n  I want to be very clear about what this bill is and is not about. It \nis not about whether citizens such as Hamdi and Padilla, or others who \nwould do us harm, should be captured, interrogated, incarcerated, and \nseverely punished. They should be.\n  But what about an innocent American? What about someone in the wrong \nplace at the wrong time? The beauty of our Constitution is that it \ngives everyone in the United States basic due process rights to a trial \nby a jury of their peers.\n  As President Obama said when referring to the indefinite detention of \nnon-Americans at Guantanamo:\n\n       ``Imagine a future--10 years from now or 20 years from \n     now--when the United States of America is still holding \n     people who have been charged with no crime on a piece of land \n     that is not part of our country. . . . Is that who we are? Is \n     that something that our Founders foresaw? Is that the America \n     we want to leave to our children? Our sense of justice is \n     stronger than that.''\n\n  The same questions could be asked of those who would indefinitely \ndetain Americans arrested on U.S. soil.\n  Is that who we are?\n  Does that reflect the America we want to leave to our children?\n  Now is the time to clarify U.S. law to state unequivocally that the \ngovernment cannot indefinitely detain American citizens and Green Card \nholders captured inside this country without trial or charge.\n  The Federal Government experimented with indefinite detention of U.S. \ncitizens during World War II, a mistake we now recognize as a betrayal \nof our core values.\n  Let us not repeat it. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 27. A bill to make wildlife trafficking a predicate offense under \nracketeering and money laundering statutes and the Travel Act, to \nprovide for the use for conservation purposes of amounts from civil \npenalties, fines, forfeitures, and restitution under such statutes \nbased on such violations, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Wildlife \nTrafficking Enforcement Act of 2015, which I authored along with my \ncolleague Senator Lindsey Graham.\n  This bill will allow the Federal Government to crack down on poachers \nand transnational criminal organizations involved in the global trade \nin illegal wildlife products.\n  Wildlife trafficking has become a global crime that the State \nDepartment estimates is valued at between $8 to $10 billion annually. \nThis ranks it as one of the most lucrative types of organized crime in \nthe world, along with drug and human trafficking.\n  Besides being a major international crime, wildlife trafficking is a \nmorally repugnant practice that threatens some of our world's most \niconic species with extinction.\n  The most disturbing example is that of elephants and rhinoceroses. A \nrecent study estimates that over 100,000 elephants were illegally \npoached in Africa from 2010 to 2012. At this rate, the African elephant \nis being killed faster than the species can reproduce, putting it at \nrisk of being wiped off the face of the earth.\n  Most disturbingly, poachers are slaughtering very young and juvenile \nelephants for their tusks due to the record high demand for ivory in \nplaces like China and the United States.\n  But the illicit ivory trade is not just a threat to African \nelephants; it is also a problem for global security. The State \nDepartment reports that there is increasing evidence that wildlife \ntrafficking is funding armed insurgencies like Al Shabaab and the \nLord's Resistance Army. The illegal ivory trade fuels corruption and \nviolence in Africa.\n\n[[Page S15]]\n\n  The rhinoceros has also been decimated by poaching due to record high \ndemand for its horn. Conservation organizations estimate that hundreds \nof rhinoceroses are illegally slaughtered in Africa each year. It is \ndeeply concerning that the poaching rate for rhinoceroses in Africa \nappears to be increasing.\n  Some populations of rhinoceroses are on the brink of extinction. The \npopulation of the Sumatran rhinoceros has plummeted by over 50 percent \nin the last two decades due to poaching, and it is estimated that only \nabout 100 remain in existence. It is estimated that fewer than 10 \nNorthern White Rhinoceroses remain alive in the wild.\n  The problem is not just confined to elephants and rhinoceroses. \nTigers, leopards, endangered sea turtles, and many other wildlife \nspecies are being decimated by poaching.\n  At its core, this legislation increases criminal penalties for \nwildlife trafficking crimes. The federal government needs stiffer \npenalties in order to go after organized and high volume traffickers. \nThe President asked for this authority in the National Strategy to \nCombat Wildlife Trafficking released last year.\n  Specifically, this bill makes violations of the Endangered Species \nAct, the African Elephant Conservation Act, and the Rhinoceros and \nTiger Conservation Act that involve more than $10,000 of illegal \nwildlife products predicate offenses under the money laundering and \nracketeering statutes and the Travel Act.\n  Currently, each of these wildlife laws carries a maximum prison \nsentence of only one year for a violation. Under this bill, wildlife \ntrafficking violations can be subject to up to a 20-year prison \nsentence, as well as increased fines and penalties of up to $500,000 \nfor an offense.\n  These new penalties will allow the government to change the equation \non wildlife crimes. Wildlife trafficking has increased at dramatic \nrates because the crime is high value and low risk due to weak \npenalties across the world. Under the new authorities, the Federal \nGovernment will have a full range of tools to prosecute the worst \nwildlife trafficking offenders and to put them behind bars with \nsignificant sentences. The new authorities will also act as a deterrent \nto the criminal organizations currently trafficking illicit wildlife \nproducts into and through the United States.\n  As one of the largest markets for products of illicit poaching in the \nworld, the United States has a responsibility to step up and help to \ncombat this scourge. With this legislation, the United States will set \nan example for other countries on the need for each country to \nstrengthen penalties for wildlife trafficking. It is critical that \nother nations around the world with large markets for illicit wildlife \nproducts step up to tackle this global problem.\n  The Wildlife Trafficking Enforcement Act of 2015 will also allow \nfines, penalties, forfeitures, and restitution recovered through use of \nthe bill's new authorities to be transferred to established \nconservation funds at the Departments of the Interior and of Commerce. \nThis will enable the Federal Government to use the monetary penalties \nfrom a wildlife trafficking conviction to benefit the species that was \nharmed. Thus, the bill will both act to punish and deter criminals \nwhile supporting the conservation of those species that are directly \nharmed by poaching.\n  Addressing the issue of wildlife trafficking speaks to our values and \nmorals as a Nation. We have a responsibility to help prevent these \nendangered species, which have existed for thousands of years, from \nbecoming extinct in our lifetime. It is also clear that Federal law's \nweak penalties for wildlife crimes have been exploited by poachers and \ntransnational criminals.\n  I therefore ask all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nwork with me to enact this legislation this year. The stakes for \nendangered species like elephants, tigers, and rhinoceroses could not \nbe higher. If we don't crack down on wildlife trafficking, we will be \ncomplicit in the slaughter.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Cardin, Mr. \n        Durbin, Mr. Franken, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n        Udall, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 28. A bill to limit the use of cluster munitions; to the Committee \non Foreign Relations.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues \nSenators Leahy, Boxer, Durbin, Klobuchar, Murray, Udall, Franken, Wyden \nand Whitehouse to introduce the Cluster Munitions Civilian Protection \nAct of 2015.\n  Our legislation places common sense restrictions on the use of \ncluster munitions. It prevents any funds from being spent to use \ncluster munitions that have a failure rate of more than one percent.\n  In addition, the rules of engagement must specify that: cluster \nmunitions will only be used against clearly defined military targets; \nand will not be used where civilians are known to be present or in \nareas normally inhabited by civilians.\n  Our legislation also includes a national security waiver that allows \nthe President to waive the prohibition on the use of cluster munitions \nwith a failure rate of more than one percent if he determines it is \nvital to protect the security of the United States to do so.\n  However, if the President decides to waive the prohibition, he must \nissue a report to Congress within 30 days on the failure rate of the \ncluster munitions used and the steps taken to protect innocent \ncivilians.\n  Cluster munitions are large bombs, rockets, or artillery shells that \ncontain up to hundreds of small submunitions, or individual \n``bomblets.''\n  They are intended for attacking enemy troop and armor formations \nspread over a wide area.\n  But, in reality, they pose a far more deadly threat to innocent \ncivilians.\n  According to the Cluster Munitions Monitor, over the past fifty \nyears, there have been 19,419 documented cluster munitions deaths in 31 \nnations. The estimated number of total cluster munitions casualties, \nhowever, is an astonishing 55,000 people.\n  While cluster munitions are intended for military targets, in \nactuality civilians have accounted for 94% of cluster munition \ncasualties.\n  Death and injury from unexploded ordnance left behind by cluster \nmunitions continues to kill civilians to this day. Today, 23 States \nremain contaminated by unexploded ordnance left from cluster munitions.\n  Last year, nine of these countries suffered casualties from \nunexploded ordnance. They were: Croatia, Iraq, Laos, Lebanon, Cambodia, \nSouth Sudan, Sudan, Syria and Vietnam.\n  More tragically, despite the risk they pose to civilians, cluster \nbombs continue to be used in conflicts.\n  Since July 2012, Syrian government forces have used cluster munitions \nin 10 of the country's 14 governates.\n  Human Rights Watch has documented that the Syrian government has used \nseven types of cluster munitions to date, six of which were \nmanufactured in the former Soviet Union and the seventh of which is \nEgyptian-made.\n  In 2012 and 2013, the Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor recorded \n1,584 deaths from government-launched cluster munitions in Syria. \nApproximately 97 percent of the deaths directly linked to cluster \nmunitions were civilians.\n  For the first time, Human Rights Watch has also obtained evidence \nthat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, known as ISIL, has also \nused cluster bombs.\n  According to witness testimony and photographic evidence, ISIL used \ncluster bombs on at least two occasions near the besieged town of \nKobani.\n  Terrorist groups and other non-state actors would not be able to \nobtain and use cluster bombs if the world adopted the Oslo Treaty on \nCluster munitions.\n  The Oslo Treaty bans the production, sale, stockpiling and use of \ncluster munitions. It came into effect in 2010 and to date has been \nratified by 88 nations.\n  Under the Treaty, 22 nations have destroyed 1.16 million cluster \nbombs and nearly 140 million submunitions.\n  Unfortunately, the United States is neither a signatory nor state \nparty to the Oslo Treaty.\n  In fact, the United States maintains a stockpile of 5.5 million \ncluster munitions containing 728 million submunitions. These bomblets \nhave an estimated failure rate of between 5 and 15 percent.\n\n[[Page S16]]\n\n  Rather than adopting the increasing international consensus that \ncluster bombs should be banned, the Pentagon continues to assert that \nthey are ``legitimate weapons with clear military utility in combat.''\n  I respectfully disagree. The benefit of using cluster bombs is \noutweighed by the continuing threat they pose to civilians long after \nthe cessation of hostilities.\n  The Cluster Munitions Civilian Protection Act would immediately ban \ncluster bombs with unacceptable unexploded ordnance rates and in areas \nwhere civilians are known to be present.\n  Passing this legislation would move the United States closer to \nabiding by the requirements of the Oslo Treaty, which has been ratified \nby many of our allies, including the United Kingdom, France and \nGermany.\n  Since 2008 the Congress has banned the export of cluster munitions \nwith a greater than one percent unexploded ordnance rate. While banning \nthe export of these indiscriminate weapons was a positive first step, I \nstrongly believe the United States can do better.\n  This body cannot compel the administration to sign the Oslo Treaty. \nHowever, we can surely take steps to abide by its spirit. Passing the \nCluster Munitions Civilian Protection Act would do exactly that.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Bennet, Mr. \n        Blumenthal, Mr. Booker, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Brown, Ms. Cantwell, \n        Mr. Cardin, Mr. Carper, Mr. Casey, Mr. Coons, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \n        Franken, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Heinrich, Ms. Hirono, Mr. Kaine, \n        Mr. King, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Markey, Mrs. McCaskill, \n        Mr. Menendez, Mr. Merkley, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Murphy, Mrs. \n        Murray, Mr. Peters, Mr. Reed, Mr. Reid, Mr. Sanders, Mr. \n        Schatz, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. Shaheen, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Tester, \n        Mr. Udall, Mr. Warner, Ms. Warren, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. \n        Wyden):\n  S. 29. A bill to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act and ensure \nrespect for State regulation of marriage; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nfully repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, DOMA, and ensure that married \nsame-sex couples are accorded equal treatment by the federal \ngovernment.\n  When I first introduced this bill in 2011, only 5 States and the \nDistrict of Columbia recognized same-sex marriage.\n  Today, due to a combination of actions by legislatures, voters, and \nthe courts, 36 States and D.C. recognize same-sex marriage. Florida \njoined the group just this week.\n  This progress is nothing short of amazing. Over 70 percent of \nAmericans now live in a State where same-sex couples can marry.\n  The Supreme Court's landmark decision in United States v. Windsor, \nwhich struck down Section 3 of DOMA, has caused most federal agencies \nto accord equal rights and responsibilities to married same-sex \ncouples.\n  But, despite this progress, the mission of ensuring full equality \nunder Federal law for married same-sex couples is still unaccomplished.\n  This bill will accomplish that mission. It will strike DOMA from \nFederal law, and ensure that legally married same-sex couples are \ntreated equally by the federal government, period.\n  I want to thank my 41 colleagues who have cosponsored this bill.\n  For my colleagues who have not yet supported this bill: if you \nbelieve that couples who are married should be treated that way by the \nfederal government, you should cosponsor this bill. It is as simple as \nthat.\n  Two major agencies, which serve millions and millions of Americans--\nthe Social Security Administration and Department of Veterans Affairs--\nstill deny benefits to some married couples depending on where the \ncouple has lived. This bill would fix that problem.\n  Let me address Social Security first. An example of the \ndiscrimination married same-sex couples still face is the case of Kathy \nMurphy and Sara Barker. According to a legal filing, this couple \nmarried in Massachusetts and shared a ranch house in Texas for nearly \n30 years.\n  In 2010, when Sara was 60 years old, she was diagnosed with an \naggressive form of cancer. Sara went through several surgeries and \nchemotherapy, and Kathy was Sara's caregiver.\n  Sara passed away on March 10, 2012. As the complaint states: ``Kathy \nlost her partner of more than thirty years and the love of her life.''\n  In July 2014--over a year after she applied--Kathy's application for \nsurvivor's benefits from Social Security was denied because they lived \nin Texas together, and Texas does not recognize them as married.\n  This cost her an estimated $1,200 per month in Federal survivor's \nbenefits.\n  Veterans and active-duty military personnel in same-sex marriages \nalso are being denied equal treatment by the Department of Veterans \nAffairs.\n  Many of these brave individuals have served our country overseas or \nin war zones, but they may nevertheless be denied a huge range of \nbenefits our nation grants to those who have served in the Armed \nForces.\n  A court filing by the American Military Partners Association explains \nthat:\n\n       lesbian and gay veterans and their spouses and survivors . \n     . . will be denied or disadvantaged in obtaining spousal \n     veterans benefits such as disability compensation, death \n     pension benefits, home loan guarantees, and rights to burial \n     together in national cemeteries.\n\n  This is wrong. Our married gay and lesbian soldiers put their lives \non the line for our country the same way other soldiers do.\n  We owe them the same debt of gratitude we owe to all other men and \nwomen who serve, and this bill would ensure that we fulfill that solemn \nobligation.\n  Continued discrimination against married same-sex couples is not \nlimited to these benefits programs.\n  Other Federal laws are not part of programs administered by agencies, \nbut they nevertheless are designed to protect families, including \nspouses.\n  Let me just give one example--Section 115 of Title 18. Among other \nthings, this law makes it a crime to assault, kidnap, or murder a \nspouse of Federal law  enforcement officer, with the intent to \ninfluence or retaliate against the officer.\n\n  This law protects the ability of people like FBI agents and federal \nprosecutors to serve the public knowing there is protection from \nviolence against their families.\n  These agents and prosecutors investigate and prosecute people like \ndrug kingpins, terrorists, and organized crime figures.\n  But, even today, it is not clear whether this vital protection for \nthese officers covers those in lawful same- sex marriages everywhere in \nthe country.\n  These public servants, who protect all of us, should not have to \nworry that they lack the full protection we provide to their \ncolleagues--but that is the situation we confront today. This bill \nwould fix it.\n  In addition, Section 2 of DOMA--which was not expressly addressed by \nthe Supreme Court--continues to pose a serious risk to legal relief \nreceived by victims of crime and civil wrongs. This bill would repeal \nit.\n  Section 2 of DOMA is the full faith and credit provision of DOMA, and \nit has been the subject of many misconceptions.\n  When DOMA was enacted, some claimed Section 2 was designed to prevent \nthe Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution from forcing a \nstate to recognize a marriage from another state.\n  But states have never needed permission from Congress to decide \nwhether to recognize an out-of-state marriage. States have done that \nunder their own laws, subject to other constitutional guarantees like \nthe Equal Protection Clause.\n  Thus, repealing Section 2 of DOMA simply would not force a State, or \na religious institution, to recognize a particular marriage.\n  While it is on the books, Section 2 may have a very serious impact: \nit may nullify legal relief awarded to victims of crime and other civil \nwrongs.\n  There is a general rule that the judgments of one state's courts will \nbe enforced in another state's courts.\n  But Section 2 purports to exempt any ``right or claim arising from'' \na same-sex marriage from this rule.\n\n[[Page S17]]\n\n  Imagine a woman killed by a drunk driver. Her surviving spouse would \nhave a civil claim for wrongful death, or might obtain restitution in a \ncriminal case.\n  But DOMA could prevent the court judgments in those cases from being \nenforced in the perpetrator's home State, allowing him to avoid the \nconsequences of his actions.\n  The same problem could arise in numerous types of cases, such as \nassaults, batteries, and insurance claims.\n  Same-sex married couples are the only class of people who are \nburdened by this sort of legal disability, which hinders the court \nsystem from protecting them the same way that it does other citizens.\n  This is wrong, and it must be repealed.\n  As a Senator from California, I come to this bill with a strong sense \nof history.\n  In 1948, the California Supreme Court became the first state court to \nfind that a ban on interracial marriage violates the Equal Protection \nClause. At the time, 29 states still prohibited interracial marriage.\n  Prohibitions on interracial marriage then were eliminated in 13 other \nstates, so that when the Supreme Court decided Loving v. Virginia in \n1967, only 16 states retained bans on interracial marriage.\n  I very much hope that is where we are today on same-sex marriage.\n  People of all stripes have come to believe that loving and committed \nsame-sex couples are worthy of the same dignity and respect other \ncouples receive. Public opinion has changed dramatically, and 36 states \nnow recognize same-sex marriage.\n  The tide has shifted, I hope irreversibly so.\n  But here, in Congress, we still have work to do.\n  We must end the discrimination married same-sex couples continue to \nface at the federal level.\n  DOMA remains on the books, where it should never have been placed. It \ncould be revived by a different Supreme Court majority.\n  A future administration also could interpret other laws differently \nthan this Administration has done, potentially restricting the \navailability of key benefits even further.\n  The solution is simple: pass this bill, which would eliminate DOMA \nand accord equal treatment under Federal law for married same-sex \ncouples.\n  Let me again thank my cosponsors for joining me in this effort, and \nto urge my other colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Donnelly, Ms. Murkowski, and Mr. \n        Manchin):\n  S. 30. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe definition of full-time employee for purposes of the employer \nmandate in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today, Senator Donnelly and I are \nreintroducing the Forty Hours is Full-time Act to correct a serious \nflaw in the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, that is \nalready causing workers to have their hours reduced and their pay cut. \nWe are pleased to be joined in this bipartisan effort by Senators \nMurkowski and Manchin. Our legislation would raise the threshold for \n``full-time'' work in Obamacare to the standard 40 hours a week. This \nis consistent with the threshold for overtime eligibility under the \nFair Labor Standards Act, and the common-sense understanding of ``full-\ntime'' work.\n  Under Obamacare, an employee working just 30 hours a week is defined \nas ``full-time,'' a definition that is completely out-of-step with \nstandard employment practices in the U.S. today. According to a survey \npublished by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average American \nactually works 8.7 hours per day, which equates to roughly 44 hours a \nweek. The Obamacare definition is nearly one-third lower than actual \npractice.\n  Similarly, the Obamacare definition of ``full-time'' employee is ten \nhours a week fewer than the 40 hours per week used by the GAO in its \nstudy of the budget and staffing required by the IRS to implement \nObamacare. In that report, the GAO described a ``full-time equivalent'' \nas: ``a measure of staff hours equal to those of an employee who works \n2,080 hours per year, or 40 hours per week. . . .'' Even the Office of \nManagement and Budget recognizes that 30-hours is not ``full-time.'' A \ncircular it issued to Federal agencies actually directs them to \ncalculate staffing levels using more than 40 hours a week as a ``full-\ntime equivalent.''\n  The effect of using the 30-hour a week threshold is to artificially \ndrive-up the number of ``full-time'' workers for purposes of \ncalculating the penalties to which employers are exposed under \nObamacare. These penalties begin at $40,000 for businesses with 50 \nemployees, plus $2,000 for each additional ``full-time equivalent'' \nemployee. While these draconian penalities were scheduled to begin in \nJanuary of last year, we have yet to feel their full effect because the \nObama administration delayed their implementation through 2014, perhaps \nknowing the negative impact that will result. But that artificial \ngrace-period expired January 1 for employers with 100 or more workers \nand will end for employers with between 50 and 99 employees in January \nof next year.\n  Needless to say, these penalties will force many employers to \nrestrict or reduce the hours their employees are allowed to work, so \nthey are no longer considered ``full-time'' for the purposes of the \nlaw. In addition, these penalties will discourage employers from \ngrowing or adding jobs, particularly those close to the 50-job trigger.\n  These are not hypothetical concerns. According to the Investors \nBusiness Daily, more than 450 employers had cut work hours or staffing \nlevels in response to Obamacare as of September of last year. Employees \nof for-profit businesses are not the only ones threatened by \nObamacare's illogical definition of full-time work. Public sector \nemployees and those who work for non-profits are also affected.\n  I am concerned that educators, school employees, and students will be \nparticularly hard hit. As the ASAA, the School Superintendents \nAssociation, explained in a letter in support of our bill, Obamacare's \n30-hour threshold puts an ``undue burden on school systems across the \nNation, many of [which] will struggle to staff their schools to meet \ntheir educational mission'' while complying with this requirement.\n  For example, the school superintendent of Bangor, ME, has told me \nthat Obamacare will require that school district to reduce substitute \nteacher hours to make sure they don't exceed 29 hours a week. This will \nharm not only the substitute teachers who want and need more work, but \nit will also harm students by causing unnecessary disruption in the \nclassroom.\n  Likewise, in Indiana, a county school district had to reduce the \nhours of part-time school bus drivers to make sure they do not work \nmore than the 30-hour threshold. As a result, the school district has \nbeen forced to cut field trips and transportation to athletic events, \nand employees who used to work more than 30 hours total in two jobs \nhave been forced to give up one of their jobs, hurting their financial \nsecurity.\n  The 30-hour rule will also affect our Nation's institutions of higher \neducation. According to the College and University Professional \nAssociation for Human Resources, Obamacare's full-time work definition \nhas already caused 122 schools to announce new policies capping hours \nfor students and faculty.\n  It is troubling that the 30-hour threshold will also harm delivery of \nhome care services. The requirement will likely result in reduced \naccess to needed services for some of our Nation's most vulnerable \ncitizens: home-bound seniors, individuals with disabilities, and \nrecently discharged hospital and nursing home patients. Information \nprovided to my office by the Home Care & Hospice Alliance of Maine \nshows that many of its member organizations will be forced to reduce \nwork hours for employees or even to cease operations due to Obamacare's \ndefinition of ``full-time'' work. If that happens, hundreds of home \ncare workers could lose their jobs, and a thousand seniors could lose \naccess to home care services--in Maine alone.\n  Data from Maine's Medicaid program show that home care services are \nextremely cost-effective compared to alternatives. Thus, by making it \nharder for home care service providers to give their workers the hours \nthey need,\n\n[[Page S18]]\n\nObamacare's definition of ``full-time'' work will end up reducing the \nhome care services available to seniors, depriving them of care or \nforcing them into costlier care, driving up Federal costs.\n  Before I close, I would like to read a few lines from a letter I \nrecently received from Randy Wadleigh, the owner of a well-known and \nmuch-loved restaurant institution in Maine called ``Governor's.'' \nRandy's letter sums up what Maine employers have always told me--their \nemployees are the heart and souls of their businesses, and are the face \nof their companies to the public. As Randy puts it, businesses \nrecognize the importance of their workers ``because without GREAT \nemployees, businesses really don't have anything. [The 30-hour \nthreshold] is hurting many of our employees. They don't understand it, \nthey can't afford it and they just want to work more hours.''\n  The bipartisan bill we are introducing today will protect these \nworkers by changing the definition of ``full-time'' work in the ACA to \n40 hours a week, and making a corresponding change in the definition of \n``full-time equivalent'' employee to 174 hours per month. This is a \nsensible definition in keeping with actual practice.\n  Among the many organizations that have endorsed our bill are: the \nCollege & University Professional Association for Human Resources, the \nNational Association for Home Care & Hospice, the American Hotel & \nLodging Association, the American Staffing Association, the Asian \nAmerican Hotel Owners Association, the Associated Builders and \nContractors, the Food Marketing Institute, the International Franchise \nAssociation, the National Association of Convenience Stores, the \nNational Association of Health Underwriters, the American Rental \nAssociation, the National Association of Manufacturers, the National \nAssociation of Theatre Owners, the National Grocers Association, the \nNational Federation of Independent Business, the National Restaurant \nAssociation, the National Retail Federation, the Retail Industry \nLeaders Association, ASAA, the School Superintendents Association, the \nSociety for Human Resource Management, and the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce.\n  Regardless of the varying views of Senators on the Affordable Care \nAct, surely we ought to be able to agree to fix this problem in the law \nthat is hurting workers' paychecks and creating chaos for employers. I \nurge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                December 19, 2014.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of AASA: The School \n     Superintendents Association, the Association of Educational \n     Service Agencies, the National Rural Education Association \n     and the National Rural Education Advocacy Coalition, I write \n     to express our support for the Forty Hours is Full Time Act. \n     Collectively, we represent public school superintendents, \n     educational service agency administrators and school system \n     leaders across the country, as well as our nation's rural \n     schools and communities. We have followed closely the \n     Affordable Care Act and stand ready to implement the law, and \n     see your proposed legislation as one way to alleviate an \n     unnecessarily burdensome regulation.\n       The Forty House is Full Time Act would change the \n     definition of ``full time'' in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) \n     to 40 hours per week and the number of hours counted toward a \n     ``full time equivalent'' employee to 174 hours per month. The \n     current ACA arbitrarily sets the bar for a full work week to \n     30 hours. This is inconsistent with how most Americans think: \n     full-time is a 40 hour work week. The current definition \n     causes confusion among employers who struggle to understand \n     and comply with the new requirements, especially ones that \n     are in conflict with long-standing practices built on the \n     long-standing 40-hour work week premise.\n       We welcome the opportunity to ensure our employees have a \n     positive work environment and we remain committed to \n     providing a robust set of work benefits. We are concerned \n     that the ACA, as currently written, puts additional, undue \n     burden on school systems across the nation, many of whom will \n     struggle to staff their schools to meet their educational \n     mission while meeting the strict 30-hour regulation.\n       We applaud your continued leadership on this issue and look \n     forward to seeing the Forty Hours is Full Time Act move \n     forward.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Noelle M. Ellerson,\n          AASA, The School Superintendents Association, Associate \n      Executive Director, Policy & Advocacy, AESA, NREA and NREAC \n     Legislative Liaison.\n                                  ____\n\n         Governor's Restaurant & Bakery, Governor's Management \n           Company, Inc.,\n                                  Old Town, ME, December 22, 2014.\n     Re Definition of full time hours for the ACA\n\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     413 Dirksen Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Susan: Governor's Restaurants have been a staple in \n     Maine since 1959. We have 6 locations and employ over 300 \n     full and part time fine Maine folks while serving the great \n     people of Maine. In general, we've had longevity because we \n     pay attention to business and play by the rules dictated to \n     us by local, state and federal agencies. In a nutshell, we \n     take pride in doing the right things.\n       As our company's CEO, I recently conducted health insurance \n     enrollment meetings at all of our locations for those 100+ \n     eligible full time employees (as currently defined at 30 \n     hours per week}. We are strongly in favor of changing the \n     current definition of a full time employee from 30 hours to \n     40 hours . . . but not necessarily for the reason(s} you may \n     think.\n       On behalf of our employees, we've just got to increase the \n     threshold to 40 hours. Our offered health plan is defined as \n     affordable and meets minimum standards as defined by the law, \n     but when you express to the employee that they must \n     contribute +/-$30 per week it becomes a heartfelt choice to \n     pay for food, child care, rent OR pay for health care. On \n     more than one occasion, I had employees (all of whom worked \n     less than 32 hours per week} break down in tears because they \n     just can't afford coverage. At the same time, those that \n     worked over 38 hours, were more likely to participate and in \n     fact could afford coverage.\n       When ACA was first introduced, I could never understand why \n     the law defined 30 hours per week. Our company has had to \n     make dramatic cuts in hours to some staffers to reduce \n     exposure. But once again this hurts the employee.\n       So you see the obvious selfish thing to do as a business \n     person is to cry foul about the health care law and how it \n     affects our bottom line. But our company takes a bit of a \n     different approach. We recognize the importance of our people \n     because without GREAT employees, business owners really don't \n     have anything. This law is hurting many of our employees. \n     They don't understand it, they can't afford it and they just \n     want to work more hours. 30 hours is too restrictive to them. \n     40 would be better for them and ultimately for business and \n     such change would benefit both the employee and the employer.\n       Thanks for your great work in Washington.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Randy Wadleigh,\n\n                                                    Owner and CEO,\n                                    Governor's Management Company.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Udall, Mr. Blumenthal, Ms. \n        Klobuchar, Mr. Grassley, and Ms. Heitkamp):\n  S. 32.

Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the \nTransnational Drug Trafficking Act of 2015 with my colleagues and \nfriends, Senators Charles Grassley, Richard Blumenthal, Heidi Heitkamp, \nAmy Klobuchar and Tom Udall.\n  This bill, which passed the Senate unanimously in the last Congress, \nsupports the Obama Administration's Strategy to Combat Transnational \nOrganized Crime by providing the Department of Justice with crucial \ntools to combat the international drug trade. As drug traffickers find \nnew and innovative ways to avoid prosecution, we cannot allow them to \nexploit loopholes because our laws lag behind.\n  This legislation has three main components. First, it puts in place \npenalties for extraterritorial drug trafficking activity when \nindividuals have reasonable cause to believe that illegal drugs will be \ntrafficked into the United States. Current law says that drug \ntraffickers must know that illegal drugs will be trafficked into the \nUnited States and this legislation would lower the knowledge threshold \nto reasonable cause to believe.\n  The Department of Justice has informed my office that, it sees drug \ntraffickers from countries like Colombia, Bolivia and Peru who produce \ncocaine but then outsource transportation of the cocaine to the United \nStates to violent Mexican drug trafficking organizations. Under current \nlaw, our ability to prosecute source-nation traffickers from these \ncountries is limited since there is often no direct evidence of their \nknowledge that illegal drugs were intended for the United\n\n[[Page S19]]\n\nStates. But let me be clear: drugs produced in these countries fuel \nviolent crime throughout the Western Hemisphere as well as addiction \nand death in the United States.\n  Second, this bill puts in place penalties for precursor chemical \nproducers from foreign countries, such as those producing \npseudoephedrine used for methamphetamine, who illegally ship precursor \nchemicals into the United States knowing that these chemicals will be \nused to make illegal drugs.\n  Third, this bill makes a technical fix to the Counterfeit Drug \nPenalty Enhancement Act, which increases penalties for the trafficking \nof counterfeit drugs. The fix, requested by the Department of Justice, \nputs in place a ``knowing'' requirement which was unintentionally left \nout of the original bill. The original bill makes the mere sale of a \ncounterfeit drug a Federal felony offense regardless of whether the \nseller knew the drug was counterfeit. Under the original bill, a \npharmacist could be held criminally liable if he or she unwittingly \nsold counterfeit drugs to a customer. Adding a ``knowing'' requirement \ncorrects this problem.\n  As Co-Chair of the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control \nand as a public servant who has focused on narcotics issues for many \nyears, I know that we cannot sit idly by as drug traffickers find new \nways to circumvent our laws. The illegal drug trade is constantly \nevolving and it is critical that our legal framework keeps pace. We \nmust provide the Department of Justice with all of the tools it needs \nto prosecute drug kingpins both here at home and abroad.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mrs. Shaheen, Ms. Ayotte, Mr. \n        Schumer, Mr. Blumenthal, Ms. Klobuchar, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \n        Portman, and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 36. A bill to address the continued threat posed by dangerous \nsynthetic drugs by amending the Controlled Substances Act relating to \ncontrolled substance analogues; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the \nProtecting Our Youth from Dangerous Synthetic Drugs Act of 2015, with \nmy colleagues, Senators Kelly Ayotte, Richard Blumenthal, Barbara \nBoxer, Amy Klobuchar, Rob Portman, Charles Schumer, Jeanne Shaheen and \nSheldon Whitehouse. This legislation addresses the significant harm \nthat synthetic drugs cause our communities.\n  When Congress outlawed several synthetic drugs in 2012, traffickers \ndid not stop producing them. Instead, they slightly altered the drugs' \nchemical structure to skirt the law, producing ``controlled substance \nanalogues'' which are dangerous, chemically similar to Schedule I \nsubstances, and mimic the effects of drugs like ecstasy, cocaine, PCP, \nand LSD.\n  Manufacturers of synthetic drugs often prey upon youth, selling \nproducts such as Scooby Snax, Potpourri, and Joker Herbal. But make no \nmistake: these products are dangerous. In the first ten months of 2014 \nalone, poison centers nationwide responded to approximately 3,900 calls \nrelated to synthetic drugs.\n  Under current law, determining whether a substance meets the vague \nlegal criteria of a ``controlled substance analogue'' results in a \n``battle of experts'' inside the courtroom. Significantly, a substance \nruled to be an analogue in one case is not automatically an analogue in \na second case.\n  The Protecting Our Youth from Dangerous Synthetics Drug Act addresses \nthese issues. This bill creates an interagency committee of scientists \nthat will establish and maintain an administrative list of controlled \nsubstance analogues. The Committee is structured to respond quickly \nwhen new synthetic drugs enter the market.\n  Because virtually all of these controlled substance analogues arrive \nin bulk from outside our borders, the bill makes it illegal to import a \ncontrolled substance analogue on the list unless the importation is \nintended for non-human use.\n  Finally, the bill directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to review, \nand if appropriate, amend the Federal sentencing guidelines for \nviolations of the Controlled Substances Act pertaining to controlled \nsubstance analogues.\n  In sum, this bill sends a strong message to drug traffickers who \nattempt to circumvent our Nation's laws: no matter how you alter the \nchemical structure of synthetic drugs to try to get around the law, we \nwill ban these substances to keep them away from our children.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself and Mr. Brown):\n  S. 37. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n1965 to provide for State accountability in the provision of access to \nthe core resources for learning, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to reintroduce the Core \nOpportunity Resources for Equity and Excellence Act with my colleague \nSenator Brown. I would also like to thank Representative Fudge for \nintroducing companion legislation in the House of Representatives. This \nyear, we will be commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act. Now is the time to reaffirm our commitment \nto educational equity, and in the words of President Johnson ``bridge \nthe gap between helplessness and hope.''\n  As we embark upon reauthorizing this landmark legislation, we must \nensure that our accountability systems in education measure our \nprogress towards equity and excellence for all children. The CORE Act \nwill help advance that goal by requiring states to include fair and \nequitable access to the core resources for learning in their \naccountability systems.\n  More than 60 years after the landmark decision of Brown v. Board of \nEducation, one of the great challenges still facing this nation is \nstemming the tide of rising inequality. We have seen the rich get \nricher while middle class and low-income families have lost ground. We \nsee disparities in opportunity starting at birth and growing over a \nlifetime. With more than one in five school-aged children living in \nfamilies in poverty, according to Department of Education statistics, \nwe cannot afford nor should we tolerate a public education system that \nfails to provide resources and opportunities for the children who need \nthem the most.\n  We should look to hold our education system accountable for results \nand resources. And we know that resources matter. A recent study by \nresearchers at Northwestern University and the University of California \nat Berkeley found that increasing per pupil spending by 20 percent for \nlow-income students over the course of their K-12 schooling results in \ngreater high school completion, higher levels of educational \nattainment, increased lifetime earnings, and reduced adult poverty.\n  In addition to funding, there are other opportunity gaps that we need \nto address. Survey data from the Department of Education's Office of \nCivil Rights show troubling disparities, such as the fact that Black, \nLatino, American Indian, Native Alaskan students, and English learners \nattend schools with higher concentrations of inexperienced teachers; \nnationwide, one in five high schools lacks a school counselor; and \nbetween 10 and 25 percent of high schools across the nation do not \noffer more than one of the core courses in the typical sequence of high \nschool math and science, such as Algebra I and II, geometry, biology, \nand chemistry.\n  We are reintroducing the CORE Act to ensure that equity remains at \nthe center of our federal education policy. Specifically, the CORE Act \nwill require state accountability plans and state and district report \ncards to include measures on how well the state and districts provide \nthe core resources for learning to their students. These resources \ninclude: high quality instructional teams, including licensed and \nprofession-ready teachers, principals, school librarians, counselors, \nand education support staff; rigorous academic standards and curricula \nthat lead to college and career readiness by high school graduation and \nare accessible to all students, including students with disabilities \nand English learners; equitable and instructionally appropriate class \nsizes; up-to-date instructional materials, technology, and supplies; \neffective school library programs; school facilities and technology, \nincluding physically and environmentally sound buildings and well-\nequipped instructional space, including laboratories and libraries; \nspecialized instructional support teams, such as counselors, social\n\n[[Page S20]]\n\nworkers, nurses, and other qualified professionals; and effective \nfamily and community engagement programs.\n  These are things that parents in well-resourced communities expect \nand demand. We should do no less for children in economically \ndisadvantaged communities. We should do no less for minority students \nor English learners or students with disabilities.\n  Under the CORE Act, States that fail to make progress on resource \nequity would not be eligible to apply for competitive grants authorized \nunder the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. For school districts \nidentified for improvement, the State would have to identify gaps in \naccess to the core resources for learning and develop an action plan in \npartnership with the local school district to address those gaps.\n  The CORE Act is supported by a diverse group of organizations, \nincluding the American Association of Colleges of Teacher Education, \nAmerican Federation of Teachers, American Library Association, \nCoalition for Community Schools, Education Law Center, Fair Test, First \nFocus Campaign for Children, League of United Latin American Citizens, \nNational Association of School Psychologists, National Education \nAssociation, National Latino Education Research and Policy Project, \nOpportunity Action, Public Advocacy for Kids, Public Advocates, Inc., \nSoutheast Asia Resource Action Center, and the Texas Center for \nEducation Policy.\n  Working with this strong group of advocates and my colleagues in the \nSenate and in the House, it is my hope that we can build the support to \ninclude the CORE Act in the reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act. I urge my colleagues to join us by \ncosponsoring this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/06/senate-section/article/S20-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S20]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 1--INFORMING THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES THAT \n                  A QUORUM OF EACH HOUSE IS ASSEMBLED\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

Res. 20) limiting certain uses of the \n     filibuster in the Senate to improve the legislative process.\n\n  Mr. UDALL. I ask for its immediate consideration and to send the \nresolution over, under the rule, I, therefore, object to my own \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The resolution will go over, under the rule.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about our continuing \neffort to change the Senate rules as we begin the 114th Congress. This \nis the same process Senators Merkley, Harkin, and I used at the \nbeginning of the last Congress when we introduced a similar resolution. \nAt that time, Majority Leader Reid wanted to have the debate about \nreforming our rules after the inauguration.\n  He was willing to work with us and protect our interests until we \ncould debate our proposal. By doing so, he preserved the right of a \nsimple majority of this body to amend the rules in accordance with \narticle I, section 5 of the Constitution.\n  I hope Majority Leader McConnell will extend to us this same courtesy \nif he chooses to address other issues before rules reform.\n  It has been the tradition at the beginning of many Congresses that a \nmajority of the Senate has asserted its right to adopt or amend the \nrules. Just as Senators of both parties have done in the past, we do \nnot acquiesce to any provision of Senate rules--adopted by a previous \nCongress--that would deny the majority that right.\n  The resolution I am offering today is based on proposals we \nintroduced at the start of the 112th and 113th Congresses. At that \ntime, many called our efforts a power grab by the majority. But we were \nvery clear. We would support these changes even if we were in the \nminority, and here we are today, reintroducing the reform package as \nMembers of the minority.\n  These changes do not strip minority rights. They allow the body to \nfunction as our Founders intended. The heart of our proposal is the \ntalking filibuster. The filibuster once was a tool that was used \nsparingly. It allowed the minority to be heard. Today it is abused too \noften and far too easily.\n  I have said many times that the Senate has become a graveyard for \ngood ideas. The shovel is the broken filibuster and other procedural \ntactics.\n  The system is broken. But in the last election I think the message \nwas clear. The electorate said: Fix it, do your job, and make the \ngovernment work. That is what our resolution is intended to do.\n  Our reforms were not adopted in the last Congress, but we made some \nprogress. Strong support for fixing the Senate led leaders Reid and \nMcConnell to address the dysfunction in the Senate and make some \nmoderate changes.\n  Unfortunately, it did not take long for the leaders' gentlemen's \nagreement to break down. In November 2013 the abuse of the rules--and \nthe obstruction--reached a tipping point, and so the majority acted \nwithin the precedence of the Senate. We changed the rules to prevent \nthe minority from abusing the rules and obstructing scores of qualified \nnominees for judicial and executive appointments.\n  I believe that drastic step was unfortunate, but it was also \nnecessary. The minority has a right to voice objections but not to \nabuse the rules to obstruct justice by preventing judges from being \nconfirmed or by preventing the President from getting his team in \nplace.\n  By changing the rules, the 113th Senate was able to confirm 96 \njudges. In fact, it confirmed more judges than any modern Congress \nsince 1980.\n  The 113th Congress also confirmed 293 executive nominations in 2014--\nthe most since 2010.\n  That is an incredible change. It was a bold but necessary action. But \nit also led to even greater polarization in the Senate. That \npolarization could have been prevented if the Senate had adopted our \nreforms at the beginning of the 113th Congress.\n  That is why I strongly urge the new majority leader to continue the \nchange\n\n[[Page S24]]\n\nthat was adopted in November. It allows most judicial and executive \nbranch appointees to be confirmed by a straight majority vote. I urge \nhim to continue the progress we made last Congress and adopt the rest \nof our proposed reforms at the start of this Congress.\n  Anyone who has watched this Senate try to legislate in the past few \nyears knows we still are hobbled by dysfunction. We voted on cloture \n218 times just over the past 2 years. To put that in perspective, the \nSenate voted on cloture only 38 times in the 50 years after the rule \nwas adopted in 1917. We cannot continue down this path.\n  The unprecedented use of the filibuster and other procedural tactics \nby both parties has prevented the Senate from getting its work done. \nThe Senate needs to return to its his historical practice and function \nas a deliberative yet majoritarian body, when filibusters were rare and \nbipartisanship was the norm.\n  We believe the proposed rule changes in our resolution provide \ncommonsense reforms. This will restore the best traditions of the \nSenate and allow it to conduct the business the American people expect.\n  We have one goal, whether we are in the majority or in the minority: \nto give the American people the government they expect and deserve, a \ngovernment that works.\n  We said before, and we say it again, that we can do this--with \nrespect for the minority, with respect for differing points of view, \nwith respect for this Chamber, but, most of all with respect for the \npeople who send us here.\n  The right to change the rules at the beginning of a new Congress is \nsupported by history and by the Constitution. Article I, section 5 is \nvery clear. The Senate can adopt and amend its rules at the beginning \nof the new Congress by a simple majority vote. This is known as the \nconstitutional option, and it is well named.\n  It has been used numerous times--often with bipartisan support--since \nthe cloture provision was adopted in 1917.\n  Opponents of the Constitutional Option say that the rules can only be \nchanged with a two-thirds supermajority, as the current filibuster rule \nrequires. And they have repeatedly said any attempt to amend the rules \nby a simple majority is ``breaking the rules to change the rules.'' \nThis simply is not true.\n  The supermajority requirement to change Senate rules is in direct \nconflict with the U.S. Constitution. Article I Section 5 of the \nConstitution states that, ``Each House may determine the Rules of its \nProceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behavior, and, with the \nConcurrence of two thirds, expel a Member.'' When the Framers required \na supermajority, they explicitly stated so, as they did for expelling a \nmember. On all other matters, such as determining the chamber's rules, \na majority requirement is clearly implied.\n  There have been three rulings by Vice Presidents, sitting as \nPresident of the Senate, on the meaning of Article I Section 5 as it \napplies to the Senate. In 1957, Vice President Nixon ruled \ndefinitively:\n\n       [W]hile the rules of the Senate have been continued from \n     one Congress to another, the right of a current majority of \n     the Senate at the beginning of a new Congress to adopt its \n     own rules, stemming as it does from the Constitution itself, \n     cannot be restricted or limited by rules adopted by a \n     majority of a previous Congress. Any provision of Senate \n     rules adopted in a previous Congress which has the expressed \n     or practical effect of denying the majority of the Senate in \n     a new Congress the right to adopt the rules under which it \n     desires to proceed is, in the opinion of the Chair, \n     unconstitutional.\n\n  Vice-Presidents Rockefeller and Humphrey made similar rulings at the \nbeginning of later Congresses.\n  In 1979, when others were arguing that the rules could only be \namended in accordance with the previous Senate's rules, Majority Leader \nByrd said the following on the floor:\n\n       There is no higher law, insofar as our Government is \n     concerned, than the Constitution. The Senate rules are \n     subordinate to the Constitution of the United States. The \n     Constitution in Article I, Section 5, says that each House \n     shall determine the rules of its proceedings. Now we are at \n     the beginning of Congress. This Congress is not obliged to be \n     bound by the dead hand of the past.\n\n  In addition to the clear language of the Constitution, there is also \na longstanding common law principle, upheld in the Supreme Court, that \none legislature cannot bind its successors. For example, if the Senate \npassed a bill with a requirement that it takes 75 votes to repeal it in \nthe future, that would violate this principle and be unconstitutional. \nSimilarly, the Senate of one Congress cannot adopt procedural rules \nthat a majority of the Senate in the future cannot amend or repeal.\n  Many of my Republican colleagues have made the same argument. For \nexample, in 2003 Senator John Cornyn wrote in a law review article:\n\n       Just as one Congress cannot enact a law that a subsequent \n     Congress could not amend by majority vote, one Senate cannot \n     enact a rule that a subsequent Senate could not amend by \n     majority vote. Such power, after all, would violate the \n     general common law principle that one parliament cannot bind \n     another.\n\n  So amending our rules at the beginning of a Congress is not \n``breaking the rules to change the rules.'' It is reaffirming that the \nU.S. Constitution is superior to the Senate rules, and that when there \nis a conflict between them, we follow the Constitution.\n  And I would like to make clear that by moving on to other business, \nwe are not waiving our constitutional right to amend the Senate's rules \nwith a majority vote. In 1975, when the cloture threshold was reduced \nfrom two-thirds to three-fifths, the reform effort lasted until March. \nBut on the first day of that Congress, Senator Mondale introduced his \nresolution and unequivocally stated that he was reserving his right to \ncall for a majority vote at a later date.\n  Senator Mondale made the following statement on that first day:\n\n       Mr. President, I wish to state, as has been traditional at \n     the commencement of efforts to amend rule XXII, that, by \n     operating under the Standing Rules of the Senate the \n     supporters of this resolution do not acquiesce to the \n     applicability of certain of those rules to the effort to \n     amend rule XXII; nor do they waive any rights which they may \n     obtain under the Constitution, the practice of this body, or \n     certain rulings of previous Vice Presidents to amend rule \n     XXII, uninhibited by rules in effect during previous \n     Congresses.\n\n  Today, I take the same position as Senator Mondale and many other \nreformers did over the years. I understand that Majority Leader \nMcConnell may move on to other business, but I am not acquiescing to \nany provision in the Senate rules that prevents a majority from \namending those rules. We can, and should, take time to debate our \nproposal and have an up or down vote. I know other colleagues also have \nreform proposals. They all deserve consideration.\n  This is not just about rules. It is about the norms and traditions of \nthe Senate. They have collapsed under the weight of the filibusters.\n  Neither side is 100-percent pure. Both sides have used the rules for \nobstruction. No doubt they have had their reasons, but I don't think \nthe American people care about that. They don't want a history lesson \nor a lesson in parliamentary procedure. They want a government that is \nreasonable and that works.\n  I hope all my colleagues, especially the new Senators, give special \nconsideration to reform. We do not need to win every legislative or \nnomination vote, but we need to have a real debate--and an open \nprocess--to ensure we are, actually, the greatest deliberative body in \nthe world.\n  We changed the rule regarding nominations. That was an important \nstart, but it was the beginning--not the end. We still need to reform \nthe Senate rules.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Franken be added \nas a cosponsor to S. Res. 20.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Today we are at the start of a new Congress, and every \nnew Congress provides the opportunity for a fresh start of the work we \ndo on behalf of the American people. Congratulations to our newly \nelected Members and congratulations to our returning elected Members.\n  It is appropriate at this moment, at the start of a new, 2-year \nCongress, that we ponder how to make this institution work for the \nAmerican people, work well within our constitutional framework and our \nresponsibility for\n\n[[Page S25]]\n\nadvice and consent on nominations, and work well in terms of our \nresponsibility for legislation that will address the big issues facing \nour Nation.\n  Since I came to the Senate in 2009, it has been a pleasure to work \nwith my colleague from New Mexico. My colleague from New Mexico came to \nthe Senate from the House. I came here from the State of Oregon but \nwith memories of how the Senate worked many years before when I first \ncame to the Senate as an intern in 1976.\n  I must say, in the 1970s, this body worked very much in the manner \nthat one might anticipate. A bill was put forward. There was no \nfilibuster of a motion to proceed. The bill was debated. A group of \nSenators would be ready to call upon the President of the Senate to \nsubmit their amendment.\n  Whoever was called on first--that amendment was debated. That \namendment was debated, and in a short period of time it was voted on \nand then the Senators would vie for the opportunity to present the next \namendment.\n  What I saw in 2009 when I came back as a Senator was a very different \nChamber, a Chamber where long periods of time would be spent debating \nwhat bills to debate. The motion to proceed would be filibustered. So \nwe would waste the energy of this institution not upon delving into the \ncomplexities of an issue and how to best address it but simply on the \nprocedural issue of whether we were going to start debate on a \nparticular bill.\n  This situation has certainly been observed by the American public. \nThe American public's esteem for our institution has declined steadily \nover the past several decades as the paralysis of this institution has \nincreased.\n  Observers of Congress report that the past two Congresses have been \namong the least productive in modern history--too few amendments \ngetting considered, paralysis even after a bill has come to the floor \non which amendment to address first, and too many filibusters--\nfilibusters not of the type of old in which a Senator would delay \naction on a bill by holding forth as long as his energies would enable \nhim or her to stand on this floor and carry forth, but filibusters of \nthe silent kind, the kind in which there is simply an objection to \nclosing debate. But then this Chamber is filled with silence because no \none has anything left to say on it, and no one is willing to spend the \ntime and energy to even declare to the American people: I am here on \nthis floor speaking at length because I want to block this bill. There \nis no accountability to the public in that fashion--no transparency. So \nthe silent filibuster has come to haunt this hall.\n  Well, that is a very different Senate than the Senate in the mid-\n1970s and one that my colleague from New Mexico and I are determined to \nchange--to restore this Chamber to being a great deliberative body. We \ncan have all the interesting policy ideas in the world, and we can \nhave, certainly, insights on how to make things work better, but if the \nmachinery for this body to consider those ideas is broken, then, \ncertainly, those abilities are not put into their best opportunity or \nframework. Many folks, when we have been debating the functionality of \nthe Senate, have said: But, remember, it was George Washington who said \nthat the Senate should be a cooling saucer--in other words, saying that \nthe dysfunction and paralysis of the Senate is just exactly the way it \nwas designed to be.\n  That is certainly a misreading of the comment attributed, perhaps \napocryphally, to George Washington. George Washington was referring to \nthe fact that the Senate was designed with a constitutional framework \nof 6 years, of one-third of the Members rotating every 2 years, of a \nChamber that was initially elected indirectly by the States--rather \nthan by popular election--and that this would give it more chance to be \nthoughtful and reflective on the issues that come before the Nation.\n  This thoughtfulness, this ability to gain reflexion, is, in fact, \nexactly what the Senate should be. It is the quality that led to the \nSenate being described as the world's greatest deliberative body. But \nthe filibuster, and the abuse of it, has changed that. And certainly \nthe inability of the minority and the majority to be able to put forth \namendments in a timely fashion and to debate them has changed.\n\n  I think back to what Alexander Hamilton said early in the history of \nour Nation. He said that the real operation of the filibuster ``. . . \nis to embarrass the administration, to destroy the energy of \ngovernment, to substitute the pleasure, caprice and artifices of an \ninsignificant, turbulent or corrupt junto to the regular deliberations \nand decisions of a respectable majority.''\n  That phrase, isn't that what we need to restore in this body, the \nregular deliberations and decisions of a respectable majority?\n  This is all part of this cycle of a democracy in which citizens vote \nfor an individual who they feel reflects what needs to be done in our \nNation, and those individuals come to this [chamber/Chamber] and they \nproceed to have an agenda. That agenda, if it is part of the majority \nagenda or a bipartisan majority agenda, gets implemented and those \nideas get tested. Those ideas that work well can be kept and those \nideas that work poorly can be thrown out. But if this Chamber is locked \nin paralysis, that cycle of testing ideas and of citizens voting for a \nvision and seeing that vision implemented and tested is broken. That is \nmuch where we are now.\n  Alexander Hamilton went on to say that when the majority must conform \nto the views of the minority, the consequence is `` . . . tedious \ndelays; continual negotiation and intrigue; contemptible compromises of \nthe public good.''\n  I think that is exactly what we have seen too much of in this \nChamber, whether it be one party in charge or the other party in \ncharge. As my colleague noted, this is not a partisan issue. The ideas \nwe put forward when in the majority we are now putting forward in the \nminority. Isn't that the test of whether an idea is in fact designed \nfor the good of this institution, rather than the advantage of the \nmoment?\n  Our Senate is broken. The American people know that. And it is our \nresponsibility as Senators to work to change that. That is why there \nshould now be a full debate among the Members on the best ideas on how \nto enable this Chamber to work better. Those ideas should come from the \nright of the aisle, from the left of the aisle, and ideas in \npartnership between colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Again, this \nshouldn't be about the advantage of the moment, it should be about the \nsuccessful function of our beloved Senate.\n  One of the things we have seen in the course of this broken Senate is \nour failure to adequately dispose of our responsibility for advice and \nconsent on nominations under the Constitution. That responsibility is \ndesigned to be a check on outrageous potential nominations from the \nPresident. It is not designed to be a way for one coequal branch of \ngovernment--that is the Congress--to seek to systematically undermine \nother branches of the government, be it the judiciary or the executive. \nSo we need to have a timely and systematic way of considering \nnominations. That certainly has fallen apart in the course of the \npoisonous and partisan nature of deliberations here over the last few \nyears. But we can change that.\n  Indeed, we stepped forward a year ago November to test a rule to \nclose debate on most nominations with a simple majority. The result has \nbeen quite spectacular. The number of district judges who have been \nconsidered on the floor of this Chamber has more than doubled--has \nalmost tripled. Judicial vacancies have been cut in half--extremely \nimportant to a fair and capable judiciary. Executive nominations \nroughly doubled.\n  It should not be the goal of this Chamber, whether the majority or \nthe minority, to disable the executive branch by preventing the \npositions from being filled in the executive branch. If a majority says \na person is reasonable, then that nomination should proceed \nexpeditiously.\n  Senator Udall and I have put forward, as he noted, a resolution that \nis in keeping with the package of ideas we worked on in 2011 and 2013, \nso we are presenting those ideas here in 2015. But my encouragement is \nfor people to put forward their ideas, individual Senators, to add \ntheir ideas or put forward individual components that will contribute \nto this dialogue.\n  One of the ideas we have, and I will be offering to this body, is to \ncreate a process to consider rule changes at the start of each \nlegislative session--a detailed way of addressing that, since\n\n[[Page S26]]\n\ncurrently we have no pattern, no guide, to holding a debate about how \nthe Senate functions.\n  A second will be to consider the expedited consideration of most \nnominations. We made a rule change a couple of years ago--well, \nNovember a year ago. And also, before that, we made some minor changes \nin timing in January 2013. That came out of the debate just 2 years \nago. Those January 2013 changes are expiring. Those timelines are \nexpiring. So that goes away. Should those be adopted as part of the \nstanding rules rather than simply the standing orders which expire with \nthe change of a Congress?\n\n  A third idea is to end the filibuster on the motion to proceed to \nlegislation. Think about how this has changed. If you take the 10-year \nperiod between 1973 and 1982, a 10-year period that embraces when I \nfirst came here as an intern, there were 14 times there was a \nfilibuster on a motion to proceed. If you take 10 years from roughly \n2003 to 2012, that number went up to about 160--more than a tenfold \nincrease in the paralysis of getting bills to the floor to be \ndiscussed.\n  Why should there be filibusters at all on a conference committee? If \nthe House has put forward an idea and passed it, and the same bill has \nbeen passed by the Senate, isn't it common sense to enable a delegation \nfrom each Chamber to meet together to work out a compromise? We did \nmake a modest improvement in this procedure, but there is much more \nwork to be done on this.\n  In fact, I was mystified when I came here in 2009 as to why there \nweren't conference committees going on. First I heard: Well, it is \neasier for Chairs of committees to get together informally and try to \nwork out something behind the scenes. But then, as I asked more \nquestions, the answer became: Because there are three steps required, \nand all three of which enable a filibuster, and that paralysis just \nisn't worth entertaining the time on the floor. Well, let us restore \nconference committees. Let us get rid of filibusters on conference \ncommittees.\n  And certainly we must improve floor debate by ensuring amendments can \nbe introduced and debated. The minority has said in recent years that \nthis is a deep disadvantage to them. But I can tell you as a Member of \nthe previous majority that it was a disadvantage to majority Members as \nwell not to be able to introduce and debate amendments.\n  We also certainly must replace the silent filibuster with the talking \nfilibuster so there is transparency and accountability to the use of \nthis instrument on final passage of a bill.\n  Let us not let this opportunity pass. Let us not continue on \nautopilot from one Congress to the next. Let us take this moment of \nopportunity to start on this path to restoring the U.S. Senate to being \nthe world's greatest deliberative body in order to address the big \nissues before us and for the betterment of our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/06/senate-section/article/S26-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S26]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
