Mr. President, let me quote from a letter I recently \nreceived from our colleagues across the aisle. Here is what they said:\n\n       We are writing to reiterate our interest in working \n     cooperatively to facilitate the fiscal year 2017 \n     appropriations process. As we see it--\n\n  Our Democratic friends said--\n\n     restoring the regular order promises not only a more open and \n     transparent process, but a chance for Senators on both sides \n     of the aisle to participate meaningfully in funding \n     decisions. This is a win-win opportunity and we should seize \n     it together.\n\n  That was a letter I received from all of our friends on the other \nside of the aisle. That is exactly what we have been doing--exactly. \nThe appropriations process is off to a strong start, an ``excellent \nkickoff,'' in the words of the top Appropriations Committee Democrat, \nSenator Mikulski, with bills passing through the committee by unanimous \nbipartisan votes.\n  ``If this is the way it is going to be to move appropriations,'' she \nsaid just a few days ago, ``then I think it is a good day.'' Senator \nMikulski said: ``I think it is a good day.'' Democrats lauded the first \nbill on the floor and in press releases for helping promote American \njobs and for addressing the cleanup of radioactive and hazardous \ncontamination across our country.\n  They praised its key investments in research and water \ninfrastructure. Then, what did they do? They filibustered--the very \nsame people who wrote the letter, the very same people who praised the \nbill in press releases, the very same people who took credit for \namendments in the bill, those same people.\n  It seems Democrats are more concerned with funding the acquisition of \nheavy water from Iran than funding water infrastructure in America. Let \nme say that again. It seems Democrats are more concerned with funding \nthe acquisition of heavy water from Iran than funding water \ninfrastructure right here in our own country.\n  As we all know, President Obama concluded a nuclear deal with Iran \nlast year. Tehran is expected to reap approximately $100 billion, \nthanks to the deal, and the Obama administration itself has admitted \nthe regime is likely to use that windfall to invest in its war economy, \nto defend its regime, and to strengthen the hand of the Revolutionary \nGuard, a group that has been accused of helping Shiite militias attack \nand kill American soldiers in Iraq.\n  Many of us, including myself, warned that this deal made little sense \nin terms of our regional strategy. We warned it would enhance Iran's \ncapability and its power. Indeed, since signing President Obama's deal, \nIran has tested ballistic missiles. It has deployed forces to Syria in \nsupport of the Assad regime. It has harassed American ships and those \nof our allies within the Persian Gulf.\n  So when the administration made an announcement over this past \nweekend that it would be purchasing so-called heavy water from Iran, a \nlot of us were concerned. That is right. Make sure everybody \nunderstands. U.S. funds would be sent to Iran. Nothing in the \nPresident's deal with Iran required the United States to make that \npurchase. It is likely it will effectively amount to even more money \nfor Iran to invest in military modernization.\n  So Senator Cotton filed an amendment to prevent the money we are \nappropriating from being used for more of these purchases in the \nfuture--in the future. His amendment does not put the Secretary of \nEnergy's current heavy water purchase agreement at risk. It simply \ntries to keep our Treasury from subsidizing the modernization of Iran's \nmilitary or the procurement of ballistic missiles or air defenses that \nmay be used against America or her allies.\n  I support his policy objective. I don't know why it would not be \nsupported by every Member of the Senate, regardless of party, but \napparently Democrats do not. They have filibustered the overall bill, a \nbill that passed committee with unanimous bipartisan support, remember, \nto prevent even the possibility--this amendment is not even pending--to \nprevent even the possibility of voting on this amendment. They could \nnot wait a single week before throwing an\n\n[[Page S2504]]\n\nobstructionist wrench into the appropriations process they claim to \nwant.\n  Some of us remember that the Democrats did not want to vote when they \nwere in the majority. They also don't seem to want to vote when they \nare in the minority. I hope they are not dusting off the old filibuster \nsummer playbook, especially in light of the letter they just sent to me \nabout win-win opportunities and restoring regular order. Perhaps the \nmost galling thing about Democrats again trying to blow up the \nappropriations process is this: They filibustered this appropriations \nbill and then walked into a press conference about Zika funding. They \nfilibustered this bill and then walked into a press conference about \nZika funding.\n  The appropriations process is the path for that funding. That is the \nway you do it. Preventing the spread of Zika is something both parties \nagree is a priority. The administration currently has funds to address \nthe issue but has requested additional funds by the end of next month. \nBoth Republicans and Democrats have been looking at different \napproaches to properly address the situation.\n  The senior Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, recently \ncharacterized that bipartisanship collaborative process as moving \nforward ``in good faith.'' That is especially notable when you consider \nhow difficult it is for the committee to move forward when the \nadministration keeps it waiting month after month after month for \ninformation it needs, as has been the case with Zika, but progress is \nbeing made anyway. Then Democrats filibustered and upended the process. \nSo how do we move forward now? I remember the second-ranking Democrat, \nSenator Durbin, once shared some wisdom that seems particularly \nrelevant. Here is what he said:\n\n       If you don't want to fight fires, don't be a firefighter. \n     If you don't want to come to Congress and vote on tough \n     issues, get another job somewhere else.\n\n  So here is the message to our Democratic colleagues: Do your job. Do \nyour job. There are other areas where both sides have been able to find \ncommon ground. We have seen the truth of that in many important \nsolutions passed by this Republican-led Senate already: permanent tax \nrelief for families and small businesses, groundbreaking education \nreform that empowers parents and prevents Washington from imposing \nCommon Core, the first long-term transportation solution in years--a \nsolution that will finally allow us to address crumbling roads and \ninfrastructure.\n  Whether it is pay raises for our troops, help for our veterans, or \nhope for the victims of human trafficking, we got a lot done last year \nwith hard work and with cooperation. We have gotten more done this year \nwith hard work and cooperation too. In the past 3 months, we passed a \ncomprehensive North Korea sanctions bill, a bill to permanently ban \nInternet access taxes, a measure to give the public more access to \ngovernment records, a bill to help safeguard American intellectual \nproperty from theft, and critical legislation to help address our \nNation's prescription opioid and heroin epidemic.\n  Just last week, we passed both the most pro-passenger, pro-security \nFAA reauthorization in years and the first major energy legislation \nsince the Bush administration. So where are we? We now have a \nbipartisan opportunity to responsibly work through the individual \nfunding bills. We now have a bipartisan opportunity to responsibly \ncontinue addressing funding issues like Zika.\n  What will it take? What it will take is for our Democratic colleagues \nto end this obstruction and work cooperatively across the aisle \ninstead. That is not too much to ask. So let's take a step back and \nlook at the bigger picture. I believe that when you give Senators and \nthe people they represent more of a say in the legislative process, \nthey are bound to take more of a stake in the legislative outcome, \nregardless of party.\n  That is why we have empowered committees and Members to take the lead \nin more areas. That is how we have gotten the Senate back to work in so \nmany ways. I think Members in both parties have seen the benefits of \nit. So, yes, some may see a short-term political benefit in blowing up \nthe appropriations process now, but I would also ask my friends to \nremember this: Restoring the appropriations process is something we all \nshould want. Democrats have said it is what they want. Republicans have \nsaid it is what we want. It is what I have set out to do. I think it is \nthe best way to give individual Senators in both parties more of a \nvoice for their constituents in the funding process, to empower them to \nmake smarter decisions about how taxpayer dollars are spent.\n  So we are going to give our colleagues an opportunity today to \nreconsider this filibuster. They don't have to block the appropriations \nprocess, which is the path for funding priorities such as Zika. I hope \nthey will make the right choice. We have gotten so much done already \nwith hard work and cooperation. I know there is much more we can \naccomplish for our country with a little more of each.\n  So let's keep striving to get more done for our country. The only way \nto do that is together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/senate-section/article/S2504-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, when I first came to the Senate, I was so \nfortunate I was put on the Appropriations Committee that very first day \nI was here. I loved my assignment. For many years, I had the good \nfortune of either chairing or being the ranking member of that Energy \nand Water Subcommittee. So I know a lot about that subcommittee--many \nsuccessful bills, never an unsuccessful bill did we bring to the floor. \nWe did them quickly. I worked mostly with the Senator from New Mexico \nby the name of Domenici. We worked together and got a lot done for the \ncountry. So I know this Water and Energy bill. The Republican leader \ncomplains about what happened yesterday on the Energy and Water \nappropriations bill.\n\n  On the Democratic side, there is no one who is more liked, \nappreciated, and who is more imbued as a historic figure than Dianne \nFeinstein of California. She became involved in politics at an early \nage and was thrown into a maelstrom of violence when the mayor was \nmurdered. She had to step in and take over that very difficult job.\n  As a Senator, she has been valiant, and she wants to get things done. \nNo one can call her rank partisan, because she isn't. But like all of \nus over here, she was terribly disappointed yesterday and the day \nbefore when all of a sudden, the bill is finished--the bill is \nfinished; the Energy and Water bill is finished--and out of nowhere at \n12:15 p.m. on Tuesday we get an amendment that really is something that \nis a poison pill if there ever were one.\n  The only thing holding up the bill is this poison pill amendment. We \nagreed to pass it yesterday. Dianne Feinstein agrees; pass it. She \nlikes it the way it is. We like it the way it is.\n  So if they are as serious about doing their job as the Republican \nleader said, we are happy to vote on this bill now. But if Republicans \ncontinue to insist on these poison pill amendments--and there is no \nquestion that is what this is--we are going to have to continue as we \nhave.\n  It takes a lot of gall for my friend the Republican leader to talk \nabout filibusters. I repeat what I have said here before, but it is \nworth repeating. As soon as Obama was elected, the Republicans met in \nWashington, and they reported in a 2-day-long meeting--which had been \nreported on numerous times--that they came to two conclusions.\n  No. 1, Obama will not be re-elected. They failed at that miserably. \nHe got more than 5 million votes than his opponent. But on the other \nthing they have succeeded in most instances, and that is to oppose \neverything President Obama wants. That continues to today.\n  As far as poison pill amendments, we are on record numerous times \ntalking about why it is wrong to have these poison pill riders. For \nexample, I said on the floor:\n\n       True bipartisanship also requires both parties to resist \n     the temptation to pursue poison pill riders that appeal to \n     their own supporters, but that are so strongly opposed by the \n     other party that their inclusion in appropriations bills \n     would grind the process to a halt. No doubt there will be \n     many opportunities next year for both sides to score \n     political points. But the appropriations process is\n\n[[Page S2505]]\n\n     not the place for that. And I hope members in both parties \n     will agree that it's more important to fund the government \n     than to play politics.\n\n  That is what I said when we started this Congress, and that is what \nthe Senators who wrote this letter, which my friend the Republican \nleader talked about, want to do. We want to do appropriations bills, \nand we were on a rush to get the first one done. We were headed to \nvictory, and then out of nowhere comes a poison pill rider. Everyone \nacknowledges that is what it is. There are many definitions of a poison \npill rider but, of course, as the President has said, one is when you \ncan't sign the bill.\n  So it would be to everyone's interest if we would simply step back, \npass the bill that exists, and figure out some other way to try to \nembarrass the President. This is not the way to do it.\n  Finally, my friend the Republican leader comes to the floor and talks \nabout what a great amount of work we have done in the Senate. We have \ndone as much as we can. We have tried to support everything.\n  We are a responsible minority. We have not done to them what they \nhave done to us. They opposed everything we tried to do--everything. We \nhad to move to hundreds of motions to proceed.\n  We are pleased we got the energy legislation done. We tried for 5 \nyears to get it done. We were filibustered every step of the way. We \ncouldn't get it done. So it was brought up again. We cooperated, and we \ngot it done. So virtually everything the Republican leader talked about \nwere things that we tried to do before and they wouldn't let us.\n  Let's talk about what we haven't done. They talked about having \npassed opioid legislation. Oops, there is one problem. They didn't fund \nit. Flint, MI--oops, they did nothing. They ignored it for months and \nmonths and months.\n  There was a mistake. No one disagrees there was a mistake made--not \nby us but by the Republicans--in drafting a deal with renewable energy \ncredits--not done.\n  There is the Zika virus. My friend says: Well, we are trying to get \ninformation. That is ridiculous. We will hear more about that in a few \nminutes.\n  There are no district court nominations, no hearings on the Supreme \nCourt.\n  There is no need to go over what hasn't been done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/senate-section/article/S2505-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2505-S2508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 3038\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, imagine though, if you will, that this great \ncountry is facing a potential outbreak of a dangerous virus. It is \nnothing that was made up in the movies, nothing that is on a special TV \nshow. It is actually a potential outbreak of a dangerous virus.\n  Imagine, mosquitoes are carrying a virus that affects pregnant women, \na virus that causes birth defects in babies, not allowing their brains \nand skulls to develop. The skulls collapse on a number of them. Brains \ndon't develop. It is a virus that can cause men and women to develop \nnervous system disorders that can result in paralysis. We don't know \nthe full extent of this.\n  We had a briefing here a week ago today with the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health. We had \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services here. They are in a state of \nemergency. They need to do something. They need to develop a vaccine. \nThis is on its way. It is here.\n  It is here in Puerto Rico. We have cases reported in the State of my \nfriend, Florida. He is someone with whom I have served in the House and \nin the Senate. Senator Nelson of Florida is one of our very outstanding \nMembers.\n  We already know there are cases in Florida. Thirty States are going \nto be affected with these mosquitoes as the weather warms. I have been \ntold in the past that mosquitoes have never caused birth defects. They \nhave caused all kinds of problems with malaria and other things, but \nnot birth defects. Now they are here.\n  Imagine, after what I have just laid out to you, that those in \ncontrol of Congress do nothing to address the imminent danger posed by \nthis virus. It sounds like some science fiction novel; doesn't it? But \nit is not.\n  This is real life in America. This is the reality--the Republicans' \nrefusal to respond to the threat of Zika. My friend mentioned that the \nsenior Senator from Washington is involved in trying to come up with \nsomething for Zika. She said yesterday she hasn't heard a word from the \nRepublicans in more than a week on this important issue.\n  This is real life. Zika is a scourge that is already affecting our \ncountry, as I have outlined. It is time we pass an emergency \nappropriations bill to take care of it, to fight it. Out of tradition, \ncommon sense, and precedent, a public health threat is an emergency, \nand it demands a response.\n  As I indicated, hundreds of people in Puerto Rico--quickly \napproaching a thousand--are infected. As the weather warms, as I have \nindicated, it is going to multiply throughout the continental United \nStates. Thirty States will likely be affected with this mosquito--this \nkiller mosquito.\n  More than 2 months ago my friend said: We need more from the \nadministration. More than 2 months ago the administration--desperate as \nthey were--sent a letter to Congress saying we need an emergency \nrequest of $1.9 billion--out of desperation.\n  What did the White House do? Two years ago we were fighting Ebola. It \nis still a serious worldwide problem and a problem for our country. \nThey had to take money from vaccines they were working on for Ebola and \nother things and start doing Zika. Now we have a situation where both \nthe mosquito-caused Zika and the Ebola scourge are underfunded now. \nRepublicans have done a double whammy here. We need to give the money \nback to the agencies that are doing something to help Ebola and fund \nZika.\n  They haven't lifted a finger that we are aware of. As I said \nyesterday, the senior Senator from Washington hasn't heard from the so-\ncalled negotiators in more than a week. They refuse to do anything, \neven as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National \nInstitutes of Health are pleading for us to act. They have been very \nclear about the funding they need to fight Zika. They are not making up \nthings. They have told us in line and verse.\n  My friend, the Republican leader said: We need more from the \nadministration. It wasn't all that long ago that my friend the \nRepublican leader was singing a much different song. This is what he \nsaid about funding the outbreak of Ebola 2 years ago, and it is a \ndirect quote:\n\n       I think they should have anything they want. . . . Whatever \n     the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] thinks they \n     need, we'll give it to them.\n\n  He said the same thing 7 years ago when we were faced with another \nreal problem, swine flu. This is what he said then: ``So if [the \nAdministration] needs anything additionally from Congress, I know we'll \nbe happy to provide it on a totally bipartisan basis.''\n  Fast forward 7 years, and the Republicans now in the majority won't \nprovide the requested funding for Zika. Why? We know why. They can't \nget it through over here. They can't get it done.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National \nInstitutes of Health know what they need. They have told us. They told \nanyone who will listen.\n  So why can't the Republicans give it to them. If they won't give the \nexperts the resources they need to combat Zika, what do they propose? \nWe could ask the Zika-carrying mosquitoes: Don't breed this year.\n  Remember, anyway, that it is in the last term of a two-term \nPresident. Maybe we shouldn't do it this year.\n  The Senate should not leave today without addressing this serious \nissue. We shouldn't be taking 10 days off as a dangerous virus \nthreatens this Nation--and it is threatening us. The Republicans should \ndo their job and pass a $1.9 billion emergency spending bill to help \nprotect Americans from the Zika virus.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield before he makes the \nrequest?\n  Mr. REID. I am pleased to do that. I want the record to be spread \nwith the fact that this good man--more than any other Senator, because \nof what he\n\n[[Page S2506]]\n\nis facing and will face in the very hot, humid, and sometimes tropical \nState of Florida--recognized this a long time ago. I admire him being \nahead of this issue. He has been out there in the front and some of us \nhave been trying to catch up with him.\n  I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding. I wish \nto add to his comments from this Senator's personal perspective.\n  The State of Florida presently has 94 infected cases that we know of, \nincluding 5 pregnant women whom we know of.\n  We also have a very mobile and sizeable population of Puerto Ricans \nwho go to that island, where, lo and behold, it is estimated that up to \n20 percent of the population could ultimately be infected. There are \nupwards of close to 100 cases--multiple hundreds--that we know of. I \nthink the actual number is in the eighties of pregnant women whom we \nknow of who are infected in the United States.\n  As the leader has already described, this has horrendous \nconsequences, not only to the families but there is also the cost to \nsociety because of the deformed babies that result--and not necessarily \nat birth. These defects may come years later, but that is a huge cost \nto society, not even to speak of the human tragedy.\n  So is it any wonder that I join with the minority leader in begging \nfor this emergency appropriations of $1.9 billion.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the \namendment and a letter from the President detailing his request be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Request to Fight Zika--$1.9 \n                           billion (S. 2843)\n\n\n     Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)--$1.509 billion\n\n       Centers for Disease Control and Prevention--$743 million to \n     support Zika prevention and response strategies, including: \n     domestic response efforts to prevent, detect and respond to \n     Zika; providing grants and technical assistance to Puerto \n     Rico and U.S. Territories; and international CDC response \n     activities, including expanding field epidemiology resources \n     and infectious disease surveillance.\n       Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services--$246 million to \n     support increasing the Medicaid Federal Medical Assistance \n     Percentage (FMAP) from 55 to 65 percent for one year in \n     Puerto Rico and other U.S. Territories.\n       National Institutes of Health--$277 million to support \n     efforts to develop a vaccine for Zika, as well as to support \n     basic research on Zika virus.\n       Food and Drug Administration--$10 million to support \n     vaccine and diagnostic development review.\n       Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority \n     (BARDA)--$188 million to support vaccines and diagnostics \n     development and procurement.\n       Health Resources and Services Administration--$20 million \n     to support health centers, the Maternal and Child Health \n     Block Grant/Home Visiting, the National Health Service Corps, \n     and the Countermeasures Injury Protection Program.\n       Other HHS activities--$25 million for urgent and emerging \n     threats.\n\n\n                    Department of State--$41 million\n\n       Supports U.S. citizens in affected countries, medical \n     support for State Department employees in affected countries, \n     public diplomacy, communications, and other operations \n     activities. Also supports the World Health Organization and \n     its regional arm, the Pan American Health Organization. These \n     resources would support critical public health actions \n     underway, including preparedness, surveillance, data \n     collection, and risk communication. Activities would also \n     include support for the UN Children's Fund's (UNICEF) Zika \n     response efforts in Brazil, and support for the International \n     Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to bolster diagnostic \n     capabilities through deployment of equipment, and specialized \n     training and to implement projects to suppress mosquito \n     populations in affected areas.\n\n\n    United States Agency for International Development--$335 million\n\n       Supports affected countries' ability to control mosquitoes \n     and the transmission of the virus, support maternal health, \n     expand public education on prevention and response, and to \n     create new incentives for the development of vaccines and \n     diagnostics.\n       The bill also replenishes Ebola money that was reprogrammed \n     for Zika--$510 million on April 6, 2016, the Administration \n     announced that it had to act to address the growing Zika \n     emergency, so it identified $589 million--including $510 \n     million of existing Ebola resources within HHS, State and \n     USAID--to be redirected to immediate activities to fight \n     Zika. The $1.9 billion will replenish the redirected Ebola \n     funds: $215 for HHS Ebola balances and $295 for State/USAID \n     Ebola balances.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                    Washington, February 22, 2016.\n     Hon. Paul D. Ryan,\n     Speaker of the House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Speaker: Today, I ask the Congress to consider the \n     enclosed FY 2016 emergency supplemental appropriations \n     request of approximately $1.9 billion to respond to the Zika \n     virus both domestically and internationally. This funding \n     would build upon ongoing preparedness efforts and provide \n     resources for the Departments of Health and Human Services \n     and State, and the U.S. Agency for International Development \n     (USAID). Funding would support immediate response activities \n     to prevent the spread of, prepare for, and respond to Zika \n     virus transmission; fortify domestic public health systems to \n     prevent, detect, and respond to Zika virus transmission; \n     speed research, development, and procurement of vaccines, \n     therapeutics, and diagnostics; provide emergency assistance \n     to States and the U.S. Territories to combat the virus; \n     provide additional Federal Medicaid funding in Puerto Rico \n     and the other U.S. Territories for health services for \n     pregnant women at risk of infection or diagnosed with Zika \n     virus, and for children with microcephaly, and for other \n     health care costs; and enhance the ability of Zika-affected \n     countries to better combat mosquitoes, control transmission, \n     and support affected populations.\n       The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports 50 \n     laboratory-confirmed cases of the Zika virus among U.S. \n     travelers from December 2015-February 5, 2016. In addition, \n     the Pan American Health Organization reports 26 countries and \n     territories in the Americas with local Zika transmission. On \n     February 1, 2016, the World Health Organization declared the \n     Zika virus a Public Health Emergency of International \n     Concern.\n       My foremost priority is to protect the health and safety of \n     Americans. This request supports the necessary steps to \n     fortify our domestic health system, detect and respond to any \n     potential Zika outbreaks at home, and to limit the spread in \n     other countries.\n       The request includes approximately $1.9 billion to respond \n     to Zika virus transmission across the United States and \n     internationally. In addition, transfer authority is requested \n     to allow for sufficient response and flexibility across the \n     Federal Government to address changing circumstances and \n     emerging needs related to the Zika virus.\n       My Administration requests that the funding described above \n     be designated as emergency requirements pursuant to section \n     251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \n     Control Act of 1985, as amended.\n       I urge the Congress to act expeditiously in considering \n     this important request, the details of which are set forth in \n     the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \n\n  Mr. REID. The record should reflect that the people of Puerto Rico \nare American citizens.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 157, H.R. 3038; that all after the \nenacting clause be stricken; that the Nelson substitute amendment to \nenhance the Federal response and preparedness with respect to the Zika \nvirus, which is at the desk, be agreed to; that there be up to 2 hours \nof debate, equally divided between the two leaders or their designees; \nthat upon the use or yielding back of time, the bill, as amended, be \nread a third time and the Senate vote on passage of the bill, as \namended, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Reserving the right to object, there is bipartisan \nsupport for doing what we need to do to address the Zika virus, which, \nas the Senator from Florida correctly pointed out, has dramatically \naffected the territory of Puerto Rico. Fortunately, according to the \nlatest statistics from the Centers for Disease Control, there is no \nsingle case in the continental United States of a mosquito-borne \ninfection in someone in the continental United States. But that is not \nto say this is not a serious matter. In fact, it is. That is why \nRepublicans were glad to see the administration use the unexpended \nfunds for the Ebola crisis--some $500 million--as a downpayment on what \nis going to be necessary to deal with this.\n  But the fact is, our friends across the aisle have requested a $1.9 \nbillion blank check, and they haven't told us what the plan is for the \nuse of the funds. In the bill filed by Senator Nelson, he said those \nfunds will be spent until they are gone. And, of course, it is \nemergency spending, which is deficit spending and adds to the debt. But \nthe\n\n[[Page S2507]]\n\nlegislation completely lacks any sort of accountability that would only \ncome through a regular appropriations process where we consider this in \na deliberate sort of way. So I have a number of questions for the \nSenator that I would ask.\n  I would note that I have traveled to the Galveston National \nLaboratory, which has done some world-class research in this area and \nalso on the Ebola virus and other infectious diseases. Last Friday I \nwas in Houston at the Texas Medical Center talking to the experts and \ntrying to learn more about this so I can do my job as a Senator in a \nresponsible sort of way.\n  We all agree that this is a serious matter and it should be \nnegotiated on a bipartisan basis, but we should at least have a plan \nfrom the administration for how the money is going to be spent. There \nis no plan. It is a blank check. And until we get a plan and can sit \ndown and avoid the histrionics and the gamesmanship and the \npartisanship on something that should be nonpartisan, we object to the \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend the assistant Republican leader \nhas a lot of nerve. There have been a lot of States affected with \nemergencies in the last decade, and Texas has had its share. We have \nbeen willing to help them on floods and fires and all the other \nproblems they have had, some of them manmade, some of them not so. \nThose were emergencies; this is an emergency.\n  For the Republicans to come to this body this morning and say there \nis no plan--there is a plan. Of course there is a plan. There is $1.9 \nbillion. Pay back the money for Ebola so we can continue that. That is \n$500 million right there. We also want to do something to help Puerto \nRico, which needs to be done. That is approximately $200 million. We \nhave some help--a minimum amount--for countries outside the United \nStates where these mosquitoes are breeding. We want to try to do \nsomething about that. And, of course, most of the money here is for \nresearch to come up with vaccines and other programs to alleviate the \ndisaster facing this country. The President has outlined that, and the \nSenator from Florida has outlined that.\n  To have the assistant majority leader say that we need to sit down \nand negotiate--we are not in the majority. They have an obligation to \nbring something to the floor. If there is bipartisan support to do \nsomething, why aren't the Republicans doing something? Wait and wait \nwhile we are home glad-handing people during the next week? We should \nbe doing something here to address this emergency. It is an emergency.\n  Mr. NELSON. Will the Senator yield, Mr. President?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. NELSON. In answering directly the question of the Senator from \nTexas, before he objected, he wanted to ask this Senator a question as \nto what is the plan.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, has the Democratic leader yielded the \nfloor, or is it for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader has yielded the floor \nfor a question.\n  Mr. NELSON. All right, I will put it in the form of a question.\n  Does the Democratic leader believe that this Senator has spoken many \ntimes on the floor laying out the specifics of the request of $1.9 \nbillion, which includes the replenishment of $589 million to the Ebola \nfund which had been advanced to fight this emergency? Does the Senator \nbelieve that? And does the Senator further believe that I have in my \nhand that breakdown that I have had printed in the Record?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, to my friend from Florida, yes. And where \ndid he get that information in preparing this legislation? He got it \nfrom the administration. Everybody knows what is in this legislation. \nWhat my friend the assistant Republican leader said is nonsense.\n  If there is some bipartisan support--and I am confident they would \ncome up with something--we would do our best to try to support it, but \nthis is the legislation we need. This is a desperate situation, and it \nis going to become more desperate as each day goes by because the \nsummer season is fast approaching.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, let me just suggest that, contrary to what \nthe Democratic leader has said, the questions I have asked about where \ntheir plan is are not nonsense, and let me demonstrate the specific \nquestions which I have and which I think other responsible Senators are \ngoing to want answers to before we write a blank check for $1.9 billion \nto the administration, particularly when they already have access, as \nthe Senator from Florida said, to the $589 million, which are \nunexpended Ebola funds.\n  One of the questions I would like to get answers to--and I think we \ncan then have a meaningful discussion and act responsibly--is, What \nspecific activities are going to be funded by the $1.9 billion plan? \nFor example, the bill from the Senator from Florida provides $743 \nmillion to the Centers for Disease Control. Is that for domestic \nactivities? Is it focused on Puerto Rico? Is it for CDC international \nactivities? And if so, where?\n  The second question I have is, What are the agency's priorities? \nContinuing with the CDC issue, will they focus on vector control \nactivities, outreach, and education? As we know, this is a mosquito-\nborne disease. It is not the only mosquito-borne disease, but \nunfortunately this mosquito has not only been present in Central and \nSouth America but is now, as the Democratic leader says, present in \nsome of the more tropical climates, the warmer climates, including my \nState of Texas. So I take this personally and seriously. But it also \naffects Florida, no doubt about it, Louisiana, and we don't know how it \nmight spread or how this virus might morph over time.\n  Another question I have is, How long does the administration expect \nto use the funding? For example, we have an annual appropriations \nprocess, which has been filibustered by our Democratic colleagues, \nstarting with the Energy and Water bill, and now they want us to fund \nan emergency appropriation for an unlimited period of time without any \nplan to spend the money. That is irresponsible.\n  The request from the Senator from Florida in his bill says the money \nwill be spent ``until expended,'' until it runs out, and they have \nprovided no further details on what will be funded this year and in \nfuture years.\n  The reason I mention the appropriations process is that we all know \nwe are in the appropriations season now, and it would be appropriate \nfor the Committee on Appropriations to process this request and to come \nup with a recommendation for the full Senate, but that has not yet \nhappened. I am told the discussions are ongoing, which is a good thing, \nand that is where this ought to be resolved, not through grandstanding \non the Senate floor in an effort to try to make this a partisan issue. \nThis is not a partisan or political issue. It should not be. There is \nbipartisan concern and willingness to address this issue. But can they \nspend $1.9 billion before the end of the fiscal year, when the \nappropriations process will start up again? In other words, it doesn't \ntake a lot of thought to realize this is a request for a blank check \nwithout regard for the accountability that comes from what we call the \nregular order here in the appropriations process in the Senate.\n  We know the administration transferred funding from unobligated Ebola \nfunds 2 weeks ago. What is the administration using that $589 million \nfor that is related to Zika? I think we should know the answer to that. \nAnd that also demonstrates what happens when Congress appropriates \nmoney on an emergency basis without knowing what the plan is, because \nobviously the Ebola crisis has abated to some extent. I am not saying \nit has gone away completely, particularly in countries like Africa, but \nthere is a pot of money--$589 million--which suggests maybe we \ninadvertently appropriated more money on an emergency basis for the \nEbola crisis than ultimately was necessary. I am not faulting anybody \nfor that; I am just saying that is the way this works when you ask for \nthe money first without a plan and there is no accountability for how \nthe money is spent. You have these pots of money out there that are--\nfortunately in this case--available now to deal with the Zika issue.\n  In the Health and Human Services request contained in the bill from \nthe\n\n[[Page S2508]]\n\nSenator from Florida, there are other issues. One, they ask for a \ngovernmentwide contingency fund that Health and Human Services controls \nand can transfer funds elsewhere. So what they want to do is play a \nshell game with this money. They want to get the money, and if they do \nnot need it to deal with Zika, they can transfer it for other \npurposes--again, without any transparency or any real political \naccountability.\n  I think responsible Members of the Senate--and I would expect all 100 \nof us would put ourselves in that category--would want to know where \nthe transparency is, where the accountability is, where the plan is, so \nwe can sit down and do this as mature adults in a nonpartisan way in \norder to solve the problem.\n  Here is another thing that sort of jumps out at me: When I look at \nthe President's request for $1.9 billion, they actually talk about \nfunding matters unrelated to Zika. They talk about funding things at \nthe Environmental Protection Agency. And looking at the request to \ntransfer funds governmentwide, basically they are requesting money, it \nappears--unless there is some logical explanation as to why we should, \nwhich they have not yet made--on an emergency basis, to grant funds to \nthe Environmental Protection Agency. That is a little hard to \nunderstand.\n  Finally, there is this: All of us are willing to deal with this in a \nresponsible, nonpartisan way. That is the reason I have spent time at \nthe Galveston National Laboratory and the Texas Medical Center trying \nto learn as much as I can about this, so I can do my job, just as I am \nsure every individual Senator wants to do their job in a responsible \nway. But to come in and ask for $1.9 billion in emergency funding, \nwhich means it is not paid for--it is borrowed money, which adds to the \ndeficit and the debt--is a pretty serious matter, especially when our \nnational debt is $19 trillion and has almost doubled under the Obama \nadministration.\n  This is a very serious matter, and I treat it seriously, and I trust \nall 100 Senators believe this is something we ought to deal with \nresponsibly and in a deliberate sort of way, and we will. But it is not \nby coming to the floor and grandstanding by asking for $1.9 billion \nblank checks without any plan to spend it in an appropriate sort of \nway.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/senate-section/article/S2508-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there are already nearly 900 cases of the \nZika virus in the United States and its 3 territories, including \nactually 2 confirmed cases in my home State of Washington. A recent \nsurvey showed that 40 percent of adults in our country see this virus \nas a reason to delay starting families. Those are disturbing \nstatistics. They make it clear that the Zika virus is a public health \nemergency, and there is no good reason for the delay we are seeing from \nour Republican colleagues in addressing this.\n  Months ago, the administration put forward the strong proposal that \nSenator Reid introduced today. Republicans refused at the time to even \nconsider it, and I am disappointed again this morning that they weighed \nin on the side of further delay rather than acting on this. As a \nresult, we are getting closer to the summer and to mosquito season, but \nwe still here in this body have not moved on emergency supplemental \nfunding that would put much needed resources into preventing and \ntreating this frightening virus.\n  Too many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle still don't \nseem to see Zika as an emergency. Some Republicans are insisting we \nshouldn't give the administration a penny in additional funding to \nsupport the response we need to make. Others are saying that action on \nZika can wait--wait for weeks or months. Republicans in Congress might \nbe able to simply wait, but families across this country cannot.\n  Addressing this Zika virus shouldn't be controversial. With women's \nand children's health and well-being on the line, it certainly should \nnot be a place for partisanship.\n  Democrats are at the table. We want to get this done as soon as \npossible. In fact, as recently as a few days ago I was hopeful \nRepublicans were truly interested in working with us to get this done \nand to be able to find an actual path forward. We had some good \nconversations last week. But I am worried that in the last few days it \nhas become clear once again that the extreme right, like the Heritage \nFoundation, is in control, and Republican leaders have been unable to \ndemonstrate to this point a path on how we can get a bipartisan deal \nsigned into law. This issue is far too important to have Republican \ninfighting hold it up. So I urge my Republican colleagues to join us. \nWe are ready to be at the table to work with them. We need to address \nthis as an emergency.\n  Then I hope we can move on to work on the other really critical \nissues before us: the opioid epidemic that so many have been here to \ntalk about; the families in Flint who are suffering; ensuring our \nSupreme Court nominee gets a fair consideration--a hearing, even. There \nis so much work to be done.\n  I am here to urge our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to \nrecognize this is an emergency. It cannot wait. Families are waiting \nfor us to act. We need to get the research. We need to have an \nunderstanding of what this disease is. We certainly need to put into \nplace prevention, and we certainly need to work on the important path \nforward in making sure we have the right kinds of education out there \nas well as a solution to this problem that is rapidly becoming an \nAmerican problem.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, if this isn't an emergency, then I don't \nknow what is. Zika is a public health emergency. It defines a public \nhealth emergency, and we really have to act now to fund the \nadministration's full $1.9 billion supplemental funding request.\n  I want to respond to the assistant majority leader's concerns that \nthere is no plan. With due respect--and I know he is working hard on \nthis as well--that is just not accurate. The legislation propounded by \nSenators Nelson and others has a very specific plan. I was fortunate \nenough to visit the headquarters for the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention in Atlanta. They have a very specific plan. It is vector \ncontrolled. It is developing the diagnostic tests necessary to figure \nout whether or not people are carriers of the Zika virus. It is working \non a vaccine. They have a high degree of confidence that they are \neventually going to get a vaccine. But this takes time, and this takes \nresources. It is public health outreach regarding mosquitos and how \nthis is transmitted, and it is assurance regarding the safety of our \nblood supply. So they have a plan.\n  Let me be a little more specific: $743 million for CDC--this money \nwould include grants and technical assistance to Puerto Rico and the \nU.S. territories and help our domestic and international response \nactivities; about $250 million for the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid, or CMS, to increase the Federal match rate to Puerto Rico \nwhere there have been 500 active transmission cases--and, \nunfortunately, that number continues to go up; several hundred million \ndollars for the National Institutes of Health and BARDA to invest in \nvaccine research and development. That is the end game, but in the \nmeantime, we have to prevent the transmission as our country warms up \nand as the mosquitos become more prevalent across the country with $10 \nmillion to the FDA for a vaccine and diagnostics development review and \n$335 million to USAID's efforts abroad to support affected countries' \npublic health efforts on mosquito-borne diseases.\n  I will make a couple of specific procedural points. As a member of \nthe Appropriations Committee, I believe it is really important that we \nare trying to move in the regular order on each individual \nAppropriations subcommittee.\n\n[[Page S2509]]\n\nWe have been working on a bipartisan basis. So we are trying to move in \nthe regular order, and that is good news. We are moving a little more \nquickly than I think has been done in many years. That is good news. \nBut the practical fact of that also means that we are not in the middle \nof working on legislation that must be passed by today or must be \npassed by next week because whatever we do--whether it is the Energy \nand Water title, whether it is THUD coming next, maybe MILCON-VA after, \nwhatever it may be--we are going to be waiting for the House to act, \nand we are going to be conferencing. It is not at all clear when we \nwill actually move appropriations measures to the President's desk, but \nit is fair to say those things are not exactly legislatively on fire. \nWe could wait 2 or 3 legislative days. We could wait 2 or 3 legislative \nweeks. We are ahead of the game. That is not to say we don't have our \nown challenges with each of these individual appropriations measures, \nbut this defines an emergency. This defines an emergency. This is an \nactual public health emergency, which means the idea of a pay-for for \nthis is antithetical to the way we ought to work. This is what \ngovernment does.\n  Whatever your political persuasion, whatever your ideology is about \nthe size and scope of the Federal Government, I think we can all agree \nthat the most basic responsibility of the Federal Government is to keep \nus all safe. This is a real risk. This is not an imaginary risk, this \nis not a trumped-up risk, and this is not a partisan thing. If you talk \nto the CDC, if you talk to your local departments of health, vector \ncontrols, mosquito control areas--talk to them. They are very nervous, \nand it is increasing. The only reason this hasn't totally popped both \nepidemiologically and politically is that it is still cold in a lot of \nplaces and mosquitos aren't out. This is a real emergency. There is no \nreason we shouldn't be taking this up as the emergency starts to \nhappen. There is no reason we can't take a couple legislative days to \ndeal with that.\n  To address the senior Senator from Texas, the assistant majority \nleader's questions about whether the plan addresses his concerns about \naccountability, about the ability to move money from one account to the \nother, about backfilling the Ebola funding--fine. Those are all \nlegitimate questions, and I think they can all be addressed.\n  But here is my question: Why not get on the bill? Why object to a UC \nrequest that we get on the bill? All of those questions can be \naddressed on the floor or in committee or in conversation. There are \nmany ways to address those questions. But the refusal to even \nacknowledge that this matter is sufficiently urgent that it should be \nthe thing we are dealing with right now, that THUD could wait a week, \nand that whatever we are planning to do next is not quite as urgent as \nthe Zika virus--that is the point we are making today. Not that there \nisn't going to be some legislative wrangling and not that we are \nsupposing that the President's request is exactly perfect, it is just \nthat this is a real emergency, and we ought to get this thing onto the \nfloor so we can take some action. That is what we have to do.\n  I know the Senator from Missouri is working very hard on this. I know \nothers are too. We don't want this to be a partisan issue either. But \nto object to a request to get on this bill fails to acknowledge what a \nserious public health emergency the Zika virus is.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I came to the floor today to talk about \nanother issue, and I will talk about the issue I had scheduled to talk \nabout earlier this week. But in regard to the issue of Zika, it does \nneed to be dealt with. It is being dealt with.\n  The good news is that there was substantial money various departments \nhad that could be reprogrammed, and the fact that they have \nreprogrammed it indicates to me that there is a genuine belief in the \nadministration, which I share, that this is an emergency. Over half a \nbillion dollars has already been reprogrammed to deal with that \nemergency. I believe some of that reprogramming money needs to be \nrestored, and some of it probably doesn't. The Ebola crisis is not what \nwe thought it might be in Africa, but it is still in existence there. I \nthink some of that money needs to go back into the accounts it had been \nreprogrammed out of.\n  But if anybody listening to this debate believes that nothing is \nhappening, that is not accurate. I do appreciate my friend from Florida \nrecognizing that a lot of discussions are going on. I was in several \nthis week, and some yesterday with House Members and Senate Members.\n  The House could pass a bill first. That may or may not happen, but \nwhat really needs to happen is a bill that gets on the President's \ndesk. I think there is almost no chance the Senate would pass a $1.9 \nbillion bill as proposed. The best place to debate that could be the \nSenate floor for several days or it could be to work on a bill that \ncould come to the floor quickly, go to the House, and be passed by the \nHouse. If there were a slim chance that the Senate could pass the bill \nwe have been talking about--the bill as proposed that would spend $1.9 \nbillion, in big hundred-million dollar chunks, which we talk about as \nif that is no money at all and is somehow a plan--that in all \nlikelihood wouldn't pass the Senate, and I am absolutely sure it \nwouldn't pass the House. What would we have gained? This is something \nwe need to work out. We can work it out. I believe we will work it out.\n  The goal is not for the Senate to pass a bill. The goal is for the \nCongress to pass a bill and the President of the United States to sign \nthat bill. I believe that will happen. Many people, including me, are \nworking to see that happens. The majority leader knows that, and others \nwho have spoken today reflect the fact that they know those discussions \nare going on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/senate-section/article/S2509-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2509-S2510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FALLEN HEROES FLAG ACT\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, what I came to talk about today is a bill \nwe did pass a couple of weeks ago. As we get ready for police week \nearly in May--I think the week of the 9th of May--there are people we \nwant to recognize and do recognize and do appreciate. I am cochair, \nalong with Senator Coons of Delaware, of the Law Enforcement Caucus. I \nwant to speak today about something we have just done to honor our \nfirst responders.\n  I want to start by recognizing the first responders from my State of \nMissouri who lost their lives in the line of duty last year. In \nMissouri, four law enforcement officers died in the line of duty. \nDeputy Sheriff Steven Brett Hawkins of the Harrison County Sheriff's \nOffice, Trooper James Matthew Bava of the Missouri State Highway \nPatrol, Sergeant Peggy Marie Vassallo of the Bellefontaine Neighbors \nPolice Department, and Officer Ronald Eugene Strittmatter of the \nLakeshire Police Department lost their lives.\n  Deputy Sheriff Brett Hawkins of Bethany, MO, suffered a fatal heart \nattack on September 13 following an emergency response. He was 34 years \nold. Deputy Sheriff Hawkins suffered that attack after returning home \nfrom his shift, which included the search of a residence and \nsurrounding property. He had served with the Harrison County Sheriff's \nOffice for 3 years. He is survived by his wife, daughter, and three \nsons.\n  Trooper James Bava of Mexico, MO, was involved in a fatal vehicle \ncrash while pursuing a motorcyclist for a traffic stop on August 28. \nTrooper Bava had served with the Missouri State Highway Patrol for 2 \nyears. He was 25 years old the day he lost his life serving us. He is \nsurvived by his parents, a brother, three sisters, and his fiancee.\n  Sergeant Peggy Vassallo of Bellefontaine Neighbors Police Department \nwas struck and killed by a vehicle on August 24 while rendering aid to \nanother driver after being involved in an accident en route to work. \nSergeant Vassallo had served with the Bellefontaine Neighbors Police \nDepartment for 15 years and had previously served with the St. Louis \nCounty Police Department for over 13 years, almost 30 years' service. \nShe is survived by her husband, son, and two grandchildren.\n  Officer Ronald Strittmatter suffered a heart attack after attempting \nto help an older person who had fallen. Officer Strittmatter had served \nin the Lakeshire Police Department for 4 years and had previously \nserved in the\n\n[[Page S2510]]\n\nSt. Louis Metropolitan Police Department for 24 years. He is survived \nby his wife and a son.\n  In Missouri, we also lost five firefighters and first responders in \nthe line of duty last year.\n  Battalion Chief Chris Tindall of Raymore, MO, died shortly after \nresponding to an emergency incident in January 2015. He was a 19-year \nveteran of the South Metro Fire Department.\n  Larry Lawhorn, a volunteer firefighter with the Orchard Farm Fire \nProtection District, suffered a fatal medical emergency in May of last \nyear while driving a first responder vehicle en route to a structure \nfire. He had been a volunteer with the department for 20 years and had \npreviously served 15 years with the St. Charles County Fire District.\n  In October 2015, two firefighters were killed in Kansas City in the \nline of duty. Larry Leggio, a 17-year veteran of the Kansas City Fire \nDepartment, and John Mesh, a 13-year veteran of the Kansas City Fire \nDepartment, were able to save two residents from a burning apartment \ncomplex before a wall collapsed on them after they had evacuated other \npeople from the building.\n  EMS pilot Ronald Rector of Linn, MO, was killed during a flight \noperation in March 2015. He was inbound to pick up additional crew \nmembers at St. Louis University Hospital in a medical helicopter when \nhis helicopter crashed.\n  Early this month, I introduced the Fallen Heroes Flag Act, which \ncreates a program to provide a flag flown over the Capitol to the \nfamily of firefighters, law enforcement officers, members of rescue \nsquads or ambulance crews, and public safety officers who lose their \nlives in the line of duty. I thank my colleagues for unanimously \npassing that bill last week. The House had already passed a similar \nmeasure introduced by Congressman Peter King, and I hope to get a final \nbill on the President's desk in very short order.\n  Our Nation's first responders put themselves in harm's way to keep us \nsafe, and we mourn the loss of all those who have given their lives in \nthe line of duty. We can never in any way fully repay the debt we owe \nthem and their families. These are people who go to work every day, \nwith the greatest goal for their families being that they come home \nsafely that day, and they have more reason to worry about that than \nmost of us have. All we can offer instead is our gratitude. My hope is \nthat each flag that is flown over the Capitol and provided to these \nfamilies will be a lasting symbol of our appreciation and a fitting \nhonor to those who embody the very best of what we stand for as a \nnation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/senate-section/article/S2510-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SILVER STAR SERVICE BANNER DAY\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, as I conclude, one other thing I want to \nmention is Silver Star Service Banner Day. I thank my colleagues for \nunanimously passing a resolution I submitted with Senator McCaskill \nlast week to designate May 1 as Silver Star Service Banner Day. It is a \nday we honor our Nation's servicemembers who have been injured or \nbecome ill while serving, and we also honor their families on that day.\n  I am grateful to work for this cause and for the work the Silver Star \nFamilies of America do. This is a nonprofit organization headquartered \nin Clever, MO. In 2004, that group began its work to remember, to \nhonor, and to assist members of the Armed Forces from every branch of \nthe military and from every war. This organization assists veterans who \nhave suffered physical or emotional trauma from war and distributes \nSilver Star flags and care packages to wounded veterans and their \nfamilies.\n  Our military men and women put their lives on the line to defend our \nNation, and many have done so in ways that result in tremendous \npersonal cost for them and their families--from loss of life, to \ninjury, to trauma of all kinds. On Silver Star Service Banner Day, I \nhope all Americans will take a moment to reflect on the countless \nsacrifices and appreciate the blessings of freedom their service has \nprovided.\n  We salute our former and current servicemembers and encourage all \nAmericans to do the same with the presence of a Silver Star service \nbanner in the window or a Silver Star flag flying in the front yard. \nThose who serve deserve and should receive the gratitude of the Nation, \nwhether they serve in the military or as first responders, and in the \nlast few days the Congress was able to step forward and recognize those \nwho serve in unique ways.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rubio). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the talk of the debt in our Nation has \nbeen diminishing. Unfortunately, debt itself has not also diminished. \nWhile the deficit has been reduced significantly over the last several \nyears, the debt continues to grow. It is now crossing well over $19 \ntrillion. It is my concern that we as a body continue to get distracted \nwith other things and lose track of the looming debt issues we will \nstill continue to face and we will be held to account for, and \nrightfully so.\n  The American people expect us to come here and solve a lot of \nissues--solve not only crisis issues such as Zika and other issues \naround the country, but also what we are going to do with national \ndefense and security. There is an expectation that we will be able to \ndo multiple things, but over all of that, there is an expectation that \nwe will balance the Nation's checkbook and find a way to be able to \nsolve these issues. I don't think that is an unreasonable request.\n  When we cross over $19 trillion, at what point do we as a body decide \nthat this is enough and that we need to work together to solve the \nissues we face? The Congressional Budget Office continues to challenge \nus and to tell us that this is an unsustainable pace, and the Nation as \nwhole continues to push back. I think we should pay attention to it.\n  I thank Gene Dodaro and the good folks from the Government \nAccountability Office for putting out their latest report on what they \ndefine as opportunities to reduce fragmentation, overlap, duplication, \nand achieve other financial benefits. It is the report that GAO puts \nout every year that we often call a duplication report--here are the \nproblems, here are the unresolved issues.\n  Last year, I asked Gene Dodaro and GAO specifically to break it up \nand to make it very clear--not just to say where it is in government \nbut whose responsibility it is, who can actually fix this. They broke \nit up this year into two different sections basically saying: This is \nthe administration and the agencies. They already have the authority to \nfix this, and these are the issues they face.\n  He also identified 63 areas that specifically only Congress can fix. \nIt is a to-do list for us of things that we need to either vote on and \ndiscuss or we need to disagree with GAO and be able to push back on, \nbut we shouldn't just ignore it and say we are going to do nothing on \nit.\n  We have dealt with this every single year for the last several years. \nWe all face the duplication. We all hear the stories about it. My \nchallenge is, How do we actually bring this to the floor, vote on it, \nsolve it, and move forward from here? It will leave some things \nactually addressed.\n  Part of the issue we face every year with duplication is that \nduplication is buried into the governmental system, and it takes a GAO \nreport to pull it out.\n  I have proposed a bill for several years now. I did it in the House \nand brought it over to the Senate. It is called the Taxpayers Right-To-\nKnow Act. The Taxpayers Right-To-Know Act already passed the House this \nyear, and it has not yet cleared the Senate. The Taxpayers Right-To-\nKnow Act is a very clear transparency piece. It says: Shouldn't we have \na list of every program in the Federal Government, how much we spend on \nthat program, how many staff are committed to it, what that program \ndoes, and, specifically, how it is evaluated? It is a very \nstraightforward, transparent piece.\n\n[[Page S2511]]\n\n  Everyone in this body continues to talk about duplication and says we \nshould do something about it. GAO then highlights it for us, but the \nchallenge is that you can't easily identify it until you do a very deep \nsearch on it. I think we should be able to have a level of transparency \nso we can see where the duplication is by comparing one program to \nanother. That way we can all address it and talk about it.\n  Yesterday, at the Indian Affairs Committee hearing, we were doing a \nmarkup. The conversation in that markup was about several programs that \nseemed to be very good ideas to serve Indian Country. The problem is \nthat many of them already exist in another agency, and they are not \ndoing their job very well. The challenge is this: Can we get rid of it \nin another agency and not just start it in a second, third, or fourth \nagency?\n  We can't continue to say: It is not working over there. So let's just \ndo it somewhere else. Every time I bring up the issue, they say: We \ndon't know what agency it exists in. The Taxpayer's Right-to-Know Act \nprovides a very simple list that should be searchable and public and \nthat everyone would be able to see. It is currently being held up right \nnow and going back and forth in this ongoing conversation about \nsomething as simple as: How many programs should we see?\n  OMB has pushed this issue back on us and said: We will have program \ntransparency but only for the biggest programs.\n  We basically said: If you spend $1 million on this program, you \nshould have transparency.\n  They said: No, let's do a much higher number. Let's do $10 million or \nmore.\n  Yesterday, we asked Gene Dodaro: If we dropped this number from $10 \nmillion to $1 million, how many programs will suddenly go away?\n  He said: It is in the thousands. That just puts us in the same spot. \nWe can't eliminate duplication we can't see. The famous philosopher \nMuhammad Ali said: ``Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee, the \nhands can't hit what the eyes can't see.''\n  We, as a body, spend a lot of our time saying: I would love to get \nrid of duplication, but we can't see it. Let's actually expose it. \nLet's get it out there so everyone can see it and we can clear this \nissue. Let's just solve this very simple issue. Let's make it \ntransparent, and then let's work together.\n  Senator Tester and I had a great conversation after the Indian \nAffairs Committee hearing yesterday. We agreed that we would look for \nareas of duplication in Indian Country. We are not looking for more \nprograms. We are looking for programs that actually work and accomplish \nwhat they should accomplish, and for things that don't work, we can \neliminate them. We can take that money from one area and put it in \nanother area where it actually does work. At the end of the day, we \nhave to get back to balance. We can't keep funding duplicative programs \nthat don't work, and we should be able to accomplish this together.\n  Last year, I put out a report called ``Federal Fumbles: 100 Ways the \nGovernment Dropped the Ball.'' Two-thirds of that book identified \nduplication and waste in the government. We have made progress on some \nof those already this year. We have so much more to do. The key to it \nis that we actually need to get busy working on it instead of just \ntalking about it.\n  Yesterday, Gene Dodaro, who is with GAO, also mentioned a bill that \nBen Sasse is working on called the new hire database bill. I think it \nis a very good bill, and I am glad to be supportive of what he is \ntrying to accomplish there. Senator Sasse wants to do one thing, and \nthat is to be able to say that when we actually do means-tested \nprograms, we should be able to see the employment records. That should \nbe a very open process for those who are in the means-tested program, \nbut right now GAO and other groups do not have access to the new hires \ndatabase. So there is no way to see those in the means-tested program.\n  There are people who self-report their income, and there is no way to \nbe able to verify that. Shouldn't we be able to verify that?\n  It is a straightforward solution in a day and time when they continue \nto bring up obvious things year after year, such as having the same \nperson being eligible for disability and unemployment insurance at the \nsame time. That person will actually receive unemployment and \ndisability benefits simultaneously. Disability benefits, by definition, \nmeans you cannot work anywhere in the economy, and that is why you get \ndisability benefits. Unemployment benefits, by definition, means you \ncan work in the economy, but you are not currently employed. Why should \nyou be eligible for both? GAO has brought that up to us. That is not a \npartisan issue. That should be a solvable issue, and it is costing \ntaxpayers billions of dollars. It is one of the things that we have to \nbe able to work on together so we can actually solve this problem. This \nis not too hard for us, and the American people expect us to get it \ndone.\n  My only challenge is this: Let's actually get it done.\n  With that, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to address two different issues \nthis morning, but I think both are timely and important.\n  The first issue I will address has to do with a telephone \nconversation I had a few minutes ago with Dr. Thomas Frieden. Dr. \nFrieden heads up the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in \nAtlanta, GA. Most Americans don't know much about the agency, but the \ntitle speaks for itself. The CDC, as we call it, is America's first \nline of defense in a public health crisis. When we think that \nAmericans--individuals and families--are in danger or vulnerable, we \ncall the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and ask them to \nanalyze the challenge and then give us the right public health response \nto that challenge.\n  A few months ago, I went to their campus in Atlanta, GA. It is very \nimpressive, not just for the buildings but also for the people who are \nthere. We have some of the best health researchers in the world working \nfor our Federal Government at CDC--most of them at financial sacrifice. \nThey want to be part of solving problems and protecting America. Just \nas the folks in the Pentagon across the river believe in the protection \nof America, so do the people at the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention. The CDC is our first line of defense against public health \nattacks.\n  This morning I called Dr. Frieden to talk about the Zika virus. I \nhave come to know him and have worked with him over the years. Most \npeople have learned about it by now. We are learning more about it \nevery single day. We have kind of traced its origin to South America, \nand now it is moving north. It is moving north into Puerto Rico in a \nbig way, and Florida is likely to be the next State to witness the Zika \nvirus being transmitted by mosquitoes. Then, frankly, the whole United \nStates is vulnerable. Not only can this virus be transmitted to an \nindividual if they are bit by a mosquito, but it can also be \ntransmitted by the sexual contact of a person already infected by the \nvirus. If you have the virus and a mosquito bites you and then bites \nyour wife, you may have just transmitted the virus to her through that \nmosquito. We are learning.\n  The reason why this is more than just a mosquito bite and an \nirritation is that this virus can cause serious public health problems. \nWe know that pregnant women with this virus run the risk of giving \nbirth to babies with difficulties and serious problems, and so we are \nmonitoring it very closely.\n  How many employees at CDC are working on the Zika virus threat to \nAmerica? There are 1,000. When you think of all of the things that we \nneed to worry about, they believe--and, I think, rightly so--that this \nis the imminent public health threat to our country. There are a lot of \nunanswered questions about the Zika virus, such as these: How long does \nit stay in an individual? How long can an individual who is infected \nwith the virus transmit it to another person? For those who are \ncarrying the virus, what impact does it have on their health? What \nimpact does it have on a pregnant woman carrying this virus?\n  It turns out there are literally hundreds now in the United States \nwho have been infected with the Zika virus. We expect some lull in the \nnumber of\n\n[[Page S2512]]\n\ncases, and then they are going to pick up in intensity and number this \nsummer. We also know--and the announcement will be made soon--that \nthere are pregnant women in the United States who have been infected by \nthe Zika virus.\n  The obvious question is this: Are we doing everything we should be \ndoing to protect America?\n  Sadly, the answer is no, we are not.\n  Two months ago, President Obama said to the Congress: I need a \nsupplemental emergency appropriation to deal with this threat. He asked \nfor $1.9 billion. They want to monitor the Zika virus and how it is \ntraveling across the United States. They want to monitor those who have \nalready been infected. They want to develop a vaccine that we can take \nthat will protect us in the future.\n  From where I am standing, I can't think of a single public health \nchallenge in America as great as this Zika virus at this moment. One \nwould think that the Congress, now that they know the facts, would have \nmoved instantly to provide the money to the President--this emergency \nsupplemental appropriation of $1.9 billion. But the answer is they have \ndone nothing. The leaders in the House and in the Senate have done \nnothing to provide emergency funds to this administration to deal with \nthis public health emergency.\n  It is so bad that this week a Republican leader in the House \nannounced publicly that he didn't see any emergency. He thinks we may \nget around to an appropriation for this in October. Well, I don't know \nwhat his lifestyle is like, but in the Midwest we have a tendency to \nget out on the patio and have barbecues and invite our friends and \nneighbors over. We worry about mosquitoes. It doesn't start in October. \nIt starts now. I don't know if this Republican Congressman plans on \nsending a memo to the mosquitoes across America saying: no buzzing and \nbiting until October when we get around to this. It won't work.\n  This has been declared an emergency by not only the President but by \nthe head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n  Why aren't we acting? Why aren't we doing something? We should be \ndoing something.\n  We are going to leave today. This afternoon we will vote and go home. \nWe will be back in probably 10 or 11 days. Maybe then the Republican \nleadership in the House and Senate will decide this is an emergency \nthat needs a response. The numbers will start coming in--the number of \npeople across America who are facing this virus--and the concern among \nAmerican families is going to grow. This is not just an irritation. \nThis is a danger to many people and certainly to women who could be \npregnant. This is something we ought to be taking extremely seriously. \nWe have been waiting for 2 months for this Congress to respond with an \nemergency appropriation to do something.\n  I have called on the leadership in the Senate this week, and I will \ncontinue to do so today and when we return. There is no excuse. God \nforbid this gets worse and we look back and say: We waited too long; we \ndidn't respond.\n  Let me add one other thing. The only suggestion we have heard from \nthe Republican side is this: Let's take some of the money we set aside \nto fight Ebola in Africa and use it for this purpose.\n  I talked to Dr. Friedman about that. He said: It is true; there has \nbeen a real drop in the number of Ebola cases.\n  Ebola is a deadly disease in West Africa and other places, and we \nworried about it coming to the United States. He said that we are still \nlearning about how this disease travels.\n  There was a man who was cured after being diagnosed with Ebola in \nAfrica, and they just learned that a year after he was cured, he \ntransmitted the disease by sexual contact to another person. Even when \nwe think we have cured and solved it, there is still a danger.\n  Let's make sure that we treat all of these public health hazards for \nwhat they are--dangerous to the United States and dangerous to our \nfamilies. God forbid that something terrible happen. I hope it doesn't. \nLet's do our job here on Capitol Hill. When the President says we need \nresources to fight this, we do. I hope we move on it very quickly when \nwe return.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/senate-section/article/S2512-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2512-S2513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, immigration is an issue which divides \nAmerica. You only have to tune into the Presidential debate to hear it. \nMost everyone would agree that the immigration system in America is \nbroken. I believe it is. I was part of an effort with some colleagues \nto try to come up with a comprehensive immigration reform bill, which \npassed the Senate 3 years ago by a vote of 68 to 32. We worked long and \nhard on that bill. We brought this bipartisan bill to the Senate, and \nit passed with an overwhelming majority. The House refused to consider \nthe measure. Speaker Boehner never called it to the floor. The bill we \npassed never ever got a vote on the floor of the House of \nRepresentatives, and so here we sit today with the same broken \nimmigration system.\n  Let me tell you that one part of that is very important to me and to \nmany of my colleagues. Fifteen years ago I introduced a bill called the \nDREAM Act. The genesis of that bill--as I have said on the floor many \ntimes and will quickly repeat--began after we got a call in my Chicago \noffice from a Korean American woman who had a daughter who was a \nmusical prodigy. She was an amazing pianist and had been accepted at \ntwo of the best music schools in America. She was filling out her \napplication and asked her mom: What do I put down for my nationality or \ncitizenship. Her mom said: I don't know. When we brought you here, \nTereza, you were 2 years old and came here on a visitor's visa. I never \nfiled any more papers. So I don't know. The daughter said: What are we \ngoing to do? The mom said: We are going to call Durbin's office.\n\n  So they called our office and we said: Let us check the law.\n  The law was very clear. This 18-year-old girl, brought here at the \nage of 2, under American law had to leave the United States for 10 \nyears and apply to come back in. Does that sound right? When she was 2 \nyears old, she had no voice in the decision to come to America, no \nvoice in the decision of filing papers. Yet our law basically told her \nto leave.\n  That is when I introduced the DREAM Act. It says that if you are \nbrought here under the age of 16, complete high school, no serious \ncriminal issues in your background, we will give you a chance. We will \ngive you a path to become legal and ultimately become a citizen. That \nis what the DREAM Act is.\n  We haven't passed that bill. We have passed it maybe once in the \nSenate, once in the House but never brought it together to be sent to \nthe President. This President, Barack Obama, was my fellow Senator from \nIllinois for 2 years and he cosponsored the DREAM Act.\n  So a few years ago, I joined in a letter to the President, with \nSenator Dick Lugar, a Republican from Indiana, and said to him: Help us \nprotect these young people from being deported until we can finally \npass comprehensive immigration reform or the DREAM Act. The President \nlistened and did it. He created what is known as DACA. What DACA says \nis, if you are such a young person, you may step forward, register with \nthe government, submit yourself to a criminal background check, pay a \nseveral-hundred-dollar filing fee, and then we will give you temporary \nprotection from deportation. Then, 2 years later, 3 years later, you \nhave to reapply--go through the same process--pay a fee and do it \nagain.\n  As it turned out, 700,000 young people, who were in the same \nsituation as the Korean girl I mentioned from Chicago, have applied for \nthis DACA protection so they can stay here on a temporary basis and go \nto school, work, and be a part of the United States. There is no \nguarantee they will ever become permanently legal or citizens--I hope \nthey will--but at least they are protected on a temporary basis.\n  Two years later, the President said: If you are in a family where one \nof the kids in the house is an American citizen or here legally in the \nUnited States as a permanent resident, we are going to give parents the \nsame opportunity to register with the government, to go through a \ncriminal background check, to pay their fee to the government, then to \nbe given a temporary work permit to work in the United States. That is \nknown as DAPA. So we have DACA and DAPA. It is currently being \nchallenged in the Supreme Court.\n\n[[Page S2513]]\n\n  I went over for the argument before the Supreme Court last week. The \nState of Texas and 25 other States have challenged this saying it will \ncreate benefits for these individuals under DACA and DAPA that will \ncost the States money. It turns out, the whole story is that once these \npeople are working in the United States and paying taxes, the State of \nTexas and all the other States are going to make quite a bit more money \noff these workers when they actually are required to pay taxes, as they \nshould. So this economic argument doesn't go too far.\n  The point I have tried to make to my colleagues in the Senate, as \nlong as I have been here and as long as I have had this opportunity to \ntalk about the DREAM Act, is that they ought to take a moment, stop \nlistening to the Presidential debates, and just pay attention to the \nlives which are at stake in this conversation.\n  I have come to the floor quite a few times to talk about young people \nwho would be helped if the DREAM Act became the law of the land. This \nmorning I am going to introduce Cynthia Sanchez to those who are \nwatching.\n  Cynthia Sanchez is another young person who is living in the United \nStates and is undocumented. She was brought here at the age of 7 from \nMexico. She grew up in Denver, CO. She was an excellent student. In \nhigh school, Cynthia was a member of the National Honor Society and \nmade the President's honor roll every semester with a 4.0 grade point \naverage. I wish I could say the same about my high school experience.\n  Cynthia was vice president and co-president of the Student Council. \nShe volunteered as a peer mediator and volunteered at the local \nlibrary. She went on to attend the University of Denver where she \nreceived lots of awards and scholarships and was an active volunteer.\n  For the record, undocumented young people like Cynthia receive no \nFederal assistance to go to college--no Pell grants, no government \nloans. They have to find a way to pay for it. They can't use any \ngovernment benefits to move forward with their education.\n  She was a member of a student organization called the Pioneer \nLeadership Program. She helped to develop Denver University Senior \nConnect, an organization to help raise awareness about the needs of \nsenior citizens.\n  As a member of the Volunteers in Partnership Program, Cynthia \norganized workshops at high schools and middle schools with low-income \nand minority student populations. She helped the students fill out \ntheir college applications and write scholarship essays, and she \nbrought the students to visit her campus at the University of Denver.\n  She graduated in 2010 with a degree in cognitive neuroscience, which \nis a double major in psychology and biology, and she even minored in \nchemistry on top of that.\n  Because of her immigration status--and despite the fact that she had \nthis amazing college experience and was academically successful and had \nthis important degree--she couldn't find a job. She wasn't even able to \nvolunteer at a local hospital because she lacked a Social Security \nnumber, being undocumented.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you.\n  Cynthia's dream to become a doctor was on hold because of her \nimmigration status. Only nine schools told her she might be able to \napply and be considered as an undocumented student. Two years after \ngraduating, Cynthia was working as a nanny and questioning whether all \nthe hard work and time in school was wasted.\n  Cynthia cried as President Obama made the announcement about creating \nDACA. She realized she was going to be given a chance. She applied for \nDACA immediately. She was approved in the summer of 2013. By September, \nCynthia was working at Northwestern University in Chicago doing \nclinical research in the Department of Medicine's Division of \nCardiology. Her research focuses on improving treatment options for \npatients facing heart failure.\n  She sent me a letter, and this is what she said:\n\n       DACA has meant a new realm of opportunities for me, it has \n     opened new doors for me, and it has allowed me to once again \n     see my dream as a reality. I truly believe that if those \n     opposed to DACA or the DREAM Act had the chance to sit down \n     and meet undocumented students, their opinions might change. \n     They would see capable, smart, hard-working individuals who \n     are Americans in every sense of the word, love this country \n     and want to contribute to its prosperity. After all, this is \n     our home.\n\n  Cynthia and the other DREAMers have a lot to give to America. Like \nmany Americans who have come to this country, they are willing to \nsacrifice. They are willing to go to the back of the line. All they are \nasking for is a chance.\n  I urge my colleagues--particularly my Republican colleagues--to join \nus in doing the right thing for these DREAMers, doing the right thing \nfor Cynthia, and thousands of others who are just asking for a chance \nto make America a better nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/senate-section/article/S2513-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2513-S2514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DUCHENNE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, the fight against muscular dystrophy is a \ncause I have championed since my days in the House of Representatives. \nMy fight against Duchenne muscular dystrophy began when a parent told \nme about his son's diagnosis with the disease.\n  This parent refused to accept that there was no hope. The House and \nSenate agreed with the MD-CARE Act and, since that time, the life \nexpectancy of the average Duchenne muscular dystrophy patient has \nincreased by a full decade. This is progress we have made on behalf of \nsick people whose lives were threatened, and this is an example of \ngovernment at its best.\n  On Monday of this week, I saw the same devotion in the hundreds of \nDuchenne families who attended a meeting of the advisers of the Food \nand Drug Administration. The meeting's attendance broke records. I \nthank the FDA for making the appropriate accommodations to handle a \ncrowd of this size. Some 11,000 people also tuned in remotely, watching \nthe meeting via live stream.\n  Monday's gathering was about what could be the first disease-\nmodifying therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. For more than 3 \nhours, the advisory committee heard from parents, doctors, and patients \nabout the drug's impact on their lives. The stories were heartfelt and \nhopeful, reinforcing the importance of patient engagement in the drug \napproval process. The dedication of the Duchenne community continues to \nset an example for advocates of other rare diseases.\n  Patient voices should be part of the drug review process, and I am \nglad to see the FDA is implementing greater stakeholder involvement in \nthis process. This was one of the goals of the Food and Drug \nAdministration Safety and Innovation Act, which Congress passed in \n2012. It continues to be a goal of my Patient-Focused Impact Assessment \nAct, introduced last year, which would require FDA to share how they \nuse feedback from patients and advocates in the drug approval process.\n  Unfortunately, the advisory committee decided this week not to \nrecommend the approval of the first Duchenne drug. This is \ndisappointing news for me and for thousands of Duchenne families, even \nthose who might not benefit directly from this drug but from other \nadvancements that could stem from it.\n  Before a final decision is made next month, I hope the FDA will take \ninto consideration the perspectives of Duchenne patients and parents. \nThe individuals fighting the good fight every day are ``the real \nexperts,'' to quote Austin Leclaire, who suffers from Duchenne and has \nexperienced increased mobility because of the drug. People like Austin \nhave a life-threatening disease now. They don't have much time.\n  No matter the outcome of the FDA's decision next month, I will \ncontinue to fight the good fight on behalf of those with Duchenne \nmuscular dystrophy. In the 15 years since I introduced the MD-CARE, I \nhave learned that small wins can lead to big victories.\n  MD-CARE was the first Federal law to focus on muscular dystrophy. It \nhelped set in motion the research and\n\n[[Page S2514]]\n\ntrials that have produced groundbreaking therapies. The life of \nmuscular dystrophy patients now is an average of 12 years longer--I \nthink I earlier said a decade; it is actually 12 years longer than it \nwas in 2001--a wonderful achievement. There are more trial participants \nneeded today than there are Duchenne patients.\n  Young adults with Duchenne were a population that did not exist when \nwe first funded research for the disease. They never got to adulthood. \nToday they are getting to adulthood because Congress acted. Because of \nthe MD-CARE amendments that became law last Congress, research at the \nNational Institutes of Health has been updated in ways that could help \npatients lead even longer, healthier lives. We want this research to \ncontinue. We want companies to continue to invest in drugs and \ntherapies that could change the lives of those with rare diseases.\n  Duchenne is still a fatal disease, affecting 1 out of every 3,500 \nboys--mostly boys. Most young men with Duchenne live only to their mid \nto late twenties. We should take every opportunity to find a \nbreakthrough. We should take every opportunity to improve quality of \nlife. This is about the futures of young people who face this disease \nevery day and the families who refuse to give up hope.\n  I look forward to the FDA's full and final decision on this matter \nnext month, and I certainly am hoping for a positive answer from the \nFDA.\n  Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/senate-section/article/S2514-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING TERRY REDLIN\n\n  Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to \ndisplay this Terry Redlin painting during my speech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Terry Redlin, a \ncitizen of South Dakota who rose to fame in the 1970s as an artist \nknown for his vivid and vibrant outdoor paintings.\n  On Sunday, April 24, 2016, Terry passed away at the age of 78 in \nWatertown, where he was born and raised. Our entire State was deeply \nsaddened to hear of his passing. Terry spent his life promoting South \nDakota, and he shared his appreciation for our great State with the \nentire world through his paintings. He will be missed deeply, not only \nby his family and loved ones but by all who admired his work throughout \nhis very distinguished career.\n  Growing up, Terry liked to draw. He didn't think he would become an \nartist, though. As an avid outdoorsman, he wanted to be a forest ranger \nso there would be plenty of opportunities to hunt and fish when he \nwasn't working. Then, tragically, at the age of 15, his life was \nchanged forever. He was badly hurt in a motorcycle accident, and his \nleg had to be amputated. Becoming a forest ranger was now impossible \nfor Terry, but Terry didn't let that stop him from pursuing greatness.\n  After graduating high school, Terry received a disability scholarship \nto help further his education. Using it, he earned a degree from the \nSt. Paul School of Associated Arts and spent 25 successful years \nworking in commercial art as a layout artist, graphic designer, \nillustrator, and art director. In his spare time, he enjoyed \nphotography, particularly of the outdoors and wildlife. Then he started \npainting from his photographs and from his memories.\n  In 1977, at the age of 40, Redlin's painting ``Winter Snows'' \nappeared on the cover of The Farmer magazine. He quickly rose to \nprominence as an exceptional artist and started painting full time. \nFrom 1990 to 1998, each year's poll of national art galleries by U.S. \nArt Magazine selected Terry Redlin as ``America's Most Popular \nArtist.''\n  Over the years, many people have tried to describe the effect Terry's \npaintings had on them. People connect with his paintings. They inspire \nus to remember personal memories of past times, places, and \nexperiences. Your heart is tugged when you look at them. There is \npeacefulness and warmth. Terry used to call it romantic realism, but \nmere words simply cannot describe it. As you can see from this Redlin \npainting beside me entitled ``America, America,'' which I brought with \nme from my front office where it normally hangs, the beauty of his \npaintings is truly indescribable.\n  His son convinced him to stop selling original paintings and just \nsell prints. Someday, he said, they would build a beautiful art gallery \nto display all of the originals. And they did. It could have been built \nin the Twin Cities, where he lived for a time, or a large metropolitan \narea, because Terry's paintings are loved everywhere. Terry chose his \nhometown of Watertown, SD, for the construction of the Redlin Art \nCenter. It was a gift to his home State and hometown for that $1,500 \nscholarship he was given all those years ago, which created a wonderful \nlife for him and his family.\n  Three million visitors came to the Redlin Art Center in the first 3 \nyears and many more millions since then. Terry would sometimes walk \ninto the galleries unannounced and visit with guests who would then ask \nthe front desk: Who is that nice guy? When told it was Terry, they were \nshocked and delighted.\n  Once Terry was seen driving slowly through the parking lot. When \nasked what he was doing, he said he was looking at all the different \nlicense plates and what they were doing there. He said he was amazed \nthat people would travel so far just to see his paintings.\n  Terry was also generous to the subjects of many of his creations. His \npaintings and prints have been used by various wildlife and \nconservation groups to raise more than $40 million to benefit their \ncauses.\n  For those of us who were blessed with the opportunity to meet and \nknow Terry Redlin, we always came away feeling like he was our friend--\nso wonderful, so kind, and so humble. For those who know him through \nhis paintings, his spirit shone brightly in all of his work.\n  As we mourn his death and pray for his loved ones during this \ndifficult time, may we find comfort knowing that the legacy which he \nleaves behind through his paintings will be enjoyed and appreciated for \ngenerations to come. He was a great painter but an even greater human \nbeing.\n  Terry once said that he wanted to paint forever, that he had to \npaint. Terry said it was like breathing to him. Unfortunately, illness \nforced him into retirement in 2007, and on Sunday, April 24, 2016, the \nLord brought Terry up to Heaven. Now he can breathe again.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/senate-section/article/S2514-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               Zika Virus\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to start by expressing my \nappreciation to all of my colleagues who are joining me on the floor \ntoday, and I thank them for all the work they do every day for women \nand their health care.\n  As of last week, the CDC reported nearly 900 cases of Zika here in \nthe United States and three U.S. territories, including actually two \nconfirmed in my home State of Washington.\n  A recent survey showed that 40 percent of adults in the United States \nsee\n\n[[Page S2515]]\n\nthe Zika virus as the reason to delay starting a family. Like so many \nof my colleagues, I am hearing from women across my State who are very \nfrightened about this virus. They want to know how to travel safely in \nlight of Zika. They want to know whether they should wait to start \ntheir families. Tragically, I am hearing from expectant mothers who are \nconcerned about what this virus could mean for the babies they have on \nthe way.\n  Women and families at home and abroad need Congress to take action \nagainst this virus, to help raise awareness about its impact, to expand \naccess to contraception and family planning, to improve vector control, \nand to accelerate our efforts to find a vaccine. That is why for months \nDemocrats have urged Republicans to come to the table and work with us \non making sure we put the needed resources into this fight against \nZika.\n  The administration has put forward a strong proposal, but Republicans \nrefused to even consider it. While some in the Republican Party \nindicated last week they wanted to work with us on emergency \nsupplemental funding, it has become pretty clear that unfortunately \nthey have been beaten back by the extreme rightwing who do not want to \ndo anything at all. These extreme conservatives do not recognize that \nZika is an emergency. They don't want to give the administration a \npenny more. As a result of that delay, we are behind the eight ball as \nmosquito season comes this summer.\n  That is why we have come to the floor together today to send a very \nclear message to Republicans today: We need action now. Women simply \ncannot afford to wait, and they should not have to. Democrats are ready \nto get this done as soon as possible. And for families and communities \nwho are looking to Congress for action, I hope Republicans join us now \nso that we can deliver what families are asking for in our country.\n  Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I want to start by thanking Senator \nHeitkamp for pulling us in here today to talk about this emergency and \nSenator Murray for her strong voice on this and many others who will be \nspeaking out today.\n  In 2014 Ebola broke out in West Africa. As it advanced, the \ninternational community came together to combat the outbreak. Doctors \nfrom around the world traveled to West Africa to set up emergency \nhospital units to help the sick and to attempt to contain the virus. \nPresident Obama deployed thousands of troops to support the effort.\n  With the media focused on the outbreak right in the middle of the \n2014 election, Republican Senators and Republican candidates across the \ncountry seized on this global health crisis. No, they didn't swoop in \nto rescue; in fact, Republicans did nothing to support the actual Ebola \nresponse before the elections. Instead, they terrified the American \npeople with totally made-up stories of Ebola-infected immigrants coming \nacross our southern border. They loudly trumpeted a number of dangerous \nand irresponsible solutions, such as travel bans that would actually \nmake dealing with the problem more difficult.\n  Ebola ravaged West Africa, but only four cases were ever diagnosed \nhere in the United States. Republican politicians didn't care--they had \nfound something to blame on President Obama and the Democrats, and they \nwere happy to do it. They exploited the situation to help win an \nelection. And it worked. Not all of the fearmongering candidates won, \nbut most of them did, and they won in part because they promised to \nprotect the American people from these horrible contagious diseases.\n  Today, Republicans run the Senate, and we face a terrible threat \nright here in America--the rapidly spreading Zika virus. So I come to \nthe floor to ask a simple question: Why haven't Republicans lifted a \nsingle finger to stop it?\n  Unlike Ebola, Zika is not confined to one small region of the world; \nit has already spread through most of South America and through Mexico. \nUnlike Ebola, which can be transmitted only by direct contact with \nbodily fluids, Zika can spread rapidly across distances by transmission \nthrough mosquitoes. Unlike Ebola, our leaders at the NIH and CDC are \nraising the alarm that Zika is an imminent threat to Americans. Nearly \n900 cases of Zika have already been reported on American soil.\n  Zika can be devastating. Most people who contract Zika show no \nsymptoms or only very mild symptoms, but Zika infections can trigger \nGuillain-Barre syndrome, a condition in which the body attacks its own \nnervous system, which can cause permanent and severe damage, \nhospitalizing some people for weeks and killing others. In addition, \nbabies born to mothers who were infected with Zika may suffer severe \nand permanent brain damage. The World Health Organization estimates \nthat 4 million people could be infected with Zika by the end of the \nyear.\n  The threat is real, but where are the Republicans? For weeks Senate \nDemocrats have called for emergency supplemental funding to support \npublic health efforts both in research and prevention. Republicans have \ndone nothing. For weeks the President has called for emergency \nsupplemental funding to protect the American people. Republicans have \ndone nothing. For weeks leaders at the WHO, NIH, and CDC have begged \nCongress for resources to fight this disease. Republicans have done \nnothing. The President has been forced to divert funds intended for \nwork on Ebola over to work on Zika. That is a very short-term strategy. \nEbola has dropped out of the news, but the threat has not ended. We \nneed funding for work on both, but still the Republicans have done \nnothing.\n  Now Senate Republicans are taking us on a week-long recess. Where is \nthe Republican plan to fund the Zika response? Where is the Republican \nplan to replenish the Ebola funds? Apparently, when there is no \nimmediate political benefit, the Republicans can't be bothered to act. \nForget Ebola. Forget Zika. They want to go on vacation.\n  Well, I have news for my Republican colleagues: That is not good \nenough. They won the election by telling Americans they would protect \nthem from scenarios just like this. Republicans run the Senate now, so \nit is time to govern. There is a public health crisis bearing down on \nthis country. Babies will be born permanently disabled, and families \nwill be devastated if Republicans keep blocking funding to deal with \nthis problem. It is up to you to act.\n  This is what government is for--to help protect the people of the \nUnited States from serious threats, from real threats. The Republicans \nare failing the people of the United States.\n  Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Madam President, lest anyone think that they are immune \nor that this is only about the tropics, I don't think a lot of people \nin the United States of America would call the State of North Dakota \nthe tropics. Today I hold up the first noted case of a pregnant woman \nwho has been infected by Zika. She was traveling, probably bitten by a \nmosquito, and somehow contracted the Zika virus. She will now live in \nfear that the baby she is carrying will suffer the birth defects we \nknow are associated with this potential pandemic.\n  Where is the answer for her? The answer that the North Dakota \nepidemiologist gave for her, which is good advice, is: Don't travel \nanywhere where we have Zika virus infections. I guess she is not \nleaving her house because the way this is spreading and the way this is \nmoving, it will be everywhere in the United States of America.\n  Once it migrates, and once it moves, what is going to stop it? Who is \ngoing to stand on the floor of the Senate and take responsibility for \nthe lack of action, for the lack of responding to this public health \ncrisis? That is why we are coming here today. This is not about \npolitics. This is not about a public health emergency. We need \nresources. We need answers. We need tests. We don't need to rob from \nother potential pandemics like Ebola to get this done.\n  There is not a citizen in the country who would not say this is an \nobligation of the government to protect their people. We anticipate in \nPuerto Rico, a territory of this country--a lot of people travel to and \nfrom Puerto Rico--\n\n[[Page S2516]]\n\none in five people in Puerto Rico will be infected by the Zika virus. \nDo they know it? Probably not. Frequently no symptoms come with the \ninfection. So now we have to respond. Now we have to do what is right.\n  People will say: We can take this in regular order. That is what I \nhear is happening over in the House. They want to take this in regular \norder. Well, if it is a regular problem, why has the State of Florida \ndeclared a state of emergency? In February--this is not new--it is \nestimated Florida will continue to be the next big place of infection \nas the Zika virus migrates.\n  What does that mean to Florida? Not only does it mean you have \ncreated huge insecurity for the families--particularly young women the \nage of our children who are now thinking about having babies you have \ncreated huge insecurity. If the answer is don't have babies, how many \ngenerations do we have to go? We don't know. That is the problem. We \ndon't know. There is no test. There is no way to verify at this point--\nno rapid test.\n  So when we look at this and we look at the effect it is having not \nonly on our families and on family decisions but look at the effect it \nis having on tourism--we all know the Caribbean depends on tourism \ndollars to have stable governments. We all know Florida is heavily \ndependent on tourism. People in my office have already canceled plans \nfor Caribbean vacations. People I know have already canceled plans to \ngo to Florida because they are afraid.\n  What happens when everybody is staying home because they are afraid? \nThis is not something we can play politics with. This is something that \nshould unite all of us. We should all be coming together. If you don't \nlike the President's plan, tell us what is wrong with it. Tell us what \nyou need to change. Tell us what your experts,--contrary to the experts \nat CDC who have arrived at this plan--tell us what your experts think \nneeds to be changed and what level of accountability you need.\n  I understand this morning the argument is not that we should spend \nthe money, the argument is there is no accountability. Tell us what \naccountability. Come together. Let's solve this problem. Let's rise to \nthe occasion in the Senate. When confronted with this virus, let's come \ntogether. Let's show the people we can respond.\n  I don't think I am exaggerating the potential health care effects. \nThe World Health Organization has declared it an emergency. A \nconservative Governor in Florida has declared it an emergency. \nCertainly for this young North Dakota woman, it is an emergency. She \nneeds to know and her family needs to know exactly how this virus is \ntransmitted and what she can expect going forward.\n  She is just one of, I think, the first cases. My great friend the \nSenator from Washington--not exactly the tropics in the State of \nWashington as well--also has one case. We don't know how many more. We \ndon't know how many more.\n  So I am pleading, let's not wait. Let's treat this like the emergency \nit is. Let's do what we need to do to protect American families, \nparticularly young women of child-bearing age who are going to be \ndevastated if this happens in their families. So let's do the right \nthing. Let's come together. If there is a problem with the proposal, \nlet's debate what that proposal should look like. Let's bring it to the \nfloor. Offer amendments for accountability.\n  Why are we waiting? Someone needs to answer that question, not just \nto me but to American families and to the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I come to the floor to join my \ncolleagues because I share their very real concerns about the impact of \nthe Zika virus on families in New Hampshire--also not a tropical \nState--the impact on people across the country here in the United \nStates, and also on people around the world.\n  As has been pointed out, we have seen reports in regions with active \nmosquito-borne transmission of the virus, places such as Brazil, where \nthey are about to host the Olympics. People will be traveling there \nfrom all over the United States, from all over the world. We have seen \nthose stories of women who have had children with severe birth defects, \nwith microcephaly, as a result of their exposure and contracting the \nvirus during pregnancy.\n  We have also seen impacts on adults. The connection that seems to be \nthere, and I think we are still waiting on definitive research, but the \nconnection in adults between Guillain-Barre syndrome and the Zika virus \nis also very real. While fortunately in America in most cases that can \nbe treated, the reality is, in a lot of places around the world and for \nsome people, it causes severe paralysis and sometimes even death. So \nthis is not just something that affects pregnant women, but there are \nalso concerns about who else might be affected by this virus.\n  As we have heard from North Dakota, as we have heard from other \nStates, as mosquito season arrives in this country, we can expect \nadditional Zika cases, transmitted often by mosquitoes from tropical \nareas, that people contract when they are traveling. We know this \nmosquito is coming to America. In New Hampshire, where neither of the \ntwo known mosquito vectors currently live, we have already had three \ncases of Zika, with about 150 possible cases that are still being \ntested.\n  Two of those cases were acquired as a result of traveling to Zika-\nimpacted regions, but the third was contracted because of sexual \ntransmission of the disease from a partner who had been traveling. Last \nweek I chaired a roundtable on Zika in Concord, NH, in our capital. We \nhad representatives who are looking at what might happen with the virus \nand our planning for an outbreak, which we hope we can avoid.\n  We had doctors from the State, we had the State epidemiologist, we \nhad the director of the State lab, and we had people who are working on \nmosquito control. They talked about how over the last several months \nthey have been getting more and more questions about Zika, particularly \nfrom women who are planning to have children in the near future, and \nfor pregnant women and their families or women and their partners who \nare beginning to think about starting a family.\n  As Senator Heitkamp pointed out, the threat of Zika is very real. We \nhad one of the doctors, an obstetrician, at that roundtable who \nreported that many of her family patients are canceling vacations they \nhad planned and some of her patients whose husbands are in the military \nwho are stationed in Zika-infected countries are concerned about how to \nprotect themselves and what they need to do when they return.\n  We heard from folks at our New Hampshire Department of Health and \nHuman Services who talked about the importance of increased access to \nfamily planning and contraceptives and the Zika outbreak impact on the \nneed for those services. It gives us a new lens on the importance of \nmaking sure women and families have access to this health care.\n  We need to make sure all women at risk or diagnosed with Zika have \naccess to comprehensive, patient-centered contraceptives and \npreconception counseling. We also heard from the folks involved with \nmosquito control. What they told us is, there are two mosquitoes that \ncan spread the Zika virus, that we know of at this time. One of those \nis a mosquito that is only in the tropics, that we are never going to \nsee in northern New Hampshire and in northern New England.\n  The second mosquito, we have already found in Connecticut and \nMassachusetts. The mosquito control folks said that unlike the usual \nspraying for mosquitoes, which is in wetland areas and swampy areas in \nNew Hampshire, this is a mosquito that, as Secretary Burwell has \ndescribed it, ``can breed in as little as a capful of water.'' They are \nmosquitoes that bite people four times in order to get a meal, so they \nspread very fast.\n  What we heard from the mosquito control folks who were at this \nmeeting was that they are encouraging people to look at places in their \nyards where water might collect in small spaces, in wheelbarrows, in \npaint cans, in places we would not normally think about mosquitoes \ngrowing.\n  They also encouraged people to think about protecting themselves. \nWhen you are going out, think about covering up, wearing long sleeves, \nwearing slacks, wearing socks when you are outside at a time when \nmosquitoes might be around.\n\n[[Page S2517]]\n\n  The other concern about the Zika mosquito is that it also is active \nduring the day. It is not like most of the mosquitoes we see in New \nHampshire, which are active at night. This is a mosquito that is also \nactive during the day. So we need to be taking action now. I listened \nto the head of the State lab in New Hampshire talking about the \nchallenge of getting results from the lab for people who had been \ntested for Zika.\n  He said: Sometimes we have to send out to labs. We don't have the \ncapacity in New Hampshire to do the analysis that is required. We are \nstill looking for a test that can definitively determine if somebody \nhas had Zika in the past. He said: Something as small as the ability to \nferry the samples and the results back and forth to a lab is one of the \nthings we need so we can get answers so we know how to act.\n  The folks who are trying to get information out to the public talked \nabout the need to have support so they could get information out, both \nto the medical community and to individuals, about the importance of \nwhat individuals need to do to take action.\n  They said very directly to me, as I said that I appreciate this is \nsomething we need to work with you on in Washington, they said: We \ndon't have the resources to respond to this in the way we need to in \nNew Hampshire. For those people who would say: Don't worry. You are \nexaggerating. This is never going to come to New Hampshire, well, that \nis what they told us about the West Nile virus. That is what they told \nus about EEE. We have had deaths in New Hampshire in recent years from \nboth of those viruses. So I think we need to act on this. I know there \nhas been an agreement in the Appropriations Committee, among the \nappropriators on both sides of the aisle. It has been a bipartisan \nagreement to help get a supplemental funding bill to the floor to \naddress this because in New Hampshire what I have heard is that we need \nhelp. We need Washington to help us. If we are concerned about the cost \nof this, just think about what our inaction will do? What if we have an \noutbreak and we have people who--we have thousands of women, as they do \nin Brazil, who have been infected and who have had babies with \nmicrocephaly. What are the health care costs to people who might have \nbeen infected by the Zika virus, with Guillain-Barre syndrome, with \nother birth defects as a result of being infected during pregnancy?\n  So this is a bill we can't afford to wait on. We need to address \nthis. If folks are not willing to do it because it is the right thing \nto do, they ought to be willing to do it because it is the cost-\neffective thing to do. I hope we can come together. I know people on \nboth sides of the aisle are concerned about this. We need to come \ntogether. We need to address this. It is a pending public health \nemergency. We have to respond.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, I rise to join my colleagues in raising \nawareness about the Zika virus and the need to pass the President's \nemergency appropriations request to get ahead of this crisis in the \nmaking.\n  Some question the need for this emergency appropriations request. \nPerhaps those who believe that funding the President's request is a \nwaste feel that we are not at immediate risk, but you have heard my \nother colleagues talking about how this is an impending crisis. While \nZika may not seem like a threat in the United States now because we \nhave not hit peak mosquito season, this head-in-sand mentality is \nirresponsible. Zika is ravaging South America, which is having its \nsummer right now. Zika is on the move. The mosquito that is the main \nZika carrier is already in 13 States, and another mosquito also capable \nof spreading the Zika virus is in 30 States. As families travel this \nsummer, they will be moving in and out of States and countries impacted \nby Zika.\n  To my colleagues who aren't worried about the spread of Zika right \nnow, it is time for all of us to wake up. With summer comes \nmosquitoes--including, of course, the mosquito that carries Zika. We \nmust do all we can to ensure that Zika does not gain a foothold in the \nUnited States. Let's act, not react, to this Zika threat. This means \nfunding the President's $1.9 billion request for Zika.\n  Hawaii knows firsthand the impact of vector-borne diseases such as \nZika and of the resources and effort it takes to contain an outbreak. \nSeven Hawaii residents have already been diagnosed with Zika. One \ninfant born to a mother with Zika has been diagnosed with microcephaly, \na devastating birth defect.\n  On top of that, Hawaii has been dealing with an outbreak of dengue \nfever, which is spread by the same mosquito that carries Zika. The \ndengue outbreak in Hawaii began in September, and only yesterday were \nwe able to go 30 days without a new dengue case.\n  The unique location of Hawaii means it serves as transit location for \nmany Pacific Island nations where Zika outbreaks have occurred in the \nrecent past, places such as Yap and French Polynesia. We know that this \ndisease can migrate and that it can migrate quickly. That is why we \nhave to get ahead of it.\n  Having the administration shift Ebola funding around is not the \nanswer. That is akin to robbing Peter to pay Paul. What will we do if \nEbola has a resurgence this summer--shift money back from Zika?\n  The United States is in a strong position, compared to many other \ncountries, to fight Zika. We have indevelopment vaccines, blood \nscreenings, cleaning tools, and research that will be game changers.\n  When the President sent his $1.9 billion request to Congress, he laid \nout how the funding would be spent or used. It would go toward vector \ncontrol, public education campaigns, and vaccine development. It would \ngo toward the work of companies such as Hawaii Biotech, which is racing \nto complete work on a vaccine.\n  We must fund the emergency request so Federal agencies that stand on \nthe battle lines of combating disease can do their work. We must also \nstrengthen vector control programs and emergency preparedness programs. \nIt is imperative that we give our communities the tools they need to \nfight Zika. Time is still on our side right now, but time is running \nout and we must act quickly. Let's come together to ensure that Zika \ndoes not become a full-blown public health emergency in the United \nStates. Let's fund the President's request.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I rise today to discuss this urgent \npublic health emergency. I am honored to be here with Senator Murray, \nSenator Mikulski, Senator Heitkamp, and Senator Hirono as we look at \nthis serious crisis facing our Nation, and that is the Zika virus.\n  The World Health Organization has declared that Zika is spreading \nexplosively and will affect nearly all countries in North America and \nSouth America. The virus has already infected nearly 400 Americans who \nhave traveled abroad from 40 States, including my home State of \nMinnesota. Over 500 people in Puerto Rico have the disease. Nearly all \nof them contracted the virus locally. These numbers will only continue \nto grow as the warmer months bring more mosquitoes that transmit this \ndisease. In fact, researchers calculate that 60 percent of the people \nin our country live in an area that will likely be affected.\n  Zika is a rapidly evolving mosquito-borne virus. Most infected \npatients develop mild flu-like symptoms that last for a week. However, \nthe virus has devastating consequences for growing families. \nResearchers have now confirmed what many feared was true: A pregnant \nwoman infected with Zika is at risk of giving birth to a child with \nmicrocephaly. This heartbreaking, lifelong condition results in \nnewborns with abnormally small heads. These children will need \nincreased access to health care and developmental services, such as \nspeech therapy, occupational therapy, and physical therapy. There is no \nknown cure for this disease or even standard treatment for this \ncondition.\n  It is crucial that physicians have the knowledge and tools essential \nto diagnose and care for pregnant women who may be infected with Zika. \nIt is crucial that moms with Zika and children with microcephaly have \naccess to the services they need. It is crucial that we\n\n[[Page S2518]]\n\ntake steps now to ensure that our health care system and all levels of \ngovernment are prepared for the imminent spread of the Zika virus.\n  We are here today to continue to stress the urgent need to ensure \nthat our country is as prepared as possible to mitigate the spread of \nZika and respond to outbreaks of this virus.\n  The administration submitted a request for nearly $2 billion in \nemergency funds to provide immediate support. This is about research. \nThis is about a vaccine. This is about therapeutics and diagnostics. \nThis is about a medical health crisis that primarily--but not only--\naffects women and children. That is why the women Democrats of the \nSenate have gathered on the floor today to speak out, to speak out and \nsay this is a crisis that must be funded. This is a crisis that must be \nresponded to.\n  Simply because it mainly affects women and children right now--and we \nhave no idea what other effects it will have--is no reason to shirk our \nduties in the Congress and not fund this. Our foremost duty is to \nprotect the health and safety of Americans. Zika is a rapidly evolving \ndisease with severe public health implications. I ask my colleagues to \nsupport this effort. We cannot afford to delay action.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise to take the floor as the vice \nchair of the Appropriations Committee and urge that we adopt an urgent \nsupplemental request to deal with the Zika threat.\n  This is real. It has been 2 months since the administration sent to \nCongress an emergency supplemental. We can't wait any longer. The \nmosquitoes are here. They are actually here. They are here in the \nUnited States of America.\n  I have said--first with wit and now with deep concern--that you can't \nbuild a wall to keep the mosquitoes out. The mosquitoes aren't going to \npay for this. We need to act, and we need to act now.\n  This is a compelling public health crisis, and we can do something \nabout it. We take an oath to defend all Americans against enemies \nforeign and domestic. This is about to be a self-inflicted wound on our \nown people because of our failure to act.\n  With no reliable, tested public health interventions on mosquito \ncontrol--we have to take action to do this. Why? Because as of April \n20, there have been close to 900 cases confirmed in the United States \nof America. We already know they are in three States. The CDC knows it \nis going to come to at least 30 States in our own country, and it will \nhave incredible consequences, particularly to women.\n  Over the years, I have heard many eloquent, poignant, and even \nwrenching speeches about protecting the unborn. They have been deeply \nmoving. We have always tried to find common ground on this. But if you \nare really for defending the unborn, you have to pass this \nsupplemental.\n  There are women all over the United States--particularly in these \nthree vulnerable States--there are women in Puerto Rico who are \nwondering, if they are already pregnant, what their situation is. There \nare young women and not-so-young women who are concerned about getting \npregnant and at the same time being bitten by a mosquito, and there are \nsparse resources to do mosquito control.\n  We want to build fences to keep out illegal aliens. OK. We want to \nbomb the hell out of ISIS and terrorists. We should because we are \nworried that they are coming at us. But in many of those instances, \nthose are problems that have been difficult to solve. This is not \ndifficult to solve; this is about mosquito control.\n  I am very concerned that we are just sitting around and that when all \nis said and done, more is getting said than gets done. We are talking \nabout an emergency supplemental.\n  The Appropriations Committee has a very clear set of criteria for \nwhat is an emergency. First, it has to be urgent. Well, the mosquito \nseason is here. It has to be unforeseen. This was unforeseen and it is \ntemporary. It is mosquito season. It is a confined season. We can do \nsomething about it, and we must do something about it. It will have a \ndisproportionate impact on pregnant women and the unborn. There will be \nchildren born with the most horrendous, heartbreaking birth defects.\n  I am of the generation that was the polio generation. My mother \nwouldn't let my sisters and me go swimming until after June 20 because, \nsomehow or another, in our faith, it was St. John's Day and we thought \nthe water would be warmer. Maybe the saint blessed the water. God bless \nthe saints. God bless people like Dr. Salk, and God bless America that \nfunded the Salk vaccine. I remember children in iron lungs to be kept \nalive, children in braces who then walked with very difficult canes. \nThose who survive bear this the rest of their lives.\n  Look at what we are facing here, and we know it. This is not unknown, \nnor is it unmanageable. It will be a national disgrace if we don't act.\n  In my own home State, I have a Republican Governor, Governor Larry \nHogan. Guess what. Governor Hogan is acting. This isn't about Democrats \nand Republicans. Governor Hogan acted. He declared April 24 to 30 Zika \nAwareness Week. He ordered his health department to coordinate \neducational events with local health departments. They also spent \n$130,000 of State money to develop 10,000 transmission kits to begin to \ndeal with this. My Republican Governor has taken action.\n  Also, in Anne Arundel County--the county that is the home of the \nState capital, again headed up by a Republican county executive--they \nreceived 850 kits. They are going to have townhall meetings to talk \nwith the agricultural officials about prevention and mosquito control. \nWe have a Republican Governor and a Republican county executive who are \nacting.\n  Then there is Howard County, where the health department is planning \nto distribute 450 kits to obstetric and gynecological practices to \nprotect pregnant women. Again, a Republican county executive working \nwith his administration is taking action, spending local money when \nthis is a national problem.\n  I am saying this because my own Governor and the county executives \nare acting.\n  In Baltimore City, which has a Democratic mayor--she listened to the \nwarnings coming from the World Health Organization, the CDC, and the \nBloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore and is taking action. \nBaltimore is now spraying, taking mosquito control action, and so on. \nThey are spending over $500,000 of local money, of which we don't have \na lot.\n  So, hello, Maryland is acting. We need to act. And I say this because \nwe are spending local money to deal with a national and international \nproblem. So please, let's now--whatever differences we have on other \nbills, please let's take up this urgent supplemental.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, as I see the majority leader is \nhere.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 1:45 \np.m. today, the Senate agree to the motion to proceed to the motion to \nreconsider the cloture vote on amendment No. 3801, the motion to \nreconsider the cloture vote on amendment No. 3801, and the Senate then \nvote on the motion to invoke cloture on the Alexander substitute \namendment No. 3801, upon reconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                               Zika Virus\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I have two topics I want to talk about \ntoday--actually, three--but I want to begin with the Zika virus.\n  A few weeks ago I went back to Florida on a Friday and I sat down and \nmet with officials from the Department of Health from Florida. I met \nwith leaders from Puerto Rico in the health sector. I met with doctors \nwho live in Miami-Dade County and also officials in Miami-Dade County. \nThey are freaked out about the Zika thing. I don't know any other term \nto use. If they are freaked out, then I am very concerned about it as \nwell. That is why I do support fully and immediately funding this \nsituation, and I have asked our colleagues to do so as quickly as \npossible.\n  I want to speak briefly about the Florida experience with this. There \nare two things that are deeply concerning,\n\n[[Page S2519]]\n\nand then I will speak to some of the things we should be doing.\n  First, the summer months are upon us. Anyone who has been in Florida, \nin the summer particularly, knows summer has basically already started \nin Florida if you go outside. The spread of mosquitoes as a threat \nvirtually everywhere in the State is just massive. It is just a way of \nlife. This very deadly disease is something we are still learning \nabout, by the way. A few weeks ago, they said: Well, Zika impacts only \na small population of people--a very significant population of people. \nWe are learning this disease impacts whoever it touches. First of all, \nyou don't have to be symptomatic to spread it. In Florida alone, we \nhave had at least two cases of transmission sexually transmitted.\n  By the way, it is just a matter of time before someone in Florida \ngets bit by a mosquito. I am telling you, it is just a matter of days, \nweeks, hours before you will open up a newspaper or turn on the news \nand it will say that someone in the continental United States was \nbitten by a mosquito and they contracted Zika. When that happens, then \neveryone is going to be freaked out, not just me and not just the \npeople who work for the health department in Florida. This is going to \nhappen. There are just way too many mosquitoes to avoid it.\n  The second thing is that Miami-Dade County, in particular, but a lot \nof Florida, is a transit point for all of Latin America. So, for \nexample, one of the places most impacted by Zika is Brazil. Well, this \nsummer the Olympics are being held in Brazil, and there will be \nhundreds of thousands of people who cross through Florida to get to \nBrazil and back, on top of the normal number of travelers. It is just a \nmatter of time. It is not a question of if, it is a question of when.\n  So I look at this from a Senate perspective and say: We are going to \nfund this. We are going to spend money on Zika in Washington, DC, No. \n1, because we should. It is the obligation of the Federal Government to \nkeep our people safe, and this is an imminent and real threat to the \npublic safety and security of our Nation and our people. So the money \nis going to be spent. The question is: Do we do it now, before this has \nbecome a crisis or do we wait for it to become a crisis? Maybe that \ncrisis happens in August, when everyone is back home doing their \ncampaign stuff or maybe it happens on Monday, when everyone is back \nhome doing whatever they do on recess. Then everyone will get pulled \nback to deal with this immediately, and I want to know what Members \nwill say to those who say: Hey, this Zika thing has been in the news \nfor months. Now there is a case.\n  It can be in any State in the country--any State in the country. You \nmay hear: Oh, it is only in certain States that are warm. That is not \ntrue. It can be in any State in the country. I want to know what people \nare going to say when they are asked: What did you do about it? Are you \ngoing to say: Well, I had real problems. I wanted to make sure about \nthis and that.\n  This is a serious thing. People's lives are at stake here. And by the \nway, this is now spreading into all sorts of other threats. Guillain-\nBarre was mentioned earlier. We know about the birth defects that are \nvery significant. Do my colleagues realize what the cost will be of \ndealing with all of that? Are people aware of what Guillain-Barre is? \nIt is a debilitating, often fatal, disease. The cost of treating \nsomeone that has it is extraordinary.\n  What about where the money is going to be spent? Look, it is possible \nat the end of the day that $1.9 billion will not even be enough. We \ndon't know. But we have to start.\n  No. 1, we don't have a commercially available plan to test for Zika. \nYou can't just go to Quest Diagnostics and get a Zika test. It doesn't \nexist. In Florida, if you want to get a Zika test, you have to go \nthrough the State department of health.\n  No. 2, a lot of people aren't being tested because they are not a \npregnant woman so they do not think they have to be tested. False. If \nyou have traveled anywhere at this point--I don't care who you are, how \nold you are, male or female--where there are mosquitoes in significant \namounts, you probably should be tested. If you have traveled abroad \ninto these danger zones, you can transmit this disease. You can be \ncarrying it and not see manifestations of it for a while.\n  There is no commercially available plan. They talk about mosquito \ncontrol. They have only been trying that for thousands of years, and \nmosquitoes have outlasted everything. It is important. It has to be a \npart of it. But one of the two mosquito species that spreads Zika is \nresistant to pesticides. It has become resistant to the pesticide, and \nthat is why new technologies need to be developed.\n  There are some innovative ways out there to cut down on the mosquito \npopulation. There is an innovative program now, trying to start a pilot \nprogram in the Keys. That should be a part of this conversation. \nResearchers are pretty confident they can find a vaccine for this kind \nof disease, given its pathology. Maybe not next week, but they can find \na vaccine for it. The government has a role to play in basic research \nthat allows the private sector to commercialize that and make that \npossible.\n  I understand we want accountability for how this money will be spent. \nI believe that. I do. I think the administration should come forward \nand say: Here is our plan. Here is where every penny is going to be \nspent, and here is how we are going to spend it. We should hold them \naccountable, and if there are ways to improve on that, we should. But I \nthink there should be a sense of urgency when dealing with this issue.\n  I honestly believe--I don't believe; I know--it is just a matter of \ntime before there is a mosquito-borne transmission. By the way, does it \nreally matter how you got it, whether it was from a mosquito or it was \nsexually transmitted? You have Zika. It acts the very same way once you \nhave it. It is just a matter of time before there is a mosquito-borne \ntransmission in the continental United States.\n  I also have heard--not that anyone here has said it--but I have heard \nothers say there are no cases of Zika transmitted from a mosquito yet \nin the United States. That is false. Puerto Rico is in the United \nStates. Puerto Ricans are American citizens. By the way, they travel in \nhuge numbers to and from the United States. Many are moving here. Many \nwork here during the week and travel back on the weekends. This is a \ncatastrophe right now in Puerto Rico, which is a United States \nterritory, and its people are American citizens. They are facing a \ncatastrophe right now on this issue.\n  So I hope there is real urgency about dealing with this. I understand \nthis is not a political issue. There is no such thing as a Republican \nposition on Zika or a Democrat position on this issue because these \nmosquitoes bite everyone. They are not going to ask you what your party \naffiliation is or who you plan to vote for in November. This is a real \nthreat, and it is not just in the tropical States. They may feel it \nfirst, but so can any State that has any significant travel, which is \nbasically all 50 States in the Union. In a country where people travel \nextensively across the country and around the world, we are going to \nface a Zika problem in this country this summer and fall.\n  My advice to my colleagues is that we are going to deal with this, so \nI hope we deal with it at the front end. Not only is that better for \nour people, but that will be better for my colleagues. Otherwise, we \nwill have to explain why it is that we sat around for weeks and did \nnothing on something of this magnitude.\n  The second topic I want to--\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, will the Senator yield for just one \nmoment before he goes into his second topic?\n  Mr. RUBIO. I will yield to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I just want to thank the Senator from \nFlorida for joining the women of the Senate here today to bring \nattention to such a critical issue and to extend our hands. We want to \nwork with the Senator. We believe this is an emergency, and we want to \ndeal with it quickly. We appreciate his comments and his support this \nmorning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I appreciate the advocacy of the Senator \nfrom Washington, and I do look forward to working with the Senator on \nthis as well. Hopefully, we can get a result on this.\n\n[[Page S2520]]\n\n  There is going to be a recess now, and that means for 10 days people \nwill be going back to their home States. So I hope when we come back a \nweek from Monday, we will hear that we have a plan that we are going to \nbe able to vote on and vote on it quickly.\n\n\n           Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and FDA Advisory Panel\n\n  Madam President, on a separate topic, I want to call attention to a \nremarkable group of advocates who are bound together, not by a common \nrace or religion or political ideology but by the common hope of one \nday ridding the world of a rare disease named Duchenne muscular \ndystrophy.\n  Duchenne is one of multiple different forms of muscular dystrophy. It \naffects mostly boys, almost exclusively, at the rate of 1 per 3,600 \nindividuals. Its primary symptom is the steady deterioration of muscle \nmass beginning early in childhood. By the age of 12, most boys with \nDuchenne have lost the ability to walk and eventually become paralyzed \nfrom the neck down. I am sad to say there is currently no cure for \nDuchenne, and the average life expectancy is around 25 years.\n  I am personally the parent of four children, including two boys, and \nI can only imagine--perhaps I can't imagine; that is how difficult it \nis--what it must be like to have a child receive this diagnosis. Few \nare called to do more for their child and to show greater courage in \nthe face of the adversity that MD poses than a parent helping their \nchild battle Duchenne.\n  I was recently inspired and humbled a few weeks ago to meet a young \nman struggling against this disease. His name is Austin, and his dad \nJoe is a hero in more ways than one. Joe helps Austin combat Duchenne, \nand he does it alone, as a single father. By the way, he also serves as \nan Active-Duty member of the United States Air Force.\n  Austin is 12 years old, and I was immediately impressed when I met \nhim. I knew how difficult it must have been for him to travel all the \nway to Washington from his home in Tampa. This is the embodiment of \ncourage that people living with this disease show every day.\n  Joe shared with me a few of the struggles they face. He told me how \nAustin is unable to attend school full time because he needs hours of \ndaily physical therapy to stimulate his muscles. He told me how Austin \nis quickly losing the ability to walk and how he now needs help getting \nin and out of his wheelchair and other daily tasks. He needs help with \neating.\n  Joe told me he spends hundreds of dollars each month on over-the-\ncounter drugs that are not covered by insurance, and he spends hours \nevery Friday attending doctors' appointments.\n  Joe shared the dreams he once had when Austin was born--dreams of \nbeing that proud father in the bleachers at little league games or \ncheering loudly and waving a big foam finger. With Duchenne, he tells \nme he has even more reasons to proudly cheer Austin on, though the \nreasons are different. He cheers when Austin is able to get out of bed \nwithout help or to walk to the restroom. These are moments of great \npride for Joe, when he sees how resilient Austin is in the face of this \ndisease.\n  Joe and Austin traveled to Washington as part of a coordinated effort \nto witness and participate in FDA action related to Duchenne. As \nadvancements in medical science continue, targeted therapies to treat \nDuchenne are being developed and tested, and each one--even the ones \nthat fail--is providing us greater insight into the way the disease \noperates and how it might ultimately be defeated.\n  The last couple of weeks in particular have brought about a display \nof extraordinary strength from Joe and Austin, and thousands of other \nparents, children, family, and friends who engage in activism on behalf \nof those with Duchenne. This Monday, scores of advocates from around \nthe country attended a hearing of the FDA advisory committee, which \nwelcomed them and spent almost an entire day listening to their \ntestimony. What this committee was listening to was the result of a \nclinical study on a small group. Admittedly, this is a small group of \npeople who have this disease, so any clinical trial will have a small \nnumber of people. It is not the same as you would have for another more \ncommon disease. So this FDA advisory panel was meeting to decide \nwhether they were going to allow this testing to expand and this drug \nto be more available.\n  The panel should have reviewed this in the context of a law that was \npassed in 2012 called the Food and Drug Administration Safety and \nInnovation Act; call it FDASIA for short. This act gave the FDA the \nauthority to consider the perspectives of patients when evaluating \nwhether to approve a drug. In essence, it gave the FDA the authority to \nlisten to people who are taking the drug and decide whether it works or \nnot--not just to look at the clinical study.\n  This also provides real flexibility when evaluating drugs for life-\nthreatening illnesses, such as Duchenne. It included multiple \nprovisions to address the challenges of the rare disease patient \ncommunity, which is by definition small--meaning clinical trials have a \nmore difficult time finding enough participants to meet the FDA's usual \nrequirements. Usually, when it is a drug for cancer or something like \nthat, you have tens of thousands of people you can do a trial for. When \nit is a rare disease, you have a harder time finding enough people to \ntest it on the way you would for a normal drug. And on top of that--on \ntop of the perspective of a lesser number of people--it is also a \ndisease that is fatal. In the end, all of these cases with Duchenne end \nthe same way, with death, in a very predictable pattern.\n  They had a chance to meet this week and review this in the committee. \nIn the words of someone who was there, who has a lot of experience in \ninteracting with government agencies and bureaucracies, the word they \nused was ``jarring.'' They said it was jarring. This is from someone \nwho has a lot of experience interacting with government agencies and \nbureaucracies. They said it was jarring how it went.\n\n  I want to paint the picture of what that place looked like on Monday. \nThere was an entire community of parents whose kids have Duchenne, who \nare taking this experimental drug, who are seeing their kids improve. \nThey are seeing it. They know these kids better than any scientist, any \ndoctor, or any panelist at the FDA, and they see these kids are doing \nbetter. They see this. They are begging the FDA panel: Please allow us \nto continue to give these kids medicine. And, by the way, make it \navailable to other kids because, No. 1, there has not been a single \ndocumented case of harm; no one using this experimental medicine has \nbeen harmed by it. No. 2, we, the parents, are telling you it works \nbecause we see it in our kids. And, No. 3, if you take it away, we are \ndesperate; there is nothing left. They are going to die. It is very \npredictable.\n  The committee ignored them. The committee ruled against them, and it \ndid so because they basically applied the same standard to this drug as \nthey did to a normal one: Oh, you didn't have enough people in the \nclinical trial. No, there aren't enough people to do a clinical trial \nwith. It is a rare disease. The result is they had this ruling, and I \nthink the vote was 7 to 3.\n  What is interesting is that one of the board members was quoted as \nsaying: Based on all I heard, the drug definitely works, but the \nquestion was framed differently. What that means is the way the FDA \nposed the question to this committee was not just whether the drug \nworked, but the question was the process: Did this clinical trial have \nenough people? Was it conducted the normal way--the way other drug \ntests are conducted? Of course not, because it is not treating a normal \ncondition. It is one with a very small population.\n  The committee spent almost the entire time focused on how the \nclinical study was designed and not on whether it works. By the way, \nhad the FDA followed FDASIA, the law passed a few years ago, and taken \nthat into account--the small patient population and likewise--they \nmight have reached a different result. Instead, what is happening now \nis these patients and families are on the verge of losing not just \naccess to the drug but to other families as well.\n  Put yourself in the position of one of these patients. Your son has \nDuchenne, your son is taking this experimental drug, and you see how he \nis improving--because you do not improve with Duchenne. It is not one \nof these things where you get better, worse, better, worse. You get \nworse and then worse and then worse. It is a steady, predictable \ndecline. So imagine your child is\n\n[[Page S2521]]\n\none of those impacted by this disease. You know what the outcome is. It \nis a predictable, guaranteed outcome. They are taking an experimental \ndrug, and you know it is working because they are not declining. In \nfact, in many cases they are improving. You are begging the FDA: \nPlease, allow us to continue to give our children this drug. They say: \nNo, we reject it because the clinical trial was not conducted the way \nit is for normal drugs. Then you would understand the desperation of \nthese parents.\n  There is one last chance. The senior leadership of the FDA has the \nability to override this decision and allow this to move forward. I \npersonally hope that is what they will do. In the end, the only thing \nto lose here is to do nothing.\n  The sad story here would be for these parents, who are already seeing \nthe benefits, to lose access to this drug that they know is having an \nimpact on their children. No one has been able to prove there is any \nthreat that this drug poses to these children. This has been \ndocumented. CBS has done a report. Other entities have reported on it.\n  FDA senior leadership has the chance to overrule this committee, \nwhich didn't knock it down for purposes of safety or anything of that \nnature. They just said the clinical trials didn't meet their standard--\nand say these kids are going to die anyway if we don't do something.\n  Here is a drug that is showing improvement, and families who are \nusing it are begging them to allow them to use it. Thousands of people \ndo not fly in from around the country or watch online for something \nthat isn't working. If this weren't working, these parents would not be \nso adamant about it. They see it is working. They know people it is \nworking for. They are desperate to keep it or to reach it. Listen to \nthem. They know what they are talking about. They know. They are the \nprimary caregivers for their children, and they know improvement when \nthey see it.\n  I hope the FDA will consider moving in a different direction. These \nparents deserve better.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Tillis pertaining to the introduction of S. 2885 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. TILLIS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                       Pension Accountability Act\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I rise today to talk about an issue \nthat affects not only retirees in Ohio, but retirees all around the \ncountry.\n  Let me start by saying that if hundreds of thousands of retirees were \ngetting the Social Security benefits they had worked for cut by as much \nas 70 percent, there would be a national uproar. People would consider \nit totally unacceptable. It would be the top news story every night. \nPeople would say: These retirees played by the rules; they did \neverything right. Yet they are seeing these big cuts. How could this \nhappen?\n  Yet that is exactly what is happening to about 400,000 members of the \nCentral States Pension Fund who are facing cuts of up to 70 percent as \nsoon as July 1 of this year. Again, these are people who worked hard \nall their lives, put money into the pension system assuming it would be \nthere, made their financial plans based on that, and now they are \nsuddenly finding massive cuts--some 20 percent, some 40 percent, some \nas high as 70 percent. It is time for the Senate to address this \npotential crisis and to come up with a fair solution.\n  The Central States Pension Fund consists mostly of union truck \ndrivers. They have seen its pension fund severely decline. That is why \nwe are in this situation. The pension suffered big investment declines \nduring the great recession, as did other pension funds. One difference \nis that they missed the market rebound because they had a large \npopulation of new retirees, and they had to withdraw large sums from \ntheir pension for those payouts.\n  One of the largest pension funds in America is in trouble. It is \nprojected to go bankrupt in about a decade. That bankruptcy could be so \nlarge that it would have a very negative impact on the larger Pension \nBenefit Guaranty Corporation that insures the fund. We don't want that \nto happen because that could, of course, leave hundreds of thousands of \nretirees with severely reduced or no pensions.\n  Something has to be done. Math is math. I understand that and, by the \nway, Central States retirees understand that. They know there is a \nproblem. But the way Congress and the President have dealt with this is \ntotally unacceptable. The House of Representatives worked on a \nproposal. It was crafted in the House, not in the Senate. It allowed \nthe pension to possibly avert bankruptcy--and I say ``possibly'' \nbecause, as I will talk about later, even this proposal doesn't mean \nthey are going to avert bankruptcy. But they did so by cutting the \nbenefits of current retirees substantially, severely in some cases, \nagain by as much as 70 percent.\n  They then took this proposal called the Multiemployer Pension Reform \nAct, or MPRA, and buried it inside a $1 trillion spending bill, which, \nfrankly, nobody read. It was one of those last-minute bills, an end-of-\nthe-year omnibus spending package, as they call it, and they sent it to \nthe U.S. Senate. Members of the Senate were told: This is an up-or-down \nvote. There were no hearings in the Senate. There was no transparent \nprocess.\n  I remember when this happened about a year and a half ago, we were \ntold that if the Senate didn't quickly pass these unprecedented \nreforms, with no hearings and no opportunities for amendments on the \nfloor of the Senate, the spending bill would fail.\n  This is Washington at its worst: Bury something in a spending bill \nthat has nothing to do with a spending bill--in this case, a pension \ncut--and then basically try to blackmail lawmakers to vote for it, \nsaying: If you don't vote for this, the whole bill goes down.\n  I voted against it, as did other Members here in the Senate, but it \npassed. Of course, President Obama quickly signed it into law. \nSuddenly, these retirees were sent notices saying they have this big \ncut in their pension.\n  I agree that the status quo is not acceptable. I think over time it \nwould lead to pension bankruptcy, and something has to be done. \nDifficult decisions are necessary. But the MPRA was an unfair remedy \nbecause it did not go through a fair and open and transparent process. \nAlso, it didn't give the workers or retirees a sufficient voice in \ntheir own futures. They did not have a voice in crafting the reforms \nbecause of the way it was structured.\n  We probably have 47,000, 48,000 Ohioans affected by this. After \nmonths of meetings with Ohio workers, retirees, and stakeholders, \nincluding the administration, I introduced what is called the Pension \nAccountability Act. Basically, it gives workers and retirees a voice in \nthis process. Right now, MPRA does allow there to be a vote by workers \nand retirees, but for these large plans, the vote is nonbinding. So \nthere is a vote, but it doesn't count. Even if the participants vote \n100 percent against the reforms, it wouldn't stop the cuts from going \nforward. That is crazy. That is certainly not democratic.\n  Additionally, the vote is designed unfairly. Here is how it works: If \na retiree or a worker chooses not to take out a ballot and vote, it is \nautomatically counted as a ``yes'' vote for the plan. Imagine how that \nwould work in U.S. Presidential elections or other democratic \nprocesses. But that is not how this works. If you submit a ballot, it \nshould be counted. If you don't submit a ballot, it shouldn't be \ncounted.\n  So the Pension Accountability Act fixes these two problems: First, it \nmakes the retiree and the worker vote binding. This will give workers \nand retirees a seat at the table, and a majority vote would be required \nfor any pension cuts to go forward. Second, it makes the vote fair by \ncounting the ballots as they should be counted, not returning the \nballots as an automatic ``yes'' vote.\n  These commonsense reforms give the workers and the retirees more \nleverage. It gives them a fair say in the process because their vote is \ngoing to be heeded to implement changes. They are going to have a seat \nat the table to find the right balance.\n  Again, we know these pensions are in trouble, and some changes are \nnecessary to prevent bankruptcy, which could leave some families with \nnothing. So let the process play out. If the\n\n[[Page S2522]]\n\nbusinesses, unions, workers, and retirees can craft a solution to win a \nmajority vote, more power to them. But let's give everyone a seat at \nthe table, and let these retirees have a vote.\n  The goal should not be to stop all pension reforms. If Central States \ncontinues on its road to bankruptcy, then, everybody loses. But the \ngoal should be to give those affected a say in how these reforms are \ndesigned. It brings accountability. It opens the lines of communication \non both sides of the bargaining table to come up with a fair solution.\n  There are some other proposals. I think the Pension Accountability \nAct has a much more realistic chance of enactment because I do not \nbelieve a massive tax increase is viable. It is the only reform \nproposal with bipartisan support. In fact, between my bill and the \nHouse companion legislation, we have nine Democrats and nine \nRepublicans.\n  In the meantime, for the reasons I have discussed, the Department of \nthe Treasury should not accept Central States' application. They should \nreject this proposal to cut benefits up to 70 percent for some of the \nretirees, as we have talked about. By the way, even if all the \napplication's positive market assumptions play out, there is still a \n50-percent chance the pension goes bankrupt anyway. This doesn't \nexactly inspire confidence in this plan. I think they should go back to \nthe drawing board.\n  By the way, I am openminded to other solutions that would provide \nfunding from inside the multiemployer pension system. There are \ndifferent ideas out there, and we should talk about them.\n  Let me finish with a story about a guy I got to know through this \nprocess. His name was Butch Lewis, from Westchester, OH. Butch was a \nstar baseball player in high school. He was drafted out of high school \nby the Pittsburgh Pirates. But instead of going on to a career in \nbaseball, he heard the call of duty and he volunteered to join the U.S. \nArmy and to serve in Vietnam. He became an Army Ranger. He was \nseriously injured while rescuing fellow soldiers. He was sent home with \na Bronze Star and a Purple Heart.\n  When he came home, Butch reunited with his high school sweetheart \nRita. He started a family, and he started working, despite his \ninjuries. He spent 40 years as a truckdriver. The lack of shock \nabsorbers in those old trucks hurt his knees a lot. His knees had been \ninjured in Vietnam in battle. Ultimately, it required 37 surgeries. But \nhe kept working and never complained. He sacrificed for his family and \nfor their pension--to the point of foregoing pay raises, vacations, and \nother benefits in order to guarantee that he had a sufficient pension \nfor retirement. They planned on it, like you would or anybody would.\n  Finally retired, a year ago Butch was surprised when he received a \nletter in the mail saying his pension would be cut by 40 percent--the \npension that he was depending on. So after all those years of work and \nsacrifice, his pension would be deeply slashed. Butch felt betrayed, \nand I think that is understandable. He organized with his fellow \nretirees an effort to try to defend those pensions, and that is how I \ncame to know him. He came to Washington, DC, to meet with me here. I \nalso met with him in Ohio. I listened to his story. I listened to his \nwife Rita, who is very articulate, and we addressed different ways to \ntry to save his pension. He is one of the reasons we came up with this \nlegislation.\n  This past New Year's Eve, feeling the stress, Butch became ill, and \nhe died of a massive heart take. He was 64 years old. His wife Rita is \nleft to pick up the pieces. She has now lost her husband. Her own dad \nis battling Stage IV cancer. She is looking at a 40-percent cut to her \nsurvivor's benefit. She is preparing to sell the house that she and her \nhusband Butch saved a lifetime for. She is wondering what her future is \ngoing to be. She is a very strong woman. She worked tirelessly to save \nfor these pensions. Now she is fighting to make sure all the hard work \nher husband put in was not in vain.\n  This is who we are fighting for. Think about Butch Lewis when we \nthink about what we should do. Think about Rita and 400,000 other \nmembers of the Central States Pension Fund. These are people who played \nby the rules. They worked hard, and yet, in their retirement years, \nthey face possible financial ruin through no fault of their own.\n  This is why we need to pass the Pension Accountability Act. We have \nattempted to offer it as amendments in previous legislation here over \nthe last couple of months. We are going to continue to do that. We are \nnot going to give up. I would hope the Senate and the House would see \nthat by giving people a voice, it gives them leverage, and we can come \nup with a better and a more fair solution for everybody.\n  I yield back my time.\n  I yield to the Senator from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n\n                 Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act\n\n  Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, April is Genocide Awareness and Prevention \nMonth. As we remember all those who have lost their lives in the wave \nof terrorist violence sweeping the world, I call on my Senate \ncolleagues to join the effort to make real the words ``never again'' by \ncosponsoring S. 2551, the Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act.\n  Islamic extremists are waging religious war so severe that the Pope \nof the Catholic Church and the Patriarch of the Greek Orthodox Church \ncame together, stating:\n\n       Whole families, villages and cities of our brothers and \n     sisters in Christ are being completely exterminated. Their \n     churches are being barbarously ravaged and looted, their \n     sacred objects profaned, their monuments destroyed. It is \n     with pain that we call to mind the situation in Syria, Iraq \n     and other countries of the Middle East, and the massive \n     exodus of Christians from the land in which our faith was \n     first disseminated and in which they have lived together with \n     other religious communities since the time of the Apostles. \n     We call upon the international community to act urgently in \n     order to prevent the further expulsion of Christians from the \n     Middle East. In raising our voice in defense of persecuted \n     Christians, we wish to express our compassion for the \n     suffering experienced by the faithful of other religious \n     traditions who have also become victims of civil war, chaos, \n     and terrorist violence.\n\n  On February 4, a nearly unanimous European Parliament passed a \nresolution declaring that ISIS ``is committing genocide against \nChristians and other religious and ethnic minorities.'' Sadly, the \nUnited States, in keeping with the President's desire to lead from \nbehind, only recently decided to call it genocide in the face of the \nreligious cleansing taking place in the heart of the Middle East. ISIS \nvows that they will break our crosses and enslave our women--they are \nspeaking of Christians--and they will place a black flag at the top of \nSt. Peter's Basilica. At the other end of the Middle East, we have \nIran. Iran is launching test missiles with the words ``Death to \nIsrael'' on the tips of the ballistic missiles, in Hebrew.\n  We would do well to remember the words of an Israeli Prime Minister \nwho said: ``When someone tells you he wants to kill you, believe him.'' \nIf you think it is a problem that is over there, think again. Terrorism \nreaches our shores. It has devastated some of the great cities of the \nworld like London, Paris, Brussels, Madrid, and Bali. As a result of \nconflict, there are now a record 60 million displaced persons--men, \nwomen, and children. That is more than at the height of the \ndisplacement of World War II.\n  Responding to the dire needs of those fleeing violence has driven a \n600-percent increase in global humanitarian aid over the past 10 years, \nfrom $3.5 billion in 2004 to $20 billion in 2015. I have actually seen \nthe human cost in refugee camps along the Turkish-Syrian border. I was \nthere a couple of weeks ago, less than 30 miles away from the Syrian \nborder in Turkey. These were Muslims fleeing ISIS and a bloodthirsty \ndictator who unleashed chemical weapons on his own citizens.\n  In the 1980s, then-Ambassador to the United Nations Jeanne \nKirkpatrick took up the cause of preventing genocide. With the memory \nof Chairman Mao's killing of 100 million still fresh in her mind, her \nattention was turned to Africa, where she saw the first stirrings of \nthe genocide on the continent, and then to Cambodia, where Pol Pot \nmurdered over one-third of his nation. She urged President Reagan to \nsign the convention on genocide, and President Reagan did just that.\n  President Reagan said:\n\n\n[[Page S2523]]\n\n\n  \n\n       We gather today to bear witness to the past and learn from \n     its awful example, and to make sure that we're not condemned \n     to relive its crimes. . . . the genocide convention [is a] \n     howl of anguish and an effort to prevent and punish future \n     acts of genocide.\n\n  I believe Congress has an important leadership role to play here. We \ncan help ensure that America has the tools to combat genocide and \natrocities and combat violent conflict. That is why I joined Senator \nCardin in introducing the Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act.\n  As does the Senator from North Carolina, I also have a special reason \nfor supporting this legislation that has the potential to fuse \ndiplomacy, intelligence, and foreign aid, and in turn, prioritize \ngovernment action to prevent future atrocities by working together.\n  It is important to me because my State, as I said earlier today, is \nat the tip of the sphere. When diplomacy fails, it is the 82nd Airborne \nand Special Forces from Fort Bragg or the U.S. Marines from Camp \nLejeune who are going to go resolve the conflict. We want to avoid \nthose conflicts. We owe it to them to do better by putting partisanship \naside and by taking up proactive steps to avoid sending our \nservicemembers into harm's way to confront a conflict that may be able \nto be prevented without firing a single shot.\n  Silence is the greatest enemy of freedom. Silence led to the \ndevastation of Jews in Europe. But from the ashes of the Holocaust came \nthe State of Israel and the vow ``never again.'' The first President \nBush reminded us: ``The words 'never again' do not refer to the past; \nthey refer to the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n             Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon with \ngreat regret, having to raise the issue of the pending nomination of \nthe Secretary of the Army. Mr. Eric Fanning has been nominated to be \nthe Secretary of the Army. We have held hearings in the Armed Services \nCommittee, and his name has been on the calendar for confirmation. My \nfriend from Kansas, who is on the floor with me--and he is my dear \nfriend of many years, despite the branch in which he chose to serve in \nthe military--has been objecting to the confirmation of Mr. Eric \nFanning as the Secretary of the Army, which is his right.\n  Mr. Fanning had a distinguished career. He served as Special \nAssistant to the Secretary of Defense and White House Liaison. He \nserved as Deputy Undersecretary of the Navy and Deputy Chief Management \nOfficer of the Navy. The Senate confirmed him, and he served as Under \nSecretary of the Air Force, including 6 months as Acting Secretary of \nthe Air Force. He served as Chief of Staff to the Secretary of Defense, \nDr. Ash Carter. Later, he served as Acting Under Secretary and Acting \nSecretary of the Army. In 2016, he served as the Special Assistant to \nthe Secretary of Defense.\n  He comes from a military family. He has two uncles who graduated from \nWest Point and were career Army officers. He has another uncle who is a \ncareer Air Force officer. He has a cousin who flew helicopters in the \nMarine Corps and another cousin who was an Army Ranger.\n  He has senior executive leadership experience in all three military \ndepartments and has pursued efficiencies and transformation in every \npart of the Department of Defense. His most recent experience as Acting \nUnder Secretary and Secretary of the Army has given him a solid \nunderstanding of the challenges currently facing the Army and the need \nto sustain a ready Army that will, as he said at his confirmation \nhearing, deter enemies, assure allies, build partner capacity, and be \nready to respond when the Nation calls.\n  One of the obligations--in some respects--that we as Senators have is \nthe role of advice and consent, and that is an important role. As \nSenators, we also understand that elections have consequences, and \ntherefore--although it is not written down anywhere--when a President \nis selected by the American people, then that President should be given \nthe benefit of the doubt as to the person or persons the President \nwants on his or her team. I believe it is then our job to make the \ndecision on whether to confirm or deny confirmation based on our view \nof the qualifications but with the presumption that we would confirm \nsomeone rather than the presumption that we wouldn't confirm someone. \nWhen the American people choose their leader--the President of the \nUnited States--then it seems to me it is our obligation, unless there \nis a reason not to do so, to ensure that the President has a team \naround him he has selected.\n  I am stating the obvious, and Mr. Fanning is clearly qualified. He \nhas performed well in the hearing before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. My friend from Kansas has objected to Mr. Fanning being \nconfirmed by the Senate, and I will let him describe his reasons for \nobjecting to the nomination, but as I understand it, the Senator from \nKansas does not want the detainees from Guantanamo transferred to the \nState of Kansas.\n  I have assured my dear friend from Kansas that the Armed Services \nCommittee will not approve the transfer of detainees to the United \nStates of America unless there is a plan that will assure the American \npeople the circumstances surrounding that transfer, if it should ever \ntake place, will be appropriate. The administration, after 7\\1/2\\ years \nthat I have been dealing with them, has no plan. I can assure the \nSenator from Kansas that the Defense authorization bill, which I assume \nwill be made into law, will again prohibit the transfer of detainees \nfrom Guantanamo to the United States of America until there is a plan \nthat is approved by the Congress of the United States. That is our \nobligation and our role. Now, add to that that Mr. Fanning has no role \nto play. He has no role to play in this decisionmaking as to whether we \ntransfer detainees from Guantanamo to the United States of America.\n  When we consider nominations, we should be considering the role, \nmission, and responsibilities of that nominee, and, frankly, I say to \nmy dear friend from Kansas, he has no role to play in the whole \nscenario I described.\n  I urge my friend, in the strongest possible way I can, to work \ntogether with me, as we have over the last 7\\1/2\\ years on this issue \nof Guantanamo, and give the benefit of the Senator's expertise as we \nbring the Defense authorization bill to the floor during the last week \nin May, which is when it is scheduled, and talk about Guantanamo. I am \ntotally confident and can assure the Senator from Kansas that the \noverwhelming majority of the Armed Services Committee and I am sure a \nmajority in the Senate--I am totally confident that the Defense \nauthorization bill will have a prohibition on the transfer of detainees \nto the United States of America unless there is a plan that is approved \nby the Congress of the United States.\n  Finally, I understand that the Senator from Kansas is very concerned \nabout this issue and has been for a long time. No one understands \nbetter than he. He was a former member of the U.S. Marine Corps and is \naware of the obligations to preserve the safety and security of this \nNation.\n  All I can say is that the U.S. Army needs this man, Mr. Eric \nFanning's leadership. It is not fair to the men and women of the U.S. \nArmy to be without the leadership of a Secretary of the Army. Mr. \nFanning is eminently qualified to assume the role of Secretary of the \nArmy.\n  I urge my friend and colleague to not object to the unanimous consent \nrequest I am about to propound.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session to consider Calendar No. 477, the nomination of Eric \nFanning to be Secretary of the Army; that the nomination be confirmed, \nthe motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; \nthat the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and \nthe Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. I want to \nmake certain that my colleagues understand my position on this matter. \nMy hold on Eric Fanning's nomination is not in relation to his \ncapabilities, expertise, or character, and it is certainly not intended \nto bring undue stress to our U.S. Army. Rather, my hold on the nominee \nis to protect the security of\n\n[[Page S2524]]\n\nthe United States and especially the people of Kansas.\n  I will be more than happy to vote for Mr. Fanning once the White \nHouse addresses my concerns regarding the President's efforts to move \nGuantanamo Bay terrorist detainees to the mainland, with Fort \nLeavenworth, KS, the intellectual center of the Army, very high on the \nlist.\n  I have been clear, honest, and flexible with the White House. I am \nsimply asking that they communicate to me what all those who have \nreviewed Fort Leavenworth already know; that Fort Leavenworth is not a \nsuitable replacement for the detention facilities at Guantanamo Bay. \nThe White House has not reciprocated.\n  I have prepared lengthier remarks on my position in this matter. At \nthis time, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 5 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, the senior Senator from Arizona, our \ndistinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee and my friend, \nhas made a very impassioned plea for me to remove my hold on Eric \nFanning to be Secretary of the U.S. Army. I want to be very clear that \nas a veteran and marine, I support the nominee for this post.\n  Kansas is the proud home to two Army posts, Fort Leavenworth, the \nintellectual center of the Army where the commandant staff school is \nlocated, and Fort Riley, home of the Big Red One--two proud posts with \nvery rich histories.\n  I want the Army to have a highly qualified Secretary just as much as \nthe distinguished Senator from Arizona, but it is due to my deep \nrespect and concern for the men and women in uniform at Fort \nLeavenworth, and those who live and work in the region, that I am \ncompelled to issue my hold on the President's nominee in the first \nplace.\n  As I have publicly stated from the beginning, and personally to Mr. \nFanning, former Army Secretary John McHugh, and Defense Secretary Ash \nCarter, my quarrel is not with the nominee but with the President.\n  President Obama continues to insist that he will close the Guantanamo \nBay detention facility before he leaves office, transferring the \nremaining detainees to the U.S. mainland, with Fort Leavenworth under \nserious consideration. Quite frankly, this is a legacy item for the \nPresident. After much study and review, I can name countless reasons \nwhy this plan is wrong and it is also illegal. The President's own \nCabinet has acknowledged this, and the Secretary of Defense and the \nAttorney General have publicly stated that current law prohibits the \ntransfer of Guantanamo Bay detainees to the mainland. Yet the President \nis undeterred. He continues to insist it will be done, even if he has \nto resort to Executive power in defiance of the law and the will of the \nCongress. As a result, I have been left with very little choice other \nthan to do what I can as an individual Senator to block the transfer of \ndetainees to Fort Leavenworth.\n  I understand and share the concerns of the distinguished Senator, but \nif there is any anger, concerns, or frustrations, it should be directed \nat a White House that intends to ignore laws written and introduced by \nthe Senator from Arizona himself. We should be speaking today, not \nabout my attempts to protect the people of my State and Fort \nLeavenworth, we should be speaking about a White House that ignores the \nNational Defense Authorization Act and every appropriations bill passed \nin this Chamber since 2009. We should be angry at a White House that \nwants to bring this terrorist threat to our shores without so much as \nan intelligence assessment as to the risk and benefits of such an \naction to our citizens at home or to our men and women in uniform. An \nintelligence assessment regarding these concerns does not exist.\n  The administration is responsible for refusing to come forward with a \nreal plan to relocate prisoners, instead of a weak and veiled attempt \nto honor a campaign promise, which is the only way to characterize the \nactions to date.\n  Just days ago, I received the most classified report from the \nDepartment of Defense on moving the detainees from Gitmo. This report--\nfar from clearing up any reports--made it even more apparent to me that \nit is virtually impossible to safely relocate terrorists at Fort \nLeavenworth.\n  The assessment is there. All I am asking is for the White House to \nassure me that Fort Leavenworth is not a viable alternative. Cities and \ntowns across America are holding their collective breath while we await \nthe White House's judgment as to where to house these detainees.\n  For those of us in the crosshairs, we are left with very few options \nto fight a President who is willing to break the law. With this hold, I \nhave used one of the tools--perhaps the only tool other than a \nfilibuster--afforded to me as a U.S. Senator, and I will continue to do \neverything in my power to fulfill the obligations of the security of \nthe United States. It is what Kansans expect and have demanded of me.\n  If the White House calls and assures me that terrorists held at \nGuantanamo will not come to the Fort Leavenworth, I will gradually \nrelease this hold immediately. As a matter of fact, we just had a \nconversation with the White House this morning in the hopes that this \ncould be worked out, but the White House simply would not give me that \nassurance.\n  Make no mistake, I remain adamantly opposed to placing detainees \nanywhere on the mainland. The distinguished Senator from Arizona knows \nthat, and I think he shares those views. However, if the plans and \nstudies from the administration rule out Fort Leavenworth as an option, \nall they have to do is tell me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request by the \nSenator from Arizona?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, Mr. Fanning has nothing to do with the \nissue. We are shooting a hostage that has nothing to do with the \ndecisionmaking process. If we inaugurate a practice here of holding \nnominees over an issue that is not related to those nominees, we are \nabusing our power and authority as U.S. Senators.\n  Secondly, the Senator from Kansas knows he cannot have the President \ncall him. If he did that, he would then have to call 99 other Senators \nwho would then hold up nominees because they have not been assured that \ndetainees will not be relocated to their States according to any plan \nthat the President may come up with.\n  What we are doing is telling a nominee who is totally and eminently \nqualified for the job that that person cannot fulfill those \nresponsibilities and take on that very important leadership post \nbecause of an unrelated issue that has nothing to do with Mr. Fanning. \nThat is not the appropriate use of senatorial privilege. What if we set \nthis precedent and every Senator--100 Senators--adopts the practice of \nsaying: I don't want the President to pursue a certain course of \naction, therefore I will hold his or her nominees hostage until they \ntake a certain course of action. That is not the role of advice and \nconsent. That is a distortion of advice and consent.\n  Let me say, I will be coming back to the floor on Mr. Fanning's \nnomination. It is not fair to him. He is an American citizen. He has \nserved for years in the service of his country, at least since 2009 \nthat I can see. He shouldn't be held hostage to a policy decision \nthat--the full Senate will act to prevent that action.\n\n  I tell my colleague that the full Senate, as we have the last several \nyears, will prohibit the transfer of detainees from Guantanamo Bay \nuntil the President of the United States comes forward with a plan that \nis approved by the Senate. So if a plan came forward that contained \nmovement of the detainees to Fort Leavenworth, as the Senator from \nKansas is worried about, then the Senate would say no. We would say no.\n  So, unfortunately, we have seen the Senator from Kansas take a \nnominee who is fully qualified in every aspect--he passed through the \nSenate Armed Services Committee by voice vote--and hold him hostage to \nan action that the nominee has no ability to take, has no ability to \ndetermine, nor is it in his area of responsibility as Secretary of\n\n[[Page S2525]]\n\nthe Army to determine a policy on Guantanamo.\n  So if we are going to set a precedent here, I say to my friend from \nKansas, that if we don't like a certain policy or anticipated action by \nthe President of the United States in some area, we will therefore hold \nup a nominee for an office which they are not in any way related to--\nthat is not the way the Senate should behave.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Will my friend from Arizona yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Sure. I will be glad to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Well, if this is a bad precedent and all that the \ndistinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee has said it is \nwith regard to my actions, I will remind him that there has been a \nprecedent before this time. The year was 2009, and this issue came up. \nObviously, it was a campaign promise by the President. There was a lot \nof concern, a lot of frustration, a lot of anger. I asked myself at \nthat particular time what on Earth I could do to stop this effort to \nmove detainees to Fort Leavenworth. Again, I would stress that it is \nthe intellectual center of the Army. The commander staff school is \nthere--think Pershing, think Eisenhower, think MacArthur, think \nPetraeus. Bad fit. Sixteen thousand people at Leavenworth have signed a \npetition saying no to the detainees.\n  Back then, in 2009, John McHugh--a wonderful Congressman, a great \nfriend to me, and a great Secretary of the Army--was being nominated. I \ntook the very same action, I would tell the distinguished Senator from \nArizona, and put a hold on John.\n  I called him up. I said: John, I have some bad news and some good \nnews.\n  He said: Well, give me the bad news.\n  I said: Somebody here in the Senate has put a hold on you.\n  He said: Who on Earth would do that?\n  I said: It is me.\n  He was a little stunned--I think a lot--and would probably make the \nsame statement and speech the Senator from Arizona has given.\n  I said: Not to worry. All that has to happen is for the \nadministration to give me assurance--it could be vocal; I don't expect \nhim to write it down--that the detainees will not be moved to Fort \nLeavenworth.\n  John went to work to try to carry that message to the administration. \nI am not saying that Eric Fanning should do that, but John McHugh did. \nAnd it wasn't very long after that that the legal counsel from the \nWhite House--and I won't get into names here--called me and assured me \nthat would be the case. I immediately lifted the hold.\n  So there is a precedent in 2009, and it worked.\n  Again, I really regret--my hold on Eric Fanning's nomination is not \nin relation to his capabilities, his expertise, his character, and \ncertainly not intended to bring undue stress to the U.S. Army. I \nunderstand that. But when we are faced with a situation like this, and \nthe situation could be further explained by a call that I just received \nprior to the distinguished Senator coming to the floor--the White House \nknows this--we had a very frank conversation. The conversation pretty \nwell ended up: I can't give you that assurance, but we won't surprise \nyou; i.e., if we have an Executive order and we are moving detainees \ninto Fort Leavenworth, we will certainly tell you.\n  So I can't release this hold, as I did in 2009. I don't think the \nstatute of limitations is here with regard to the previous assurance I \ngot from the White House. If there is, maybe it is because that is--\nwhen the legal counsel left, all of a sudden we were back to where we \nare.\n  So the ball is in the court of the White House. All they have to do \nis give me another call and indicate that things will be fine. I am not \ntelling them what language to use or anything else.\n  I might add that there are two other Senators who are very concerned \nabout this--Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina and the distinguished \nSenator from Colorado, Cory Gardner.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, just quickly, facts are stubborn things, I \nsay to my friend from Kansas. The reason there hasn't been movement of \nthe detainees is because the action of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee in the authorization bill prohibited such a thing from \nhappening. It has nothing to do with any hold or no hold that the \nSenator from Kansas has. Let's be very clear about that. And whether \nEric Fanning is confirmed or not, it does not change the situation one \niota--not one iota.\n  I have assured the Senator from Kansas that the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee--I know enough about my own committee to know that they will \nbe passing again, as we have for the last several years, a prohibition \non the movement of detainees until there is a plan. And in 2009 or \nwhenever it was, I am sure they had no plan at that time because they \ncame to see me and I told them to come up with a plan.\n  So the Senator's actions have nothing to do with whether or not the \nPresident closes Guantanamo and transfers them, and the Senator's \naction right now has nothing to do with whether or not the President of \nthe United States will decide to close Guantanamo by Executive order \nand move them to Leavenworth. There is nothing he is doing by \nwithholding this nomination that would in any way inhibit the President \nfrom acting. The only thing that will inhibit the President from acting \nis the aye vote of Senator from Kansas on the Defense authorization \nbill which will be on the floor at the end of May and which will have a \nprohibition for the transfer of those detainees.\n  So I would hope my dear friend from Kansas would understand that what \nwe need to do is get a defense authorization to the floor, get it in \nconference with the House, and get it to the President's desk. That is \nthe best way he can keep any movement of detainees to Kansas and to \nFort Leavenworth. And at the same time, the President of the United \nStates, despite your hold on Mr. Fanning, may act by Executive order. \nNothing you are doing by prohibiting Mr. Fanning from being confirmed \nto a post he is well qualified for--to lead the U.S. Army--will have \nany effect whatsoever on an Executive order by the President of the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Will the Senator yield again for one last comment?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, every Senator listening to this--every \nperson listening to this--should understand, with the summation the \nSenator has just given, what an outstanding chairman of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee he has been and what a stalwart he has been \nfor our men and women in uniform. I cannot think of a chairman--and \nthere have been a lot of very great chairmen in the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, but none so well qualified as the Senator from \nArizona. His remarks are right on point with regard to his point of \nview. His remarks sing, if you will, in behalf of our national defense. \nHe is a great friend. He is a personal friend. I respect him more than \nhe knows, and I appreciate him. I think he mentioned Eric Fanning to be \nSecretary of the Navy. That might be an alternative. But at any rate, I \nwant to thank him for his remarks.\n  But if this has no bearing on anything, why did the White House call \nme just before we came down here trying to work it out? And saying that \nin 2009--OK, they did let me know that Fort Leavenworth was not being \nconsidered. As I say again, there is no statute of limitations, I don't \nthink, except just ``Oh well, by the way, we are going to change our \nmind'' and a couple of little campaign assurances by the President \nsaying ``Well, we can always use an Executive order''--not to mention \nhis Press Secretary. So if there is nothing to bear here--this doesn't \nhave any relationship to the issue at hand--why did the White House \ncall and say ``Well, we will make a decision down the road, but we \nwon't surprise you''?\n  I shouldn't even be talking about this with regard to the \ncommunications this morning. So I just disagree with my good friend. I \nthank him for his leadership, and I thank him for his position. Were I \nin his position, I probably would be saying the same thing.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I just say, Mr. President, that I hope my dear friend \nfrom Kansas--we are about to go into a week-long recess--would do as he \nalways does, and that is contemplate and\n\n[[Page S2526]]\n\ncommunicate, as he does with the people of Kansas, who have honored him \nfor so much time here in the Congress of the United States. Maybe \nhopefully we could work this out with the certain knowledge and my \nassurance that I am 100 percent confident that the Senate Armed \nServices Committee will report a bill that will become law that \nprohibits the transfer of the detainees from Guantanamo to anywhere in \nthe United States of America until there is a plan that is approved by \nCongress, and I want to give him that confidence.\n  His passion that he has displayed here is ample evidence for why the \npeople of Kansas hold him with such affection and respect. He is \nfighting for what he believes is in the best interests of the people \nwhom he represents so well and honorably.\n  I hope he will have the opportunity, as we go into recess next week, \nto talk with his constituents and think about this and think about my \nassurance that we will not--we will not--approve of a transfer of \ndetainees from Guantanamo Bay unless it is in compliance with the law \nthat we will pass.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  I know the Senator from Tennessee is waiting.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, within a few minutes we will be voting \non whether to cut off debate on the Energy and Water appropriations \nbill and move to finish the bill. I hope my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle will vote yes.\n  This is a bill the Senator from California and I have worked on \ncarefully with Members on both sides of the aisle. More than 80 \nSenators have made contributions to the bill. We considered 18 \namendments on the floor. This is a bill which is about half national \ndefense and about half essential services. These include dredging \nharbors and building locks and dams. These include our 17 National \nLaboratories and keeping us first in the world in supercomputing. It is \nwithin the Budget Control Act, and it is the part of the budget that is \nflat. In other words, it is a part of the budget that is reasonably \nunder control, not the part that is not.\n  It is also the first time since 2009 that this Energy and Water \nappropriations bill has had the opportunity to go across the floor in \nthe regular order. It is the earliest appropriations bill that has been \nconsidered by the Senate since 1974. Senator McConnell and Senator Reid \npicked this bill because they thought Senator Feinstein and I could \nwork with Members of the Senate to establish a model for how to deal \nwith the remainder of the appropriations process, and we hope that \nproves to be true.\n  We have run into one issue, and that is an amendment by the Senator \nfrom Arkansas regarding Iran. That is a provocative amendment--I \nunderstand that--on both sides of the aisle, and the President cares \nabout it as well. But I have worked hard to get Senators a right to \noffer germane amendments. Some Senators have chosen to withdraw their \namendments in order to keep the bill moving along, but Senator Cotton \nhas a right to offer his amendment on the bill, and I support him in \ndoing that. He has been eminently reasonable. He has offered to modify \nit. He has offered to do it at another time. He has offered to vote it \nat 60 votes or to vote it by voice vote. So far, we have not had any \nagreement.\n  If we do not succeed, I am going to keep working with Senator \nFeinstein, the Democratic and Republican leaders, and with Senator \nCotton in the hopes that when we come back next Monday, we will have a \nsuitable solution and we will vote still again on finishing the Energy \nand Water appropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Over the last year and 5 months the White House has \nthreatened 87 vetoes. That is about one every week and a half. If we \nshut down the Senate and stopped our work every time the President \nthreatened a veto, we would be here about 3 or 4 hours every Monday \nafternoon.\n  When we say to the President: Your budget is dead on arrival, he \nsends us his budget anyway.\n  The way to handle a veto threat is the way we did it with the \nnational defense act, which is to say: All right, Mr. President, if you \nwant to veto it, you may. We sent it to him, and he did. It came back, \nand the offending provision was taken out. A better way to do it might \nbe that the President says: I will veto the education bill. We worked \nwith him, and we sent him a version that he could sign.\n  My plea with my friends on the Democratic side, as well as on the \nRepublican side, is let's not let the White House lead us around by the \nnose and tell us we can't consider a bill just because there is a veto \nthreat. We should consider the bill. We are a coequal branch of \ngovernment. We should do what we think we ought to do--defeat it or \npass it. Then, if the President chooses to veto it, that is his \nconstitutional prerogative, and most of the time, if we know that is \ngoing to happen, the offending provision comes out.\n  I ask for a ``yes'' vote. I hope that it succeeds. If it doesn't, we \nwill be having the same exact vote a week from next Monday when we come \nback, and I will do my best to help that succeed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the motion to \nproceed to the motion to reconsider the cloture vote on amendment No. \n3801 is agreed to and the motion to reconsider is agreed to.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending \ncloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on Senate amendment \n     No. 3801 to Calendar No. 96, H.R. 2028, an act making \n     appropriations for energy and water development and related \n     agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and \n     for other purposes.\n         Mitch McConnell, Lamar Alexander, Jerry Moran, John \n           Boozman, Steve Daines, Richard Burr, Roy Blunt, Orrin \n           G.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there are a lot of divisions on Capitol \nHill, and the press spends a lot of time reporting differences between \nDemocrats and Republicans in the House and the Senate. I think that is \none of the reasons the press conference I just left is noteworthy, \nbecause at this press conference, we had equal numbers of Democratic \nSenators and Republican Senators talking about a bill that we hope to \nmove forward on the floor of the Senate. The bill relates to criminal \njustice reform.\n  I am pleased to cosponsor this legislation with Senator Chuck \nGrassley, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. We \nare proud to have the support as well of Senator Leahy and Senator Mike \nLee of Utah, who was one of the original authors of this bill 3 years \nago when we both introduced it. We also have the support of the \nRepublican whip, John Cornyn of Texas; Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode \nIsland; and many others who have joined this effort.\n  What is it about this bill that could bring people together who are \nso different--liberals, conservatives, Democrats, Republicans? It is a \ncommon belief that we bring to this that at this moment in history, we \nneed to take an honest look at the incarceration policy in America.\n  The United States of America has 5 percent of the world's population \nand 25 percent of the world's prisoners. Over the last 35 years, we \nhave increased the number of Federal prisoners by anywhere from 800 \npercent to 900 percent. We are building Federal prisons as fast as you \ncan imagine, and they are dramatically overcrowded.\n  It raises the obvious question: Are we safer? If we spend $30,000 a \nyear to incarcerate a person, take them off the streets and away from \ntheir family, are we safer because of it? In some cases, we clearly \nare. Our first obligation is public safety. If someone is a \nthreatening, deadly, violent criminal, they ought to be taken off the \nstreets as long as they are a menace or a danger to society. But the \nlargest increase in the Federal prison population during the period I \njust described is for nonviolent offenders, people who have sold drugs \nin America.\n  The problem is made worse because we decided 25 or 30 years ago to \ncreate mandatory minimum sentences. What it meant was that when the \njudge sentenced someone, there was an absolute floor they couldn't go \nbelow regardless of the circumstances. Needless to say, that resulted \nin the miscarriage of justice in many cases.\n  Sadly, it isn't just a matter of longer sentences. We have seen some \ndisparities and injustice that we have to be very honest about, as \npainful as it is to describe them. For instance, the majority of \nillegal drug users and drug dealers in America are White. Three-\nquarters of all the people incarcerated for drug offenses are African \nAmerican and Latino, and the large majority of those who are being \nsentenced under mandatory minimum sentences are African American and \nLatino.\n  Let's be very honest about this. In my State of Illinois, I have to \nbe because in the city of Chicago and other communities, we are going \nthrough a very candid and painful discussion about the issues of race \nand justice. We have to be honest. We are incarcerating minorities in \nthis country at dramatically higher percentages than we should. The \nreason I say that goes back to the original point: The majority of \nillegal drug users and sellers in America are White; three-quarters of \nthose in prison are not.\n  As a result of mandatory minimums, the families of nonviolent \noffenders are separated for years on end, and a disproportionate number \nof them are people of color. This is destroying communities, damaging \nand destroying families, and, sadly, eroding faith in our criminal \njustice system.\n  In 2010 I worked with Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama. He is a very \nconservative Republican but one of my colleagues and friends on the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. We passed the Fair Sentencing Act. You see, \nwe had a disparity in sentencing so that those who were found guilty of \nselling and using crack cocaine were sentenced at 100 times the \nstandard of powder cocaine. There was a reason for it, but it turned \nout not to be valid. Yet for years this was the standard. We were \nfilling our prisons primarily with African Americans on crack offenses, \nand if they were repeat offenders--three times and you are out, three \nstrikes and you are out--they could be sentenced for long periods of \ntime.\n  Senator Sessions and I decided to change it. We reduced the disparity \nbetween crack and powder, and we have seen a dramatic downturn not only \nin those serving times for crack cocaine offenses and selling them but \nalso the arrests that are being made today.\n  This bill we just announced in a press conference--the latest version \nand I think a good version--is another step forward. It will give \njudges more discretion in sentencing below the mandatory minimum on an \nindividual case-by-case basis.\n  A young man whom I have come to know is Alton Mills. Alton is from \nChicago, IL. In the year 1994 at the age of 24, Alton Mills was given a \nmandatory sentence of life in prison without parole for a low-level, \nnonviolent drug offense. This man had never served 1 day in prison in \nhis life, and at age 24 he received a life acceptance. I appealed to \nPresident Obama to use his Executive authority to give Alton Mills \nanother chance. Just before Christmas last year, the President commuted \nhis sentence, and Alton Mills was released after 22 years in Federal \nprison.\n  He was there today in a meeting we had with his mom. She never gave \nup on him. She was the one who appealed to me initially to take a look \nat her son's case. His attorney, a dynamic African-American woman named \nMiAngel Cody, really closed the deal as she described this case in \ndetail and how unfortunate it was that a 24-year-old man would receive \na life sentence for low-level, nonviolent drug offenses.\n  He is not alone. There are hundreds more just like him serving \nmandatory life sentences for third-strike sentences. The Sentencing \nReform and Corrections Act, which Senator Grassley and I have \nintroduced, would eliminate this mandatory life sentence. This change \nalone would change the sentencing for many who are currently serving in \nFederal prisons.\n  The bill was reported out of the Judiciary Committee in its original \nform by a vote of 15 to 5--a good, strong vote. We have picked up an \nadditional number of Republican sponsors since we have made some other \nchanges in the bill. I thank Senator Lee for joining me in initially \nintroducing this bill.\n  There are so many people who are counting on this legislation, not \njust those families who have someone serving time in prison but many \npeople across the board--Black, White, and\n\n[[Page S2528]]\n\nBrown--who want to see us restore faith in the system of criminal \njustice.\n  We had an amazing endorsement of our bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter of endorsement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 National District\n\n\n                                        Attorneys Association,\n\n                             Alexandria, Virginia, April 26, 2016.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Democratic Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Democratic Leader Reid: \n     On behalf of the National District Attorneys Association \n     (NDAA), the largest prosecutor organization representing 2500 \n     elected and appointed District Attorneys across the United \n     States as well as 30,000 assistant district attorneys, I \n     write in support of S. 2123, the Sentencing Reform and \n     Corrections Act of 2015. As a result of months of changes and \n     good faith negotiations, our organization feels the latest \n     version of the bill strikes the appropriate balance between \n     targeting the highest level drug traffickers plaguing our \n     communities, while simultaneously decreasing crime rates and \n     addressing the burgeoning prison population.\n       America's federal, state, local and tribal prosecutors have \n     as their primary responsibility the administration of \n     justice. Everyday, prosecutors have to make tough judgment \n     calls. Sometimes, that judgment call involves locking up \n     individuals for a long period of time for a heinous crime \n     that damaged a community. More often, we work hard to provide \n     second chances and concerted efforts are made to rehabilitate \n     an individual with the goal of reducing the chance that he or \n     she will reoffend back into the system.\n       As we have seen from the cost curve published by the \n     National Academy of Sciences, the current prison population \n     is simply unsustainable and continues to have a greater and \n     greater impact on broader funding and programming at the \n     Department of Justice. Budget aside, communities across this \n     country have shifted to embrace rehabilitation and the \n     opinion that certain individuals in our federal prison system \n     are serving sentences that are too long compared to the crime \n     they committed. This legislation aims to strike the \n     appropriate balance of time served and the relevant crime by \n     modifying the three strikes rule for drug felonies, with a \n     third strike now carrying a 25-year penalty as opposed to \n     life, and second strike carrying a 15-year sentence instead \n     of 20 years. Appropriately so, the bill expands the three \n     strikes rule to apply to serious violent felonies, ensuring \n     that we use prison for those we are afraid of, not those whom \n     we are mad at based on their behavior.\n       One previous concern our members highlighted was the \n     retroactive nature of many provisions in the original bill. \n     The new version takes into account that concern by limiting \n     the retroactivity where applicable if an individual's record \n     contains any serious violent felony. We feel this filters out \n     the truly dangerous individuals who should stay out of the \n     community, while allowing lower level offenders a chance for \n     redemption.\n       Our members also realize that as we see the same offenders \n     reenter the criminal justice system time and time again, we \n     must be creative and come up with innovative programs to \n     reduce recidivism, including job training skills, addiction \n     counseling and other productive activities. According to a \n     report primarily authored by the National Center for State \n     Courts, ``properly designed and operated recidivism-reduction \n     programs can significantly reduce offender recidivism. Such \n     programs are more effective, and more cost-effective, than \n     incarceration in reducing crime rates.''\n       As part of the broader legislation, the Corrections Act \n     requires the development of a risk assessment tool that will \n     categorize inmates based on their risk of recidivism and \n     subsequently determine which types of programming are most \n     tailored to that individual's needs and risks. This is an \n     important step in targeting at risk populations and providing \n     the necessary resources to rehabilitate those individuals \n     with the eventual goal of returning to our communities as \n     productive citizens. At the same time, appropriate parameters \n     are set for who is eligible to earn good time credit for \n     completion of the recidivism reduction programming in order \n     to keep the most dangerous and high-risk individuals from \n     being eligible for early release to community supervision and \n     off the streets.\n       We are especially appreciative of the provision in the \n     legislation requiring an annual report by the Attorney \n     General outlining how savings accrued from modifications to \n     federal sentencing will be reinvested into efforts by \n     federal, state and local prosecutors and law enforcement to \n     go after drug traffickers and gangs, as well as provide the \n     necessary training and tools needed to carry out \n     investigations, keep officers safe, and ensure successful \n     programming and initiatives are duplicated across communities \n     in the form of best practices. Unfortunately, as the Bureau \n     of Prison's (BOP) budget has continued to rise, funding for \n     state and local law enforcement grants has been slashed to \n     the bone negatively impacting innovative work in the field \n     including diversion programs, updating of information sharing \n     systems, and hot spot policing. This language is an \n     acknowledgement that vital funding streams to prosecutors and \n     law enforcement must be restored to protect the communities \n     we serve.\n       The members of NDAA are acutely aware that our federal \n     partners need to have the ability to allocate resources to \n     state prosecutors to help combat human trafficking, domestic \n     violence, the scourge of prescription drug addiction, and so \n     many other ills that plague our communities. Absent \n     meaningful sentencing reform, where the truly dangerous are \n     locked up for an appropriate period of time and those with \n     addiction or mental health issues have the chance for \n     treatment and rehabilitation, those needed resources will not \n     exist.\n       We applaud the bipartisan leadership of the Senators and \n     staff who have spent considerable time working on this \n     compromise legislation. Their tireless efforts have included \n     open and transparent communication with our organization and \n     members, which has not gone unnoticed. We look forward to \n     working with both of you and other Senators and staff in the \n     weeks ahead to move this bipartisan legislation forward.\n           Respectfully,\n\n                                          William Fitzpatrick,\n\n                            President, National District Attorneys\n                                                      Association.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. The National District Attorneys Association, which is the \nlargest group of criminal prosecutors in America, has endorsed our \ncriminal justice reform bill. We have brought together an incredible \ncoalition. I am proud to have not only the civil rights community, but \nwe also have others from the conservative side, such as Michael \nMukasey, former Attorney General. Everyone knows him to be a tough \nprosecutor. He endorses our bill. Others have come forward. They \nunderstand that it is time to step back and take an honest look at \nwhere we are today.\n  This criminal justice reform bill will bring some sanity to our \ncorrections system, and it will save us money. Roughly one-fourth of \nthe Department of Justice appropriations now goes into prisons. By the \nyear 2030, it will be 30 percent. As Senator Lee said, we are spending \nmore money on prisons than we are spending in the Department of Justice \non the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration combined.\n  What if we could reduce that prison population in a responsible, \nsensible way that doesn't endanger public safety but gives us resources \nthat could be used by the Department of Justice for law enforcement, \nfor dealing with the heroin epidemic across America and making our \nneighborhoods truly safe? What if we could take part of that and invest \nit in the lives of young people before they turn to gangs, before they \nturn to drugs, and before they turn to guns? That could literally \nchange the face of a great city such as Chicago and the great Nation we \nlive in.\n  This is a historic bill--not just because Democrats and Republicans \nhave come to support it; it is historic because we are tackling one of \nthe toughest issues of our time. We are doing it in a thoughtful, \ncareful, bipartisan, and respectful manner. I happen to believe that is \nwhat the Senate should be all about.\n  I look forward to encouraging my colleagues who have not signed on as \ncosponsors to do so as quickly as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today as the cochair of the Rare \nDisease Congressional Caucus in recognition of patients with Duchenne \nmuscular dystrophy and the loved ones who care for them.\n  Duchenne is a devastating, rare disease that primarily affects boys \nand young men. There is no cure. It is 100 percent fatal. There are no \napproved disease-modifying treatments at this time, but we want to give \nthem hope. In 1999, there were no human clinical trials for Duchenne. \nToday, there are 22 observational trials currently underway. Life \nexpectancy rates have increased by about 10 years in just the past \ndecade. The FDA has more tools in its toolbox than ever to accelerate\n\n[[Page S2529]]\n\napprovals of safe and effective Duchenne therapies, but we would like \nmore therapies to be approved in the future.\n  Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most common fatal genetic disorder \ndiagnosed in childhood, affecting approximately 1 in every 3,500 male \nchildren. The disease results in the gradual loss of muscle strength, \nusually beginning before age 5. The progressive muscle weakness leads \nto serious medical problems, particularly issues related to the hearts \nand lungs. By age 14, over 80 percent of these boys are using \nwheelchairs.\n  My work on Duchenne muscular dystrophy began when I was elected to \nthe Senate. It was an issue my dear friend and former Minnesota \nSenator, Paul Wellstone, championed. Paul was instrumental in getting \nthe Muscular Dystrophy Community Assistance Research and Education \nAct--or as it is known, the MD-CARE Act--signed into law back in 2001.\n  The bill dramatically increased investment at the National Institutes \nof Health for muscular dystrophy research and included funding for the \ncreation of six centers of excellence. In recognition of his work, all \nof the centers share Senator Paul Wellstone's name. The bill also \nsupported public health policies designed to improve quality of life \nand boost life expectancy of children and adults diagnosed with \nmuscular dystrophy.\n  Since passage of the MD-CARE Act, $500 million has been leveraged for \nmuscular dystrophy research and education programs, half of which is \nDuchenne-specific. I then led the reauthorization of the MD-CARE Act in \n2008, and it passed the Senate by unanimous consent. In 2014, Senator \nRoger Wicker and I led the MD-CARE Amendments of 2014, which built upon \nthe progress by ensuring that efforts are focused on the most critical \nneeds of doctors, patients, and researchers. These are important \naccomplishments, but more needs to be done.\n  The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 \ngave the FDA increased flexibility to grant accelerated approval for \nrare disease treatments that have proven to be beneficial. The bill \nalso directed the FDA to use patient-focused drug development tools \nduring the drug approval process. The idea is simple: Patient \nexperience should be a factor when the FDA considers a drug for \napproval. This gives the FDA the opportunity to hear directly from \npatients, their families, and caregivers about the symptoms that matter \nmost to them, the impact the disease has on patients' daily lives, and \ntheir experiences with treatments.\n  To build upon that progress, Senator Wicker and I introduced the \nPatient-Focused Impact Assessment Act. The bill would help advocates \nunderstand how the FDA uses patient-focused drug development tools and \nhow it engages patients, including those with rare diseases, such as \nDuchenne, as it reviews drugs and therapies. Last month this bipartisan \nbill unanimously passed the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee, bringing us one step closer to ensuring strong \npatient engagement throughout the FDA review process.\n  At an FDA meeting on Monday, there was one example of patient \ninvolvement in the drug approval process. It was a meeting that broke \nrecords. According to advocates, it was the largest gathering of \nDuchenne families in history. More than 900 members of their community \nwere there. In fact, turnout was so large the FDA changed the meeting \nlocation to accommodate everyone.\n  Many stories were shared during the daylong meeting--stories of hope, \nstories of progress. Even seemingly small improvements--such as the \nability to open a bottle of water on their own or lift their arm a \nlittle higher--make a huge difference in the quality of these boys' \nlives. These small victories have a ripple effect across a lifetime.\n  Monday's historic event shows the strength of the Duchenne community, \nthe passion of the families, and the hope that treatments are on the \nhorizon. This particular treatment was not approved that day, but we \ncontinue to hold hope that change will be on the horizon.\n  The fight against muscular dystrophy will not be won overnight, but \nwe have already seen incredible progress in the last few years. I am \nconfident that by working together--by bringing families to the table \nwith policymakers and health care experts--we can accomplish some truly \nremarkable things.\n  One of the reasons Senator Wicker and I fought so hard to have the \nFDA officials listen directly to the families is that when you know \nyour child has a disease that is 100 percent fatal, you might take \ndifferent risks. You might see different improvements in a different \nway than a medical professional who does not have this experience. We \nhope going forward this kind of experience and testimony and \ninformation will make for better decisions by the FDA.\n  We need to continue to ensure the FDA has the tools and flexibility \nit needs to increase the number of safe, effective, and affordable \ntreatments that are available for people with rare diseases. I also \nthank Senator Hatch, who has done a lot of work with me on the rare \ndisease issue, and we will continue to push for cures for people who \nhave so little hope.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/senate-section/article/S2529-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON.

Mr. President, this morning at 11 a.m., a big event \nhappened in Washington, DC, on the third floor of this building when \nall members of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, Republican and Democrat \nalike, introduced what we call the Veterans First Act--a comprehensive \noverhaul of the Veterans' Administration to bring about accountability \nin services to our veterans by the Veterans' Administration. Every \nmember of the committee, Republican and Democrat alike, came to that \npress conference.\n  I want to start by thanking Senator Richard Blumenthal of \nConnecticut, who is my ranking member on the committee, for his efforts \nand his work over the last 10 months to help make this a reality, and \neach and every member of the committee for the work they did. In the \nend, we adopted 148 provisions of the Senate to amend, reconstruct, and \nhold accountable the Veterans' Administration.\n  I don't know about the Presiding Officer, but every morning when I \nwake up in Washington, DC, and turn on the TV, whether it is CNN, FOX, \nor a local station, one of the lead stories is about a tragedy in the \nVeterans' Administration. This morning, in preparing for this press \nconference I didn't turn on the TV until after I read my notes. After I \nread my notes, I turned on the TV, and what, to my dismay, did I see? \nIn Chicago, IL, at the Veterans' Administration hospital, they found \ncockroaches in the food of our veterans. What kind of accountability is \nthat in the Veterans' Administration? For our veterans to be fed food \nwith vermin in it is ridiculous and crazy.\n  We all know what happened in Arizona a few years ago when \nappointments were manipulated, so veterans missed their appointments, \nand three veterans died. We know what happened in Atlanta, where we had \nan outbreak of suicide by people who couldn't get to mental health \nservices in time. We know what happened when cost overruns went awry in \nDenver, CO. When the costs of the hospital got out of line, the \nVeterans' Administration didn't know how to control it.\n  Every time we turn around, there is no accountability in the \nVeterans' Administration, so our committee decided it is our job to see \nto it that our veterans get what they deserve and what they fought for \nfor us; that is, a Veterans' Administration that delivers on\n\n[[Page S2530]]\n\nthe promise of good health care, good benefits, and the appreciation of \na grateful country for the sacrifice each of them made.\n  To begin with, we want to make sure the Secretary of the VA can fire \nsomebody and make it stick. A few months ago, the Merit Systems \nProtection Board overruled the firing of two Philadelphia employees of \nthe Veterans' Administration and reinstated them with pay with no \nreason except they didn't like the way in which they were fired.\n  If we go around the country, we find out that the Veterans' \nAdministration's best way to discipline somebody is to move them from \none city to another, from one hospital to another, or from one location \nto another. Moving problems around doesn't solve problems. They just \ngive the problem to somebody else. It is time that if somebody deserves \nto be fired for their lack of performance or their poor performance, we \nput our veterans first and make sure they are getting the attention \nthey should get. If somebody is not willing to do their job or cannot \ndo their job, then they are terminated.\n  We don't want to go through and take the rank-and-file, good \nemployees of the Veterans' Administration and tell them ``We don't like \nyou, we don't appreciate you, and we don't trust you,'' but we want to \ntell those who don't want to be held accountable, those who are not \ndoing their job, that we are watching.\n  We are going to encourage whistleblowers to tell us where the \nproblems are. We created an independent office in this act for \nwhistleblower status within the VA, so the VA itself is soliciting \ninput within its own organization to point out those who may not be \ndoing a good job. We need the VA to have a culture of support for our \nveterans, not a corruption of our veterans. It is critical that we do \nthat.\n  We took a lot of other issues that have been big problems in the \nUnited States of America for our veterans and we addressed them.\n  Opioids. We have a major section on opioids to try to get medicines \nto our veterans that counteract the addiction of opioids and don't \ntreat pain with opioids but instead treat it with the appropriate type \nof medicine.\n  We did a great job in terms of caregivers. I don't know about the \nPresiding Officer, but I am a Vietnam-era guy. I remember Vietnam. I \nremember the sacrifice of our troops there and the 58,000 men whom we \nlost in Vietnam. A lot of our Vietnam veterans came home with multiple \ndisabilities. In fact, 22,000 of them are living with disabilities \ntoday, but they have never been covered by caregivers. Our post-9/11 \nveterans have been covered by caregivers but not our Vietnam-era or \nGrenada veterans or our Panama veterans. This bill makes them eligible \nas well, so a family member--a loved one who is giving care at home to \na veteran who fought and was injured for our country--can get the same \ntype of stipend and benefit that someone who has fought in Iraq or \nAfghanistan gets. It is only fair to see to it that they get the same \nbenefit and the same treatment.\n  It is also only fair to see to it that Secretary McDonald himself can \nbe held accountable. Bob McDonald is a good Secretary. He has done a \ngood job. He has tried his best, but he hasn't had the tools he needs. \nWell, we want to give him those tools. We want to give him the chance \nto have discipline. We want to give him the chance to find the people \nhe needs to put in place. One of the provisions in this bill allows the \nSecretary to hire physicians, directors, and hospital administrators \nwho are capable of doing the job and pay them what the market will \nbear. Why not have good people who can do the job rather than temporary \npeople who don't want to do the job? Right now in the Veterans' \nAdministration, fully a third of its leadership is temporary, not \npermanent. We need a permanent commitment to our veterans that they are \ngoing to get the services they deserve and the services they need.\n  I could go on and on about this legislation, but the important thing \nto understand is that we are finally putting our veterans first. We are \ntelling the Veterans' Administration: We appreciate the good job you \ndo, but we want to make sure it is 100 percent of the time, not just 85 \nor 90 or 95 percent of the time.\n  We want to make sure they are putting our veterans first. We want to \nmake sure that somebody who makes a mental health call to a veterans \nhospital doesn't get a busy signal or a wrong number. We want to make \nsure that when somebody makes an appointment and then shows up, there \nis somebody there to meet them for that appointment. We want to make \nsure that the services veterans earned, fought for, and in many cases \nsacrificed for, are available to them.\n  I thank the members of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. I thank this \nSenate in advance for what I am sure it will do later this year: put \nour veterans first.\n  When we return from our break next week, I am going to do everything \nI can to get this bill before the Senate before Memorial Day, to see to \nit that we get it to the House of Representatives so we can conference. \nThe House has passed their bill. They have passed a good bill, and we \nhave passed a good bill. We need to find common ground to put those two \ntogether because one thing is for sure: What has happened in the VA for \nthe last few years is inexcusable and indefensible, and I, for one, am \nnot going to be a chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee who did \nnot try to make it right. I am going to use every strength that I have, \nevery power that I have, and every ability that I have to bring people \ntogether to say: We owe our veterans everything.\n  The Presiding Officer wouldn't have his job, I wouldn't have mine, \nand our families wouldn't live in peace and security today in this \ncountry had millions of Americans not volunteered to fight and risk \ntheir lives so that we could be free, so that I could speak freely on \nthe floor of the Senate about what I believe and the Presiding Officer \ncould speak freely about what he believes and we could go home and \nassemble and gather together. All of those are guaranteed by our \nConstitution--a document which is preserved and memorialized not by the \npaper it is written on but by the veterans who sacrificed and risked \ntheir lives to see to it that it was preserved.\n  I am very proud to be chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. I \nam proud to have served with Richard Blumenthal as ranking member and \nall the members of the committee whose contributions to this \nlegislation have made it a great piece of legislation--one that we \nshould pass. I hope we do so before Memorial Day, so on the day we \nhonor those who have fought for us and sacrificed, we send them the \nsignal: We have got your back and we are putting you first. We are \nputting America's veterans first.\n  I want to pause for a second at the end of my remarks and thank some \npeople for all the efforts they have made over the past 10 months to \nmake this a reality. As the Presiding Officer knows, legislation \ndoesn't just happen. We Senators make a lot of speeches. We are full of \na lot of hot air. But the hard work that goes on is done in the back \nrooms of the Capitol, in the committees, by the people who do the \nresearch to find the pay-fors, to make the decisions that have to be \nmade to see to it that a piece of legislation works and is not just a \nhollow promise.\n  I thank Tom Bowman, my chief of staff on the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, for the work he has done. I thank Amanda Meredith, Maureen \nO'Neill, Adam Reece, David Shearman, Gretchen Blum, Jillian Workman, \nLeslie Campbell, Lauren Gaydos, Tucker Zrebiec, Tommy Reynolds, and \nChris Bennett. I thank the members of my staff: Jay Sulzmann, my chief \nof staff Joan Kirchner, Ryan Evans, and Amanda Maddox. I also thank \neverybody on Richard Blumenthal's staff for all the contributions they \nmade to make this happen.\n  Today we opened up a new day for the Veterans' Administration in \nAmerica and a new day for America's veterans. We put America's veterans \nfirst today, and we are going to keep them first. They put us first \nwhen they sacrificed for us; it is time we did the same for them.\n  I urge each Member of the Senate during this break to get the \ninformation we send to your offices about the Veterans First Act, read \nand study it, and then come back and let's pass a bill that tells our \nveterans: We love you. We appreciate you. And never again will you have \nan appointment broken or not receive the services you need from the \nVeterans' Administration of the United States of America.\n\n[[Page S2531]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today's announcement by the Bureau of \nEconomic Analysis that our economy grew, once again, an anemic rate of \n0.5 percent during the first quarter of the year is more than \ndiscouraging but not surprising. Whether it is burdensome regulations, \nwhether it is a broken Tax Code, or whether it is a continued plunge \ninto national debt, the Obama administration's policies have been and \nwill continue to be a deadweight on our economy.\n  The President continues to make big promises and insists his policies \nare effective, but the facts speak for themselves. Under President \nObama, the median household income has decreased during his presidency \nand remains 6.5 percent below its prerecession level. If this were an \naverage post-1960s recovery, individuals would have nearly $2,700 more \nin their wallets. Instead, they have received a decrease of $3,000 per \nyear in their income. This is unacceptable.\n  While the President continues to say the economy is improving, it is \nclearly not reaching its potential or anywhere close to its potential. \nAt some point, you have to acknowledge the policies aren't working. \nHere we are 8 years from the beginning of the recession, and the \npresident in the White House insists that his policies are working: \nHang in there with us, folks. Things are going to get better.\n  Then these statistics come out that things are not only not getting \nbetter, but are getting worse. We are not only not moving closer to the \naverage level of recovery after a major recession, but we are moving \nfurther and further away from it.\n  Our current annual growth rate in this recovery is less than 2 \npercent. In 2016, with this quarter's report, we are off to a very weak \nstart. But if this were an average recovery, we would be seeing an \nannual growth rate of somewhere around 3\\1/2\\ to 4 percent.\n  I served previously in Congress in the Reagan years, and the growth \nrate during the Reagan recovery was 4.5 percent, which is well more \nthan double what it is today. I have seen firsthand how pro-growth \npolicies turn a dismal economic situation around, but I haven't seen it \nhere in Washington under President Obama. Where I have seen it is in my \nhome State of Indiana.\n\n  In 2005, under the policies of a Democratic administration, which \nclearly weren't working, Indiana faced a $200 million deficit, and our \nState had not balanced its budget for 7 years, even though the State \nconstitution requires that we do that.\n  Under the leadership of former Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels and \ncurrent Governor Mike Pence, Indiana has reduced spending, cut taxes, \nand paid off its debt. As a result, instead of a $200 million deficit, \nwe have a $2 billion surplus today. We enjoy a triple-A credit rating \nfrom all the credit rating agencies, and we have been listed in index \nafter index as the State to go live thanks to our low taxes and because \nwe are business friendly, family friendly, and tax friendly.\n  The contrast between this body and the State that I represent is \ndramatic because of the differences in our policies. By the numbers and \nindexes, it is clear that this Federal economy under the policies of \nthis administration is simply not making any progress. I think we see \nthat playing out in the upcoming election for the next President. It \nhas become a major campaign issue, and we hear both parties talking \nabout it.\n  Over the past 2 years, in Indiana, private employment has grown by \nnearly 130,000 jobs, reflecting the results and success of Indiana's \npro-growth policy. Employers are taking notice of our healthy business \nclimate and coming into the State to establish new businesses. I think \nthe resurgence of growth is proof that sound economic policy works.\n  I have seen how it works in Indiana, and I am simply not willing to \naccept the stagnant rate of growth here without trying to do something \nabout it. I don't think anything is going to change since there is no \nindication from the White House or even from our colleagues across the \naisle here that they are willing to at least debate this issue and put \nthe policies that bring about economic growth into place.\n  In order to boost economic growth, we need to reverse the failed \npolicies of this administration by overhauling our Tax Code, strip away \nunnecessary government regulations, give employers the certainty they \nneed in order to grow their businesses and create jobs, follow the lead \nof States like Indiana, Ohio, and others that have turned their \neconomies around and bring the prosperity to the people of those \nStates.\n  Congress can take action to encourage our economy to grow, but we \nneed a partner in the White House willing to cut the redtape, willing \nto enact pro-growth reforms and put in place a real plan to reduce the \ndebt.\n  I hope I don't have to come down here to discuss another quarter of \nanemic rate of growth. The American people simply pay the bills, pay \nthe mortgage, send the kids to college, and put aside money for the \nfuture. That is not happening, and it needs to change. Hopefully, we \ncan take a lesson from what we have learned on these quarterly \nreports--that the policies in place are simply not doing the job.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I am glad to see that my good friend \nfrom Indiana was on the floor talking about an important issue that the \nadministration certainly won't talk about. To be honest, not many \nMembers of this body talk about it nearly enough. As my colleague from \nIndiana mentioned this morning, the U.S. Commerce Department came out \nwith some big news. They said that the U.S. economy grew at 0.5 percent \nGDP growth the first quarter of 2016. That is one-half of 1 percent. \nThat is a horrible number.\n  I am going to make a prediction. I don't think anybody in the media, \nif they are still up there, is going to talk about this issue. Nobody \ntalks about this issue. In the old days, it didn't matter if there was \na Republican or a Democratic administration. If the U.S. economy was \ngrowing at 0.5 percent GDP--which essentially means it is not growing \nbut has instead stopped--then almost certainly the Secretary of the \nTreasury would come out and say: Don't worry, America. We have this; we \nhave a plan.\n  We know that 0.5 percent GDP growth is horrible for everybody, \nespecially working-class families. At the very least the Secretary of \nCommerce would have come out and said: We know you are hurting, \nAmerica, but don't worry. We have a plan. In previous administrations, \nthat is what would have happened, and it wouldn't matter if the \nPresident was a Democrat or a Republican.\n  But I don't think we heard a peep out of this administration this \nmorning. We have not heard from the President, the Secretary of the \nTreasury, or the Commerce Secretary. Nobody came out and spoke, and \ndon't count on it. I don't think they will be talking about this \nnumber. They even seem to be satisfied with this number--0.5 percent \nGDP growth. They certainly don't want the American people talking about \nit because this is not a good number.\n  This is a really important issue for our country. This is an \nimportant issue for every single American, and yet we have an \nadministration that doesn't want to talk about this issue because it is \na big problem for them. It is a big problem for all of us. We can't \ngrow the U.S. economy.\n  Some of my colleagues have come down to the Senate floor often to \ntalk about what they view as moral imperatives. I respect everybody in \nthis body, but there is a lot of talk about moral imperatives and \nnobody talks about this issue as a moral imperative. In my\n\n[[Page S2532]]\n\nview, growing the economy and providing opportunities for Americans has \nto be the No. 1 moral imperative of this body and of the Federal \nGovernment. We should be talking about it, but we are not, and one of \nthe reasons we are not talking about it is because there is no doubt \nthat the Federal Government--the Obama administration--is failing the \nAmerican people in this regard by any serious measure. This is not a \ndebatable topic.\n  The Obama administration's record on economic growth has been one of \nthe worst in U.S. history. Let's take a look at this chart. Is it any \nwonder why the President or Secretary of the Treasury didn't come out \nand talk about these numbers this morning? The numbers are abysmal, and \nthey are their numbers. Remarkably, when the President does talk about \nthe economy, he has taken to bragging about the U.S. economy because we \nare doing better than Europe. Look at the press. When the President \ntalks about the economy, he talks about how we are doing better than \nEurope. After today's news, he won't even be able to brag about that \nbecause 0.5 percent GDP growth is not better than Europe. If the \nPresident is actually comparing his record to another country, he needs \nto remember that the only country that matters is America. That is the \nonly measure he should be looking at--not Europe, not Japan, and not \nBrazil. He should be looking at our country.\n  How has he done historically relative to every other President--\nDemocrat or Republican? If we take a look at this chart, we can see the \nanswer. These are facts. We are not debating anything. These are just \nthe numbers. Real GDP growth, as I mentioned, is 0.5 percent growth \nthis quarter. But if you look at some history here, from 1790 to 2014, \nthe average real GDP growth for the United States has averaged about \n3.7 percent. That includes Democrats and Republicans over 200-plus \nyears. That is what made us great. Historically, we have had almost 4 \npercent GDP growth. That is what made the United States great.\n  I keep talking about GDP growth, but in essence, gross domestic \nproduct is an indicator of the economic health of our economy and how \nit is growing. It is an indicator that measures the opportunities that \nexist in the United States.\n  Like I said, we had almost 4 percent growth throughout American \nhistory. The President's numbers in the last 7\\1/2\\ years: 1.36 percent \nGDP growth. Here we see it on the chart. This is Kennedy, Johnson, \nNixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush 41, Clinton, Bush 43, and President \nObama.\n  The red line is important. That is 3 percent GDP growth. That is \nconsidered pretty good--not great but pretty good. Take a look. \nPresident Obama has never hit that. He has never actually hit that in \none quarter, ever. By any measure, these numbers are abysmal.\n  So what are we looking at? The Obama era has been a lost decade of \ngrowth. Again, compared to any other period, even the Great Depression \nperiod, these numbers represent lost opportunity, stagnant wages, and \nmiddle-class families struggling. Yet the administration never talks \nabout it.\n  If we can't grow our economy, who is hurt the most? It is the most \nvulnerable. It is the working poor. It is the elderly. It is the young \npeople. It is our pages right here who want a positive future. These \nare the people who are hurt. Yet if we grow our economy--if we got to \nReagan levels or Clinton levels or Johnson levels of 4, 4.5, 6--we \ncould take care of so many of the challenges our country faces.\n  So what has happened is--and we know the media certainly helps the \nadministration deal with this--we don't talk about it. The President \nmight compare our economy to Europe. That is pretty weak. Instead, we \ndefine the problem down. Many people may have heard this term, ``the \nnew normal.'' That is a term they are now using in Washington, ``the \nnew normal.'' So what does that mean? It means we can't grow at 3 \npercent anymore. Look at the chart. We have never hit 3 percent, ever. \nSo let's just define it now. We are not going to shoot for traditional \nlevels of robust American growth like 4 percent. Again, the historic \naverage is 3.7 percent, for 200 years, Democrats and Republicans. We \nare just going to say: Well, it is a new time in the history of our \ncountry--secular stagnation. This is the new normal.\n  If Americans believe this or accept this or our young people do, we \nare in big trouble.\n  So we talk about the new normal or we are silent, like what happened \ntoday. No one came out--not one person from the Obama administration \nexplained how we are going to get out of this rut. They are silent \nbecause there is no way to sell 0.5 percent GDP growth--to anybody. The \nAmerican people are smart, and they know they are being sold a clunker. \nThe economy is a clunker right now, and it has been one for almost 8 \nyears.\n  Again, it is important to understand just how bad this record is, in \nterms of U.S. history. Let me give a few more statistics. In 85 years, \nfor which the Bureau of Economic Analysis has calculated the annual \nchange in real GDP, there is only one 10-year stretch, and it is right \nhere--the entire Obama administration--when the annual GDP growth never \nhit 3 percent. Even during the Great Depression, it was only a 4-year \nstretch. So 10 years, starting with the Bush-era recession. The \nPresident talks about the recession, but that was almost 8 years ago. \nWe need to get over that and grow this economy.\n  During the last 10 years, real annual growth of GDP peaked in 2006 at \n2.7 percent. It has never been that high again. In the 25 quarters \nsince the recession ended, real GDP growth has totaled just 14.3 \npercent. So that is what we grew our economy by--the total growth of \nour economy. In comparison, other recoveries--again, Democrat, \nRepublican--since 1960, that lasted much more than a year, real GDP \ngrowth for the whole economy grew on average of 27 percent. So we have \n14 percent Obama, 27 percent over the comparable period for the \naverage--Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan. If real GDP \ngrowth in the Obama years had grown at that average, our GDP would be \n$1.8 trillion higher. Think about that--$1.8 trillion, almost $2 \ntrillion higher. Think about what families could do with that kind of \nmoney if we divided that by American families.\n  In the Reagan recovery, real GDP growth grew a total of 34 percent. \nThe economy expanded by 34 percent. So, again, Obama, 14 percent; \naverage, 27 percent; Reagan, 34 percent. He grew it at an average rate, \nand the economy grew at about 4.8 percent, so almost 5 percent GDP \ngrowth. Look at the comparison here. If the 8 years of President Obama \ngrew at the rate that President Reagan's recovery took place, we would \nbe seeing almost $3 trillion more in terms of the size of our economy, \nhigher annual aftertax income of almost $5,000 per American, and of \ncourse millions and millions of more jobs.\n  The President talks about the unemployment rate going down, but what \nhe doesn't talk about is the reason it is going down is because people \nare leaving the workforce. We have the highest rate since the mid-1970s \nof workforce participation. Why? Because we are not growing the \neconomy.\n  I know I am throwing a lot of numbers out, but what this chart \nreveals is something much more important than numbers. This chart goes \nto what the American dream is all about; that is, progress. That is \nprogress. When you are an American, you expect progress. You expect \ngrowth. You don't expect this. This is not progress. We are hearing it \nand we are seeing it.\n  The American dream was founded on progress. There is opportunity. You \nhave the opportunity to take advantage and move up the ladder.\n  A recent poll came out and said 13 percent of Americans--13 percent--\nthink their kids are going to have a better economic future than they \nhad. That is the death of the American dream, and this chart explains \nwhy. The young people right here, through hard work--only 13 percent of \nAmericans think you are going to have a better future than we had.\n  That is the essence of the American dream. We all used to think our \nkids would have a better future. Now 13 percent do. It shows that \npeople are losing faith in the American dream because of these numbers.\n  It gets worse in terms of the unequal growth. I was talking about \n1.36 percent is the average growth rate for the Obama administration. \nIn actuality, about 20 percent of the population in\n\n[[Page S2533]]\n\nregions of the country--mostly on the east and west coasts--are doing \npretty good. Twenty percent are growing at about 5 percent GDP growth. \nEighty percent of America--the rest of the country--is not growing at \nall--zero growth.\n  I believe this is a surrender. I believe this body is not talking \nabout it enough. The White House wants to ignore it. It is a surrender \nof America's greatness. It is a surrender of our future. It is a \nsurrender of our kids' future.\n  We need to do something about it. If we stay at these levels of \ngrowth, issues like infrastructure, issues like military spending, \nissues like social spending, even social cohesion are going to be much \nharder to address, but if we grow--back to traditional levels of \nAmerican growth--the future is going to be bright again like it has \nbeen for 200-plus years in the United States.\n  We don't have to continue down this path. We can make decisions in \nthis body--the right decisions--in order to right this sinking ship of \nan economy, but the first step is to admit we have a problem. The first \nstep is to recognize we have a big problem.\n  The President and his Cabinet will not do this. As a matter of fact, \nthere was a recent New York Times article where the President was \ntalking about how this is actually pretty good growth--again, dumbing \ndown expectations, the new normal. Did they say anything today? No. But \nthe American people know we have a huge problem. We see it reflected in \npolling and our politics with people losing work, stagnant wages, \nhistoric levels of failed businesses. More small businesses are failing \nnow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 more \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, we need to realize that what we are \ndoing here is part of the problem. Look at this chart. We are \noverregulating every aspect of our economy. What we need to do is start \nfocusing on ways that Washington can be a partner in opportunity, not \nthe center of regulations that focus on small businesses.\n  Let me conclude by saying, although I have highlighted the challenges \nwe have right now and the lack of focus by the administration, this is \nsomething all of us in this body--Democrats and Republicans--should be \nworking on together. Nobody wants 1.36 percent GDP growth. Nobody wants \n0.5 percent GDP growth. We need leadership now to tackle these \nchallenges and to get America back on track. We have to grow this \neconomy. We have to continue progress. We must do better for our \nchildren and restore the American dream, but first we need a White \nHouse that recognizes the problem. Unfortunately, today we saw that is \nnot the case.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/senate-section/article/S2533-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2533-S2534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    OVERSEEING OUR FINANCIAL MARKETS\n\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, 8 years ago, we suffered through the worst \nfinancial crisis in generations. Millions of people lost their homes, \ntheir jobs, and their savings. Although the economy has improved under \nPresident Obama's leadership, many of those families are still \nstruggling to recover today.\n  Terrible subprime mortgages were at the heart of this crisis, but \nWall Street invented other new financial devices, including exotic \nderivatives, that piled risks on top of risks in the financial market. \nThe subprime mortgages were like hand grenades, but the derivatives \npacked them together and magnified the risks, turning them into giant \nbombs that blew up parts of the economy. The Financial Crisis Inquiry \nCommission concluded that derivatives ``contributed significantly'' to \nthe crisis, ``amplifying'' losses many times over and exposing \ninstitutions and investors throughout the system.\n  Do you remember the billions and billions of taxpayer dollars that \nCongress shoveled into AIG as part of the bailout? That was to cover \nthe massive losses from risky derivatives that went south.\n  In response to the crisis and the bailout, Congress dedicated an \nentire title of the Dodd-Frank Act to the regulation of derivatives. \nCongress tried to make the derivatives market more transparent so that \nboth investors and regulators could have at least a fighting chance to \nidentify the risks and to address them. Congress also tried to reduce \nthe risk to taxpayers by requiring banks to raise more capital as they \nincreased their derivatives exposure and by forcing banks to push out \nthat derivatives exposure from their depository banks--the parts that \nactually hold checking and savings accounts--and to put them into \nanother entity that doesn't have access to taxpayer-backed insurance.\n  Over the past few years, the Dodd-Frank approach to derivatives has \nstarted to unravel. At the end of 2014, the swaps pushout was repealed. \nHow? Because lobbyists for Citibank literally wrote the amendment and \nhad a friendly Congressman slip it into the end-of-the-year spending \nbill--a bill that had to pass or the government would shut down. With \nthe help of other big banks, including personal phone calls from the \nCEO of JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, to his personal friends in \nCongress, the swaps repeal got rammed through Congress.\n  How big was the hole that this Wall Street amendment blew in Dodd-\nFrank? Well, Congressman Elijah Cummings and I spent a year looking \ninto it, and here's the takeaway: The FDIC now estimates that the \nrepeal allows a few big banks to put taxpayers on the hook for risky \nswaps to the tune of nearly $10 trillion. And who is gobbling down most \nof this $10 trillion risk? Three huge banks--Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, \nand Bank of America--three banks, nearly $10 trillion of risk.\n  These banks will happily suck down the profits when their high-stakes \nbets work out, and they will just as happily turn to the taxpayers to \nbail them out if there is a problem--all this because the Wall Street \nlobbyists persuaded Congress to do just one little favor for them.\n  Meanwhile, last year, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission \nfinally issued a rule that it was required to write under Dodd-Frank. \nThe rule was about margin, the amount of money that financial \ninstitutions have to put up when they enter into a derivative contract. \nEssentially, the CFTC rule was about making sure that financial \ninstitutions had enough money to pay off their derivative bets if they \nbet wrong. It is the kind of money that keeps the taxpayers from \nneeding to bail them out.\n  The CFTC rule was exceedingly weak, far weaker than the one they had \ninitially proposed. The changes in the rule came after months of \nintense lobbying from giant banks that were worried that a stronger \nmargin rule might cut into their profits. As CFTC Commissioner Sharon \nBowen wrote in her dissent to the rule:\n\n       This action today seems to be a return to blindly trusting \n     in large financial institutions' ability and willpower to \n     manage their risks adequately. Are we really willing to make \n     that bet again?\n\n  Well, I know that I am not, and that is why I think the recent \nRepublican bill to weaken the CFTC is so dangerous. Rather than \nstrengthening the agency and plugging the gaps in Dodd-Frank that have \nemerged in the last few years, the bill goes in the opposite direction, \nweakening or delaying other Dodd-Frank requirements and starving the \nagency of the resources it needs to oversee a $500 trillion derivatives \nmarket.\n  I applaud Senator Stabenow, the ranking Democratic member on the \nAgriculture Committee, for leading the unanimous Democratic opposition \nto the bill in Committee. Democrats should not be supporting a bill \nthat weakens financial rules, period.\n  We need strong rules and strong Federal agencies to oversee our \nfinancial markets. We learned that lesson the hard way in 2008. While \nsome lobbyists and their friends here in Washington may be trying to \nforget that lesson, I know that millions of American families remember \nit all too well, and they will be watching Congress to see who stands \non their side and who stands on the side of the big banks.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield my time.\n\n[[Page S2534]]\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today as a Senator and, as the \nPresiding Officer is, a doctor. I want to talk about a disease called \nDuchenne muscular dystrophy. Earlier today Senator Rubio was on the \nfloor talking about the disease, and I know earlier today Senator \nWicker was on the floor talking about the disease. It is a topic that \nis, as an orthopedic surgeon, very personal to me.\n  I was introduced to Duchenne more than 30 years ago and, as an \northopedic surgery resident, worked at a muscle disease clinic with \nyoung people with muscle disease. One of those muscle diseases is \ncalled Duchenne. It is a disease that affects young boys. I met \npatients and I met their families in the fight against this disease. \nThe experience has left a lasting lifelong impression on me, and it is \nsomething I continue to work with today.\n  I think the reasons we have gone into medicine are to help people and \nto make a contribution. One of the reasons I chose orthopedic surgery \nwas that I really enjoyed seeing the relief--the care that I gave could \nhelp people, causing relief of their symptoms, relief of their pain, \nrelief of problems they were living with from day to day. It is \nextremely rewarding to be able to work with a patient and tell that \npatient the surgery you performed was successful, and they are going to \nget better. They are going to get back to normal.\n  As a doctor, I was able to see patients go on to graduate from \ncollege, get married, have children of their own. When I was overseas \nvisiting our troops, I met a young man, a commander--a pretty big guy--\nand he told me I had taken care of his broken leg. I looked at him and \ndidn't really recognize him. I said: When was that? And he said: I was \nonly 8 at the time.\n  We take care of patients and, as we do, we see people through their \nlives, and it is encouraging to see them go on and strive and get \nstronger and bigger and more productive. But for patients with Duchenne \nmuscular dystrophy, that kind of treatment doesn't exist. It doesn't \nexist today with all the breakthroughs and research.\n  When I saw patients in the muscle disease clinic who suffered from \nthis condition, I knew the day that I saw them was going to be their \nbest day from there going forward. Many of them had brothers. It is a \ndisease that affects young men. It is a disease that may be coming in \ntheir family to children who had not yet been born. In some families \nthere were several brothers in the line who had the disease. As one was \ndiagnosed, then another younger brother was diagnosed a couple of years \nlater with the same disease because this does tend to run in families.\n  As a doctor, one wants to see somebody get better and stronger every \nday. Parents want to see their own child going from crawling to walking \nto running, getting stronger and bigger every day, but patients and \nfamilies who live with this disease every day know too well the \nunrelenting force of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. What it does is cause \ndegeneration of muscles and weakness.\n  The vast majority of people with this disease are boys, and they are \nusually diagnosed between the ages of 3 and 5. Typically, parents start \nto notice their son isn't meeting all of the developmental milestones \nthey might expect. He might be a late walker, or he may appear less \ncoordinated than other children his age. Most parents aren't worried; \nthey are just cautious. They may mention it to the pediatrician, and \nthe doctor may run a test or two. Once the diagnosis of Duchenne \nmuscular dystrophy is made, patients pretty quickly and parents, \nspecifically, very quickly find out that their son doesn't just have a \ndevelopmental delay; they learn their son is typically going to lose \nthe ability to walk by the time he is a teenager, graduate to a \nwheelchair, which then can make that young man prone to conditions like \nscoliosis, a curvature of the spine often requiring surgery to correct \nit. As the muscles continue to deteriorate--as they always do with \nDuchenne--that young man will lose lung function, which puts him at a \nhigher risk of infection, pneumonia. Eventually, he will have to use a \nmachine to breathe, to clear his lungs. The muscle deterioration \ndoesn't just occur to the skeletal muscles--the muscles of the arms and \nlegs--but also can occur to the heart, which is itself a muscle.\n  When a young man with Duchenne muscular dystrophy catches a cold, it \ncan be life threatening. Even when the patients get the best medical \ncare--and so many of them do get the best medical care--they usually \nlose their fight against Duchenne muscular dystrophy by the time they \nare in their 20s. That is the devastating reality of this disease, and \nwe cannot allow it to continue.\n  Because of my experience with these patients, I have been working for \nyears to actually help raise money for awareness for muscle disease and \ntreatment for the disease. I served as a local host in Wyoming for the \nMuscular Dystrophy Association's annual Labor Day telethon.\n  Every year, I was amazed at the dedication and the generosity of \npeople around the country who would call in pledges to pledge centers \nat the 200 so-called ``love networks'' in Casper, WY. People would call \nin. We would always raise over $100,000. People were very committed to \nfinding a cure for muscle disease and to sending young people with the \ndisease to summer camp, where they found a level of freedom and \nfriendship that they did not often find throughout the rest of the \nyear. It was a great time for the young people with the disease. It \ngave their parents a rest as well.\n  I think many of us in this body remember Jerry Lewis hosting the \nJerry Lewis Labor Day Telethon, as it was called, for more than 40 \nyears. He would always end the telethon by signing a song. The song was \n``You'll Never Walk Alone.'' So I come to the floor today to make sure \nthat these patients and these families know that today they are not \nalone. Congress is listening. We heard from Senator Rubio earlier today \nand we heard from Senator Wicker. Those families and those patients \nknow how critically important it is, and we know how critically \nimportant it is that we find a cure for this rare disease known as \nDuchenne muscular dystrophy.\n  In 2012, Congress passed the Food and Drug Administration Safety and \nInnovation Act. One of the key parts of this law gives the FDA more \nflexibility to approve treatments that have the potential to help \npeople with rare diseases. It also allows the FDA to do followup \nstudies to confirm the clinical benefits of the treatment.\n  Well, we want to give people real hope. It is not good to give people \nfalse hope. We are interested in giving patients and giving families a \nfighting chance. I believe the FDA needs to use the tools that Congress \nhas given them so patients can come across and get access to \npotentially lifesaving drugs. So a couple of weeks ago I signed a \nletter that was written by Senators Wicker and Klobuchar--a bipartisan \nletter. It called on the FDA to take full advantage of this accelerated \napproval authority.\n  So we also asked the FDA to ensure that the prospective of patients \nis fully considered in this review process, when it comes down to the \nregulations. More than 20 Senators signed this letter because we know \nhow important this issue is to patients as well as to their families.\n  Last Friday the Wall Street Journal ran an editorial entitled: ``The \nFDA vs. Austin Leclaire.'' This article talked about a young man named \nAustin Leclaire, 17, who has Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and so does \nhis younger brother Max. As we talked, I mentioned that this runs in \nfamilies. Sometimes, there is the diagnosis of a son in a family in \nwhich there is a younger son who has not yet been diagnosed but likely \nwill have the disease.\n  Well, back in 2011, Max was able to get an experimental drug to treat \nhis disease. Now, Austin was not eligible to get the same drug. \nRemember, Austin is the older brother. So today Max is 14 and he is \nstill able to walk. He can\n\n[[Page S2535]]\n\nstill play sports, and he can still dress himself.\n  For most of us who have had healthy children, these are the things \nthat people take for granted. So for a family where one of their sons \nhas Duchenne, this kind of small victory can seem like a miracle. I \ncan't even imagine how hard it must be when a mother has two or three \nchildren--two or three sons--with this disease, and especially when one \nof her children can get access to an experimental drug and the other \ncannot.\n  The family looks at it. One son is being helped, and the other is not \nbeing helped. They can see the difference in their sons. So how would \nany of us here in the Senate react if we were in that same situation? \nHow much heartbreak should one family have to bear? Those are the \nchallenges for families who live with muscle disease every day.\n  Well, the FDA, I believe, needs to work with patients like Austin and \nMax. We all know that this agency needs to make sure that treatments \nare safe and effective. That is not a question. We also know that \npeople at the FDA are caring and careful professionals. The practice of \nmedicine relies on hard science and on following data to understand and \nto treat illnesses.\n  As a doctor, I know that the practice of medicine requires an equal \nmeasure of compassion. I think the FDA needs to take into account the \nunique needs of this patient population. We talk about double-blind \nstudies, where you give one patient the real treatment and one patient \nsomething else, a sugar pill, something else that is not really the \nreal treatment, the real medication.\n  To really evaluate the impact of these medications, sometimes it \ninvolves doing muscle biopsies and putting people though painful tests. \nI think it is hard for a family living with a child with muscle disease \nto say: Well, we are going to participate in the experiment. We don't \nknow. It is a 50-50 chance if our child is even going to get the real \nthing. But we still put them through all of these tests that can be \npainful, as they take muscle biopsies.\n  I think it is unrealistic to ask a family to make that decision. I \nthink we need to make sure that the FDA--and the FDA needs to make \nsure, in their compassion--doesn't lose sight of these kids. These \nyoung people really don't have a moment to lose in terms of potential \ntreatments. I think the FDA needs to hear the calls of patients and to \ngive these young people, living with a devastating disease, a chance to \nbeat Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to warn of a gathering threat \nto American's most fundamental constitutional right; that is, the right \nto vote. Fifty-one years ago, President Johnson urged the Congress to \npass the Voting Rights Act. In the face of implacable opposition from \nSouthern States, President Johnson laid out the stakes. He said:\n\n       Every American must have an equal right to vote. There is \n     no excuse which can excuse the denial of that right. There is \n     no duty which weighs more heavily on us than the duty we have \n     to ensure that right.\n\n  Sadly, half a century after that law began to remove the most \noffensive obstacles to voting, Americans now face new barriers to \nexercising their fundamental right to vote. Across our land, there are \nstories of long lines, inexplicable purges of voter rolls, and new \nrequirements that make it still harder for our people to vote. There is \nabsolutely no excuse for accepting this sorry state of affairs.\n  There is no excuse for citizens in Arizona to wait 5 hours to cast \ntheir ballot. There is no excuse for citizens in Rhode Island to find \ntwo out of every three polling places have closed. There is no excuse \nwhatsoever for poor communities and minority communities across America \nto see their polling places shuttered.\n  Seniors and disabled Americans should not have to wait in long lines \nor struggle to reach polling places in America. Working parents should \nnot have to choose between going to work and going to vote. Voting \nshould not be a test of endurance. It should not be a Kafkaesque \nexperience in defeating bureaucracy and wading through redtape. \nIncreasingly, too many voters show up at the polls on election day, \nonly to find that their name--somehow, magically--has gone missing from \nthe voter rolls or their ID does not meet some new, even more \nburdensome, even more restrictive requirement.\n  There is no excuse for our government to turn away citizens and to \nsay their vote does not count because of a clerical error or an unjust \ntechnicality. These grossly unfair obstacles have sprouted like weeds \nacross our country ever since the Supreme Court overturned large \nportions of the Voting Rights Act in 2013. According to the Brennan \nCenter for Justice, just this year, 17 States have passed new laws or \nrules to make it harder for their citizens to vote.\n  Let me repeat that. Seventeen States in America, just this year, have \npassed new laws, new rules, and new hurdles for our people who want to \nvote. Thankfully, there is a solution. My home State of Oregon has led \nthe country in making voting more accessible. In Oregon, every voter \nreceives a ballot 2 or 3 weeks before election day. Ballots should be \narriving in mailboxes across the State over the next few days. Every \nOregonian has ample time to research candidates and issues.\n  Rather than waiting in long lines, Oregonians can mail their ballot \nback or drop it off at ballot collection sites, many of which are open \n24/7. Nobody has to take time off from work just to exercise his or her \nconstitutional right.\n  So let me repeat. In our State, we have made this work. Every voter \ngets a ballot 2 or 3 weeks before an election date. Now, vote-by-mail \nis not going to stop every State legislature in America from devising \nnew ways to suppress voter turnout. Certainly, some State officials in \nour country have worked very hard to dream up new ways to limit the \nfranchise.\n  But here is why the Oregon antidote is so important. If there is a \nproblem, our State gives voters more time to fight back. When Americans \nhave 2 or 3 weeks to vote, they will have more time to challenge \nregistration problems. There is more time for citizens to defend their \nrights.\n  Oregon has been voting by mail since I was first elected to the \nSenate in 1996, and we went to all vote-by-mail in 2000. Since then, we \nhave had consistently higher voter turnout rates than other parts of \nthe country. We have consistently had voter turnout rates that are \namong the highest in the Nation.\n  Oregon voting rates are especially high among young people and in \nmidterm elections. As an added benefit--this should appeal to all \nSenators--studies have shown that it saves money, to boot. So you have \na system that voters like, gives them more time to reflect, is more \nefficient, and saves money, to boot. That is a pretty appealing \ntrifecta, it seems to me, for democracy. So my proposition today is \nthat the rest of the country ought to follow Oregon's lead, and all \nAmericans, from one end of the country to another, ought to have the \nchance to vote by mail.\n  To me, this just is common sense. In fact, over the years, there were \nquestions about who benefited from vote-by-mail? In fact, Oregonians \nput it on the ballot, because they said that everybody benefits from \nit. There was support all across the political spectrum. So today, I \nrolled out a new proposal for a national vote-by-mail. It is built on \nthe Oregon system. The plan is simple. Every voter in a Federal \nelection will receive a ballot in the mail.\n  The Federal Government, through the Postal Service, would assist \nStates with the cost of mailing ballots to registered voters. States \ncan keep their current polling practices if they wish. But those States \nthat choose a full vote-by-mail system are going to see their election \ncosts drop and drop significantly. My hope is that this proposal \nignites a new campaign across the country to make it easier, not \nharder, for Americans to vote.\n  Vote-by-mail is a first step in fighting back against those who would \ndisenfranchise their fellow citizens to gain a political edge.\n  For instance, in my view it also ought to be easier for Americans to \nregister to vote. Again, my home State leads the way. Since January, \nevery eligible voter is automatically registered to vote, eliminating \nextra trips to the\n\n[[Page S2536]]\n\nmotor vehicles department or the county clerk's office. In my view our \nGovernor, Gov. Kate Brown, deserves enormous credit for leading the \neffort to turn this particular idea, this particular reform, into law.\n  I know many of my colleagues and many voters are cynical about the \nchances of passing real reforms in this partisan day and age. My view \nis, voting rights are too important to abandon the field to special \ninterests who would manipulate our government. That is why I mentioned \nthat in Oregon there was some initial debate with respect to who might \nbenefit, who might get a little bit of a partisan edge on the other \nside, and Oregon voters said: Nothing doing. We all think this is in \nour interests, making it easier to vote, making it easier to correct an \nerror, and cheaper than the alternatives.\n  This afternoon I urge my colleagues and voters to take advantage of \nthis opportunity to promote real reform, reform where we have hard \nevidence that shows it actually works, to make sure every citizen in \nAmerica who wants to vote has that opportunity. Oregon once again paves \nthe way to making sure there are real solutions to an enormous \nchallenge.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, after many months of discussion and \ndebate, today we announced a bipartisan piece of legislation to reform \nour criminal justice system.\n  I have been in the Senate long enough to realize that even the best \nideas that don't have bipartisan support go nowhere. The good news is, \nthis is an issue that enjoys broad bipartisan support and actually \nrepresents the marriage of two distinct parts. The more I think about \nit, the more it represents a continuum in terms of the way we punish \npeople who violate our criminal laws and how we treat them when they \nare in prison and how we prepare them--or not--for a life of reentry \ninto civil society.\n  Even in the polarized political environment that our country \nrepresents today, it is an example of an opportunity to demonstrate \nthat when enough people identify a problem and work together, we can \nactually come up with viable solutions.\n  In a previous life, I served 13 years as a State district court judge \nand then as attorney general. I have had an opportunity to witness some \nof the strengths and weaknesses of our justice system firsthand. Though \nwe made some significant progress in reducing crime across the \ncountry--by the way, that ought to be the litmus test, the crime rate. \nIf the crime rate is going down, to me, it indicates we are doing \nsomething right. If the crime rate goes up, that is pretty much a \nlitmus test that we are doing something wrong.\n  The truth is, our criminal justice system has been plagued with \ninefficiencies, overcrowding, and failures that are ultimately \ndetrimental to public safety. We spend too much of our criminal justice \nresources locking up low-level, nonviolent offenders and not enough \ntargeting the most dangerous and violent criminals. The good news is, a \nnumber of States, including Texas, have seen the need and have \nimplemented statewide criminal justice reforms with positive results.\n  As I said earlier, the longer I am here, the more things occur to me \nabout how we do business, but the idea that somehow we can initiate \nreforms at the national level for 320 million people and then cram them \ndown on a big and diverse country like the United States is pretty \nludicrous.\n  Actually, the Federal Government is rarely competent to do that sort \nof thing. We saw this with the health care reforms, which have resulted \nin prices actually going up and most people dissatisfied with the \nhealth care reforms.\n  If we just tried things out at the local level, and if they were \nsuccessful, then scale them up, I think we would have a much better \nchance for success. That is exactly what has happened in the criminal \njustice area.\n  I know most people think about Texas as a State tough on crime, and \nthat is true, but in the middle of the first decade of this millennium, \nwe saw the need to deal with overcrowding. We saw high recidivism or \nrepeat offenders, and we were facing a major budget shortfall. In other \nwords, we tried to keep building prisons to build our way out of the \nproblem.\n  Instead of just spending more money to build more prisons and hoping \nthe problems would go away, the major problem we overlooked before \nwas--which we finally realized--that people in prison at some point \nwill mostly get out of prison. The question is, Do they go back into \nprison after committing other crimes or can we help those who are \nwilling to accept the help, turn their lives around, and become \nproductive members of society?\n  We opted for a different approach. We traded in our construction \nplans for plans to help lower-risk offenders turn their lives around \nand become productive members of society. As I said, that is because \nmost offenders will one day get out of prison.\n  Today Texas has improved and increased programs designed to help men \nand women behind bars take responsibility for their crimes and then \nprepare to reenter society as productive, law-abiding members of the \ncommunity. I am not naive enough to say this is something we are going \nto be able to do for 100 percent of the people behind bars. That is \njust not true. I wish the world was the kind of place where once people \nmade mistakes and ended up behind bars, they could transform their \nlives universally and then enter productive society. It is not true, \nbut there are many who want to who need our help and can benefit from \nsome of these programs.\n  This includes training that could impact a prisoner's life, somebody \nwith a drug problem, somebody with a mental illness, or somebody who \nhas been drinking, exacerbating their problems. Those sorts of issues \ncan benefit from treatment and from rehabilitation.\n  Those who are educationally inadequately prepared to enter the \nworkforce, we can help them through work programs and job training. \nMany of these programs have allowed local communities to get involved \nas well, by encouraging partnerships in Texas between prisons and \nfaith-based organizations and people who believe in radical \ntransformation of people's lives through their faith. They can focus on \nhelping those prisoners who are willing and wanting to turn their lives \naround get the training and life skills they need in order to succeed.\n  I will never forget my visit just a few months back to the H.H. \nCoffield Unit maximum security prison in East Texas, where I saw \nfirsthand how important some of these types of programs are. I went to \none section of the prison and was introduced to the shop instructor. He \ntold me some of the inmates in his shop class came to him unable to \nread a simple tape measure.\n  I think it is shocking. It was to me. I think it is shocking to most \npeople that anybody can reach adulthood unable to do something so basic \nas to read a tape measure, but yet that was an example of the types of \npeople who were in that prison.\n  It is a remarkable example of how much opportunity there is through \neducation to actually help: drug-alcohol treatment, mental health \ntreatment, and to prepare people to reenter civil society.\n  I am pleased Texas--in addition to our well-earned reputation for \nbeing tough on crime--is now known as being smart on crime and a good \nexample what we could do nationally.\n  We are not the only State. Other States have done things, too, but \nthe results in Texas are remarkable. Between 2007 and 2012, our overall \nrate of incarceration fell by 9.4 percent. The crime rate dropped and--\nas I have said--that is the gold standard. It is not the rate of \nincarceration. It is not how many people are in prison. It is what is \nhappening to the crime rate. Our crime rate dropped and, not \ninsignificantly, we saved more than $2 billion of the taxpayer money. \nWe were able to physically close three prison facilities. That is the \nfirst time that has ever happened in our State.\n  We are not the only ones. For example, Georgia reduced its crime rate \nby more than 10 percent with similar programs. South Carolina and Ohio \nreduced their crime rate by 14 percent. North Carolina and Texas have \nboth reduced their crime rates by more than 20 percent.\n\n[[Page S2537]]\n\n  These reforms make our communities safer, which again is the first \nobjective of criminal justice reform, it is the second objective of \ncriminal justice reform, and it is the third objective of criminal \njustice reform. Does it make our community safer? The answer, from the \nevidence, is yes.\n  I think there is no question but that we should consider some of \nthese reforms at the Federal level. Let's take State successes and \nscale them up so the rest of the country can benefit where they are not \notherwise already doing this and where we can do this in the Federal \nprison system and not just in the State system.\n  That is where the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act comes in. \nThis bill includes legislation that I introduced last year that takes \nthis Texas model and builds on it to help restore an important part of \nour criminal justice system that is too often forgotten; that is, \nrehabilitation.\n  When I went to law school more years ago than I wish to admit, we \nwere told that the purpose of criminal law was punishment and \ndeterrence, to deter others from committing similar acts. The third was \nwe were told it was rehabilitation. We were going to help people change \ntheir lives if they made a mistake. Instead, over time our prisons have \nbecome warehouses where we just warehouse people and don't do enough to \ntry to rehabilitate people, those who are willing to take the \nopportunity to deal with their problems in a constructive sort of way \nand turn their lives around.\n  I have introduced legislation, along with Senator Sheldon Whitehouse \nof Rhode Island. As anybody who follows the Senate knows, we agree on \nvery little, but we agree on this. We were both former attorneys \ngeneral. He was a former U.S. attorney, and he has seen a similar \nexperience in his State.\n  So we introduced this portion of the legislation to encourage \nprograms that would help inmates learn valuable skills they can \ntransfer back home to their communities and help them turn from a life \nof crime. It is important to note that not only does reduced recidivism \nimpact an individual life--which is reason enough to do what we can to \nhelp--but it also helps that individual's family because the collateral \ndamage from somebody making a mistake and ending up in prison does not \nstop with them. It stops with their families, including their children, \nand their whole community, but it also makes financial sense too.\n  The Justice Department spends around 30 percent of its budget \ndetaining Federal inmates. By reinvesting more of this money in \nrecidivism reduction programs instead of building more Federal prisons, \nwe have an opportunity to save tax dollars and plow more of the money \nback where it can have the best impact. Inmates can be rehabilitated, \nneighborhoods can be made safer, and tax dollars can be better put to \nuse.\n  We have also made other changes in the legislation that represent the \ngive-and-take that usually happens in the Senate. Legislating is a \nconsensus-building process, and that is a good thing. Initially, when \nthe corrections act was introduced, there was a separate piece of \nlegislation called the Smarter Sentencing Act, which focused on, as the \nname would suggest, sentencing with a goal to reduce some of the \nmandatory minimum sentences which were a part of the 1990s effort to \nget tougher on crime. This is where we have actually benefited a lot \nfrom the input from those who initially were unpersuaded about the \nmerits of that part of the legislation.\n  For example, we have categorically taken out, removed, any benefit of \nthe Smarter Sentencing Act provisions for somebody who has committed a \nserious crime, as defined by Federal law. So somebody who is a violent \noffender, somebody who has committed a serious crime, cannot benefit \nfrom the Smarter Sentencing Act.\n\n  There is an area where I am afraid there is some misunderstanding by \nsome folks, and some people are actively spreading disinformation, \nsuggesting that as a result of the Smarter Sentencing Act provisions, \nthere is a get-out-of-jail-free card; that we are automatically going \nto come in and cut prison sentences for people to get out on the \nstreet. That is just not true. They need to take another look at the \nlegislation.\n  Under some circumstances, and only if you are a low-level, nonviolent \noffender, you can ask the court--the court in which you were actually \nconvicted and before the judge who actually dispensed the sentence and \nbefore the prosecutor who actually put you in prison--for a reduction \nretroactively of long-term mandatory minimum sentences. For example, \nunder some circumstances, back in the days of three strikes and you are \nout, you could get a life sentence for three relatively minor offenses. \nNow, where appropriate, the judge could say: Well, we are going to \nreduce that to 25 years. That is still a long time, particularly if you \nare talking about three relatively minor offenses. There is one other \nexample where a 20-year mandatory minimum sentence could be reduced to \n15 years. So if you haven't served 15 years, you are certainly not \ngoing to get out of prison.\n  But the whole point is that this is a negotiated piece of legislation \nfor which we tried to garner as much support as we could, and I am \npleased to announce today that we have five new cosponsors of this \nlegislation. I believe there are now 37 Senators on a bipartisan basis \nwho support this legislation as cosponsors.\n  Earlier this week, we got a very important endorsement from an \norganization for which I have tremendous respect. This is the largest \norganization of prosecutors in America. It is the National District \nAttorneys Association. They represent about 1,500 district attorneys \nand 30,000 assistant district attorneys across the country. They have \nendorsed this legislation.\n  Yesterday, at the Republican lunch and conference, we had people such \nas former Attorney General Michael Mukasey, who served 20 years on the \nFederal bench in New York, talk about how he thought this was a well-\nbalanced and worthwhile piece of legislation.\n  The bottom line is that we need to make sure that violent offenders \nand hardened criminals stay in prison and away from our communities. I \nam talking about the people who will not take advantage of the \nopportunity to turn their lives around, the people who must be \nseparated from society because they have made a decision to pursue a \nlife of crime.\n  At the same time, while we have focused on the hardened criminals and \nthe most violent, we have to address our expanding prison system that \ntoo often perpetuates a life of crime. When I was a younger lawyer, I \nwas told that often our prison system is an organization of higher \neducation in crime because, of course, that is who is there--people who \nhave committed crimes. And people who have committed rather low-level, \nnonviolent offenses, particularly when they are housed with people who \nhave chosen a more violent life of crime, can suffer terrible \ndetrimental impacts.\n  The idea is to focus on the hardened criminals, the violent \ncriminals, and take a look at the low-level, nonviolent offenders and \nsee if some will take advantage of the opportunity to turn their lives \naround. Local communities in conservative States--red States such as \nTexas, Georgia, and North Carolina--have already proven it is possible \nto do both. After months of discussion, I am confident we can bring \nthis success to the rest of the country with this legislation.\n  Like every piece of legislation, though, we know there is an arduous \npath forward. While this bill was voted out of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, it still needs to come to the floor of the Senate, where all \n100 Senators will have an opportunity to help improve that product. And \nthen there is the House of Representatives. Earlier today, Senator \nGrassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and I met with \nCongressman Bob Goodlatte, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, \nabout our ideas together and how we can move this legislation forward. \nAnd I know the President is anxious to sign a criminal justice reform \nbill. This could actually be a good bipartisan accomplishment of the \n114th Congress.\n  I appreciate the bipartisan effort on all sides to work \nconstructively toward a bill that can win broad bipartisan support. For \nthose who don't like parts of the bill, bring your ideas to us. That is \nthe way this process is supposed to work. Let's make it better. Let's \nbuild bipartisan support and consensus.\n\n[[Page S2538]]\n\n  Let me just say in closing that I particularly want to thank the \nchairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Chairman Grassley, for his \nstewardship of this legislation through the process. As an experienced \nMember of the Senate, somebody who has been at this a while, he knows \nbetter than most how to shepherd legislation--particularly potentially \ncontroversial legislation--through this process. He has been masterful \nin bringing us this far.\n  I think we owe it to our constituents and to the country to take the \nlessons we have learned at the State and local level and bring those to \nbenefit the rest of the country. Let's make our criminal justice \nsystem, as the name suggests, more just and at the same time more \neffective. And let's save taxpayers a buck or two in the process.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/senate-section/article/S2538-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2538-S2539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CENTRAL STATES PENSION FUND\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, across the United States, hundreds of \nthousands of workers and retirees are scared. They are scared for the \nfuture, they are scared for their families, and they are scared for \nthemselves. These workers and retirees did everything right. They \nplayed by the rules. They worked for years, if not decades, often in \nlabor-intensive jobs, and they responsibly planned for the future by \nputting money into their pensions, only to have their retirement \nsecurity ripped away.\n  This is a story happening across North Dakota and across America. \nHarsh and senseless proposed cuts to Central States Pension Fund--a \nmultiemployer pension fund--could rip away the retirement of workers \nand retirees in the trucking, UPS package and delivery, and grocery \nsupply industries. These cuts could impact more than 2,000 North Dakota \nfamilies and 400,000 retirees across the country who could see their \npensions slashed up to 60 percent. Many of these workers have been \nforced to retire because of decades of lifting packages over 100 pounds \nevery day. These jobs took hard tolls on their bodies, but they were \nable to earn a living, support their families, and put food on the \ntable each night. They knew that because they were saving for \nretirement through their pensions, they would be taken care of in later \nyears, they would be able to enjoy their later years hunting and \nfishing with their grandchildren, and they would be able to enjoy their \nlater years by taking care of their family and their loved ones. \nUnfortunately, that security is evaporating.\n  I recently met with Teamsters and union workers and retirees in \nBismark and Fargo. Quite honestly, their stories were heartbreaking. \nThey couldn't understand how, if they did everything right, their \nretirement could be taken away from them. They can't live in a country \nthat just enables these workers and retirees to be left behind. They \ncan't understand who was fighting for them.\n  They and we must stand up and say: This is wrong. We must stand up \nfor hard work, and we must protect their pensions and make sure all \nNorth Dakotans have a secure retirement.\n  I want to tell just a few of their stories today. I will start with \nDennis Gainsforth from Jamestown. He worked for UPS for 31 years. He \nneeds surgery on one of his knees because of working decades as a night \nmechanic. Dennis is also helping financially take care of his son, who \nhad a stroke, and his wife, who needs back surgery. Under the proposed \ncuts, his pension would be slashed by 50 percent. As a result, Dennis, \nwho is 72 years old, is now back at work driving a public bus in \nJamestown.\n  Tina Kramer from Mandan was a member of the Teamsters. She worked as \na secretary for the local union for 25 years, throughout which time she \nearned a pension. Her husband was a member of the steelworkers union \nand worked for Bobcat for about 30 years as a forklift driver. He also \nearned a pension. Several years ago, both of them retired, and soon \nafter, Tina's husband suddenly passed away. Tina lost her husband's \npension and now has to rely solely on her pension. Under these proposed \ncuts, Tina's pension would be cut by almost 60 percent. Tina has just a \nlittle bit of savings, which she has already had to dip into every \nmonth to pay her bills and for groceries and to pay her property taxes. \nUnder the proposed pension cuts, it could only get worse for Tina.\n  Bob Berg, from just north of Fargo, worked at UPS for over 30 years \ndelivering packages, many of which could weigh up to 150 pounds. \nBecause of the hard labor of his job, he had surgery on both knees, his \nhands, five hernia operations, and back problems, forcing him into \nearly retirement. Now his medical bills are skyrocketing. He receives \n$2,200 a month under the pension plan, but with the cuts, he would \nreceive just $1,150, which is a 50-percent reduction.\n  Mark Rothschiller from Mandan worked as a UPS driver for 28 years \ndelivering packages to rural communities in North Dakota. Because of \nthe intensity of his job, he had five back surgeries and two rotator \ncuff surgeries. After the last surgery, Mark's doctor told him to stop \nworking or he might lose his ability to walk. He now walks with a cane. \nHe relies on his pension--the pension that he earned--to help pay his \nmedical bills. Under the proposed cuts, Mark's pension would be cut by \nmore than 50 percent.\n  You hear these stories about men and women who worked hard all their \nlives and who did the right thing. They bargained for a pension because \nthey knew the work they did was not work you could do your entire life, \nand they knew they wanted time in retirement to enjoy their golden \nyears. Yet, today, the benefit they earned and that security is \nthreatened.\n  I had a man approach me after one of the meetings where I asked \npeople to tell me what the impacts were from the cuts, and many were \nable to give public testimonials. This man came up to me afterward, and \nI won't use his name because quite privately he wanted to tell me that \nhe was going to lose his house, that he was going to lose all the \nsecurity he had in the world, and that he was a grandfather helping to \ntake care of his grandchildren because his daughter couldn't afford \ndaycare.\n  These pension cuts don't affect just the worker, they affect the \nworker's family, they affect the extended family, and, quite honestly, \nthey affect our communities. But more than that, they affect our \ngeneral sense of security, our general sense that you ought to be able \nto rely on the goodness of your hard work and on the rewards of your \nhard work. Today, all of that is being threatened.\n  Some might say: Well, that is just the way it is. Pension funds are \nin trouble.\n  I want everyone to remember that many of these workers were basically \nprevented from managing their pension fund. In fact, the Federal \nGovernment took it away, took that pension fund away and gave it to \nprivate investment firms that squandered and wasted the principal. \nThese workers wonder why in the world, in a country where we would bail \nout Wall Street bankers who made bad decisions, they never get listened \nto.\n  We cannot let this happen. I have been pressing Treasury Secretary \nLew about this issue, and I recently met with Ken Feinberg, the \nTreasury official overseeing the reconstruction of this pension fund. \nWe have to reinforce this point. We had a good conversation, and I hope \nthe Treasury Department does the right thing by rejecting this \ndevastating proposal and seeking a fairer option. We can and must find \na solution that doesn't jeopardize retirement security or present long-\nterm insolvency issues to the Central States Pension Fund.\n\n  This deal has threatened the livelihood of so many of my fellow North \nDakotans, people who work hard for a living, the kind of people we brag \nabout on floor of the Senate, whom we are here to represent--the hard-\nworking, good Americas who build our country. Yet when this happens, \nthey wonder who is listening to them. Who do we really represent here?\n  This deal has to be rejected. We have to create an opportunity that \nenables all North Dakotan and American families to have the secure \nretirement they have earned. Dennis, Tina, Bob, Mark, and so many other \nNorth Dakotans whom I have met deserve as much. They deserve the same \nkind of consideration and interest that we gave to AIG and all of the \norganizations we bailed out during the 2008 crisis at a time when we \nsaw record bonuses for Wall Street executives. We wonder all the time \nwhy people are mad. We don't\n\n[[Page S2539]]\n\nneed to look any further than this example to know that sometimes the \npriorities are just plain wrong.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to become aware of this problem, to \nbecome invested in this problem, and to work with us to solve this \nproblem. The first and most significant and important step we can take \nis to urge the Department of Treasury to reject the current plan and \ntake this back to the drawing board.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/senate-section/article/S2539-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2539-S2540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ACCOUNTABILITY OF CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, of the words the American people frequently \nuse to describe Congress today--at least one of the words that is \nappropriate to repeat on the Senate floor--one of the most common and \naccurate is ``unaccountable.''\n  Year after year, hard-working men and women across this great country \nbristle under dysfunctional, costly, and burdensome laws made right \nhere in Washington, DC, and day after day, many of them do what \nAmericans have always done when faced with an out-of-touch government. \nThey contact their elected lawmakers to voice their concerns about \nthose laws and to push for change of those laws and the process by \nwhich they are made.\n  Ask anyone who has ever called, written, or emailed their Member of \nCongress what happens next. It is consistent. It is predictable. Blame \nis shifted; fingers are pointed; scapegoats of every variety imaginable \nare brought forth to defend those who are charged with making the laws \nfrom the consequences of their own handiwork. This is the very \ndefinition of unaccountability, and it pervades the culture of \nWashington, DC, because Congress has allowed it to infect our laws and \nour institutions--the very institutions by which those laws are made.\n  Many Americans assume that they are being lied to when their elected \nlawmakers blame someone else for the laws that are raising the cost of \nliving, eating away at their paychecks, and generally making it harder \nfor individual Americans and families to realize the American dream. \nBut the truth is actually even more troubling than that. Most of the \nitems on the Federal Government's interminable list of do's and don'ts \ngoverning nearly every activity of human life are not in fact written, \ndebated, discussed, and passed by Congress; rather, they are imposed \nunilaterally by unelected bureaucrats in one of the executive branch's \nadministrative agencies. This is true even for what are called major \nrules, which are regulations that cost the American people more than \n$100 million each year in compliance costs.\n  For instance, look at the Department of Energy, whose appropriations \nwe are currently considering. In a single year, 2015, the costs of the \nregulations issued by the Department of Energy exceeded $15 billion--\n$15 billion. In 1 year, it cost the American people $15 billion to \ncomply with the regulations issued by this single bureaucratic agency--\nby this single Federal Department, the U.S. Department of Energy.\n  Even if we were to agree with every cent of that very onerous \nregulatory burden, we should all be able to recognize the danger of \nallowing one group of people, consisting of individuals who never have \nhad to stand for election, to squeeze $15 billion out of the \npocketbooks of the American people. That is why I have submitted this \namendment, No. 3856, which would restrict the Department of Energy from \nspending any funds to implement or enforce regulations whose compliance \ncosts exceed $100 million, unless specifically approved by Congress.\n  Unfortunately, regrettably, tragically, this amendment was blocked \nfrom consideration by one of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle for reasons that appear to be completely unrelated to the merits \nof this amendment.\n  Nevertheless, I would like to take a moment to explain how my \namendment works. This amendment would have provided immediate, much \nneeded financial relief to the budgets of hard-working families and \nbusinesses all across the country. It would protect them from the costs \nof two major rules recently proposed by the Department of Energy--rules \nthat impose new energy-efficiency standards on ceiling fans and \ncommercial packaged boilers.\n  Just like the Department of Energy's ban on incandescent light bulbs, \nunder these rules, Americans would no longer be able to buy ceiling \nfans or commercial boilers that do not adhere to the government's \nstrict new standards. Proponents of the rules think this is a good \nthing. As former Energy Secretary Steven Chu said about the light bulb \nban back in 2011, ``We are taking away a choice that continues to let \npeople waste their own money.''\n  This government-knows-best approach to regulation is not only \narrogant--it is not only off-puttingly paternalistic--it is detached \nfrom the economic realities of American life today. Most Americans may \nbuy less energy-efficient ceiling fans than most Washington \nbureaucrats, not because they are less intelligent or less concerned \nabout saving energy or less concerned about protecting the environment \nbut because it is what they can afford. The additional costs of these \nenergy-efficiency standards are not insignificant. In fact, it is \nestimated that these two rules would cost American families and \nbusinesses more than $3 billion.\n  Today, the Department of Energy has the power to impose these rules \non the public, and there is very little Congress can do about it. But \nunder my amendment, the two rules would not go into effect unless and \nuntil Congress voted to approve them--unless and until Congress \naffirmatively enacted them into law and allowed them to be signed into \nlaw by the President. This simple, commonsense reform is modeled on the \nREINS Act, a bill that requires congressional approval for all major \nrules issued by all executive agencies across the entire Federal \nGovernment.\n  Last July, the House of Representatives passed the REINS Act by a \nstrong vote of 243 to 165, and it currently has 37 cosponsors in the \nSenate. Support for the legislation is growing because it is becoming \nincreasingly difficult to ignore the moral and material problems of \nhiding the regulatory process in the nameless, faceless bureaucracy. \nEveryone here knows the regulatory burden in America has become \nuntenable. Every single day, each of us hears from our constituents \nabout how stifling government regulations have become.\n  The data tell the same story. Just today we saw that the first \nquarter of 2016 was the third in a row in which private domestic \ninvestment has shrunk. This is disappointing, but it is not surprising.\n  According to a recent study by the Mercatus Center, in 2012, ``the \neconomy was $4 trillion smaller than it would have been in the absence \nof regulatory growth since 1980.'' That works out to about $13,000 of \nlost earnings for every man, woman, and child in America.\n  Some of my colleagues may think the costs of our regulatory system \nare defensible. I certainly don't. But I know there are different \nopinions out there, and that is exactly the point of the REINS Act. \nThat is exactly the point of this amendment--this amendment which has \nbeen improperly blocked.\n  Under the broken status quo, Members of Congress can claim \ninnocence--and they regularly do--when an executive agency imposes a \ncostly and controversial regulations on the country. In fact, many \nMembers of Congress not only claim innocence, but they claim almost \nvictim status. They behave almost as if we were a victim, as if we were \nsomeone being acted upon. We don't even have to debate it. It just \nkicks into law by itself. It is self-executing. This may be convenient \nfor those of us in Washington, but it is fundamentally and unacceptably \nunfair to the American people. We don't make the law this way in this \ncountry, but that is now how our system is set up. It is time that we \nchange it.\n  If Congress is ever going to win back the trust of the American \npeople, we must prove that we are in fact trustworthy--trustworthy to \ndo what we are supposed to do and trustworthy to make law--because that \nis why we exist as a part of our government. The best way to do that is \nto make ourselves once again accountable for making the laws, passing \nthe laws, and standing accountable for the laws of this country. This \namendment would be a significant step toward making Congress \naccountable again.\n\n[[Page S2540]]\n\n  I regret--I deeply regret--that it was blocked, but I look forward to \nadvancing similar reforms in the future because the idea of making \nCongress accountable isn't just a good idea; it is burned deeply, \nindelibly within our constitutional system.\n  It is no accident that the very first clause of the first section of \nthe first article of the Constitution says, ``All legislative Powers \nherein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, \nwhich shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.'' All \nlegislative powers--that means all Federal law in this system is vested \nin a Congress of the United States. We are not supposed to delegate \nthat to someone else.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in many places around the world, April is \na month where we celebrate rebirth and renewal. But April has too often \nbeen, in T. S. Eliot's words, ``the cruelest month,'' a month where \nsome of the world's darkest moments have cast shadows over our \nhumanity.\n  It was in April 1915 when the Ottoman government began rounding up \nand murdering leading Armenian politicians, businessmen, and \nintellectuals, a step that led to the extermination of more than 1 \nmillion Armenians.\n  It was April 1933 that the Nazis issued a decree paving a way for the \n``final solution,'' the annihilation of 6 million Jews of Europe.\n  It was April 1975 that the Khmer Rouge entered Cambodia's capital \ncity, launching a 4-year wave of violence, killing 2 million people.\n  In April 1992, the siege of Sarajevo began in Bosnia, the longest \nsiege in modern history, where more than 10,000 people perished, \nincluding 1,500 children.\n  It was in April 1994 that the plane carrying the President of Rwanda \ncrashed, triggering the beginning of a genocide that killed more than \n800,000 people in 100 days. When we talk about what happened in Rwanda, \nit is easy to begin to think of genocide as a single, undifferentiated \nact of barbarism. In reality, it was made of many individual atrocities \nthat took place over 100 days.\n  In April 2003, innocent civilians in Sudan's Darfur region were \nattacked, killing more than 400,000 and displacing 2.5 million in a \nconflict that continues to this day.\n  This past month, the State Department announced that the United \nStates has determined that ISIS's action against the Yazidis, Shiite \nMuslims, and Christians in Iraq and Syria constitutes genocide. \nSpecifically, Secretary Kerry noted that in 2014, ISIS trapped Yazidis, \nkilled them, enslaved thousands of Yazidi women and girls, ``selling \nthem at auction, raping them at will and destroying the communities for \nwhich they lived for countless generations.''\n  I rise here today, in April, not only to commemorate International \nGenocide Awareness and Prevention Month and pay respect to the \ninnocents who were slaughtered but also to speak about what the United \nStates can and must do to prevent atrocities and genocide.\n  The commitment to prevent acts of genocide and mass atrocities has \nbeen a centerpiece of policy by consecutive administrations of the U.S. \nGovernment. The United States was the first country in the world to \nsign the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of \nGenocide, signed in Paris on December 9, 1948, and President Ronald \nReagan signed implementing legislation, allowing the United States to \nbecome a party to the convention on November 25, 1988.\n  In the 2006 ``National Security Strategy,'' President George W. Bush \nhighlighted the ``moral imperative that states take against to prevent \nand punish genocide.''\n  I firmly believe that U.S. leadership can make a difference in \npreventing future genocides and mass atrocities. U.S. leadership can \nsave lives by bringing the power and resources of the United States to \nbear on atrocity prevention, accountability, and justice.\n  On April 10, 2014, I introduced the Syrian War Crimes Accountability \nAct in this Chamber. Three days earlier, the world had marked the 20th \nanniversary of the genocide of Rwanda, one of the most horrific events \nin modern history, which unfolded as the world stood back and watched.\n  At that time, I noted:\n\n       Unfortunately, we have not learned the lessons of the past. \n     We must do better to not only see that sort of atrocities \n     never again occur under our watch.\n\n  That statement was not only a reflection of my beliefs but a promise \nto keep the issue of atrocity prevention in front of the Senate and the \nAmerican people.\n  So today, under the heavy cloud of atrocities occurring in Syria, \nSouth Sudan, and elsewhere, I come to address this body again. I am \nhere today not to look backward about actions not taken. I am here \ntoday to stress that our job, our responsibility, is to make sure the \nUnited States has the tools--diplomatic, political, economic, and \nlegal--to take effective action before atrocities occur. Essential to \nthis is authorizing the Atrocities Prevention Board and ensuring that \nthe U.S. Government has structures in place and the mechanisms at hand \nto better prevent and respond to potential atrocities.\n  President Obama, when he established the Atrocities Prevention Board \nin 2012, said that ``preventing genocide [is] an `achievable goal' but \none that require[s] a degree of governmental organization that matches \nthe kind of methodical organization that accomplish mass killings.''\n  Earlier this year, I introduced the Genocide and Atrocities \nPrevention Act of 2016 to ensure that we do just that. I am joined in \nthis effort by Senators Tillis, Murphy, Menendez, Shaheen, Brown, \nGillibrand, Blumenthal, Coons, Mikulski, Markey, Merkley, Boxer, Casey, \nWarren, Whitehouse, Murkowski, Burr, and Bennet. This bill authorizes \nthe Board, which is a transparent, accountable, high-level, interagency \nboard that includes representatives at the assistant secretary level or \nhigher from departments and agencies across U.S. Government.\n  The board will meet monthly to oversee the development and \nimplementation of atrocity prevention and response policy, and, \nadditionally, address over the horizon potential atrocities through the \nuse of a wide variety of tools so that we can take effective action to \nprevent atrocities from occurring.\n  This bill gives our Foreign Service officers the training they need \nto recognize patterns of escalation and early warning signs of \npotential atrocities and conflict. With this training, we will, over \ntime, build atrocity prevention into the core skill set of our people \non the ground. They will be equipped to see the warning signs, analyze \nthe events, and engage early.\n  The bill also codifies the Complex Crises Fund, which has been a \ncritical tool in our ability to quickly respond to an emerging crises \noverseas, including potential mass atrocities and conflict. We used the \nComplex Crises Fund in Tunisia during the Arab Spring and in Sri Lanka \nafter its civil war. We have used it to respond quickly in Kenya and in \nother countries, where we helped save lives. Importantly, this bill \nbuilds greater transparency and accountability into the structure of \nthe Atrocities Prevention Board. Civil society will have a say, and \nCongress will have a greater oversight role to make sure we are getting \nthis done right.\n  This is a good bill. It does good things and places the United States \non a solid moral ground. But the moral argument alone is not enough. We \nmust also remember that America's security and that of our allies is \naffected when civilians are slaughtered. Our security is impacted when \ndesperate refugees stream across borders. Our security is affected when \nperpetrators of extraordinary violence wreak havoc on regional \nstability, destroying communities, families, and livelihoods.\n  We have seen groups such as ISIS systematically targeting communities \non the basis of their ethnicity or religious beliefs and practices. \nAfter 60 years, we still do not have a comprehensive framework to \nprevent and respond to mass atrocities in genocide.\n  Let this bill act as a framework and also as our call to action so \nthat when\n\n[[Page S2541]]\n\nwe use the phrase ``never again,'' we know that we are taking \nmeaningful action to make that a reality.\n  Mr. CARDIN.

Mr. President, the death of Freddie Gray was a national \ntragedy deserving of a national conversation. A year after the death of \nFreddie Gray, the glare of television cameras covering the ensuing \nunrest has faded in Baltimore but the hurt and the continuing effort to \nheal remain.\n  In the 12 months since Freddie Gray's death, Americans have had long \noverdue conversations about racially biased policing, poverty in cities \nacross America, the lack of access to quality education, and the \nscarcity of safe and affordable housing. These conversations have been \ntranslated into meaningful actions by Baltimore City residents, \ncommunity leaders, and lawmakers at every level. Faith groups, \ncommunity organizations, the business community, and many other groups \nwho love and understand the limitless potential of our city have stood \nup and articulated their vision on how to build a stronger Baltimore.\n  The death of Freddie Gray was yet another painful reminder of the \nproblems we have in our criminal justice system. I am a strong \nsupporter of the independence of our judicial branch of government and \nthe grand jury system, but I think all of us understand the frustration \nwhen there were no criminal indictments brought in the Trayvon Martin \ncase, the Michael Brown case, the Eric Garner case, and far too many \nexamples across America.\n  I have been working for years to address problems in our criminal \njustice system. In the days following the death of Freddie Gray and the \nensuing unrest, I called on the Justice Department to open Federal \ncriminal and civil rights investigations into Freddie Gray's death. On \nApril 21, 2015, I was joined by Representative John Conyers in \nreintroducing legislation, the End Racial Profiling Act, which I \noriginally introduced before the tragic death of Trayvon Martin.\n  As Baltimore emerged from the unrest, I met with community leaders to \ndiscuss legislative responses to help heal Baltimore's physical wounds \nand how to address many of the core problems that underpinned the \nunrest.\n  I met with a pharmacy owner whose store had been looted. I visited a \nsenior center that was damaged. I spoke with residents in east and west \nBaltimore. I visited Freddie Gray's elementary school to hear from \nteachers and community leaders about what tools they required for the \nFederal Government to better meet the needs of students.\n  In the weeks following the unrest, I went back and forth from \nBaltimore City to the Senate and the White House, relaying the needs of \nBaltimoreans to my colleagues and to top Obama administration \nofficials. I was joined by the Maryland congressional delegation, my \ncolleague and friend Senator Mikulski--one of the great leaders on this \nissue--and members of our city delegation--Congressman Cummings, \nCongressman Ruppersberger, and Congressman Sarbanes.\n  Congress and the Federal Government responded and continues to \nrespond. I welcomed the announcement that the Department of Justice \nCivil Rights Division will open a Federal ``pattern or practice'' \ninvestigation of the Baltimore Police Department. This was just one way \nto help restore the eroded trust between communities and police. To \nfurther this effort, I introduced the BALTIMORE Act. The BALTIMORE Act \nis comprised of four titles.\n  Title I deals with law enforcement reform. The BALTIMORE Act places \nbans on racial profiling by State and local law enforcement, mandatory \ndata collection and reporting, and available grants.\n  It requires local law enforcement officials receiving funds from the \nByrne/JAG and COPS Hiring Programs to submit officer training \ninformation to the Department of Justice, including how their officers \nare trained in the use of force, countering racial and ethnic bias, \ndeescalating conflicts, and constructive engagement with the public.\n  It requires the Department of Justice to report on a plan to assist \nState and local law enforcement agencies to improve training in the use \nof force, identifying racial and ethnic bias, and conflict resolution \nthrough the course of officers' careers.\n  The Department of Justice shall develop Field Training Program \npolicies and examine ways to partner with national law enforcement \norganizations to promote consistent standards for high quality training \nand assessment. The Department shall also provide a report that \ncontains best practices, model policies, and training toolkits. The \nDepartment of Justice will derive action plans for helping law \nenforcement agencies upgrade their IT systems to submit arrest and \nofficer-involved shooting data.\n  Lastly, Title I establishes a pilot program to assist local law \nenforcement in purchasing or leasing body-worn cameras, which requires \nprivacy study.\n  We have a comprehensive section that deals with law enforcement.\n  Title II deals with voting rights and civil rights restoration. The \nBALTIMORE Act restores the right to vote for all citizens after a \nprison sentence is served, returning citizens the right to vote. It \nalso restores eligibility to sit on Federal juries after a prison \nsentence has been served.\n  Title III deals with sentencing law reform, which many colleagues in \nthis Chamber have been championing. It reclassifies specific low-level, \nnonviolent drug possession felonies as misdemeanors, eliminating the \ndistinction between crack and powder cocaine for sentencing, and \nrequires fair weight for food products.\n  Title IV deals with reentry and employment law reform. It is \ncritically important that people have an opportunity once they come out \nof incarceration. I don't think there is a Member of this Chamber who \nhasn't had a second chance. This allows nonprofits to apply for Second \nChance Act grants.\n  It authorizes $200 million annually for the Labor Department's \nReentry Employment Opportunities Program. It is a sense of the Congress \nthat the administration should ``ban the box'' for hiring of Federal \ncontractors.\n  Baltimore's congressional delegation has been fighting to ensure \nFederal resources are made available to help the city residents \nprosper. In the days following the unrest, the Small Business \nAdministration established disaster loan outreach centers in Baltimore \nto help local owners who have been impacted by the unrest.\n  The Justice Department has also provided assistance in the form of \nthe Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grants to help defray the \ncost of policing during the unrest and to help local law enforcement \nbetter safeguard communities from violent crime.\n  The Department of Education's Project SERV, or School Emergency \nResponse to Violence, has given resources to Baltimore City Public \nSchools to help students recover from trauma associated with the \nunrest.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency pledged funding to help convert \nvacant lots into gardens that foster a sense of community and increase \npublic and environmental health.\n  Other Obama administration initiatives such as My Brother's Keeper \ncontinue to give communities the tools they need to foster long-term \npositive change. These are only a small portion of the Federal \nGovernment's ongoing commitment to the people of Baltimore City.\n  I am proud of the Federal Government stepping up to help Baltimore so \nthat Baltimore can reach its full potential. Baltimore is my home. \nFollowing the death of Freddie Gray was one of the most difficult days \nin the city's history. One year later, Baltimore is transforming with \nthe help of ordinary citizens, the business community, and a slew of \nnonprofits making a measurable impact. I have always been honored to \nrepresent the people of Baltimore. As long as I still have that honor, \nI will continue to make sure the Federal Government is an active \npartner in empowering Baltimore City to reach its full potential.\n  In the year since the death of Freddie Gray, we have made progress in \nbuilding a more just America by investing in Baltimore. Let us continue \nto build upon that progress.\n\n[[Page S2542]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN.

Mr. President, on Tuesday, the world lost a courageous \nactivist for international workers' rights, Harry Wu. Harry Wu spent 19 \nyears in one of China's ``laogai'' prison labor camps. That word is \npretty much unknown in English--L-A-O-G-A-I. It is a word that the \nChinese made famous, at least in their part of the world, as the \nterribly brutal labor camps where they sent political prisoners.\n  Mr. Wu was imprisoned in 1960 at age 23 because he spoke out against \nCommunist China's ally in 1960, the Soviet Union, after its invasion of \nHungary. Over those 19 years, from 1960 to 1979, Mr. Wu was brutalized. \nHe was sent to work on farms, mines, and prison camps. He was beaten \nand forced into concrete cases. As he has written and told us, he \nsurvived on food he foraged in rats' nests.\n  After his release, following Mao's death, Harry Wu dedicated the rest \nof his life to exposing the horrors that his homeland leaders inflicted \non their own citizens. He risked his life to return to China under \ncover and gathered secret footage of the abuses in China's laogai, \nChina's prison camps. He wouldn't let the world ignore Chinese \natrocities. He wouldn't let us forget that opening our doors to China--\ndemanded by U.S. corporations with few strings attached--came at a \nsteep price. Through the footage he collected, he helped show the world \nthat products like cheap wrenches and artificial flowers sold in the \nUnited States were made with forced labor. Think about what this was \nabout. U.S. companies would shut down their production in Mansfield, my \nhometown, or maybe in Baton Rouge or Cleveland, and move their \nproduction to China and sell those products back to the United States. \nThe U.S. companies that moved to China never addressed the moral issue \nof what that move did to our communities. They never addressed the \nmoral issue of, in some cases, using Chinese forced labor to make their \nproducts. These companies could also sell their products a little bit \ncheaper in the United States, and as a result, these companies could \nreap much bigger profits. The moral question of U.S. trade relations \nwith China has rarely been touched in this body. It is just \ninconvenient for us to think about. Well, Mr. Wu never let it be \ninconvenient.\n  As we approach the 15th anniversary of China's entry into the World \nTrade Organization this year and review China's nonmarket economy \nstatus, we should not forget the lessons of Harry Wu. Over the past \ndecade, we have seen that prosperity in China does not lead to more \npolitical freedom.\n  I knew Harry Wu. He testified before the Congressional-Executive \nCommission on China when I was chairman. He had testified several \ntimes.\n  As recently as 2012, Mr. Wu warned Congress:\n\n       The Laogai--\n\n  The forced labor camp--\n\n     system [is] deeply rooted into [China's] economic structure. \n     . . . China's working class is different from that of the \n     modern democratic countries. It includes not only ``workers'' \n     in the ordinary sense, but also ``workers'' of the prison \n     enterprises.\n\n  These would be slaves. He warned that ``prisoners in Laogai, more \nlike state slaves than enterprise workers, provide the state with an \nendless source of cheap or payless labor force.''\n  This system is an egregious human rights abuse against hundreds of \nthousands of Chinese people. It hurts American workers who are then \nforced to compete.\n  This system they have set up is one of the reasons that people are \nreally upset about what is happening in this country. Companies in my \nState of Ohio shut down production in Lima, Zanesville, and \nChillicothe, then moved overseas to China in order to get a tax break, \nhired Chinese workers--some of them were slave laborers for some of the \ncomponent manufacturing; some of them were just low-paid labor--to make \nthese products in a totalitarian system and sell them back in the \nUnited States. American companies never talk about the moral dimension \nof that.\n  I wrote a book a dozen or so years ago called the ``Myths of Free \nTrade.'' I interviewed Harry Wu about this book. He told me: \n``Capitalism must never be equated with democracy.'' Because our \ncountry believes in capitalism and democracy, we think they always go \ntogether. Well, they don't. According to Harry Wu:\n\n       Capitalism must never be equated with democracy. . . . \n     Don't believe it about China. My homeland is mired in \n     thousands of years of rule by one bully at a time, whether \n     you call him emperor or chairman. Don't be fooled by \n     electronics or air conditioning.\n\n  Before his death, I think Mr. Wu would have said: Yes, the United \nStates has been fooled. Maybe we choose to be fooled; maybe we choose \nto not know how the products that we hold in our hands are made--by an \noppressive government using forced labor workers.\n  We have been on a continuous march toward more trade with China and \ndemanded far little in return. We have turned a blind eye to China's \nlabor practices for too long. When you hear Presidential candidates and \nothers complaining about China, it is always about putting American \nworkers out of work, which it should be, but the other part of that \nmoral question is about how we are using slave laborers in China to \nundercut American workers. How could an American worker or company \npossibly compete with slave labor in China? Obviously we can't, but we \nleave that moral question because U.S. corporations don't want to \nacknowledge and want to turn a blind eye toward slave labor. It reminds \nme of something from a few years ago when an American drug company was \nmaking a blood thinner--much of the production of that blood thinner \ncame from China--with contaminated ingredients, and a number of people \nin Toledo, OH, died. The drug company didn't know where these products \ncame from. They knew they came from China, but they didn't know where \ntheir supply ingredients came from. Think about that. They should be \nliable for that--at least you would think they should--but they just \ndidn't think about the moral question there.\n  A year and a half ago I gave a speech to the Council on Foreign \nRelations, warning that before we sign any bilateral investment treaty \nwith China, we need to demand that China comply with existing \ninternational obligations in domestic law. We have given China chance \nafter chance, pushing for increased engagement, even though we know \nthat China will play by its own rules. In the past year and a half, \nnothing has changed. We need to make clear the international \nobligations we expect China to meet on cyber security, human rights, \nforced labor, slaves making products that American children use, \ninternational trade, workers' rights, and other issues. We need to \ndemand that China meet these standards now.\n  Increased engagement by the United States may have led to more \nagreements on paper, and that is fine, but in reality the only thing it \nhas achieved is our ongoing tolerance of Chinese transgressions. It may \nbe tolerance, it may be ignoring, it may be shrugging our shoulders, it \nmay be burying our heads in the sand, but I don't think we want to \nthink much about slave labor in China. I don't think when we buy these \nproducts at Walmart--specializing in Chinese products--that we want to \nthink much about where these products were made. We often know they \nwere made in China, but we don't really want to think about how those \nworkers produced these products.\n  Harry Wu's passing is a reminder that this needs to end. His legacy \nincludes the Laogai Museum here in Washington. I encourage my \ncolleagues to visit the museum and pay their respects to Harry Wu. The \nbest way they can pay their respects to Harry Wu is by changing our \npolicies. The thousands upon thousands of other nameless prisoners who \nsuffered in these Chinese prison camps should be honored equally. We \ncan't forget this tragic legacy, and we can't forget the human rights \nabuses that continue to this day as they continue to make these same \nproducts in these same working conditions with these same slave \nlaborers. It is shameful. It should not continue.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Good afternoon, Mr. President. For more than a year now, \nas the Presiding Officer knows since he has had the good fortune--or \nbad fortune of drawing the short straw--of sitting there when I come to \nthe Senate floor just about every month to highlight the extraordinary \nwork that is being done by the men and women of the Department of \nHomeland Security--I am here to do that again today. The agency has so \nmany talented folks, and they do incredibly important work, so there is \nno shortage of material.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, the Department of Homeland Security \nis made up of 22 component agencies and employs over 200,000 people. \nThese men and women work around the clock, and the work they do is \ndesigned to protect all of us--protect our families and protect our \ncountry. Last month we were reminded of just how crucial the work they \ndo is when terrorists attacked a train station and airport check-in \narea in Brussels, Belgium, setting off bombs that killed 32 people and \nwounded hundreds more. Our thoughts and prayers have been and remain \nwith the families, loved ones, and victims of these horrible attacks.\n  Just 6 days before these tragic attacks, I spoke on the floor about \nthe difficult but critical work performed by the 59,000 employees of \nthe Transportation Security Administration, affectionately known as \nTSA. These men and women work every day. They do so to ensure that all \nof us--Americans and tourists who visit--may travel around our country \nand around the world safe from harm.\n  The attack in Brussels shows us once again just how important these \nefforts--performed by the men and women at TSA--are to every single \nAmerican and to our visitors. It also reminds us how important it is \nthat TSA has the tools and resources needed to effectively carry out \ntheir mission.\n  To help ensure that the TSA is well equipped to protect the public, I \nworked with a number of our Senate colleagues last week--Democrats and \nRepublicans alike--to include amendments to a bill reauthorizing the \nFederal Aviation Administration. Our amendments will help make airports \nand transit hubs across our country safer for travelers by doubling the \nnumber of teams--called VIPR teams--of Federal agents and bomb-sniffing \ndogs that patrol our airports and subways to deter and identify \npotential attackers.\n  These amendments will also make security improvements to public areas \nin airports and train stations and ensure that the men and women \npatrolling those areas can effectively respond to the types of active \nshooter incidents we have unfortunately seen more frequently in recent \nmonths.\n  These commonsense amendments are just one of the many ways we can \nsupport the men and women at TSA and throughout the Department of \nHomeland Security who work on the frontlines every day screening \npassengers, guarding our ports of entry, and patrolling our transit \nhubs.\n  One part of the support we need to extend to these brave public \nservants is world-class training and education. By expanding and \nimproving training opportunities for our law enforcement personnel, we \ncan make sure they have the knowledge and make sure they have the \ncapability to respond to every situation that may arise. That is why \none of the best tools in our homeland security arsenal is the Federal \nLaw Enforcement Training Center.\n  As my staff knows, I don't like acronyms very much, but this is a \npretty good one. It is called the Federal Law Enforcement Training \nCenter. It is located in Glynco, GA. It goes by the acronym F-L-E-T-C, \nand we affectionately call it FLETC. I am not crazy about acronyms, but \nthat is a pretty good one. We call it FLETC.\n  The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center is tasked with teaching \nthe men and women we deploy to the frontlines how to best utilize the \ntechnologies and techniques needed to protect Americans here at home \nand around the world. They provide training to literally dozens of \nFederal agencies, State law enforcement personnel from across our \ncountry, and our international partners, who travel from all over the \nworld to learn from the best right here in America. From active shooter \ntrainings, to advanced forensic techniques, to methods to counter human \ntrafficking, FLETC instructors provide training in nearly 100 courses. \nThey host the training academies for a number of other agencies, \nincluding Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement, and the U.S. Coast Guard.\n  Recently, TSA announced that they would be establishing a new, \npermanent academy for transportation security officers at FLETC's main \nfacility in Glynco, GA. Having their training centralized at FLETC will \nallow TSA to better ensure uniform training for all of their officers \nand better collaborate with other components of the Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  Providing world-class training and instruction to tens of thousands \nof law enforcement officers each year requires bringing together some \nof the most highly qualified professional instructors from across our \ncountry. The more than 1,000 men and women from across law enforcement \nwho serve at FLETC utilize their personal experience in the field to \ncreate and to lead effective trainings that help law enforcement \nprofessionals keep us--Americans and our guests--safe and secure each \nday.\n  One of FLETC's world-class instructors is Greg King, pictured right \nhere to my left. For nearly 10 years, Mr. King has been an instructor \nat FLETC, utilizing his own experience to train Federal officers \ndeployed around the world.\n  Before coming to FLETC, Greg served his hometown of Cleveland, OH, \nworking for the Cleveland Police Department for 28 years. If he is \nlistening, I would just suggest that I have been thinking that Greg may \nhave started when he was about 10. He looks pretty good for a guy who \nhas been doing that for this long. He has a career spanning nearly \nthree decades. Greg did everything from working undercover as a street \ncrimes unit detective, to investigating financial crimes, murders, and \ncrimes against children. For those 28 years, Greg has dedicated his \nlife to protecting the community of Cleveland and giving back to the \ntown in which he grew up.\n  Today, Greg serves as a senior instructor at FLETC, working as \nprogram coordinator for the Case Organization and Presentation Training \nProgram, the Internet Investigations Training Program, and as assistant \nprogram coordinator for the Intelligence Analyst Training Program. Greg \nhas a wealth of knowledge in these areas. His colleagues call him--this \nis a quote, their words, not mine--a real ``subject matter expert'' \nwith the kind of expertise that can only come from real-world \nexperience. Through the lesson plans and course materials he develops, \nGreg strives to impart the firsthand knowledge he gained on the force \nto his students so that when they leave his class, they are able to \neffectively build cases, conduct investigations, analyze information, \nand ultimately catch the bad guys.\n  At FLETC, Greg's colleagues also refer to him as an ``Energizer \nbunny.'' Some of my colleagues have referred to me in those same terms. \nI think it is a compliment--I hope so--and in his case, I am sure it \nis. His energy and his passion for his work inspire other instructors \nand keep his students engaged.\n  Given his dedication to his students and to the FLETC mission, Greg \nhas earned the respect of his peers and FLETC leadership alike. It is \nno wonder, then, that Greg King was named FLETC instructor of the year \nfor 2015. Think about that--instructor of the year for the entire \nschool. It is clearly a well-deserved honor.\n  When Greg isn't training law enforcement professionals, he spends \ntime with his family--his wife Shelley, their two daughters Lela and \nShayla; and their son Rayshawn. I want to give my special thanks to \nGreg's wife Shelley and to their two daughters and their son for \nsharing him with us--with the people of Cleveland and now the people of \nthe United States--for not just 28 years but 38 years in all. He has \ndedicated countless hours, I am told as\n\n[[Page S2544]]\n\nwell, to his community and to his country in addition to that.\n  In his 10 years at FLETC, Greg King has helped train countless law \nenforcement officers, who have used the valuable lessons from his \ncourses every single day to arrest criminals, to protect our fellow \ncitizens, and to help keep Americans safe around the world.\n  FLETC has four core values that the agency and their employees \nattempt to abide by, and I am going to mention those today: No. 1, \nrespect; No. 2, integrity--one of our former colleagues, Alan Simpson, \nthe Senator from Wyoming, used to say about integrity: If you have it, \nnothing else matters. If you don't have it, nothing else matters. \nIntegrity is the second value I want to mention for FLETC. So respect, \nintegrity, service, and excellence.\n\n  I like to say that one of the things we need to focus on is to have \nexcellence in everything we do as a country, here in the Senate and \nacross the country. If it isn't perfect, make it better. And that is \none of the core values for FLETC.\n  Respect, integrity, service, and excellence. I have mentioned that \nthose values actually look a little bit like some of the values we \nembrace in the office from the State that I am privileged to represent. \nGreg has lived this one, using his own experience, to make the next \ngeneration of law enforcement officers and our country even better \nprepared to face the threats of tomorrow.\n  Greg is just one shining example of the critical work being done by \nmore than 1,000 instructors at FLETC. These instructors make it their \nown mission to ensure that law enforcement personnel across our country \nare well prepared for whatever they might face on the job.\n  So to Greg, to all of the men and women at FLETC, and to everyone at \nthe Department of Homeland Security, I thank you for your hard work day \nin and day out, I thank you for your service to the people of our \ncountry, and I urge you to keep up the good work.\n  Some of us travel on trains. Some of us travel on buses. Some of us \ntravel on airplanes and helicopters, in our own cars, trucks, and vans. \nI do a combination of those, but I do a fair amount of travel in the \nair. I was a naval flight officer for many years. I am a retired Navy \ncaptain. I spent a lot of time in Navy airplanes. I love the Navy. I \nloved serving in the Navy. But now they don't let me--they let me ride \nin a commercial plane. Sometimes we get to fly in military planes, too, \nwhich is a kick. But when you fly commercial aviation, at the airport \nyou generally go through a security check, and they want to make sure \nyou are not carrying anything in your luggage or anything on your \nperson that is inappropriate or illegal. And you have to be confronted \nby usually a series of TSA officers. I just want to remind us all that \nthey are there to protect us. That is their job, to make sure the \nplanes we get on, whether they are going 200, 300, 400 miles or 2,000 \nor 3,000 miles to go from one side of our country to the other side or \none side of the world to the other side--the job of the TSA officers is \nto protect us. They have a very tough job, and there is actually a \ntension in the job that exists because of the work they do.\n  On the one hand, every day there are tens of thousands of travelers, \nmaybe hundreds of thousands of travelers, pulsing through our airports, \ntrying to get from a terminal, from a gate, onto a plane in time to \ncatch their flights. In some cases, they have had to recheck their \nbags. They have had to go through maybe unloading their suitcases and \nshowing that what they have in their suitcases is not inappropriate or \nillegal. There is a rush to get through to try to catch their flights. \nTSA is there. In some cases, they slow down that traffic, that flow, \nand they slow down that flow of traffic in order to make sure that what \nall of us passengers every day are carrying in our suitcases or \nbriefcases or purses or on our bodies is not inappropriate and is not \nillegal. They do it to protect all of us. Sometimes the TSA folks get a \nlittle bit frazzled. I would say we would, too, if we had to do the \nwork they do.\n  A lot of times, when I fly commercial and when I go through the \ncheck-in, after they check my ID or whatever, I take it upon myself to \nsay to the TSA officers--I tell them who I am, that I am a senior \nDemocrat on the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs, and I thank them for what they do. I say: We value your work \nand we appreciate it, and I just wanted you to know that. I can't tell \nyou how many times a TSA officer has said to me: Nobody has ever \nthanked me before. Nobody has ever thanked me before.\n  Sometimes we can't pay people enough for the work they do, and they \nwork hard for their money.\n  I would ask others, when you see somebody, especially TSA officers \nwho go out of their way in spite of all of the hustle and bustle and \npressure on them--they manage to still be polite, courteous, and \nhelpful--thank them. It might be the first time. You may become the \nfirst person who has ever said ``thank you'' to them.\n  At the end of the day, one of the things that means a lot to me is \nwhenever people thank me for my service to our country, whether it was \nin uniform or as Governor, Senator, or here today. So I urge you to do \nthat. When I do that, it makes me feel better and it makes them feel \nbetter too.\n  Mr. President, I am looking around the Senate Chamber, looking for \nDemocrats or Republicans who are rushing to get to the podium to say \nsomething. I don't see anybody rushing.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/senate-section/article/S2544-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2544-S2545]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  COMMEMORATING THE BUILDING OF THE SSN 791 SUBMARINE ``USS DELAWARE''\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, just a short note. I think it is \nimportant, especially for those who are privileged to live in the First \nState--the first State to ratify the Constitution.\n  Delaware ratified the Constitution on December 7, 1787, before any \nother State did so. For 1 week, Delaware was the entire United States \nof America, and then we opened it up to Pennsylvania, Maryland, New \nJersey, Louisiana, and others. It turned out pretty well. It was a \ngreat week.\n  I think that because our State is remarkable in starting the whole \ncountry, we have a lot of ships--submarines or aircraft carriers--named \nafter it. It has been decades since there has been any naval vessel \nnamed after the First State.\n  A couple of years ago, Dr. Jill Biden, the wife of the Vice \nPresident, and I joined Navy Secretary Ray Mabus to announce that work \nwould begin in a few years from that point--work would begin building a \nfast attack nuclear submarine. It would be called the USS Delaware, and \nthe number of the ship would be SSN 791.\n  This Saturday in Newport News, VA, Dr. Jill Biden, the wife of the \nVice President, who is officially the sponsor of the submarine, will be \nthere to join Secretary Ray Mabus. I will have the good fortune of \njoining them for the keeling, which is the first step in the \nconstruction of a brandnew vessel, the USS Delaware, SSN 791.\n  These submarines are not built in a day. This is a project that will \ntake a couple of years, but a very good thing for our State and I hope \nfor our country is about to begin; that is, the adventure of building a \nsubmarine that will help defend our country, help keep the sea lanes \nopen, and better ensure that we remain a nation that is brave and free.\n  I mentioned earlier in my brief remarks that I spent some years of my \nlife in the Navy--5 years in a hot war in Southeast Asia as a P-3 \naircraft mission commander, and toward the end of those 5 years as a P-\n3 aircraft mission commander I was a naval flight officer. Then, for \nanother 18 years, I was a P-3 aircraft mission commander in the \nReserves, chasing Soviet subs all over the world.\n  We would train with American submarines, and we would track fast \nattack boats. It is a fast attack boat that will be built and named \nafter Delaware. We would track ballistic missile submarines, American \nsubmarines. We would also track those from other\n\n[[Page S2545]]\n\ncountries, especially those from the Soviet Union. It wasn't that hard \nto find them, to track them, to know the location of Soviet nuclear \nsubmarines that were on deployment. They weren't easy to find, to \nlocate and track, but they were a whole lot easier than tracking our \nown. ``Run Silent, Run Deep,'' and that is exactly what our submarines \ndid and still do. We have the best submarine force in the world. I am \nvery proud of all of them, and they are delighted to be joined by SSN \n791 in a couple of years, and we get to kick it off in 2 days in \nNewport News, VA.\n  I wish everybody a good recess. The pages are going to be in charge \nuntil we get back in about 8 or 9 days, and I am sure they will do a \ngood job. Thank you so much.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/senate-section/article/S2545-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2545]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   100TH ANNIVERSARY OF SINCLAIR OIL\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a well-\nrespected American company: the Sinclair Oil Corporation. This May \nmarks 100 years since Harry Ford Sinclair founded the corporation after \npurchasing petroleum assets from 11 smaller companies. In its \ncentennial year, Sinclair Oil continues to thrive as one of the oldest \ncontinuously operated brands in the petroleum business and the seventh \nlargest fuel company in the United States. Today I wish to congratulate \nthe company on its 100th anniversary.\n  Most people know Sinclair Oil for its iconic green Apatosaurus, but \nbehind the character is a company fueled by two real American legends: \nHarry Ford Sinclair and Earl Holding.\n  Harry Ford Sinclair experienced his fair share of setbacks before \nbecoming a successful businessman. In fact, Sinclair was just 25 years \nold when a speculative investment went south, and he lost his father's \ndrugstore, but the bad investment turned out to be a blessing in \ndisguise for the brash and brilliant young man, who was never cut out \nfor the quiet, meticulous life of a druggist in the first place.\n  After losing his family's drugstore, Sinclair found work selling \nlumber for oil derricks. Soon, he was buying and selling small oil \nleases on the side, and his ``side'' business did well enough to \nattract investors. Sinclair's successes snowballed as he rolled small \nprofits into bigger ventures, eventually leading to a payout in \nOklahoma's Glenn Pool oil field that made him a millionaire by age 30. \nIn 1916, he founded the Sinclair Oil and Refining Corporation. Three \nyears later, the company had grown to four times its original size.\n  In the 1920s, Sinclair introduced America to the first modern service \nstations. These early retail gasoline outlets offered oil changes, \nminor mechanical repairs, and, for the first time, public restrooms \nthat motorists could use while an attendant pumped gas into their \nvehicles. The convenient amenities of these service stations enabled \nthe creation of a uniquely American experience: the long road trip.\n  Sinclair's success continued through tough times. During the Great \nDepression, the company bought up dying competitors, saving hundreds of \nAmerican jobs. And during World War II, Sinclair supported the Allies \nwith high-octane fuel, tankers, and more.\n  In 1948, Harry Ford Sinclair officially retired, but 28 years later, \nEarl Holding, another American business icon, acquired the company, \nleading Sinclair Oil into a new era of prosperity and growth. Earl had \ngrown up with nothing during the Great Depression, but like Harry \nSinclair, he turned a willingness to work into success. Before \npurchasing Sinclair Oil, Earl and his wife, Carol, built the Little \nAmerica chain of hotels and gas stations. In fact, the Little America \nchain became Sinclair's biggest customer before the Holdings bought the \noil company.\n  Earl was well known for his brilliance, but he was equally regarded \nfor his steadiness and warmth. These personal qualities enabled him to \nmake Harry Sinclair's empire somehow feel like a mom-and-pop business. \nNo task at the company was beneath Earl, whether it was serving coffee \nor digging ditches. He even hosted annual conferences and parties so he \ncould personally meet partners and employees from around the country.\n  Today Sinclair Oil continues to succeed under the leadership of CEO \nRoss Matthews. Family values hold the company together, while \ninnovation drives it forward. As the company celebrates its centennial, \nthe spirit created by Harry Sinclair and Earl Holding lives on, as does \nDino, the familiar green dinosaur that is the beloved mascot of \nSinclair Oil.\n  In closing, I would like to offer just a few words in memory of the \ncompany's late CEO, Earl Holding. I knew Earl personally and considered \nhim a dear friend. He inspired his employees through genuine kindness \nand humble leadership. Earl was a master of commerce, but more \nimportantly, he was a good and honorable man of uncompromising \ncharacter and integrity. Although Earl left us only 3 years ago, his \nlegacy is alive and well. Today I wish his beautiful wife and children \nthe very best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/senate-section/article/S2545-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2545-S2546]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING WARD CORRELL\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a good friend \nand a distinguished Kentuckian who has sadly passed away after a \nresoundingly successful life and career of many decades. Ward Correll, \na native Kentuckian renowned across the Commonwealth, died on April 21 \nof this year. He was 88 years old.\n  My wife, Elaine, and I are deeply saddened by Ward's death. Ward rose \nfrom humble beginnings to great business success, and he also \ngenerously and charitably shared the fruits of his success with others \nin his hometown of Somerset and throughout Kentucky. Many have \nbenefitted from his philanthropy, and he will be terribly missed.\n  Ward was a household name in Kentucky. A self-made man, he created a \nbusiness empire, including an oil distributorship and many property, \nbusiness, and financial holdings. He was a major stockholder in First \nSouthern National Bank.\n  Ward believed strongly in giving back to the community that he loved \nso much. He was a financial benefactor to dozens of charities, \nchurches, sports teams, and other organizations, including Somerset \nChristian School--which honors his family's contribution with a \nmonument on the school campus--and the University of the Cumberlands, \nwhere the science complex is named in his and his late wife's honor. \nThe Ward Correll Sports Complex, a popular destination in Somerset, is \nthanks to his efforts.\n  For all his success in life, Ward graduated high school with less \nthan $3 in his pocket. He hitchhiked to Detroit, where he worked odd \njobs. After serving his country in the U.S. Army in an intelligence \nunit during the Korean war, he returned home to Somerset and married \nhis wife, Regina.\n  Ward and Regina's first business was selling bananas. From that, he \nbuilt himself into the titan of business and philanthropy whom we mourn \ntoday.\n  Ward received the 2002 Kentuckian Award from the A.B. Chandler \nFoundation. He was named Outstanding Philanthropist by the Association \nof Fundraising Professionals Bluegrass Chapter in 2003. In that same \nyear, he received the Business of the Year Award as an Entrepreneurial \nSuccess from the Somerset-Pulaski County Chamber of Commerce. And he \nreceived the Somerset-Pulaski County Distinguished Community Service \nAward in 2014.\n  The people of Pulaski County were accustomed to seeing full-page ads \nin the local paper bought by Ward Correll, each one sharing some bit of \nwisdom or personal philosophy from Ward that he wished to pass on to \nothers. He ended each ad with the signature line, ``Hooray, cheers! \nWard Correll.''\n  I want to send my deepest condolences and prayers to Ward's family at \ntheir time of loss. Now is the time to wish one final hooray and cheers \nto the man who leaves behind a powerful legacy. Kentucky honors Ward \nCorrell for his life and his lifetime of service, and we mourn his \npassing.\n  The Lexington Herald-Leader published an article detailing Ward \nCorrell's life and career. I ask unanimous consent that the article be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S2546]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Lexington Herald-Leader, Apr. 23, 2016]\n\nSomerset Businessman Ward Correll, Known for Philanthropy, Dead at Age \n                                   88\n\n                            (By Bill Estep)\n\n       Somerset businessman Ward F.

The \norganization is working to bring law and civic education back into \nNevada's classrooms by providing programs that give students of all \nages the opportunity to learn about our judicial system. Project Real \ntakes pride in ensuring that students are positive contributors to the \ncommunities in which they reside.\n  Since its inception, the organization has also been a strong \nsupporter of academic programs that allow children to gain a better \nunderstanding of our judicial system.

Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I share the \nnews that Judge Laura Cha-Yu Liu passed away last week. A longtime \nresident of Chicago, Judge Liu was only 49 years old. Although her time \nwith us was far too short, her accomplishments were many. Judge Liu \nbroke barriers. She was the first Chinese American woman to become \njudge in Illinois, the first Chinese American elected to public office \nin Cook County. And in 2014, Judge Liu became the first Asian American \nto serve on the Illinois appellate court.\n  Her story is the story of the American dream. Born in Carbondale, IL, \nher parents were immigrants fleeing a dire political situation and the \nterrors of war. They came to this country as foreign exchange students \nin the hopes of providing a better life for their children. Liu's first \nlanguage was Mandarin, and she started school speaking very little \nEnglish. She overcame the language barrier and graduated as her high \nschool's valedictorian. In 1987, she received a bachelor's degree from \nYoungstown State University and a law degree from the University of \nCincinnati in 1991.\n  As the daughter of immigrants, Judge Liu took extraordinary pride in \nher work on the Illinois Supreme Court's Access to Justice program, \naimed at making the system more accessible to immigrants and non-\nEnglish speakers. She helped draft requirements that courts provide \nqualified interpreters for parties and witnesses. Throughout her \ncareer, Judge Liu was a staunch defender of individuals' rights, \nespecially the most vulnerable in our community. It wasn't uncommon for \nJudge Liu to delay court proceedings when people struggled to \nunderstand, saying: ``We're going to wait for an interpreter.'' And no \none did more to ensure that language barriers would not stand in the \nway of justice for all at Daley Center.\n  Five years ago, Judge Liu was diagnosed with breast cancer, but that \ndidn't slow her down. She continued working, running for election in \n2012\n\n[[Page S2547]]\n\nand, 2 years later, winning her appointment to the appellate court. She \nnever complained; she just kept going. During chemotherapy, she said, \n``I put on my wig, put on my eyebrows, lots of blush, happy face, get \nout of bed and went to work.'' That is courage.\n  Judge Liu was the recipient of numerous honors and awards. Here are \njust a few: the Asian Pacific American Community Service Award; the \nChinese American Bar Association of Greater Chicago's Sandra Otaka \nDistinguished Judicial Service Award; Illinois' Judges Foundation's \n``the Leader Who Shares Experience Leaves a Legacy of Success'' Award; \nAsian American Bar Association's 2014 Vanguard Award for her work to \nmake ``the law and legal profession more accessible to and reflective \nof the community at large''; Illinois Secretary of State's \nDistinguished Leadership Award--and the honors go on and on. Judge Liu \nwas also a member of the Illinois Judges Association, Chicago Bar \nAssociation, Illinois State Bar Association, Asian American Bar \nAssociation of Greater Chicago, and Lesbian and Gay Bar Association of \nChicago.\n  She was an extraordinarily accomplished professional, but Judge Liu's \nproudest accomplishment was being a mother to her 7-year-old daughter, \nSophie, and a wife to the love of her life, Michael Kasper. Despite her \nbusy schedule, she always put family first. She made time to teach \nSophie Mandarin and the piano. She even took Sophie to Paris, in the \nmidst of dealing with an aggressive chemotherapy regimen. But she \nsimply said, ``I'll sleep it off on the plane.'' And she did. She also \ncould frequently be found on the sidelines of Sophie's soccer matches \ncheering her on.\n  Judge Liu was a force of nature. She authored nearly 150 judicial \nopinions in her 2 years on the Illinois appellate court. In her final \ndays, while working from home, Judge Liu filed her final opinion before \nshe passed. What commitment and what an inspiration. To the very end, \nJudge Liu understood that these issues and her opinions affected \npeople's lives, and cancer wasn't going to keep her from doing her job.\n  She once said, ``I wanted to fit in more than I wanted to be a \ntrailblazer. I didn't want to be an Asian-American on the rise.'' Well, \nshe didn't get that wish. In fact, she accomplished just the opposite. \nHer career was groundbreaking and she became a role model for countless \nChinese American kids--and an inspiration to the rest of us--especially \nher friends and family. Judge Liu will be sorely missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/senate-section/article/S2547-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2547-S2548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             SMALL BUSINESS WEEK AND VERMONT ENTREPRENEURS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, each year, the Small Business \nAdministration sets aside the first week of May to acknowledge small \nbusinesses that are doing extraordinary work and recognizes them during \nSmall Business Week. In March, the SBA announced the slate of 2016 \nVermont small business award winners, which included three tremendous \nbusinesses from Lamoille County. The award winners included the Small \nBusiness Person of the Year, Tom Stearns of High Mowing Seeds; Woman-\nOwned Business of the Year, Debbie Burritt of Sweet Crunch Bakeshop & \nCatering; and Young Entrepreneur of the Year, Caleb Magoon, of Power \nPlay Sports.\n  In Vermont, we place a high value on small businesses. They make up \nthe backbone of our economy and the heart and soul of our communities. \nI am incredibly proud of the three Lamoille County businesses being \nrecognized both because of their hard work and entrepreneurial spirit, \nbut also because they represent a true cross section of the Vermont \neconomy.\n  Vermonters share an inherent bond with our State's natural resources. \nOur State prides itself on our strong agricultural history and the \nrenaissance we are seeing in diversified agriculture and value added \nfood production. For many farmers, this connection starts with their \nsoil and the seeds they plant in the ground. What started as a hobby \nfor Tom Stearns 20 years ago has grown into a dynamic business that is \none of the top organic seed companies in the country, now supplying \nthose farmers and home gardeners across the country with the seeds that \nbecome the food we feed our families. Part of what sets Vermont \nbusinesses apart is their ability to innovate and help define or create \nnew markets. High Mowing has done just this in the seed market--by \nensuring that all of their 700 varieties of seeds are both organic and \nGMO-free--and are among the gold standard in the market. Now they are \nbranching out to experiment with new varieties that will bring new \nspecialty vegetables, herbs, and flowers to the market.\n  When imagining a startup business, it is common to think of someone \nworking out of their garage. Debbie Burritt of Sweet Crunch Bakeshop & \nCatering is precisely one of those entrepreneurs. Debbie founded her \nbusiness in 2001 in her home garage, and since then, her products have \nreceived great acclaim and attention. Sweet Crunch baked goods are made \nfrom scratch, with no preservatives. It comes as no surprise to this \nVermonter that their maple cookies are one of their best selling \nproducts. In fact, Sweet Crunch's maple cookies were featured on the \nFood Network, and Sweet Crunch products can be found in locations \nacross New England and, in fact, the country. I will take a moment of \npersonal pride to note that Debbie's delicious products will be a \nfeatured part of the annual Taste of Vermont celebration happening in \nWashington in a few weeks.\n  The mountains and valleys that played such a significant role in \ndetermining the settlement of Vermont continue to be a significant \nforce in the lives of Vermonters. These resources attract skiers, \nriders, bikers, paddlers, and many other adventurers to our State both \nto live and to visit. Naturally all of these outdoor enthusiasts need \nsome place to be outfitted. Power Play Sports has been a staple of the \nlocal sporting goods scene for more than 20 years, but was recently \npurchased by Caleb Magoon. Caleb first worked at Power Play as a \nteenager and returned to manage the store after living in Boston for a \nnumber of years. He has demonstrated a great entrepreneurial vision, \nconsolidating his other business under one roof and opening a new store \nin Waterbury, VT. This type of passion and growth are qualities we want \nto encourage in Vermont and deserve recognition.\n  I want to congratulate these three businesses and all the Vermont \nbusinesses who were recognized by the SBA for a job well done. I look \nforward to their future successes.

By 2001, his business had \n     grown to the point where Stearns began contracting with other \n     local farms to grow his seeds, in addition to continuing to \n     produce on High Mowing's 5 acres.\n       High Mowing was the first organic company to guarantee all \n     its seeds are not genetically modified, and 20 years later, \n     his company is one of the top organic seed companies in the \n     U.S., with more than 60 employees.\n       ``It is an honor to accept this award on behalf of all the \n     work done by our team for the last 20 years since this hobby \n     was born,'' Stearns said. ``It has been a joy to see it grow \n     and to know that we are just getting started. I get to do \n     what I love every day and the work is diverse, challenging \n     and creative.\n\n[[Page S2548]]\n\n       ``There is nothing more rewarding than bringing an idea to \n     life in a way that serves health in the world, and it means a \n     lot to me to have the work of our team recognized in this \n     way.''\n\n\n                           Young entrepreneur\n\n       In Morrisville, the next town over, a very different \n     business also won an award from the Small Business \n     Administration.\n       Caleb Magoon, 32, owner of PowerPlay Sports in Morrisville, \n     was named 2015 young entrepreneur of the year.\n       The annual award is presented to business owners under 35 \n     who have had success in sales, profits, increasing jobs, \n     having innovative business methods and demonstrating \n     entrepreneurial potential necessary for economic growth.\n       PowerPlay Sports was founded in 1995 by John Connell and \n     Rob Maynard. After bouncing around several downtown \n     locations, the store eventually landed at 35 Portland St.\n       Magoon began working at the store at 17. After graduating \n     from Boston University, where he studied theater design, \n     Magoon and a few friends established a theater company in \n     Boston, produced shows, and won the Elliot Norton Awards for \n     best production three years in a row.\n       However, as a native of Hyde Park, who grew up hiking, \n     biking and skiing in the Green Mountains, his passion for \n     sports led him back to Vermont in 2010. He managed PowerPlay \n     for a year, then bought the business from Maynard.\n       Magoon said working in theater helped him learn how to run \n     a business. He and his friends each worked on different \n     aspects within their theater company, including advertising, \n     producing and financing, and learned from each other.\n       ``If you can do that, business is easy. We learned to be \n     business people,'' Magoon said.\n       Last year, Magoon moved his embroidery and screen-printing \n     business--which was in an adjacent building--into the same \n     location as his sports gear. He also opened a new store, \n     Waterbury Sports, with two business partners in Waterbury.\n\n\n                          Woman-owned business\n\n       A Hyde Park business also received an award from the Small \n     Business Administration.\n       Chef Debbie Burritt, owner and founder of Sweet Crunch \n     Bakery and Catering Co., was selected as the Woman-Owned \n     Business of the Year.\n       The bakeshop portion of the company provides desserts and \n     wedding cakes to restaurants, resorts and the public. For \n     catering, the company's goal is making every event unique and \n     unforgettable.\n       Burritt has a staff to assist with all the details of event \n     planning, and will customize menus to meet the individual \n     needs of clients.\n       Burritt completed her culinary degree at Newbury College in \n     Brookline, Mass., in 1987, and worked in Boston and Virginia \n     before moving back to her native state, Vermont. After \n     working at Stoweflake Resort and Trapp Family Lodge, both in \n     Stowe, Burritt decided to venture out on her own in 2001.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/senate-section/article/S2548-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2548-S2549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING BORDER AIR LTD.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, you don't have to look too far in Vermont \nto find any number of unique businesses. One such business is Border \nAir Ltd., led by its owner Cliff Coy. Cliff is the airport manager and \nunofficial ``aviation ambassador'' at the Franklin County State Airport \nin Swanton, VT. He also owns and runs Border Air Ltd., a maintenance \nand restoration company. He purchased Border Air Ltd. in 2007 from his \nfather, George, who founded the company in 1989. Border Air specializes \nin restoring Soviet-era aircraft and is one of only five companies in \nthe country with the qualifications to sell, maintain, and inspect \nthem.\n  In addition to providing many services for the aviation enthusiasts \nwho call Franklin County home, Border Air imports and exports planes to \nand from former Soviet nations, a practice that began after the senior \nMr. Coy took a trip to Lithuania in 1989. George Coy heard of an \nAntonov An-2, the largest single-engine biplane ever built, which had \njust been restored and was listed for sale. In spite of a major \nmalfunction while crossing the Black Sea with the An-2, the Coys were \nhooked on the idea of importing similar aircraft and selling them to \nAmerican pilots.\n  Since then, over 300 planes have passed through Border Air's hangars, \nsome purchased by customers as far as Chicago. Through their work with \npilots and aviation enthusiasts across the world, the Coy family has \nbrought business to Swanton and helps to keep citizens safe by \ninspecting planes once a year to ensure they are up to Federal Aviation \nAdministration safety codes. Though safety is most important, Cliff Coy \nalso aims to inspire a love of flying in children and adults across the \ncountry by bringing students from nearby Missiquoi Valley Union High \nSchool to the airport to watch air show practices or speaking with \nanyone interested in planes from flying to skydiving.\n  The Coys represent an entrepreneurial spirit that is at the heart of \nVermont. In Cliff Coy, we see a true commitment to and leadership with \nthe community.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the April 14, 2016, article from Seven \nDays entitled ``Border Air in Swanton Keeps Imported Planes Alive,'' \nwhich chronicles the Coys' history with Border Air Ltd., be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From Seven Days, Apr. 14, 2016]\n\n           Border Air in Swanton Keeps Imported Planes Alive\n\n                            (By Ken Picard)\n\n       A stiff snow squall swirls around the main building at \n     Franklin County State Airport in Swanton as a large, twin-\n     engine turboprop prepares to roll out of the hangar. Airport \n     manager Cliff Coy watches silently as the King Air B200 revs \n     its engines with a high-pitched whine and slowly inches its \n     way onto the tarmac.\n       The plane's wingtips are upturned for improved aerodynamics \n     and fuel efficiency. It's just a fringe benefit that the \n     design also allows the plane to squeeze through the hangar \n     door.\n       ``That's a 58-foot wingspan going through a 60-foot \n     opening,'' Coy notes with a bemused smile. Once the wings \n     clear the sides, he flashes a quick thumbs-up to his \n     mechanic, Dan Marcotte, who's directing the pilot from the \n     tarmac.\n       Unlike busy commercial hubs, such as Burlington \n     International Airport, Franklin County State Airport doesn't \n     have its own air traffic control tower. Many planes that use \n     this runway lack radios, lights or onboard electrical \n     systems.\n       The 46-year-old Coy wears many hats at this small, state-\n     owned airstrip that's just a hop from the Canadian border. \n     Besides managing the airport, he's the owner of Border Air \n     Ltd., which was founded by his father, George Coy. As an FBO, \n     or fixed-base operator, Border Air performs various functions \n     for the flying public: fueling, inspection, maintenance, \n     flight training, and providing hangar and tie-down space for \n     parking aircraft. Coy calls its headquarters ``a cross \n     between a boat launch and a state park--and I'm the guy \n     wearing the green shirt and the hat.''\n       Beyond Coy's official duties, he's the airport's unofficial \n     ``aviation ambassador,'' which involves more than just \n     greeting white-knuckled travelers when they land safely in \n     inclement weather. Coy is Franklin County's go-to guy for \n     anyone who's interested in learning more about airplanes, \n     whether that means fixing them, flying them, building them or \n     jumping out of them with parachutes.\n       And, with fuel prices at historic lows, interest in \n     aviation is soaring. That's not readily apparent on the \n     morning I visit: Aside from the departing turboprop, about \n     the only thing moving on the airfield is a semierect orange \n     wind sock. But, according to Coy, KFSO--the airport's Federal \n     Aviation Administration abbreviation--is usually more active.\n       ``This is the busiest airport in Vermont for general \n     aviation,'' he says, referring to noncommercial and \n     nonmilitary air traffic. ``Come out here in six weeks on a \n     Saturday, and this place will be humming with airplanes.''\n       Those planes aren't just local flyers. In recent years, Coy \n     has carved out a unique niche for himself in the wider world \n     of aviation: He imports and exports planes to and from Russia \n     and other former Soviet-bloc countries. One of only five \n     companies in the country with the expertise to sell, service \n     and inspect Soviet-era planes, Border Air also maintains, \n     repairs and modifies them--an unusual specialty that Coy fell \n     into almost by accident.\n       Coy got his degree in mechanical engineering from Vermont \n     Technical College and studied computer science and physics at \n     the University of New Mexico. Then, as he puts it, he faced \n     an important life choice: ``Am I going to spend the rest of \n     my life in front of a computer screen, under bad fluorescent \n     lighting? Or am I going to solve problems out in the field \n     and get dirty?''\n       Coy began answering that question in 1988. That year, his \n     uncle Bob, who was working on a sister-city exchange program, \n     offered Coy a chance to travel to the Soviet Union after an \n     injury forced a student in the program to drop out at the \n     last minute.\n       Coy jumped at the opportunity--and not merely to see the \n     Soviet Union as it began to open up to the West. Coy's \n     father, George, himself a pilot and flight mechanic, was \n     keenly interested in a Russian-built aircraft called the \n     Antonov An-2. The 1,000-horsepower, 12-passenger plane is the \n     world's largest single-engine biplane ever built. As Coy \n     recalls, his father ``became infatuated with it and \n     absolutely had to have one.''\n       While that trip offered the chance to see an An-2 \n     firsthand, the Coys wouldn't get their hands on one until \n     1989, when George Coy learned that a company in Lithuania had \n     a freshly overhauled An-2 for sale. As the Soviet Union \n     neared its collapse, the Eastern Bloc countries were becoming \n     like the Wild West, Cliff Coy recalls, with everything being \n     sold off at bargain-basement prices.\n\n[[Page S2549]]\n\n     ``So he strapped a pile of cash to a belt and flew out to \n     Lithuania to go look at an airplane,'' says Cliff.\n       Since George didn't speak Lithuanian, and all the \n     instrumentation was in Russian, the sellers taught him how to \n     fly the plane. Convinced it was worth the investment, the \n     Coys hired a Russian pilot and a farmer from Shelburne to \n     help fly the An-2 back to Vermont.\n       Like many aviation adventures, Cliff Coy says, theirs began \n     with a mechanical malfunction: The plane lost all of its oil \n     above the clouds during a night crossing of the North Sea.* \n     As he recalls, ``The Russian pilot knew very few words of \n     English, and two of them were `Very bad!' ''\n       The An-2 managed to run for another half hour without oil \n     before landing safely. Despite the mishap, the trip stoked \n     the Coys' interest in importing more Russian and Eastern \n     European planes--such as two aerobatic trainer planes called \n     Yakovlev Yak-52s that they'd seen in Lithuania. Sensing a \n     business opportunity, the Coys began importing Russian and \n     Eastern Bloc planes to the U.S. for American buyers.\n       Since 1989, Border Air has imported more than 300 such \n     aircraft, including a Yak-55, which is currently under repair \n     in the hangar in Swanton. With only about 250 Yak-52s still \n     actively flying in the United States, Coy has loyal clients \n     who fly to Swanton from as far west as Chicago to get \n     their planes serviced.\n       What's the plane's appeal? For one thing, Coy points out, \n     Yak-52s closely resemble World War II fighter planes. And, \n     given the Soviets' efficient engineering, he adds, ``You're \n     basically able to maintain it out in a farmer's field with a \n     flathead screwdriver and a wrench. So they're incredibly \n     rugged and inexpensive.''\n       The Coys pretty much stopped importing Russian aircraft in \n     2005, when the dollar-to-Euro exchange rate made them \n     prohibitively expensive. The sale price of the Yak-52, for \n     example, jumped from $120,000 to $380,000.\n       In 2007, Coy bought Border Air from his father. These days, \n     much of his business has reversed direction--it involves \n     moving planes and pilots from the U.S. to Russia instead of \n     vice versa.\n       In the Soviet era, the only Russians who flew planes were \n     military pilots; when the country opened up civil aviation, \n     many Russians became interested in flying American aircraft. \n     Until the Russian ruble crashed last year, Border Air was \n     exporting about two containers of American-made planes to \n     Russia every three months.\n       Recent changes overseas have brought a whole new crop of \n     flyers to Swanton. In 2011, a wave of bad aviation accidents \n     in Russia killed scores of people. Putting the blame on \n     pilots who had obtained their licenses fraudulently, the \n     Russian government closed flight schools across the country.\n       The virtual shutdown of civil aviation in Russia could have \n     sent Coy's business into a tailspin. But then Russians began \n     coming to the United States--including the flight school in \n     Swanton--to obtain pilot's licenses. Apparently placing \n     greater trust in American flight schools than in its own, the \n     Russian government converts U.S. pilots' licenses into \n     Russian ones, Coy says.\n       Just as Coy is explaining the process, two Russian men with \n     crew cuts and black coats pass en route to a small trainer \n     plane to begin their flight lessons. According to Coy, \n     they're former Russian fighter pilots who are logging flight \n     time and learning to fly in U.S. airspace. ``There's a bit of \n     a mind shift when you go from flying something at 300 miles \n     per hour to flying something at 60 miles per hour,'' he says.\n       Of course, not all of Coy's work involves Russians and \n     Russian planes. As an FAA-licensed inspector, he ensures that \n     the aircraft he encounters are flightworthy. By law, every \n     aircraft, from a commercial Boeing 777 to the one-seat \n     Ultralight hanging from the hangar rafters, must be inspected \n     annually.\n       ``I've seen things where you wonder how these people even \n     made it here alive,'' Coy says. ``Unbelievably scary stuff.''\n       For example, he recalls encountering a pilot who reported \n     that his plane was flying funny When Coy checked it out, he \n     noticed that the bottom of the fuselage was blue--from the \n     dye used to identify aircraft fuel. Coy instantly spotted the \n     problem: The fuel line wasn't hooked up. When he went to \n     adjust the propeller control, it broke off in his hand. Next, \n     he discovered that the starboard engine wasn't bolted onto \n     the frame and the landing gear wasn't installed correctly. \n     The result: a 60-page report to the FAA.\n       Getting people passionate and up in the air is Coy's \n     mission. And, notwithstanding the back issues of Cigar \n     Aficionado in the airport waiting room, he says he meets a \n     diverse cross-section of people who are aviation enthusiasts.\n       Granted, it's not a cheap hobby: The costs of purchasing \n     and maintaining airplanes may seem daunting enough to \n     dissuade anyone without a seven-figure trust fund. But, Coy \n     points out, most people who fly these days rent their planes. \n     (Coy himself doesn't own one.) And enthusiasts who decide to \n     take the next step can buy a plane for as little as $15,000, \n     on par with the price of a boat.\n       Coy does a lot of outreach to local schools, hoping to get \n     the next generation interested in flying. Sometimes that \n     means showing the kids his various ``museum pieces''--the \n     historic aircraft parked in various hangars on the airfield. \n     Or he'll invite students from nearby Missisquoi Valley Union \n     High School to watch his mechanic, Marcotte, practice his \n     air-show maneuvers during his lunch hour. (Burlingtonians \n     know Marcotte as the pilot who flies acrobatic stunts over \n     the waterfront before the annual July 3 fireworks show.)\n        ``Look, if you have any interest in flying, we'll take you \n     for a ride in an airplane,'' Coy says. ``That's what we do, \n     because we want to get people interested in flying.''\n       Correction, April 14, 2016: An earlier version of this \n     story misreported Coy's age--it is 46. The body of water over \n     which Coy's plane experienced engine trouble was the North \n     Sea, not the Black Sea. Additionally, aviation enthusiasts \n     can buy a plane for $15,000, not the higher number originally \n     reported.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/senate-section/article/S2549-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n Mr. BOOKER.

Mr. President, today I wish to speak about the urgent \nneed for Congress to approve emergency funds to fight the Zika virus.\n  The Zika virus is a rapidly growing public health threat, and the \nstakes for women are particularly high. The virus is carried by two \nspecies of mosquito. They are found in 40 States in this country.\n  There have been 388 travel-related cases in the United States--\nmeaning an individual was infected during a trip to Latin America, \nSouth America, or the Caribbean, where the virus is widespread. There \nhave not yet been any reported cases of local transmission in the \ncontinental United States, although more than 500 cases have been \nreported in Puerto Rico. It is a matter of when, not if, that happens--\nparticularly as we approach the summer season when mosquitos are most \nactive.\n  Scientists are still working to understand the effects of the Zika \nvirus, but we do know that Zika causes severe, brain-related birth \ndefects in babies when women are infected during pregnancy.\n  Microcephaly, one of the most serious effects of Zika, causes babies' \nheads to be much smaller than normal. In severe cases, you will also \nsee seizures, developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, feeding \nproblems, hearing loss, and vision problems.\n  The CDC continues to research the virus, and it could be several \nyears before the full-range of health effects is known.\n  One of the most concerning gaps in our scientific knowledge is how \nthe disease is transmitted from person to person. The most common way \npeople contract the disease is through mosquito bites, but there have \nbeen documented cases of the virus being spread from men to women \nthrough sexual contact.\n  Zika symptoms are mild--fever, rash, and joint pain--meaning that \nmany people may become infected and spread with disease without knowing \nthey have it. Unless we act now, we could end up with a significant \nnumber of Zika carriers who don't know they are infected.\n  The administration has asked Congress for $1.9 billion in emergency \nfunding to stop the spread of the Zika virus. I fully support this \nfunding request. The Federal Government needs this money for a number \nof reasons, including controlling mosquito populations, researching the \nvirus, educating the public, and developing a vaccine.\n  As the weather warms, Zika will spread faster, particularly in States \nwith persistent mosquito issues. We simply can't ignore public health \nthreats of this magnitude, hoping they will go away.\n  In closing, Congress cannot afford to delay. I strongly urge the \nSenate to approve the administration's sensible request to fight this \ngrowing public health threat.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/senate-section/article/S2549-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2549-S2550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL PRESCRIPTION DRUG TAKE BACK DAY\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this Saturday, April 30, from 10 a.m. to \n2 p.m., the Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA, is coordinating the \nlatest National Prescription Drug Take\n\n[[Page S2550]]\n\nBack Day. Take back days are nationwide efforts to remove old or unused \nprescription drugs from medicine cabinets so they don't fall into the \nwrong hands and lead to substance abuse and addiction. I am proud to \nhave helped encourage take back days a few years ago by working with \nSenators Klobuchar, Cornyn, and Brown to pass the Secure and \nResponsible Drug Disposal Act.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, health \ncare providers wrote almost a quarter of a billion opioid prescriptions \nin 2013, enough for every American adult to have his or her own bottle \nof pills. The accumulation of these medicines in our homes creates a \npublic health risk, since they can be accidentally ingested, abused, \nstolen, and passed on to others. According to the 2014 National Survey \non Drug Use and Health, 6.5 million Americans abused controlled \nprescription drugs that year. According to that same study, a majority \nof abused prescription drugs are obtained from family and friends, \nincluding from the home medicine cabinet.\n  Obviously, the consequences of this prescription drug abuse can be \ndangerous and even deadly. Prescription drug abuse may lead to abuse of \nother drugs like heroin, which is cheaper and more readily available. \nIn 2014, more than 47,000 drug overdose deaths occurred in the United \nStates, an alltime high. Incredibly, more than half of those deaths \ninvolved prescription opioids or heroin.\n  So raising public awareness about the dangers of abuse and reducing \nthe availability of unused medications are important components of \npreventing prescription drug abuse and addiction. The take back day \ninitiative is a great way to make progress on both fronts.\n  Beginning in September 2010, the DEA has coordinated these days twice \na year, with fantastic results. At the most recent event last \nSeptember, Americans turned in 350 tons of prescription drugs at more \nthan 5,000 sites operated by the DEA and more than 3,800 of its State \nand local law enforcement partners. Overall, in its 10 previous take \nback events, DEA and its partners have taken in more than 2,750 tons of \npills. It is not an exaggeration to say that take back events have \nprobably saved lives.\n  Now, for some unexplained reason, the Obama administration decided to \ndiscontinue this program a few years ago, but in May 2015, I was a \nmember of a bipartisan group of Senators that wrote to the Department \nof Justice, urging that it be reinstated. A few months later, DEA \nActing Administrator Rosenberg did so. I am grateful for that decision.\n  In fact, I support expanding take back opportunities, by creating \nadditional permanent, convenient disposal sites for the public. \nExpansion of the program along these lines is explicitly authorized in \nthe Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, a bill I guided through \nthe Judiciary Committee in February. It subsequently passed the Senate \nby a vote of 94-1.\n  So I urge everyone in Iowa and across the country to check your homes \nfor unneeded or expired medicines. If you find any, please take part in \nthis year's National Prescription Drug Take Back Day on Saturday. \nParticipating locations typically include neighborhood pharmacies and \nlocal fire and police departments. You can locate a specific collection \nsite near you on the DEA's website. This is one small way we can each \ndo our part to reduce the risk of drug abuse and addiction for our \nfamilies and communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/senate-section/article/S2550-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DUCHENNE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I wish to raise awareness about Duchenne \nmuscular dystrophy and the boys and young men who suffer from this \ndevastating disease.\n  Duchenne muscular dystrophy was first brought to my attention 15 \nyears ago, when I met Brian and Alice Denger of Biddeford, ME. The \nDengers had two wonderful sons, Matthew and Patrick, who were both born \nwith Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Patrick, now 19, is a student at the \nUniversity of New England. He recently received his driver's license \nand enjoys driving in Maine. His brother Matthew was a 20-year-old \nstudent at UNE when he died from the disease about 3 years ago. The \nDengers also have a daughter, Rachel, with juvenile diabetes. They are \na loving and courageous family whose strength and spirit directly \ninspired me to become involved in the fight for research funding to \ncombat muscular dystrophy.\n  Brian Denger was the first to tell me of the terrible progression of \nthis type of muscular dystrophy. Symptoms begin in early childhood, and \nboys quickly experience severe and rapidly progressing muscle \ndegeneration, which often results in their losing the ability to walk. \nTragically, most die prematurely as a result of muscle-related cardiac \nand respiratory problems.\n  In 2001, what really caught my attention was that the treatment \noptions for boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy were incredibly \nlimited and aimed at managing symptoms in an attempt to optimize \nquality of life for the limited time that these children would have to \nshare with us. Research had not yielded any meaningful way to extend \nthe lifespan of children suffering from the disease. That is why I \njoined with the late Senator Paul Wellstone in introducing the MD CARE \nAct, to raise awareness and expand Federal support for research into \nthis debilitating disease. It was signed into law and last reauthorized \nin 2014 and has resulted in dramatically improved and standardized \nclinical care for those with the disease. I have also fought diligently \nfor increased funding for the Duchenne programs at the National \nInstitutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention.\n  Today there is some good news for the boys--and now--young men with \nDuchenne muscular dystrophy and their families. A number of therapeutic \nstrategies are currently under development, and we have made dramatic \nprogress to improve the quality and length of life for those who suffer \nfrom the disease. In fact, the average lifespan of Duchenne patients \nhas increased by about a decade since the MD CARE Act became law.\n  Given our Nation's wealth of scientific expertise, however, we can \nand should do more for families like the Dengers. We are making \nprogress, but this is no time to take our foot off the accelerator. The \n$2 billion increase in funding for NIH that was included in the fiscal \nyear 2016 funding bill will pay dividends for patients and their \nfamilies. I urge my colleagues to continue to work collaboratively to \nsustain this commitment to biomedical research, which holds tremendous \npromise for finding better treatments and, ultimately, a cure for \ndevastating diseases like Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/senate-section/article/S2550-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2550-S2551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REMEMBERING JOHN HEINZ\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, on April 4, we marked 25 years since \nPennsylvania Senator John Heinz died in a plane crash. I am honored to \nserve in the Senate seat he held from 1977 to 1991.\n  Five years ago, I paid tribute to Senator Heinz for his public \nservice as a Senator. Today, I am going to focus on his leadership on \nthe Special Committee on Aging. Senator Heinz served as chairman of \nthat committee from 1981 to 1987. Pennsylvania is one of the oldest \nStates in the country, and through this position, Senator Heinz was a \nstrong advocate for seniors. During his chairmanship, the Special \nCommittee on Aging held 34 hearings in Washington, DC, and countless \nmore around the Nation. The committee also produced over 60 reports and \npapers. Senator Heinz would often use what he learned through these \ninvestigations and reports to inform his work as a member of the \nFinance Committee, which has jurisdiction over the Social Security and \nMedicare programs.\n  John Heinz once said, ``Working together, we can lay the groundwork \nfor a society that respects age and the elderly and that truly realizes \nthe benefits of the experience, wisdom, and judgement of older \nAmericans.'' As chairman of the Aging Committee, his first \nresponsibility was not to party or partisanship, but to older Americans \nwhose interests the committee was created to support and protect. Frank \nMcArdle, a member of Senator Heinz's staff once commented:\n\n       What Heinz brought to many issues . . . was a sense of \n     outrage. He could channel that anger toward public policy \n     that would correct the injustices that hurt vulnerable \n     populations. When he seized upon a situation\n\n[[Page S2551]]\n\n     like that, he wouldn't let go. His outrage over what was \n     happening to defenseless people gave him an energy and a \n     commitment to see it through.\n\n  As chairman, Senator Heinz took on the powerful in defense of the \npowerless.\n  Senator Heinz was an honorable public servant for our Commonwealth \nand our Nation. He focused intensively on the challenges facing our \nseniors and worked tirelessly to find solutions to their problems. We \ncontinue to be inspired by his distinguished service on behalf of the \nolder citizens of Pennsylvania.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/senate-section/article/S2551-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR. SHEILA CROWLEY\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I do not often recognize non-\nVermonters on the floor of the Senate, but I rise today to applaud the \nnumerous and significant achievements of Dr. Sheila Crowley. Dr. \nCrowley recently retired as president and CEO of the National Low \nIncome Housing Coalition, after decades of advocacy to make sure people \nwith the lowest incomes in the United States have affordable and decent \nhomes. It has truly been an honor to work closely with Sheila on issues \nrelated to affordable housing.\n  I am particularly proud of our efforts to create the national housing \ntrust fund, the only Federal program designed to build new affordable \nrental housing specifically for extremely low-income individuals. In \nthe early 2000s, Sheila provided invaluable assistance to my office as \nwe drafted the first House version of the trust fund and shepherded the \nlegislation through its first votes in the House Financial Services \nCommittee.\n  For the next 15 years, Sheila built grassroots support across the \ncountry for the trust fund, to keep the pressure on Federal lawmakers. \nDespite numerous setbacks--and one serious housing market collapse--she \ntirelessly advocated for addressing the significant housing needs of \npeople with limited economic resources. It is a fitting testament to \nher tenacity that just as she prepared to retire, the Federal Housing \nFinance Agency began capitalizing the trust fund for the first time. \nLater this year, States will receive the first new Federal affordable \nhousing production funds in decades, and for that, Sheila Crowley \ndeserves an enormous amount of credit.\n  Not surprisingly, Sheila received the 2009 John W. Macy award from \nthe National Alliance to End Homelessness and the Housing Leadership \nAward from the National Low Income Housing Coalition for her work on \nthe National Housing Trust Fund campaign. But I am guessing the award \nSheila will cherish most will be when, in the not-too-distant future, \ntenants move into the first trust fund financed affordable housing.\n  I cannot overstate the importance of Sheila's work and her \naccomplishments. We are experiencing nothing less than an affordable \nhousing crisis on the national level. In order to afford the fair \nmarket rent for a two-bedroom apartment, a minimum wage earner must \nwork 102 hours per week, 52 weeks per year.\n  Throughout her tenure at the National Low Income Housing Coalition, \nSheila was not just a resolute advocate; she was also a vital resource \non housing policy to many members of Congress. She also worked closely \nwith organizations focused on homeless services, family housing, AIDS \nhousing, housing for people with disabilities, senior housing, and \nservices for battered women and victims of rape.\n  And while her focus was national, Sheila often travelled to States to \nsupport local housing efforts, including in my State of Vermont. She \nwas a frequent keynote speaker at Vermont conferences and a valued \npartner in developing local responses to our housing challenges. I know \na great many Vermonters who worked closely with Sheila and hold her in \nthe highest esteem.\n  I wish Dr. Sheila Crowley all the best in her well-deserved \nretirement, and I am confident her affordable housing efforts will \ncontinue to bear fruit for decades to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/senate-section/article/S2551-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL SEERSUCKER DAY\n\n  Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize seersucker \nmanufacturers and enthusiasts across the United States. I wish everyone \na Happy National Seersucker Day. This uniquely American fashion has a \nstoried history dating back to 1909. Louisiana is proud to have played \nan important part in introducing the country to seersucker apparel. The \nfirst seersucker suit was designed by Joseph Haspel at his Broad Street \nfacility in New Orleans, LA.\n  This lightweight cotton fabric, known for its signature pucker, has \nbeen worn and enjoyed by Americans across the country during the hot \nsummer months. Mr. Haspel said it best, ``hot is hot, no matter what \nyou do for a living.'' In the 1990s, Seersucker Day was established by \nMembers of this chamber to honor this unique American fashion. I \nproudly resumed this tradition in 2014 in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives by designating Wednesday, June 11, as National \nSeersucker Day. I have continued this tradition in the U.S. Senate and \nwish to designate Thursday, June 9, as the third annual National \nSeersucker Day. I encourage everyone to wear seersucker on this day to \ncommemorate this iconic American clothing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/senate-section/article/S2551-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO PETER HENRY\n\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a \ndistinguished member of my staff, my legislative director, Peter Henry. \nI am sad to say that Peter will be leaving my office, as well as \nWashington, DC, for a new chapter in his life. His last day is April \n29, 2016. He and his beautiful wife Libby, his two-and-a-half-year-old \ndaughter Winnie, and his daughter-to-be will soon move back to his \nhometown of Kansas City. Peter has taken a job working in the private \nsector, where I know he will excel and succeed as he has during his \ntime with my office.\n  Peter was one of the first staff members I hired after I became \nSenator, but Peter's time in Washington began back in 2005 when he came \nto our Nation's capital straight out of college. Prior to joining my \nteam, Peter made a name for himself as a sharp and capable Hill \nstaffer, rising quickly through the ranks in three different Senators' \noffices before moving to the Senate Committee on the Environment and \nPublic Works, where he had a lead role in surface transportation \nissues.\n  Given his breadth of experience and the deep respect he fostered with \nhis colleagues, Peter no doubt had his choice of offices to work for, \nbut he chose to work for me. For that, I am immensely grateful. Being a \nfreshman Senator is not easy, and being staff to a freshman senator is \ncertainly a challenge. Peter rose to the challenge. He put together the \nbest legislative team I could have imagined. He handled stress under \nfire, taught us about complex Senate procedures, and adeptly helped me \nnavigate the minefields that can be Washington politics. His \nintelligence, integrity, strong work ethic, sense of fair play, and his \ngood nature will be sorely missed in my office.\n  Peter is also a patriot and made sure to set us on the right track to \nserve the great people of Alaska and the rest of the country. I can't \nthank Peter enough for all the work he has done for me and for the rest \nof my staff. He leaves a hole, but I am comforted to know that his \nfuture is bright and that he will continue to contribute to our great \ncountry by working hard at his new endeavor and, most importantly, \nraising a wonderful family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/senate-section/article/S2551-4", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2551-S2552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO EVELYN CANTU\n\n Mr. BARRASSO.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \nVeterans Guest House for its unwavering commitment and loyalty to \nproviding our servicemembers, veterans, and their families lodging \nwhile they address their own health care needs at medical facilities \nthroughout northern Nevada. The Veterans Guest House is one of a kind \nfor our great State and is an invaluable resource to our military \ncommunity.\n  The Veterans Guest House was founded over two decades ago when a \nmother and her children were found sleeping in their car while their \nveteran father was in the intensive care unit at the local VA Sierra \nNevada Health Care System Medical Center. In the early 1990s, founders \nof the Veterans Guest House--Chuck Fulkerson, Dick Rhyno, Thomas \nPurkey, Minor Kelso, Robert Crowell, Esq., Wally Willson, Lois Crocker, \nDavid Parsons, Joseph Rooney, Charles Grundy, Jes Barbera, Don \nAnderson, Lew Carnahan, Ben Duncan, Jeani Hunt, Jim Martin, Manuel \nMuniz, Rick Sorenson, Ensio Tosolini, Joe Scamihorn, William Wood, Len \nCrocker, Kit McGrath, Richard Shuster, Elaine McNeill, Rand Tanner, \nChester Henry, and Ted Buchwald--realized that many veterans and their \nfamilies lacked a place to stay while family members received medical \ntreatment, and in 1994, they created the Spouse House. By 1998, the \nfacility grew to offer five beds for veterans and their families.\n  In 2002, the facility was officially named the Veterans Guest House, \nand on Veterans Day in 2004, with only private donations, the \norganization purchased and renovated a 3-story home across the street \nfrom the VA Sierra Nevada Health Care System Medical Center. This \nfacility now accommodates up to 17 guests. The Veterans Guest House \nprovides both long-term and short-term lodging to veterans and their \nfamilies for various situations, including veterans receiving \noutpatient care, families of veterans who are hospitalized, and \nveterans' immediate family members who are receiving medical treatment \nas an inpatient or outpatient. In the 22 years since its inception, the \nVeterans Guest House has served over 55,000 nights to veterans, veteran \nspouses, and veteran families.\n  There is no way to adequately thank the men and women that lay down \ntheir lives for our freedoms, but those at the Veterans Guest House \nhave gone above and beyond to show their appreciation. I would like to \nextend my deepest gratitude to chief executive officer Noreen Leary, \nthe incredible staff, and the many dedicated individuals who volunteer \nat the Veterans Guest House, in addition to president Terry Tholl, vice \nPresident Monk Maim, secretary Lucy Miller, treasurer Carol Langford, \nand past and present members serving on the board of directors. These \nindividuals helping our active military members, veterans, and their \nfamilies at the Veterans Guest House stand as shining examples of the \nmanner in which we should respect our men and women in uniform. The \nunwavering dedication of the Veterans Guest House to providing our \nbrave men and women with a place to stay is commendable, and I am proud \nto honor it today.\n  As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I recognize \nthat Congress has a responsibility not only to honor these brave \nindividuals who serve our Nation, but also to ensure they are cared for \nwhen they return home. Equally as important, it is crucial that these \nservicemembers and their families have a place to stay while receiving \nquality care. I remain committed to upholding this promise for our \nveterans and servicemembers in Nevada and throughout the Nation. I am \nvery pleased that veterans service organizations like the Veterans \nGuest House are committed to ensuring that the needs of our veterans \nare being met.\n  Today I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in recognizing \nthe Veterans Guest House, an organization whose mission is noble and \ncharitable. I am both humbled and honored to acknowledge this \norganization and its work to provide active military members, veterans, \nand thsikfamilies a safe place to stay, and I wish it the best of luck \nin all of its future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/senate-section/article/S2552-4", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2552-S2553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING THOMAS C.

Tom passed away on March 29 at the age of 84.\n  Tom was born on February 9, 1932, in Helena, MT. He first came to \nKodiak as a member of the U.S. Navy, then returned to work construction \nand married Nancy Ann Norman. Nancy's family owned the gift and photo \nshop, Norman's.\n  Tom first pursued a career in law enforcement, serving as a \nterritorial policeman, detective, State trooper, and private \ninvestigator. That took Tom and Nancy to various cities in Alaska. \nFollowing the 1964 Good Friday earthquake and tsunami, they returned to \nKodiak for good. Tom and Nancy helped Nancy's family restore Norman's \nfollowing the disaster. Tom pursued his entrepreneurial interests in \noil sales, automobile sales and service, and finally insurance \nbrokerage before retiring in 1996--a well-rounded career.\n  He was equally committed to the Kodiak community, serving as \npresident of the Kodiak Chamber of Commerce, the Kodiak Rotary Club, \nand Pioneers of Alaska Igloo #18, which Tom helped reactivate in 1983. \nHis statewide leadership roles included service as state commander of \nthe Veterans of Foreign Wars and chairman of the Alaska Committee for \nEmployer Support of the Guard and Reserve.\n\n[[Page S2553]]\n\n  Tom leaves behind his beloved wife of 60 years, Nancy, two sons, \ngrandchildren, great-grandchildren, and a large extended family.

Mr. President, today I rise to congratulate the \nYork County Children's Advocacy Center on the celebration of their 10th \nanniversary.\n  The York County Children's Advocacy Center opened its doors in May of \n2006 in York, PA. Since its opening, the center has stayed true to its \nmission ``to reduce the trauma of child abuse investigations, foster \nprofessional collaboration and cooperation, and provide education and \nadvocacy regarding the prevention of child abuse within the \ncommunity.''\n  Without a child advocacy center, if a child is brave enough to report \nabuse, that child is often required to retell and, thus, relive the \nabuse through multiple, repetitive interviews with child protective \nservices, prosecutors, police, victim services, and medical and mental \nhealth providers. The interviews often occur in places that magnify the \nchild's trauma--police stations, emergency rooms, or offices of lawyers \nand social workers.\n  The York Child Advocacy Center, by contrast, brings together law \nenforcement, trained interviewers, child protective services, medical \nproviders, and mental health experts in a child-friendly, safe house, \nwhere an abused child feels secure and only has to undergo one \ninterview and one physical exam.\n  As a result of the center's tireless efforts, over 3,000 children \nhave received vital services. The York County Children's Advocacy \nCenter has achieved many important milestones. Some of these milestones \ninclude earning full accreditation through the National Children's \nAlliance, expanding their forensic interviewing and forensic medical \nservices, and being accepted as a United Way partner agency. Each of \nthese milestones has allowed the York County Children's Advocacy Center \nto better serve the most vulnerable in our society, our children.\n  On behalf of the Senate, I wish to express my sincere gratitude to \nthe York County Children's Advocacy Center as they celebrate 10 years \nof dedicated service to York County's children and families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/senate-section/article/S2553-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO EVA ENCINIAS-SANDOVAL\n\n Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, today I want to recognize a great \nNew Mexican and a great American. Eva Encinias-Sandoval is a pioneer \nand a cultural icon in the world of flamenco in New Mexico.\n  New Mexico has a long and rich cultural history with flamenco as one \nof its dynamic traditions. Flamenco is a complex art form that \noriginated in Spain and blends influences from different cultures. It \nmixes both discipline and spontaneity.\n  With sweeping, expressive arm movements and rhythmic stomping often \naccompanied by singing or music, flamenco is more than a form of dance. \nIt incorporates guitar, percussion, and song as integral parts of the \nart form.\n  Eva Encinias-Sandoval's career in flamenco spans more than 40 years. \nHer professional expertise includes performance, teaching choreography, \nconcert production, and direction.\n  Eva began dancing and teaching flamenco at a young age. Her mother, \nClarita, was also a dancer, and Eva started her training at the age of \n5.\n  At age 14, Eva began teaching students in her mother's studio, and in \n1973, she formed her first flamenco dance company, Ritmo Flamenco. The \nfollowing year, she enrolled in the University of New Mexico, though \nthe dance department did not offer flamenco classes at the time.\n  Eva began teaching flamenco as a single course offering at UNM in \n1976. Now, the program of study includes all levels of flamenco \ntechnique and specialized topics. As a result of Eva's dedication and \npassion, UNM is the only institution in the country that offers \nbachelor of arts and masters of fine arts degrees with a concentration \nin flamenco.\n  Eva later went on to establish the National Institute of Flamenco in \n1982. NIF is a nonprofit arts organization dedicated to the \npreservation and advancement of flamenco in the United States. With \nEva's artistic vision and guidance, the organization has expanded to \ninclude several thriving programs, such as the Conservatory of Flamenco \nArts, Festival Flamenco Internacional de Albuquerque, Alma Flamenca, \nand many others.\n  Eva's work has also helped bring renowned international flamenco \nartists from Spain and other parts of the world to study and teach in \nour State, adding a depth of knowledge and expertise to her students' \nexperiences. She hopes that her students will become the better artists \nby learning alongside the best artists.\n  She was the first woman inducted into the Albuquerque Wall of Fame, \nhas received three Bravo awards, and accolades from her colleagues and \nstudents.\n  Despite the importance of these awards and honors, they are not what \ndistinguishes Eva most. Instead, it is the example she sets in always \ndoing her best, always giving back, and always striving for excellence.\n  Eva has changed her community as a talented dancer and teacher who \nhas inspired countless students. She is deeply committed to her \ncommunity and pays equal attention to young, less experienced dancers \nas more advanced students.\n  Although the origins of flamenco are cloudy, the Encinias family is a \ntrue ``flamenco family.'' Eva's children, Marisol and Joaquin, are both \ndancers. Her passion and legacy will live on through them, as well as \nher students who can be found at NIF, UNM, and, now, Tierra Adentro, a \nlocal charter school that incorporates flamenco into its curriculum.\n  Our State is fortunate to have someone like Eva Encinias-Sandoval, \nwho not only sees the beauty of art, but also the beauty of our \nculture. Flamenco will continue to grow in New Mexico thanks to her \ndedicated work and the love of dance she continues to share with the \ncommunity.\n  By educating mostly New Mexican students, Eva views flamenco as an \nopportunity to teach our State's youth programs relevant to whom they \nare as a people. Flamenco is an art form that is as unique as the \nartists who study it.\n  Whether through an appreciation or dedication to the art form, Eva \nEncinias-Sandoval has brought flamenco into the lives of countless New \nMexicans. Her love for the art has not gone unnoticed, and I commend \nher for all of her accomplishments and her service to our \nState.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/senate-section/article/S2553-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/senate-section/article/S2553-4", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/senate-section/article/S2553-5", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2553-S2554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:23 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 1890.

A bill to extend the runway at Pope Army Airfield; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, when it comes to projecting America's \npower, I have said many times that North Carolina is the tip of the \nAmerican spear. When our country calls, it is a safe bet that the first \nresponders will be U.S. Marines from Camp Lejeune or our paratroopers \nof the 18th Airborne stationed at Fort Bragg.\n  The 18th Airborne is America's Global Response Force. When called, \nunits of the 18th Airborne can be anywhere in the world within 48 \nhours. Because of this unique mission--unique to Fort Bragg and the \n18th Airborne--Pope Army Airfield is the busiest tactical airfield in \nthe Armed Forces.\n  Unfortunately, Pope is also home of the shortest runway in the Army. \nIf the 18th Airborne is put on alert, C-5 and C-17 aircraft are needed \nto launch the force, and they cannot depart fully fueled with a full \nload of paratroopers and equipment off of the airfield. The current \nPope Army Airfield runway provides only 8,500 feet for takeoff; \nhowever, to take off, the C-17 needs a minimum of 10,500 feet and the \nC-5 requires 11,500 feet.\n  The Air Force's air refueling fleet is already stressed. The C-17s \nand C-5s used to carry out the Global Response Force missions have to \nleave Pope Army Airfield with full equipment and paratroopers but only \nabout 60 percent of their fuel capacity. This requires them to go \neither to Charleston, SC, or Gander, Newfoundland, to get refueled so \nthey can continue their mission. One refueling stop for an airlift \ncoming out of Pope at Gander, Newfoundland, costs $17,000 per hour. If \n53 aircraft--roughly the number required to outload the heaviest \nbrigade combat team--have to refuel at Gander, it costs about $2 \nmillion one-way because they can't be fully loaded when they take off \nfrom Pope Army Airfield. This refueling stop also adds 2.5 more hours \nto the time on the mission, and the mission objective is to be anywhere \nin the world in 48 hours.\n  Prior to the last round of BRAC, extending the Pope runway to \naccommodate fully loaded C-17 and C-5 aircraft was Air Mobility \nCommand's No. 1 airfield project, and the U.S. Air Force said it was \ntheir No. 2 project. However, this has fallen off the Army's priority \nlist, and I am not really sure why.\n  Extending the Pope runway to accommodate the airlift requirements of \nthe Global Response Force and the 18th Airborne Corps is a national \nstrategic priority. Therefore, I will be offering an amendment to the \nNational Defense Authorization Act during markup that requires the Army \nto report to the Senate their plans to extend the runway at Pope and \nwhether it is the top priority for the Army. I think our paratroopers \nand crews need to know this. I know our taxpayers need to know this. \nAnd, more than anything, I want to make sure that when we deploy the \nproud men and women from the Green Ramp of Pope Army Airfield, we do it \nloaded and ready to go wherever they need to go in the United States or \naround the world.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Merkley):\n  S. 2886. A bill to reauthorize the Fisheries Restoration and \nIrrigation Mitigation Act of 2000; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Reauthorization \nof the Fisheries Restoration and Irrigation Mitigation Act of 2000, \nalso referred to as FRIMA. This Act was established to support healthy \nfish populations while simultaneously allowing for continued water \ndiversions for irrigation and other uses in the Pacific Northwest. I \nchampioned this program's last reauthorization in 2009, and I can say \nwith certainty that the pressing need for FRIMA has not gone away.\n  Throughout the Pacific Northwest there is a critical need for \nprojects that improve fish passage without compromising important water \ndiversion needs for agriculture and other uses. The sustainable \ncoexistence of continued water diversions and healthy fish populations \ncan be achieved through a number of interventions, such as installation \nof fish screens, removal of fish passage barriers, and carrying out \ninventories to better understand needs and priorities. The technology \nand the knowledge needed to carry out these projects are at our finger \ntips; the means, however, is not.\n  That is why FRIMA is such an important program for the Pacific \nNorthwest. The act, overseen by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, \nprovides a Federal cost-share on the order of 65 percent to fund fish \npassage and fish screen projects at water diversion and irrigation \nsites in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and western Montana. This voluntary \ncost-shared program authorizes $25 million in Federal funds, to be \nequally shared among the 4 States, that can be leveraged to make these \nessential projects to improve fish passage and install fish screens \ncome to fruition.\n  FRIMA has a history of demonstrated success in Oregon and throughout \nthe Pacific Northwest. According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, \n127 projects have been funded through FRIMA to date. These projects \nhave reopened more than 1,130 miles of habitat to fish passage. In \ntotal, 56 fish passage barriers have been removed, 130 water diversion \nsites have been screened, and 18 fish passage evaluations have been \ncompleted. This program has led to multiple accomplishments for \ncommunities in the Pacific Northwest, but there are still tens of \nthousands of unscreened water diversions in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, \nand western Montana. There is still work to be done, and FRIMA could \nprovide the means to continue to make a difference for sustainable \nfisheries and water management.\n  At its core, FRIMA is centered on the concept of collaboration. This \nis a program borne through bi-partisan and multi-sectoral support. \nFRIMA is embraced by water users, farmers, fisheries managers and \nconservation organizations alike. The economic and ecological integrity \nof our region depends on resilient fisheries and sustainable management \nof water resources, and FRIMA offers a means to concurrently make \npositive strides in sustainably managing both our water diversions and \nour treasured fishery resources.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2886\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REAUTHORIZATION OF THE FISHERIES RESTORATION AND \n                   IRRIGATION MITIGATION ACT OF 2000.\n\n       Section 10(a) of the Fisheries Restoration and Irrigation \n     Mitigation Act of 2000 (16 U.S.C. 777 note; Public Law 106-\n     502) is amended by striking ``2009 through 2015'' and \n     inserting `` 2017 through 2024''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 2893. A bill to reauthorize the sound recording and film \npreservation programs of the Library of Congress, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing The Library of \nCongress Sound Recording and Film Preservation Programs Reauthorization \nAct of 2016. I am pleased to have Senator Leahy as a cosponsor. This \nbill would reauthorize the sound recording and film preservation \nprograms of the Library of Congress through fiscal year 2026. The \ncurrent authorization sunsets in September 2016. In addition to \nreauthorizing the programs, the bill would increase the National \nRecording Preservation Foundation's number of board members and place a \ncap on Federal matching funds similar to what is currently required of \nthe National Film Preservation Foundation.\n  Congress created the National Film Preservation Board in 1988 and the \nNational Film Preservation Foundation in 1996 to help save historically \nsignificant American films for the benefit of the public. In 2000, \nCongress created the National Recording Preservation Board and the \nNational Recording Preservation Foundation to help save\n\n[[Page S2561]]\n\nhistorically important American sound recordings.\n  The two boards advise the Librarian of Congress on national \npreservation planning policy, helping the Library develop and \ndisseminate preservation and production standards for at-risk works. In \naddition, the Film Board selects films of importance to cinema and \nAmerica's cultural and artistic history for the National Film Registry, \nwhile the Recording Board selects sound recordings which have been \nrecognized for their cultural, artistic and/or historical significance \nto American society and the Nation's audio legacy for the National \nRecording Registry.\n  The two foundations are the private sector charitable affiliates of \nthe Boards. They raise funds and distribute them to archives throughout \nthe U.S. The Library's Federal match is used for small grants to \narchives, educational institutions, museums and local historical \nsocieties with small film and sound recording collections in need of \npreservation. A requirement of the grants is that recipients make these \nworks available to researchers, educators and the general public.\n  These programs have allowed the Library of Congress, in collaboration \nwith a wide range of industry organizations, no-profit libraries and \narchives, preservation organizations, artist guilds, educators and \nacademics, to collect and preserve at-risk films and recordings all \nover the country.\n  My State of Iowa has benefitted directly from these programs. For \nexample, the National Film Preservation Foundation has provided grants \nto preserve films held in Iowa institutions, including Coe College, \nCouncil Bluffs Public Library, Davenport Public Library, Herbert Hoover \nPresidential Library-Museum, Iowa State University American Archives of \nthe Factual Film, and the University of Iowa. In addition, a number of \nIowa-related items are preserved in the Library of Congress Packard \nCampus audio-visual collection, including copies of Iowa Public Radio \nand Public Television items from the American Archive of Public \nBroadcasting.\n  Iowa constituents have contacted my office about their support for \nthe reauthorization of these programs. For example, I heard from Ben \nJohnson, Support Service Librarian at the Council Bluffs Public \nLibrary, Jill Jack, Director of Library Services, College Archivist and \nAssociate Professor at Coe College, Tanya Zanish-Belcher, Director of \nSpecial Collection & Archives at Wake Forest University, and David \nMcCartney, University Archivist at the University of Iowa, about the \nvalue of these programs to local libraries and historical societies, \nand how their organizations were in the possession of materials that \nwere able to be saved with the help of these programs.\n  According to Mr. Johnson, the Council Bluffs Public Library received \na grant to preserve a 1930s silent film entitled Man Power, which had \nbeen created ``to boost the local economy by luring businesses to \nCouncil Bluffs. This historic film sat in our archives for over 80 \nyears, unwatched and deteriorating over time. With the help of the \n[National Film Preservation Fund], we were able to preserve and \ndigitize this wonderful time capsule of our local history. Thanks to \nthe [National Film Preservation Foundation], this lost piece of history \nhas been viewed hundreds of times and is now safe from decay and \navailable for the public.'' Mr. Johnson wrote, ``Did you know Council \nBluffs Iowa had the first electric Streetcar system in the country? As \na result of this grant we were able to see, for the first time, real, \nmoving images of Council Bluffs from back when it was a major rail hub. \nI have no doubt that without support from the [National Film \nPreservation Foundation], vital pieces of local history would be lost \nforever.''\n  Ms. Jack wrote, ``Coe College received grants to preserve two films \nthat depict campus life in the 1930s and 1960s. Once these historically \nrich films were preserved more than 170 people attended a screening of \nthe films. Thanks to that event, the college was able to raise funds \nfrom alumni to preserve a third campus film from 1972. The public \nfunding from the [National Film Preservation Foundation] helped us not \nonly share our history with the public but also generated financial \nsupport from the community. Since posting the films on our website \nstudents, faculty and the public have viewed the films using them in \nacademic and public history research.''\n  According to a statement from Ms. Zanish-Belcher, who managed the \nNational Film Preservation Foundation film grant when she was Head of \nthe Special Collections Department at Iowa State University, ``[t]hanks \nto the National Film Preservation Foundation, NFPF, Iowa State \nUniversity was able to preserve and make accessible an important group \nof films documenting the Rath Packing Company of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. As \nthe Head of the Special Collections Department at Iowa State at the \ntime, I oversaw the preservation of these fragile nitrate films from \nthe 1930s. Without support from the NFPF, these important visual \ndocuments of Iowa History would have been lost. The NFPF continues to \nhelp regional archives throughout the country, helping to save more \nthan 2,230 films and collections in all 50 states. While most film \npreservation efforts focus on the Hollywood product, the NFPF is the \nonly agency devoted to helping organizations like Iowa State University \npreserve films in their collections that would otherwise deteriorate \nand go unseen. These films provide important historical documentation \ndepicting local and regional business, groups, and organizations of \ninterest to both Iowa constituents and U.S. citizens.''\n  According to a letter from Mr. McCartney, the University of Iowa \nreceived funds to preserve a number of films significant to Iowa \nhistory, including ``a set of student-produced dance films (1939) \nbelieved to be the oldest thesis films of their type in the nation. \nAnother noteworthy project is Iowa State's Rath Packing Company \nCollection (ca. 1933), a group of depression era films documenting the \nlargest meatpacking company in the country. The films show the Rath \ntest kitchen, packing plant operations, and advertising efforts. Thanks \nto a [National Film Preservation Foundation] grant, this collection is \nnow available for scholars and historians.''\n  I appreciate the fact that these Library of Congress programs have \nplaced a special emphasis on assisting small and local projects that \nwould otherwise have been lost or overlooked. Local libraries and \nhistorical societies have been helped by the National Film Preservation \nFoundation to rescue films that, according to Mr. Johnson, Ms. Jack and \nMr. McCartney, ``aren't Hollywood features but regional films and \nnewsreels that document our history and culture.'' According to Ms. \nJack, ``we and other Iowa organizations have hundreds of other \nculturally and historically significant films that need preservation \nwork to survive. These document the history of our state [of Iowa] from \nits earliest years to present time.'' So the biggest value that I see \nof these programs is that they boost smaller archives with few \nresources to protect their collections, and they provide smaller \norganizations with a path to learn about film preservation and \nsuccessful production standards. These programs are an invaluable \npartner to these small and local organizations in their efforts to save \nAmerica's moving picture and sound recording heritage.\n  It is important to foster an environment that encourages the \npreservation of our nation's cultural resources, and films and music \nare a big part of the American experience. As such, vulnerable motion \npictures and sound recordings of historic and cultural significance \nshould be protected from disintegration and decay. I understand that \nmany of these works already have been lost and that others are \ndeteriorating rapidly. I am a history buff, so I am inspired when I see \nworks that depict our American heritage--and especially life in Iowa \nand rural America--saved for future generations. We need to safeguard \nthese precious items so they are not lost and so that generations of \nAmericans to come can appreciate and learn about their historical and \ncreative roots in both film and sound recordings. Many of these works \nare unique and rare, so I am pleased to support the Library of Congress \nprograms and their effort to assist organizations all across the 50 \nStates to preserve these treasures for students, researchers and the \ngeneral public.\n  I look forward to swift action on this bill so that it can be enacted \nbefore these programs sunset at the end of September.\n\n[[Page S2562]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nletters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2893\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The public funding from the NFPF helped us not only \n     share our history with the public but also generated \n     financial support from the community. Since posting the films \n     on our website students, faculty and the public have viewed \n     the films using them in academic and public history research.\n       The Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum, \n     Davenport Public Library, Council Bluffs Public Library, and \n     Iowa State University also received grants to preserve films \n     from the NFPF. We and other Iowa organizations have hundreds \n     of other culturally and historically significant films that \n     need preservation work to survive. These document the history \n     of our state from its earliest years to present time.\n       The NFPF has been very effective since it started \n     operations in 1997. To date the NFPF has helped rescue more \n     than 2,600 films from all 50 states and these aren't \n     Hollywood features but regional films and newsreels that \n     document our history and culture. I urge you to support their \n     work. With additional funding the National Film Preservation \n     Foundation can continue to work with organizations like the \n     University of Iowa to save America's heritage.\n           Best wishes,\n     Jill Jack.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                November 19, 2015.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: I write to ask your support for \n     reauthorization of the National Film Preservation Foundation \n     (NFPF), the grant-giving public charity set up by Congress in \n     1996 to help save America's film heritage. I understand that \n     the NFPF's reauthorization comes before the Senate this \n     session.\n       In 2012 Council Bluffs Public Library received a grant to \n     preserve Man Power, a 1930 silent film created to boost the \n     local economy by luring businesses to Council Bluffs. This \n     historic film sat in our archives for over 80 years, \n     unwatched and deteriorating over time. With the help of the \n     NFPF, we were able to preserve and digitize this wonderful \n     time capsule of our local history. Thanks to the NFPF, this \n     lost piece of history has been viewed hundreds of times and \n     is now safe from decay and available for the public.\n       Did you know Council Bluffs Iowa had the first electric \n     Streetcar system in the country? As a result of this grant we \n     were able to see, for the first time, real, moving images of \n     Council Bluffs from back when it was a major rail hub. I have \n     no doubt that without support from the NFPF, vital pieces of \n     local history would be lost forever.\n       Thanks to the National Film Preservation Foundation, we and \n     other local libraries and historical societies have been able \n     to save important films that would otherwise be overlooked. \n     To date the NFPF has helped rescue more than 2,600 films from \n     all 50 states and these aren't Hollywood features but \n     regional films and newsreels that document our history and \n     culture.\n       The NFPF has been very effective since it started \n     operations in 1997. They assist not only the largest film \n     archives in the country, but also provide a path for smaller \n     organizations to learn about film preservation and protect \n     their collections. I urge you to support their work. With \n     additional funding the National Film Preservation Foundation \n     can continue to work with organizations like Council Bluffs \n     Public Library to save America's heritage. Thank you for your \n     time and please be in touch if you have any questions.\n           Best wishes,\n                                                      Ben Johnson.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, two days ago, we recognized World IP Day, \ncelebrating the profound contributions that artists and inventors make \nto our culture and beyond. The theme of this year's World IP Day was \nDigital Creativity: Culture Reimagined, and events around the world \nfocused on how to promote and protect creative efforts in the digital \nage. As we look forward to new and innovative digital creations we must \nalso be vigilant in preserving the past.\n  We must ensure that the films and recordings that played vital roles \nin shaping and recording the American experience are preserved for \nfuture generations. Those works, created by previous generations, tell \nus who we are, and who we were, as a society. To help ensure that these \nrecords of our history, our dreams, and our aspirations can be viewed \nand appreciated by future generations, I am joining with Senator \nGrassley to introduce legislation reauthorizing the Library of Congress \nsound recording and film preservation programs.\n  Congress has long recognized the importance of cultural preservation, \ncreating the National Film Preservation Program in 1988 and the \nNational Sound Recording Preservation Program in 2000 within the \nLibrary of Congress. Both programs help preserve historical and \ncultural artifacts that would otherwise disappear or be destroyed \nthrough the passage of time. The Library of Congress uses the programs \nto advance important preservation efforts including recognizing films\n\n[[Page S2563]]\n\nand sound recordings on the National Film and National Recording \nRegistries.\n  The programs also created the federally chartered National Film and \nNational Recording Preservation Foundations. The foundations provide \ngrants to a wide array of educational and non-profit organizations to \npreserve films and sound recordings. To date, the National Film \nPreservation Foundation has given grants to organizations in all 50 \nStates, including to Hildene, the Lincoln Family Home in Manchester, \nVermont, which used the money to preserve home movies of Robert Todd \nLincoln's descendants from the 1920s to the 1940s. Well over 2000 \nfilms, many of which can now be viewed online, have been preserved \nthrough the Foundation's grants. Among the preserved films is the \nearliest feature film shot in Vermont, ``A Vermont Romance'' from 1916.\n  By reauthorizing these important programs through 2027, this \nlegislation will allow the Library of Congress and the Foundations to \ncontinue their important work in preserving America's fading treasures, \nas well as providing grants that will help libraries, museums, and \narchives preserve these works and make them available for study and \nresearch. I urge my colleagues to act swiftly to pass this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Northeast Historic Film,\n\n                                    Bucksport, ME, April 20, 2016.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: Founded in 1986, Northeast Historic \n     Film has built the largest existing collection of moving \n     images documenting the history and heritage of northern New \n     England. And since the founding of the National Film \n     Preservation Foundation, the NFPF has been the largest and \n     most important source of funds for preserving these works.\n       The preserved films include A Vermont Romance (1916), the \n     earliest feature film shot in Vermont; film documentation of \n     the 1927 flood; textile mill owners and workers in Maine; the \n     home movies of Charles Norman Shay, a Penobscot Indian elder \n     who is a decorated veteran of the D-Day invasion; \n     Provincetown, Massachusetts, in 1915; a 4-H club in 1946; a \n     tuberculosis sanitarium in 1934, and over two dozen other \n     examples of community life and activity in the region.\n       Communications with colleagues in archives around the \n     country inform us of the crucial significance of National \n     Film Preservation Foundation funding. Moving image \n     repositories from coast to coast benefit from NFPF grants. \n     The dedicated staff, which efficiently shepherds NFPF \n     financial resources, has ensured that our nation's heritage \n     will continue to be available for study and enjoyment.\n       We are grateful to you and NFPF's friends in Congress for \n     help in the past--and for assistance with the upcoming \n     reauthorization. Our film heritage depends on it.\n           Sincerely,\n                                    David Weiss and Karan Sheldon,\n                                Founders, Northeast Historic Film.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Cornyn):\n  S. 2895. A bill to extend the civil statute of limitations for \nvictims of Federal sex offenses; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Extending \nJustice for Sex Crime Victims Act, which is a bill to extend the time \nfor child sexual abuse victims to seek justice against their \nperpetrators.\n  I would like to thank Senator Cornyn for working closely with me on \nthis important issue.\n  Tragically, all over the country, victims of sexual abuse are coming \nforward to tell their stories of abuse and exploitation at the height \nof their innocence when they were children.\n  Several from California, for example, have contacted my office, and \ndescribed with great courage their pain and anguish.\n  Each of these individual stories represents an untold amount of pain \nand suffering. When you look at the numbers, you cannot help but feel \ndevastated.\n  Indeed, the numbers reveal that no one is too far removed from being \naffected by deplorable crimes committed against children.\n  Studies indicate that at least one in four girls and about one in \nfive boys is sexually abused.\n  It has been estimated that 90 percent of child victims never go to \nthe authorities concerning their abuse.\n  For many of these children, coming to grips with the trauma is \nextraordinarily difficult.\n  Several research studies have described in painstaking detail the \nlong-term effects that affect the physical, emotional, cognitive, and \nsocial development of abuse victims and sex trafficking victims.\n  Those who are victimized when they are children typically do not come \nforward with their abuse--if at all--until many years later, after the \nvictims reach adulthood.\n  Simply put, the bill extends the civil statute of limitations in two \nways for minor victims of Federal sex crimes--because these victims \noften need more time to realize the harm they have suffered and to seek \nredress.\n  First, the bill extends the statute of limitations until the age of \n28--from age 21--for minor victims of particular offenses, such as \nsexual abuse and child pornography.\n  This brings the statute of limitations in line with a similar law \nthat provides a civil remedy for victims of sex trafficking. The two \nlaws are sections 2255 and 1595 of Title 18.\n  This provision was recently included, at my request, in the Adam \nWalsh Reauthorization Act of 2016, which the Judiciary Committee \napproved unanimously weeks ago.\n  Second, for the laws that provide civil remedies for sex abuse and \nsex trafficking victims, the bill clarifies when the statute of \nlimitations begins to run.\n  The bill would clarify that, for both laws providing civil remedies \nfor these victims, the time for a victim to bring a claim against the \nperpetrator would not begin to run until after the victim actually \ndiscovers the injury or the violation.\n  This is significant because victims of sex crimes are sometimes \nabused even before they can remember the abuse--some as young as 3-\nyears old.\n  The bill therefore clarifies that the time for a victim to sue her \nperpetrator does not begin to run when the violation occurs, but rather \nwhen the victim first discovers the injury or the violation.\n  This is also important because victims of child pornography--who are \nalso sexually abused--may not even ``discover'' that their illegal, \npornographic images are being distributed over the internet and \nelsewhere until later in life.\n  The bill therefore ensures that minor victims have an extended period \nto seek justice against their perpetrators after discovering their \ninjury or violation.\n  Under current law, it is unclear from court opinions when victims \nmust bring their claims, and Congress must make clear it has always \nintended these victims to have an opportunity to come forward and seek \nredress.\n  I want to thank Senator Cornyn again for working so closely with me \non this issue.\n  I also want to acknowledge the support for this bill from the \nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the National Center \nfor Victims of Crime, and the Survivors Network of those Abused by \nPriests.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/senate-section/article/S2563-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2563-S2564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 447--DESIGNATING MAY 1, 2016, AS ``NATIONAL PUREBRED \n                               DOG DAY''\n\n  Mr. TILLIS submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 447\n\n       Whereas the human-canine bond predates history and \n     individuals have enjoyed the companionship and assistance of \n     dogs since the dawn of civilization;\n       Whereas dog ownership has existed in all cultures, races, \n     climates, and economic situations;\n       Whereas more than 350 dog breeds exist worldwide, and more \n     than 180 breeds are recognized by the American Kennel Club;\n       Whereas purebred dogs and breeders of purebred dogs have \n     played a crucial role in United States history, dating to \n     colonial times, during which George Washington had a foxhound \n     breeding program, which established the American Foxhound \n     breed;\n       Whereas responsible breeders of purebred dogs dedicate \n     their lives to improving the health and well-being of dogs \n     and preserving unique breeds of dogs;\n       Whereas purebred dogs were created to work alongside \n     humans, and provide inestimable service as--\n       (1) search and rescue dogs;\n\n[[Page S2564]]\n\n       (2) service dogs;\n       (3) disease detection dogs;\n       (4) police dogs;\n       (5) conservation dogs;\n       (6) livestock guardians;\n       (7) therapy dogs; and\n       (8) companions and guardians of families, homes, and \n     property;\n       Whereas purebred dogs provide unparalleled service to the \n     disabled as guide and service dogs, and are the choice of \n     leading service dog breeding programs because of the \n     heritable intelligence, and desirable and predictable \n     qualities, of purebred dogs;\n       Whereas purebred military working dogs serve alongside the \n     men and women of the United States Armed Forces in combat and \n     in peacetime;\n       Whereas breed instinct enables purebred dogs to readily \n     serve as--\n       (1) avalanche dogs;\n       (2) trackers and trailers;\n       (3) herders;\n       (4) controllers of vermin;\n       (5) water rescuers;\n       (6) carting and sled dogs;\n       (7) retrievers;\n       (8) protectors;\n       (9) hunters; and\n       (10) bird dogs;\n       Whereas the first ``National Purebred Dog Day'' was \n     established on May 1, 2015;\n       Whereas millions of individuals, through social media and \n     other avenues, recognize May 1 each year as ``National \n     Purebred Dog Day'' and desire, on May 1, to expressly \n     recognize the contributions of the purebred dog; and\n       Whereas individuals value all dogs, regardless of the \n     ancestry of the dogs, and especially cherish a purpose-bred \n     dog and the predictability of each respective breed of \n     purpose-bred dog: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates May 1, 2016, as ``National Purebred Dog \n     Day'' in celebration of purebred dogs and the many service \n     and companion benefits purebred dogs have and continue to \n     provide to the United States; and\n       (2) honors the dedicated and responsible breeders who work \n     to preserve and advance their breeds and responsible dog \n     ownership throughout the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/senate-section/article/S2564-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 448--RECOGNIZING THE ROLES AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE \n  TEACHERS OF THE UNITED STATES IN BUILDING AND ENHANCING THE CIVIC, \n         CULTURAL, AND ECONOMIC WELL-BEING OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Brown, Mr. Kirk, Mr. Cotton, Mr. Blunt, \nMrs. Capito, Mr. Moran, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Daines, Ms. Ayotte, Mr. Coons, \nMr. Booker, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Carper, Mrs. \nShaheen, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Warren, Mr. Donnelly, Ms. Hirono, Mr. \nMenendez, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Hatch) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 449\n\n       Whereas charter schools are public schools that do not \n     charge tuition and enroll any student who wants to attend, \n     often through a random lottery when the demand for enrollment \n     is outmatched by the supply of available charter school \n     seats;\n       Whereas high-performing public charter schools deliver a \n     high-quality public education and challenge all students to \n     reach the students' potential for academic success;\n       Whereas public charter schools promote innovation and \n     excellence in public education;\n       Whereas public charter schools throughout the United States \n     provide millions of families with diverse and innovative \n     educational options for children of the families;\n       Whereas high-performing public charter schools and charter \n     management organizations are increasing student achievement \n     and attendance rates at institutions of higher education;\n       Whereas public charter schools are authorized by a \n     designated entity and--\n       (1) respond to the needs of communities, families, and \n     students in the United States; and\n       (2) promote the principles of quality, accountability, \n     choice, high-performance, and innovation;\n       Whereas, in exchange for flexibility and autonomy, public \n     charter schools are held accountable by the authorizers of \n     the charter schools for improving student achievement and for \n     sound financial and operational management;\n       Whereas public charter schools are required to meet the \n     student achievement accountability requirements under the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     6301 et seq.) in the same manner as traditional public \n     schools;\n       Whereas public charter schools often set higher \n     expectations for students, beyond the requirements of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     6301 et seq.), to ensure that the charter schools are of high \n     quality and truly accountable to the public;\n       Whereas 43 States and the District of Columbia have enacted \n     laws authorizing public charter schools;\n       Whereas, as of the 2015-2016 school year, more than 6,800 \n     public charter schools served more than 2,900,000 children;\n       Whereas enrollment in public charter schools grew from \n     400,000 students in 2001 to 2,900,000 students in 2016, a \n     sixfold increase in 15 years;\n       Whereas in the United States--\n       (1) in 160 school districts, more than 10 percent of public \n     school students are enrolled in public charter schools; and\n       (2) in 14 school districts, at least 30 percent of public \n     school students are enrolled in public charter schools;\n\n       Whereas public charter schools improve the achievement of \n     students enrolled in the charter schools and collaborate with \n     traditional public schools to improve public education for \n     all students;\n       Whereas public charter schools--\n       (1) give parents the freedom to choose public schools;\n       (2) routinely measure parental satisfaction levels; and\n       (3) must prove the ongoing success of the charter schools \n     to parents, policymakers, and the communities served by the \n     charter schools or risk closure;\n       Whereas a 2015 report from the Center for Research on \n     Education Outcomes at Stanford University found significant \n     improvements for students at urban charter schools, and \n     compared to peers of traditional public schools, each year \n     those students completed the equivalent of 28 more days of \n     learning in reading and 40 more days of learning in math;\n       Whereas parental demand for charter schools is high, and \n     there was an estimated 9 percent growth in charter school \n     enrollment between fall 2014 and fall 2105;

Res. 452\n\n       Whereas on average, an individual is sexually assaulted in \n     the United States every 2 minutes, according to the Rape, \n     Abuse and Incest National Network;\n       Whereas nearly 80,000 rapes were reported to law \n     enforcement in 2013, according to the Department of Justice;\n       Whereas according to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, nearly 1 in 5 women (or 18.3 percent) and 1 in 71 \n     men (or 1.4 percent) surveyed in the United States in 2010 \n     experienced a rape or attempted rape at some time in their \n     lives;\n       Whereas sexual violence is also a burden for many \n     individuals who serve the United States, and the Department \n     of Defense estimates that approximately 19,000 members of the \n     United States Armed Forces experienced unwanted sexual \n     contact in fiscal year 2014;\n       Whereas children and young adults are at significant risk \n     of sexual assault, up to 44 percent of sexual assault victims \n     are under 18 years of age, and up to 80 percent of sexual \n     assault victims are under 30 years of age;\n       Whereas sexual assault affects women, men, and children of \n     all racial, social, religious, age, ethnic, and socioeconomic \n     groups in the United States;\n       Whereas sexual violence may take many forms, including \n     acquaintance, stranger, spousal, and gang rape, incest, child \n     sexual abuse, commercial sex trafficking, sexual harassment, \n     and stalking;\n       Whereas in addition to the immediate physical and emotional \n     costs of sexual assault, sexual assault has numerous adverse \n     consequences, which can include post-traumatic stress \n     disorder, substance abuse, major depression, homelessness, \n     eating disorders, and suicide, according to the National \n     Alliance to End Sexual Violence;\n       Whereas many sexual assaults are not reported to law \n     enforcement agencies, which enables many rapists to evade \n     punishment for their crimes;\n       Whereas as many as \\2/3\\ of sexual crimes are committed by \n     individuals who are not strangers to the victims;\n       Whereas sexual assault survivors suffer emotional scars \n     long after the physical scars of the survivors have healed;\n       Whereas advances in DNA technology have enabled law \n     enforcement agencies to potentially identify and prosecute \n     the perpetrators in tens of thousands of unsolved rape cases;\n       Whereas prosecution can lead to the incarceration of \n     rapists and prevent those individuals from committing \n     additional crimes;\n       Whereas national, State, territorial, and tribal \n     coalitions, community-based rape crisis centers, and other \n     organizations across the United States are committed to--\n       (1) increasing public awareness of sexual violence and the \n     prevalence of sexual violence;

Res. 453\n\n       Whereas each year, people in many countries throughout the \n     world, and especially in the Western Hemisphere, celebrate \n     Dia de los Ninos, or Day of the Children, on April 30th in \n     recognition and celebration of the future of their country--\n     their children;\n       Whereas children represent the hopes and dreams of the \n     people of the United States, and the well-being of children \n     remains one of the top priorities of the United States;\n       Whereas the people of the United States must nurture and \n     invest in children to preserve and enhance economic \n     prosperity, democracy, and the spirit of the United States;\n       Whereas in 2014, the Census Bureau estimated that \n     approximately 17,900,000 of the nearly 55,400,000 individuals \n     of Hispanic descent living in the United States are children \n     under 18 years of age, representing \\1/3\\ of the total \n     Hispanic population residing in the United States and roughly \n     \\1/4\\ of the total population of children in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas Hispanic Americans, the youngest and largest racial \n     or ethnic minority group in the United States, celebrate the \n     tradition of honoring their children on Dia de los Ninos and \n     wish to share this custom with all people of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas as the United States becomes more culturally and \n     ethnically diverse, the people of the United States must \n     strive to create opportunities that provide dignity and \n     upward mobility for all children;\n       Whereas the primary teachers of family values, morality, \n     and culture are parents and family members, and children are \n     responsible for passing on family values, morality, and \n     culture to future generations;\n       Whereas the importance of literacy and education is most \n     often communicated to children through family members;\n       Whereas the latest data from the National Assessment of \n     Educational Progress (referred to in this preamble as \n     ``NAEP'') indicates that Latino students continue to score \n     lower than the national average on reading assessments \n     conducted at the elementary school, middle school, and high \n     school levels--an achievement gap that has persisted for \n     decades;\n       Whereas the most recent data by NAEP demonstrates that 81 \n     percent of Latino fourth graders in public schools are not \n     proficient in reading;\n       Whereas Latino authors and Latino protagonists remain \n     underrepresented in literature for children, and less than 3 \n     percent of books for children are written by Latino authors, \n     illustrated by Latino book creators, or feature significant \n     Latino cultural content, even though \\1/4\\ of all public \n     school children are Latino;\n       Whereas research has shown that culturally relevant \n     literature can increase student engagement and reading \n     comprehension, yet some Latino students may go their entire \n     educational experience without seeing themselves portrayed \n     positively in the books that they read and the stories that \n     they hear;\n       Whereas increasing the number and proportion of \n     multicultural authors in literature for children elevates the \n     voices of the growing diverse communities in the United \n     States and can serve as an effective strategy for closing the \n     reading proficiency achievement gap;\n       Whereas addressing the widening disparities that still \n     exist among children is of paramount importance to the \n     economic prosperity of the United States;\n       Whereas the designation of a day to honor the children of \n     the United States will help affirm the significance of \n     family, education, and community among the people of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the designation of a day of special recognition for \n     the children of the United States will provide an opportunity \n     for children to reflect on their futures, articulate their \n     aspirations, and find comfort and security in the support of \n     their family members and communities;\n       Whereas families should be encouraged to engage in family \n     and community activities that include extended and elderly \n     family members and encourage children to explore and develop \n     confidence;\n       Whereas the National Latino Children's Institute, serving \n     as a voice for children, has worked with cities throughout \n     the United States to declare April 30, 2016, as Dia de los \n     Ninos: Celebrating Young Americans, a day to bring together \n     Latinos and communities across the United States to celebrate \n     and uplift children;

Res. 455\n\n       Whereas May 5, or ``Cinco de Mayo'' in Spanish, is \n     celebrated each year as a date of importance by Mexican and \n     Mexican-American communities;\n       Whereas the Cinco de Mayo holiday commemorates May 5, 1862, \n     the date on which Mexicans defeated the French at the Battle \n     of Puebla, 1 of the many battles that the Mexican people won \n     in their long and brave fight for independence, freedom, and \n     democracy;\n       Whereas the victory of Mexico over France at the Battle of \n     Puebla represented a historic triumph for the Mexican \n     government during the Franco-Mexican war of 1861-1867 and \n     bolstered the resistance movement;\n       Whereas the success of Mexico at the Battle of Puebla \n     reinvigorated the spirits of the Mexican people and provided \n     a renewed sense of unity and strength;\n       Whereas the French army, which had not experienced defeat \n     against any of the finest troops of Europe in more than half \n     a century, sustained a disastrous loss at the hands of an \n     outnumbered and ill-equipped, but highly spirited and \n     courageous, Mexican army;\n       Whereas the courageous spirit that Mexican General Ignacio \n     Zaragoza and his men displayed during that historic battle \n     can never be forgotten;\n       Whereas in a larger sense, Cinco de Mayo symbolizes the \n     right of a free people to self-determination, just as Benito \n     Juarez, the president of Mexico during the Battle of Puebla, \n     once said, ``El respeto al derecho ajeno es la paz'', meaning \n     ``respect for the rights of others is peace'';\n       Whereas the sacrifice of Mexican fighters was instrumental \n     in keeping Mexico from falling under European domination \n     while, in the United States, the Union Army battled \n     Confederate forces in the Civil War;\n       Whereas Cinco de Mayo serves as a reminder--\n       (1) that the foundation of the United States was built by \n     individuals from many countries and diverse cultures who were \n     willing to fight and die for freedom; and\n       (2) of the close ties between the people of Mexico and the \n     people of the United States;\n       Whereas Cinco de Mayo encourages the celebration of a \n     legacy of strong leaders and a sense of vibrancy in \n     communities; and\n       Whereas Cinco de Mayo serves as a reminder to provide more \n     opportunities for future generations: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the historic struggle of the people of \n     Mexico for independence and freedom, which Cinco de Mayo \n     commemorates; and\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     Cinco de Mayo with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/senate-section/article/S2567-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3884.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, \n     the United States launched Operation Enduring Freedom, and \n     since then the United States Armed Forces and the Afghan \n     National Security Forces have made countless sacrifices in \n     defending Afghanistan against the threat of terrorism and \n     insurgency and by extension the United States and the wider \n     world.\n       (2) Since 2001, the United States has worked with a broad \n     coalition of nations that has helped to dramatically improve \n     numerous development indicators within Afghanistan, \n     including--\n       (A) a dramatic increase in the number of girls enrolled in \n     primary education from an estimated 5,000 under the Taliban \n     to 2,400,000 girls as of 2010;\n       (B) an increase in the percentage of individuals above the \n     poverty line from 25.4 percent in 2002 to 35.8 percent in \n     2011;\n       (C) an increase in the percentage of individuals who now \n     have access to an improved water source in rural areas from \n     22 percent in 2001 to 56 percent in 2012;\n       (D) a precipitous decline in maternal mortality from 1200/\n     100,000 births in 1995 to 400/100,000 births in 2013; and\n       (E) an expansion of women's rights.\n       (3) Numerous research studies have shown that government \n     corruption is a driver of conflict and particularly so in \n     Afghanistan, where it has served as a powerful recruitment \n     tool for the Taliban.\n       (4) Since the first democratic transfer of power in the \n     history of Afghanistan in 2014, President Ashraf Ghani and \n     Chief Executive Officer Abdullah Abdullah have led a National \n     Unity Government that has identified key security and \n     development challenges in order to make Afghanistan a full \n     and productive member of the community of democratic nations.\n       (5) The National Unity Government has renewed specific \n     focus on addressing corruption within the country as a driver \n     of instability, including reopening a fraud case involving \n     high level officials and the Kabul Bank that resulted in the \n     disappearance of an estimated $1,000,000,000.\n       (6) In its report ``Realizing Self Reliance: Commitments to \n     Reform and Renewed Partnership'', the Government of \n     Afghanistan committed to the international community in \n     London in December 2014, to address the ``main drivers of \n     corruption in Afghanistan,'' including ``collusive \n     procurement practices, weak rule of law and abuse of the \n     legal system, and arbitrary regulations that build in \n     incentives to pay bribes''. Government of Afghanistan \n     commitments included--\n       (A) forming an independent anti-corruption commission with \n     time-bound prosecutorial powers;\n       (B) implementing recommendations by the Monitoring and \n     Evaluation Committee on a national action plan to reduce \n     corruption;\n       (C) requiring all government officials to provide public \n     declarations of their assets;\n       (D) meeting all Financial Action Task Force (FATF) \n     requirements to further limit and investigate illicit fund \n     flows;\n       (E) forming a national procurement board staffed by \n     qualified professionals who will manage all large value \n     contracts using internationally recognized standards and \n     procedures; and\n       (F) delineating the roles, responsibilities, and \n     jurisdiction of anti-corruption institutions such as the High \n     Office of Oversight and Anti-Corruption (HOO) and the \n     Attorney General to restrict them to focus on their core \n     function of enforcement instead of oversight.\n       (7) The December 2014 Government of Afghanistan report \n     ``Realizing Self Reliance: Commitments to Reform and Renewed \n     Partnership'', expressed a commitment to ``enhancing \n     productivity, growth and revenues'' by--\n       (A) developing natural resources through public-private \n     partnerships that bring in rents, taxes, and profits;\n       (B) removing obstacles to trade and transit and ending \n     smuggling that diverts revenue away from the treasury;\n       (C) negotiating expanded market access in regional and \n     global markets;\n       (D) gradually formalizing the informal economy and changing \n     the compact between the state and citizens to one where \n     citizens pay taxes for services they tangibly benefit from; \n     and\n       (E) transferring government payments electronically to \n     eliminate losses in transit.\n       (8) In 2012, international donors and the Government of \n     Afghanistan agreed to the Tokyo Mutual Accountability \n     Framework (``TMAF'') which committed to provide \n     $4,000,000,000 in economic assistance per year from 2012-2015 \n     and sustain assistance at or near the same levels of the past \n     decade through 2017, while the Government of Afghanistan \n     committed to meet benchmarks related to democracy and \n     governance, public finance and revenue generation, and \n     economic development.\n       (9) At the end of 2014, under the TMAF, the Government of \n     Afghanistan had fallen short in meeting benchmarks related \n     to: revenue collection, the enhancement of women's rights, \n     corruption and the illicit economy, and the protection of \n     human rights.\n\n[[Page S2569]]\n\n       (10) In the Joint Declaration following the London \n     Conference on Afghanistan of December 4, 2014, the \n     international community and the new Government of Afghanistan \n     agreed to refresh the existing TMAF and associated \n     commitments at the 2015 Senior Officials Meeting based on the \n     reform program and priorities as laid out by the Government \n     of Afghanistan.\n       (11) Afghanistan faces great difficulties in making \n     progress in countering illegal narcotics and remains the \n     leading global illicit opium poppy producer.\n       (12) The illegal narcotics trade results in the transfer of \n     illicit funds and encourages and also requires corrupt \n     financial transactions, and, if minimized, could have \n     beneficial impacts on trade and reduce overall levels of \n     corruption.\n       (13) The international community has endorsed Afghanistan's \n     longer-term development following the war and identified the \n     criticality of the ``transformation decade'' from 2015-2024 \n     outlined by the Government of Afghanistan and has \n     acknowledged that the Government of Afghanistan will seek \n     continued international assistance in order for it to become \n     a stable, self-sustained partner in the community of \n     democratic countries.\n       (14) As development assistance from the United States and \n     broader international community gradually diminishes in the \n     coming years, the accelerated development of the Afghan \n     private sector and governing institutions becomes even more \n     necessary to maintain the gains of the past decade and to \n     enhance our mutual goals of Afghan security and stability.\n       (15) While Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) have \n     taken over lead combat responsibilities, they continue to \n     operate in close coordination with, and with significant \n     resources from the international community, under the \n     Resolute Support Mission and in coordination with ongoing \n     counter-terrorism operations. Development of civilian \n     oversight institutions for the security sector has lagged. \n     Such oversight will be important for ensuring that Afghan \n     security forces are accountable and do not abuse their \n     powers.\n\n     SEC. 102. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON UNITED STATES ASSISTANCE AND \n                   ACCOUNTABILITY IN AFGHANISTAN.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the National Unity Government of Afghanistan has made a \n     substantial commitment to reform that should be supported but \n     also subject to heightened scrutiny by the Afghan people and \n     international donors given past failures and persistent \n     challenges in the country;\n       (2) Afghanistan is at a critical inflection point, having \n     gone through political and security transitions as the \n     international community draws down its military forces. The \n     international community should work closely with the new \n     government in supporting development priorities for the rest \n     of the transformation decade that translate into producing \n     concrete development results for the Afghan people;\n       (3) sustainable accountability and reform of Afghan \n     governing institutions will not come from the international \n     community but from a commitment by the Government of \n     Afghanistan and society reinforced by domestic watchdog \n     groups and internal government accountability monitoring \n     mechanisms;\n       (4) the United States Government should deepen its dialogue \n     on anti-corruption efforts with the Government of Afghanistan \n     to develop effective oversight mechanisms to ensure large \n     donor contracts do not contribute to corruption;\n       (5) the United States should encourage Afghanistan's \n     participation in the Open Government Partnership, a \n     multilateral initiative in which government and civil society \n     collaborate to promote transparency, fight corruption, and \n     use technologies to strengthen government;\n       (6) the United States should urge the Government of \n     Afghanistan to build upon existing anti-money laundering and \n     countering terrorism financing legislation by developing \n     effective regulations and institutions to implement reforms;\n       (7) the United States should urge the Government of \n     Afghanistan to broaden personal asset disclosures to include \n     members of the covered officials' immediate families or \n     households and develop effective mechanisms for verifying \n     disclosed information;\n       (8) in the event of future egregious cases of corruption in \n     Afghanistan, the President should impose visa bans and asset \n     freezes on those responsible, especially in instances where \n     United States assistance is stolen or misappropriated;\n       (9) the United States Government should cooperate with the \n     Government of Afghanistan and with international donors to \n     develop a series of strict accountability benchmarks based on \n     the refreshed Tokyo Mutual Accountability Framework and the \n     Government of Afghanistan's own ``Realizing Self Reliance'' \n     report commitments that will condition levels of assistance \n     and the amount of on-budget assistance on anti-corruption \n     performance acceptable to donors;\n       (10) the United States should support the Afghan Parliament \n     to refine and strengthen the legal framework of anti-\n     corruption and anti-money laundering laws to address \n     beneficial ownership, countering bid-rigging and other \n     contracting and procurement fraud, criminal investigations of \n     financial transactions, complementary banks, personal asset \n     or other financial declarations and disclosures as required \n     by law or regulation, efforts to meet FATF requirements, and \n     other areas to further inhibit the illicit flow of money;\n       (11) the commitment by the Government of Afghanistan to \n     strengthen its nascent private sector should be supported and \n     sustained using the full array of tools of the United States, \n     including technical and legal assistance;\n       (12) United States assistance to the Afghan judicial system \n     and other Afghan legal institutions that enable and empower \n     private sector development by instilling greater investor \n     confidence should be prioritized to ensure the protection of \n     private property, the sanctity of contracts, and effective \n     dispute resolution mechanisms for businesses and investors;\n       (13) the United States Government should identify \n     opportunities for the United States to introduce trade \n     facilitation as part of the economic relationship between the \n     2 countries;\n       (14) the Governments of the United States and Afghanistan \n     should work together to identify more Afghan products and raw \n     materials to be included on the United States Generalized \n     System of Preferences (GSP) treatment list;\n       (15) the American University of Afghanistan is an emerging \n     pillar in Afghanistan's education system and has provided a \n     unique opportunity for higher education for Afghan youth, \n     especially women; and\n       (16) the United States should encourage the Government of \n     Afghanistan to implement with urgency electoral reforms in \n     accordance with the ``Agreement between the Two Campaign \n     Teams Regarding the Structure of the National Unity \n     Government''.\n\n     SEC. 103. UNITED STATES ASSISTANCE POLICY FOR AFGHANISTAN.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to conduct assistance programs that result in highly \n     effective, impact driven development outcomes for the people \n     of Afghanistan while maintaining the highest standards of \n     accountability for United States taxpayers;\n       (2) that all United States Government agencies and entities \n     working in Afghanistan coordinate, plan, and regularly review \n     plans in a coherent, well-informed process to develop United \n     States policy and assistance programming;\n       (3) to support the development of effective Government of \n     Afghanistan oversight institutions and domestic watchdog \n     civil society organizations;\n       (4) subject to significant evident progress made in meeting \n     TMAF accountability and improved governance as it relates to \n     development, to abide by resource commitments made as part of \n     the Tokyo Mutual Accountability Framework;\n       (5) to provide incentivized assistance to Afghanistan's \n     governing institutions based upon verifiable and measurable \n     development outcomes and on-budget assistance based upon \n     demonstrated capacity improvements that are mutually agreed \n     to by the Government of Afghanistan and Government of the \n     United States;\n       (6) to support the development of democratic governing \n     institutions in Afghanistan, promote the development of a \n     growing private sector, and strengthen civil society in \n     Afghanistan;\n       (7) to recognize that Afghanistan's sustainable development \n     is grounded in growing the regional economy, and to support \n     the efforts of the Government and people of Afghanistan to \n     build strong regional economic connectivity with the \n     country's neighbors;\n       (8) to support, where appropriate, proven programs that \n     promote private sector job creation in Afghanistan; and\n       (9) that assistance programs in direct support of Afghan \n     women and girls remain a priority for the United States, \n     including specific efforts to support women and girls \n     education, meaningful engagement in political and \n     reconciliation processes, training and recruitment of Afghan \n     female police and security forces, advancement of women's \n     legal rights, economic development, and efforts to increase \n     the overall health and well-being of Afghan women and girls.\n\n     SEC. 104.

DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term \n     ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--\n       (A) the Committee on Foreign Relations, the Committee on \n     Appropriations, the Committee on Armed Services, and the \n     Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate; and\n       (B) the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Committee on \n     Appropriations, the Committee on Armed Services, and the \n     Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of \n     Representatives.\n\n      TITLE I--EFFECTIVE AFGHANISTAN ASSISTANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY\n\n     SEC. 101. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, \n     the United States launched Operation Enduring Freedom, and \n     since then the United States Armed Forces and the Afghan \n     National Security Forces have made countless sacrifices in \n     defending Afghanistan against the threat of terrorism and \n     insurgency and by extension the United States and the wider \n     world.\n       (2) Since 2001, the United States has worked with a broad \n     coalition of nations that has helped to dramatically improve \n     numerous development indicators within Afghanistan, including \n     a dramatic increase in the number of girls enrolled in \n     primary education from an estimated 5,000 under the Taliban \n     to 2,400,000 girls as of 2010; an increase in the percentage \n     of individuals above the poverty line from 25.4 percent in \n     2002 to 35.8 percent in 2011; an increase in the percentage \n     of individuals who now have access to an improved water \n     source in rural areas from 22 percent in 2001 to 56 percent \n     in 2012; a precipitous decline in maternal mortality from \n     1200/100,000 births in 1995 to 400/100,000 births in 2013; \n     and an expansion of women's rights;\n       (3) Numerous research studies have shown that government \n     corruption is a driver of conflict and particularly so in \n     Afghanistan, where it has served as a powerful recruitment \n     tool for the Taliban.\n       (4) Since the first democratic transfer of power in the \n     history of Afghanistan in 2014, President Ashraf Ghani and \n     Chief Executive Officer Abdullah Abdullah have led a National \n     Unity Government that has identified\n\n[[Page S2574]]\n\n     key security and development challenges in order to make \n     Afghanistan a full and productive member of the community of \n     democratic nations.\n       (5) The National Unity Government has renewed specific \n     focus on addressing corruption within the country as a driver \n     of instability, including reopening a fraud case involving \n     high level officials and the Kabul Bank that resulted in the \n     disappearance of an estimated $1,000,000,000.\n       (6) In its report ``Realizing Self Reliance: Commitments to \n     Reform and Renewed Partnership'', the Government of \n     Afghanistan committed to the international community in \n     London in December 2014, to address the ``main drivers of \n     corruption in Afghanistan,'' including ``collusive \n     procurement practices, weak rule of law and abuse of the \n     legal system, and arbitrary regulations that build in \n     incentives to pay bribes''. Government of Afghanistan \n     commitments included--\n       (A) forming an independent anti-corruption commission with \n     time-bound prosecutorial powers;\n       (B) implementing recommendations by the Monitoring and \n     Evaluation Committee on a national action plan to reduce \n     corruption;\n       (C) requiring all government officials to provide public \n     declarations of their assets;\n       (D) meeting all Financial Action Task Force (FATF) \n     requirements to further limit and investigate illicit fund \n     flows;\n       (E) forming a national procurement board staffed by \n     qualified professionals who will manage all large value \n     contracts using internationally recognized standards and \n     procedures; and\n       (F) delineating the roles, responsibilities, and \n     jurisdiction of anti-corruption institutions such as the High \n     Office of Oversight and Anti-Corruption (HOO) and the \n     Attorney General to restrict them to focus on their core \n     function of enforcement instead of oversight.\n       (7) The December 2014 Government of Afghanistan report \n     ``Realizing Self Reliance: Commitments to Reform and Renewed \n     Partnership'', expressed a commitment to ``enhancing \n     productivity, growth and revenues'' by--\n       (A) developing natural resources through public-private \n     partnerships that bring in rents, taxes, and profits;\n       (B) removing obstacles to trade and transit and ending \n     smuggling that diverts revenue away from the treasury;\n       (C) negotiating expanded market access in regional and \n     global markets;\n       (D) gradually formalizing the informal economy and changing \n     the compact between the state and citizens to one where \n     citizens pay taxes for services they tangibly benefit from; \n     and\n       (E) transferring government payments electronically to \n     eliminate losses in transit.\n       (8) In 2012, international donors and the Government of \n     Afghanistan agreed to the Tokyo Mutual Accountability \n     Framework (``TMAF'') which committed to provide \n     $4,000,000,000 in economic assistance per year from 2012-2015 \n     and sustain assistance at or near the same levels of the past \n     decade through 2017, while the Government of Afghanistan \n     committed to meet benchmarks related to democracy and \n     governance, public finance and revenue generation, and \n     economic development.\n       (9) At the end of 2014, under the TMAF, the Government of \n     Afghanistan had fallen short in meeting benchmarks related \n     to: revenue collection, the enhancement of women's rights, \n     corruption and the illicit economy, and the protection of \n     human rights,\n       (10) In the Joint Declaration following the London \n     Conference on Afghanistan of December 4, 2014, the \n     international community and the new Government of Afghanistan \n     agreed to refresh the existing TMAF and associated \n     commitments at the 2015 Senior Officials Meeting based on the \n     reform program and priorities as laid out by the Government \n     of Afghanistan.\n       (11) Afghanistan faces great difficulties in making \n     progress in countering illegal narcotics and remains the \n     leading global illicit opium poppy producer.\n       (12) The illegal narcotics trade results in the transfer of \n     illicit funds and encourages and also requires corrupt \n     financial transactions, and, if minimized, could have \n     beneficial impacts on trade and reduce overall levels of \n     corruption.\n       (13) The international community has endorsed Afghanistan's \n     longer-term development following the war and identified the \n     criticality of the ``transformation decade'' from 2015-2024 \n     outlined by the Government of Afghanistan and has \n     acknowledged that the Government of Afghanistan will seek \n     continued international assistance in order for it to become \n     a stable, self-sustained partner in the community of \n     democratic countries.\n       (14) As development assistance from the United States and \n     broader international community gradually diminishes in the \n     coming years, the accelerated development of the Afghan \n     private sector and governing institutions becomes even more \n     necessary to maintain the gains of the past decade and to \n     enhance our mutual goals of Afghan security and stability.\n       (15) While Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) have \n     taken over lead combat responsibilities, they continue to \n     operate in close coordination with, and with significant \n     resources from the international community, under the Train, \n     Advise and Assist (TAA) mission of Operation Inherent Resolve \n     and in coordination with ongoing counter-terrorism \n     operations. Development of civilian oversight institutions \n     for the security sector has lagged. Such oversight will be \n     important for ensuring that Afghan security forces are \n     accountable and do not abuse their powers.\n\n     SEC. 102. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON UNITED STATES ASSISTANCE AND \n                   ACCOUNTABILITY IN AFGHANISTAN.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the National Unity Government of Afghanistan has made a \n     substantial commitment to reform that should be supported but \n     also subject to heightened scrutiny by the Afghan people and \n     international donors given past failures and persistent \n     challenges in the country;\n       (2) Afghanistan is at a critical inflection point, having \n     gone through political and security transitions as the \n     international community draws down its military forces. The \n     international community should work closely with the new \n     government in supporting development priorities for the rest \n     of the transformation decade that translate into producing \n     concrete development results for the Afghan people;\n       (3) sustainable accountability and reform of Afghan \n     governing institutions will not come from the international \n     community but from a commitment by the Government of \n     Afghanistan and society reinforced by domestic watchdog \n     groups and internal government accountability monitoring \n     mechanisms;\n       (4) the United States Government should deepen its dialogue \n     on anti-corruption efforts with the Government of Afghanistan \n     to develop effective oversight mechanisms to ensure large \n     donor contracts do not contribute to corruption;\n       (5) the United States should encourage Afghanistan's \n     participation in the Open Government Partnership, a \n     multilateral initiative in which government and civil society \n     collaborate to promote transparency, fight corruption, and \n     use technologies to strengthen government;\n       (6) the United States should urge the Government of \n     Afghanistan to build upon existing anti-money laundering and \n     countering terrorism financing legislation by developing \n     effective regulations and institutions to implement reforms;\n       (7) the United States should urge the Government of \n     Afghanistan to broaden personal asset disclosures to include \n     members of the covered officials' immediate families or \n     households and develop effective mechanisms for verifying \n     disclosed information;\n       (8) in the event of future egregious cases of corruption in \n     Afghanistan, the President should impose visa bans and asset \n     freezes on those responsible, especially in instances where \n     United States assistance is stolen or misappropriated;\n       (9) the United States Government should cooperate with the \n     Government of Afghanistan and with international donors to \n     develop a series of strict accountability benchmarks based on \n     the refreshed Tokyo Mutual Accountability Framework and the \n     Government of Afghanistan's own ``Realizing Self Reliance'' \n     report commitments that will condition levels of assistance \n     and the amount of on-budget assistance on anti-corruption \n     performance acceptable to donors;\n       (10) the United States should support the Afghan Parliament \n     to refine and strengthen the legal framework of anti-\n     corruption and anti-money laundering laws to address \n     beneficial ownership, countering bid-rigging and other \n     contracting and procurement fraud, criminal investigations of \n     financial transactions, complementary banks, personal asset \n     or other financial declarations and disclosures as required \n     by law or regulation, efforts to meet FATF requirements, and \n     other areas to further inhibit the illicit flow of money;\n       (11) the commitment by the Government of Afghanistan to \n     strengthen its nascent private sector should be supported and \n     sustained using the full array of tools of the United States, \n     including technical and legal assistance;\n       (12) United States assistance to the Afghan judicial system \n     and other Afghan legal institutions that enable and empower \n     private sector development by instilling greater investor \n     confidence should be prioritized to ensure the protection of \n     private property, the sanctity of contracts, and effective \n     dispute resolution mechanisms for businesses and investors;\n       (13) the United States Government should identify \n     opportunities for the United States to introduce trade \n     facilitation as part of the economic relationship between the \n     two countries;\n       (14) the Governments of the United States and Afghanistan \n     should work together to identify more Afghan products and raw \n     materials to be included on the United States Generalized \n     System of Preferences (GSP) treatment list;\n       (15) the United States Government should establish a United \n     States-Afghan Tax Commission to help spearhead a rapid and \n     successful conclusion of a new Bilateral Tax Agreement \n     similar to the Agreements with several of Afghanistan's \n     neighbors, including Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, \n     Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, India, and Pakistan;\n       (16) the American University of Afghanistan is an emerging \n     pillar in Afghanistan's education system and has provided a \n     unique opportunity for higher education for Afghan youth, \n     especially women; and\n       (17) the United States should encourage the Government of \n     Afghanistan to implement with urgency electoral reforms in \n     accordance with the ``Agreement between the\n\n[[Page S2575]]\n\n     Two Campaign Teams Regarding the Structure of the National \n     Unity Government''.\n\n     SEC. 103. UNITED STATES ASSISTANCE POLICY FOR AFGHANISTAN.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to conduct assistance programs that result in highly \n     effective, impact driven development outcomes for the people \n     of Afghanistan while maintaining the highest standards of \n     accountability for United States taxpayers;\n       (2) that all United States Government agencies and entities \n     working in Afghanistan coordinate, plan, and regularly review \n     plans in a coherent, well-informed process to develop United \n     States policy and assistance programming;\n       (3) to support the development of effective Government of \n     Afghanistan oversight institutions and domestic watchdog \n     civil society organizations;\n       (4) subject to significant evident progress made in meeting \n     TMAF accountability and improved governance as it relates to \n     development, to abide by resource commitments made as part of \n     the Tokyo Mutual Accountability Framework;\n       (5) to provide incentivized assistance to Afghanistan's \n     governing institutions based upon verifiable and measurable \n     development outcomes and on-budget assistance based upon \n     demonstrated capacity improvements that are mutually agreed \n     to by the Governments of Afghanistan and the United States;\n       (6) to support the development of democratic governing \n     institutions in Afghanistan, promote the development of a \n     growing private sector, and strengthen civil society in \n     Afghanistan;\n       (7) to recognize that Afghanistan's sustainable development \n     is grounded in growing the regional economy, and to support \n     the efforts of the Government and people of Afghanistan to \n     build strong regional economic connectivity with the \n     country's [neighbors; and]\n       (8) [to support, where appropriate, proven programs that \n     promote private sector job creation in Afghanistan.] \n     neighbors;\n       (8) to support, where appropriate, proven programs that \n     promote private sector job creation in Afghanistan; and\n       (9) that assistance programs in direct support of Afghan \n     women and girls remain a priority for the United States, \n     including specific efforts to support women and girls \n     education, meaningful engagement in political and \n     reconciliation processes, training and recruitment of Afghan \n     female police and security forces, advancement of women's \n     legal rights, economic development, and efforts to increase \n     the overall health and well-being of Afghan women and girls.\n\n     SEC. 104.

Mr. President, today I submitted a bipartisan \nresolution recognizing that April is Sexual Assault Awareness and \nPrevention Month. Senators Leahy, Ayotte, Casey, Ernst, and Gillibrand \nhave joined as cosponsors of the resolution, and I thank them for their \nsupport.\n  Our purpose in introducing the resolution is to bring greater \nawareness to the problem of sexual assault and publicly acknowledge the \nsurvivors. According to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, \nsomeone is sexually assaulted every two minutes, on average, in the \nUnited States. Sexual assault can take many forms, including rape, \ncommercial sex trafficking, child sexual abuse, and stalking.\n  Rape, which is the second most violent crime in the United States--\nsecond only to murder, according to the FBI--can happen to anyone. \nAccording to the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence, the \nconsequences of rape can be profound for its victims, and may include \npost-traumatic stress disorder, depression, or even suicide.\n  In communities across the United States, Americans have commemorated \nthe month of April with activities designed to support survivors of \nsexual violence in their efforts to heal. Before the month comes to a \nclose, it is important that Congress also express its support for the \ngoals and ideals of Sexual Assault Awareness Month.\n  I would also like to take a moment to mention several other \nbipartisan, anti-sexual assault measures that I have championed during \nthe month of April, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting \nthese initiatives too.\n  First, just last week, the Senate Judiciary Committee, of which I \nserve as chairman, cleared legislation that's designed to help sexual \nassault victims secure justice. I incorporated this language into the \nAdam Walsh Reauthorization Act, a measure I introduced earlier this \nyear at the urging of a young woman who survived a sexual assault and \nfounded an organization, RISE, that's dedicated to helping other \nsurvivors.\n  The measure reported by our committee by voice vote on April 20th \nwould amend the federal crime victims' statute to add a number of new \nrights specific to sexual assault survivors. If it's enacted, victims \nof federal crimes of sexual violence would have the right not to be \nprevented from, or charged for, receiving a medical forensic exam. They \nwould have the right to have a sexual assault evidence collection kit \npreserved, without charge, until the statutory limitations period for \nprosecuting the crime has expired or ten years has elapsed. They would \nhave the right to be informed of the results when their forensic \nevidence is analyzed. And they would have the right to written notice \nof policies governing their evidence kit's collection and preservation, \nas well as the right to notice if that evidence is about to be \ndiscarded.\n  The latest version of the Adam Walsh Reauthorization also would make \nJustice Department grants available to entities that notify sexual \nviolence victims of any applicable rights under state law. Finally, \nthis legislation would extend the statutory period in which child \nsurvivors of human trafficking and child sexual abuse offenses can file \nsuit against the perpetrators. The bill has been endorsed not only by \nRISE but also by the National Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren, the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, and the National \nAlliance to End Sexual Violence. Senators Schumer, Hatch, Feinstein, \nLeahy, Shaheen, Coons, Durbin, and Klobuchar have joined as cosponsors.\n  Also last week, I joined Senator Gillibrand in calling on President\n\n[[Page S2577]]\n\nObama to take additional steps to investigate military sexual assault. \nWe contacted the President to voice our concerns shortly after an \norganization known as Protect Our Defenders released a report \nquestioning the accuracy of congressional testimony by a Pentagon \nofficial during a hearing on sexual assault in the military.\n  Last but not least, due to my concerns about campus sexual assault, I \nam an original cosponsor of the Campus Accountability and Safety Act. I \njoined Senators Heller, McCaskill, Gillibrand, Ayotte, and others in \nintroducing this bill last year. It would make additional support \nservices available to student survivors of campus rape, require \ntraining standards and uniform discipline procedures for campus \nofficials, and add transparency requirements for the Nation's \nuniversities. Earlier this week, the cosponsors of this measure came \ntogether to publicly call for prompt action on this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I will close by urging my colleagues to support \nadoptoin of the resolution we have submitted today.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolutions be agreed to, the preambles be agreed to, and the motions \nto reconsider be laid upon the table en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolutions were agreed to.\n  The preambles were agreed to.\n  (The resolutions, with their preambles, are printed in today's Record \nunder ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Khan.\n       (4) According to the 2014 DoD report, ``North Korea also \n     provided Syria with nuclear reactor technology until 2007.''.\n       (5) On September 6, 2007, as part of ``Operation Orchard'', \n     the Israeli Air Force destroyed the suspected nuclear \n     facility in Syria.\n       (6) According to the 2014 DoD report, ``North Korea has \n     exported conventional and ballistic missile-related \n     equipment, components, materials, and technical assistance to \n     countries in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.''.\n       (7) On November 29, 1987, DPRK agents planted explosive \n     devices onboard Korean Air flight 858, which killed all 115 \n     passengers and crew on board.\n       (8) On March 26, 2010, the DPRK fired upon and sank the \n     South Korean warship Cheonan, killing 46 of her crew.\n       (9) On November 23, 2010, the DPRK shelled South Korea's \n     Yeonpyeong Island, killing 4 South Korean citizens.\n       (10) On February 7, 2014, the United Nations Commission of \n     Inquiry on human rights in DPRK (in this subsection referred \n     to as the ``Commission of Inquiry'') released a report \n     detailing the atrocious human rights record of the DPRK.\n       (11) Dr. Michael Kirby, Chair of the Commission of Inquiry, \n     stated on March 17, 2014, ``The Commission of Inquiry has \n     found systematic, widespread, and grave human rights \n     violations occurring in the Democratic People's Republic of \n     Korea. It has also found a disturbing array of crimes against \n     humanity. These crimes are committed against inmates of \n     political and other prison camps; against starving \n     populations; against religious believers; against persons who \n     try to flee the country--including those forcibly repatriated \n     by China.''.\n       (12) Dr. Michael Kirby also stated, ``These crimes arise \n     from policies established at the highest level of the State. \n     They have been committed, and continue to take place in the \n     Democratic People's Republic of Korea, because the policies, \n     institutions, and patterns of impunity that lie at their \n     heart remain in place. The gravity, scale, duration, and \n     nature of the unspeakable atrocities committed in the country \n     reveal a totalitarian State that does not have any parallel \n     in the contemporary world.''.\n       (13) The Commission of Inquiry also notes, ``Since 1950, \n     the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has engaged in the \n     systematic abduction, denial of repatriation, and subsequent \n     enforced disappearance of persons from other countries on a \n     large scale and as a matter of State policy. Well over \n     200,000 persons, including children, who were brought from \n     other countries to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea \n     may have become victims of enforced disappearance,'' and \n     states that the DPRK has failed to account or address this \n     injustice in any way.\n       (14) According to reports and analysis from organizations \n     such as the International Network for the Human Rights of \n     North Korean Overseas Labor, the Korea Policy Research \n     Center, NK Watch, the Asian Institute for Policy Studies, the \n     Center for International and Strategic Studies, and the \n     George W. Bush Institute, there may currently be as many as \n     100,000 North Korean overseas laborers in various nations \n     around the world.\n       (15) Such forced North Korean laborers are often subjected \n     to harsh working conditions under the direct supervision of \n     DPRK officials, and their salaries contribute to anywhere \n     from $150,000,000 to $230,000,000 a year to the DPRK state \n     coffers.\n       (16) According to the Director of National Intelligence's \n     2015 Worldwide Threat Assessment, ``North Korea's nuclear \n     weapons and missile programs pose a serious threat to the \n     United States and to the security environment in East \n     Asia.''.\n       (17) The Worldwide Threat Assessment states, ``North Korea \n     has also expanded the size and sophistication of its \n     ballistic missile forces, ranging from close-range ballistic \n     missiles to ICBMs, while continuing to conduct test launches. \n     In 2014, North Korea launched an unprecedented number of \n     ballistic missiles.''.\n       (18) On December 19, 2015, the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation declared that the DPRK was responsible for a \n     cyberattack on Sony Pictures conducted on November 24, 2014.\n       (19) From 1988 to 2008, the DPRK was designated by the \n     United States Government as a state sponsor of terrorism.\n       (20) The DPRK is currently in violation of United Nations \n     Security Council Resolutions 1695 (2006), 1718 (2006), 1874 \n     (2009), 2087 (2013), and 2094 (2013).\n       (21) The DPRK repeatedly violated agreements with the \n     United States and the other so-called Six-Party Talks \n     partners (the Republic of Korea, Japan, the Russian \n     Federation, and the People's Republic of China) designed to \n     halt its nuclear weapons program, while receiving significant \n     concessions, including fuel, oil, and food aid.\n       (22) The Six-Party Talks have not been held since December \n     2008.\n       (23) On May 9, 2015, the DPRK claimed that it has test-\n     fired a ballistic missile from a submarine.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the DPRK represents a serious threat to the national \n     security of the United States and United States allies in \n     East Asia and to international peace and stability, and \n     grossly violates the human rights of its own people;\n       (2) the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the \n     Treasury should impose additional sanctions against the DPRK, \n     including targeting its financial assets around the world, \n     specific designations relating to human rights abuses, and a \n     redesignation of the DPRK as a state sponsor of terror; and\n       (3) the President should not resume the negotiations with \n     the DPRK, either bilaterally or as part of the Six-Party \n     Talks, without strict preconditions, including that the \n     DPRK--\n       (A) adhere to its denuclearization commitments outlined in \n     the 2005 Joint Statement of the Six-Party Talks;\n       (B) commit to halting its ballistic missile programs and \n     its proliferation activities;\n       (C) cease military provocations; and\n       (D) measurably and significantly improve its human rights \n     record.\n\n    TITLE II--ORGANIZATION AND PERSONNEL OF THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE\n\n                   Subtitle A--Organizational Matters\n\n     SEC. 201.
