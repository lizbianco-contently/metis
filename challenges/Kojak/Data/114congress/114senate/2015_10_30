Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 1:01 a.m. will be equally divided between the two leaders or \ntheir designees.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to waive the \nmandatory quorum call with respect to the motion to concur in the House \nmessage to accompany H.R. 1314.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, earlier this week the White House and \ncongressional leadership announced a budget deal that will avert a \npotential shutdown of the Federal Government and prevent a default on \nour country's obligations. This agreement would provide relief to the \narbitrary sequester\n\n[[Page S7666]]\n\ncaps for 2 years and maintain the full faith and credit of the United \nStates by extending the debt limit to March 2017.\n  For months we have been calling on both sides to abandon any reckless \nbudget cuts and work together to give the American people much needed \nrelief from the sequester. I applaud President Obama and the leaders \nfrom both political parties for crafting a commonsense solution that \nprotects the American people and our economic recovery.\n  This measure passed the House of Representatives, and now it is our \nturn. This agreement calls for $112 billion in sequester relief, \nproviding necessary funding for critical programs on which many \nAmericans depend. With this additional funding, dramatic cuts in these \nprograms can be avoided.\n  Yesterday I spoke about the importance of biomedical research. \nFunding for the National Institutes of Health can lead to medical \nbreakthroughs that keep us healthier and save money in the long run. \nOne illustration: One American is diagnosed with Alzheimer's every 67 \nseconds in America, and $1 out of every $5 spent in the Medicare system \nis spent for those suffering from Alzheimer's and dementia. The numbers \nare growing, the cost is growing, and the research is imperative. If we \ncan find a way to delay the onset of Alzheimer's, treat it, cure it, \nfor goodness' sake, it not only will spare human suffering, but it will \nsave our budget. So is money for medical research well spent? Of \ncourse. Yet in past years we have shortchanged it in the name of budget \nrelief.\n  Well, this is a moment where we can keep our promise to the NIH, to \nthe CDC, and many other agencies that are responsible for medical \nresearch. Thanks to bipartisan support--and I especially note the \nSenator from Missouri, Roy Blunt, as well as the Senator from \nWashington, Patty Murray--we are going to see an increase in the Senate \nbill this year for NIH if the Senate number continues, and I hope that \nit does. But it shouldn't come at the expense of other programs, such \nas the Centers for Disease Control, which faces cuts in our version of \nthe bill and receives better treatment in the House. We can't be the \nworld leader in biomedical research by cutting funding for NIH or CDC.\n  We should also restore funding for community health centers and \nsubstance abuse and mental health programs. As I travel around the \nState of Illinois, our State, like most States, is facing a heroin \nepidemic. We find that the overdoses and deaths associated with heroin \nare now striking a part of our population that they never struck \nbefore. The prevalence of death from heroin in America in the last 15 \nyears has changed dramatically, and now most of the victims are White, \nbetween the ages of 18 and 44. And that means we have to do something \nabout it, not only in policing--which is, of course, our \nresponsibility--but also when it comes to treatment for those who are \naddicted. We can't cut back in substance abuse and mental health \nprograms without paying a heavy price and inviting more human \nsuffering.\n  We need to ensure that the FDA has the funding to fully implement the \nFood Safety Modernization Act.\n  The money in this budget agreement will help us reach these goals and \nmany others. We can work together to chip away at the $850 million \nunderinvestment in programs that help our veterans, ensuring that those \nwho put their lives on the line for America are given the care, the \nrespect, and the quality education they deserve.\n  We should use some of the sequester relief in the budget deal to fund \ntransit programs and transportation, if necessary. I am proud to \nrepresent the city of Chicago. Our mass transit is essential. We, of \ncourse, stand by our infrastructure as well when it comes to highways, \nbridges, and rail service, but it is important that our mass transit \nsystems across America be maintained.\n  The core capacity and TIGER grants--popular grant programs that have \nbenefited the entire Nation--were facing cuts in early versions of \nbills. We can reverse it.\n  Senate Republicans funded the HOME Program, which is $66 million. \nThat was a 93-percent reduction in funding for this essential housing \nprogram. We can start to restore money in that area.\n  Without the sequester relief provided in the budget deal, $770 \nmillion would be cut from America's schools. Who in the world thinks \nthat cutting spending on education is the best thing for America in the \n21st century? We don't want to eliminate critical title I funding for \nthe most vulnerable kids in America. In my home State of Illinois \nalone, that amounts to a cut of about $40 million if we stuck with the \noriginal budget figures. Now, with this agreement, we could provide \nmore money for education for the most vulnerable kids.\n  This agreement also protects our seniors by preventing Medicare Part \nB premium increases and deep cuts to Social Security disability \ninsurance that were scheduled to occur next year. It also extends SSDI \nsolvency to 2022 and prevents a 20-percent across-the-board cut in \ndisability benefits.\n  The idea of sequester relief is not a new one. A similar agreement to \nthe one we are voting on this morning was reached in 2013 between \nSenator Patty Murray and then-Congressman Paul Ryan, who yesterday was \nsworn in as the new Speaker of the House. That had widespread \nbipartisan support. This should as well. It was the right thing to do \nthen, and it is the right thing to do now.\n  Government by manufactured crisis is no way to do the American \npeople's business. After months of uncertainty, we have before us a \nplan to remove the seemingly constant threat of defaults and shutdowns.\n  The new Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, was very candid yesterday in \nacknowledging the broken system in the U.S. House of Representatives, \nand I think he could point to our side of the Rotunda as well, which \nhas a desperate need for more bipartisan solutions. Our work is not \ndone even with this agreement.\n  I encourage my colleagues to continue in the spirit of compromise and \na shared goal of growing our American economy and providing fairness to \nAmerican citizens. Let's pass appropriations bills free of ideological \npolicy riders that seek to divide us.\n  I look forward to joining my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in \npassing this bill. Let's get back to work and face the critical issues \nwhich American families face every single day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, yesterday Chairman Hatch and I began \nmanaging this legislation on the floor of this distinguished body. It \nseems to me that speaking for more than a couple of minutes at this \npoint would just be excessive, but I think I want to summarize what the \ncentral question is at this late hour.\n  It would be fair to say that we have spirited debates in the Senate, \nand fiscal battles that play out in this Chamber take place at \nvirtually every new cycle and certainly with every election. That is as \nit should be. That ensures that we have vigorous debate about important \nissues the Founding Fathers wanted this Senate to be part of. But that \nmust never endanger the sterling economic reputation our country has \nbuilt over the generations, and passing this legislation, in my view, \nhelps to preserve that reputation.\n  With this bipartisan legislation, it is possible to avert a \ncatastrophic default and a mindless sequester, which would give an \nopportunity that the President, the Senate, and I care a great deal \nabout, and that would be the opportunity to come up with smart, \neffective, targeted reforms, such as fixing the broken system of \nfighting wildfires in our country. That system is broken today. With \nthis legislation and the opportunity to bring a bit more flexibility to \nthe cause of reforming our government, there will be an opportunity on \na bipartisan basis to fix that broken policy which has consumed, \nliterally and figuratively, so much of our land in the West.\n  To me, having the opportunity to prevent a government shutdown and \ndemonstrate once more that our country pays its debts and pays them on \ntime is central to our obligations in the Senate--obligations we must \nmeet on a bipartisan basis.\n  The reality is, as it has been for decades, that America is the \neconomic rock in tumultuous seas with this legislation. Once again, we \npreserve our status, our prestige, with the ability to\n\n[[Page S7667]]\n\nsay to the world: America pays its debts. Our full faith and credit is \nintact.\n  The reality is the cycle of fiscal crisis has gone on for far too \nlong. To me, the Senate ought to view this legislation as, in effect, a \nspringboard to go back to very different and robust and bipartisan \nbudget debates. The people of this country--certainly the people of my \nState--expect Senators on both sides of the aisle and of differing \nphilosophies to come together to solve the big economic challenges \nahead.\n  The reality is, if you count the votes here in the Senate, to get the \nimportant work done, you have to find some common ground. Neither side \ncan forge the progress we need here in this body all by itself. So \nlet's pass this bipartisan legislation tonight, and let's reaffirm our \npledge to protect the full faith and credit of the United States.\n  This evening I urge my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, \nto support this important legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Will the Senator delay his \nsuggestion?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Yes. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nduring the quorum call be allocated equally.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, the number one threat to our country's \nfuture is our debt. The number one threat to our national security is \nour debt. This deal gives the President the power to borrow unlimited \namounts of money. This deal represents the worst of Washington culture. \nThe left and the right have come together in an unholy alliance to \nexplode the debt. The left gets more welfare, the right gets more \nmilitary contracts, and the taxpayer is stuck with the deal.\n  This is a bipartisan busting of the budget caps that will further \nindenture our next generation. I promised the voters of Kentucky to \noppose deficits, to oppose budgets that don't balance, and to spend \nonly that which comes in. I will not give this President any power to \nborrow unspecified amounts of money. Our debt now equals our entire \neconomy. Not raising the debt ceiling means we would be forced to only \nspend what comes in--also known as a balanced budget. I could accept \nthat. But I can also accept a balanced budget that brings us to balance \nover 5 years. The debt threatens us like never before, and now is the \ntime to take a stand. I have traveled far and wide across America. I \nhave not met one voter outside of DC who supports adding an unlimited \nincrease to the debt ceiling.\n  I hope my colleagues will listen and will listen very clearly to \ntheir constituents before voting for this terrible, rotten, no-good \ndeal. The time is now to take a stand. The time is now to say enough is \nenough--no more debt. The very foundation of our country is threatened \nby the addition of debt. This is precisely the time when we should be \nusing the leverage of raising the debt ceiling to exact budgetary \nreforms.\n  In 2011, that is exactly what we did. We had a compromise that worked \nin the right direction. We had a compromise that said we will set \nlimits on both the military and the domestic spending. Instead, what we \nhave today is an unholy alliance of right and left. We wonder why the \ndeficit grows no matter which party is involved, no matter which party \nis in charge. The deficit continues to grow because, frankly, many are \nnot serious about reducing the debt. Many up here are serious only \nabout increasing spending for their sacred cow.\n  The true compromise that is necessary in America is for both right \nand left to say enough is enough, to say that the particular interests \nthey have in spending money is hurting the country. It is time for the \nright to say: You know what; the country is not stronger by going \nfurther in debt. The country actually, I believe, is weaker. We do not \nproject power from bankruptcy court.\n  I think the time is now. Enough is enough. We shouldn't be adding \nmore debt. The left needs to acknowledge this as well. The left may say \nthis is for humanitarian purposes, we want to help people. I don't \ndoubt their motives, but I do doubt whether you can help people from \nbankruptcy court. I think we are weakening our country.\n  One of the reasons why we have been able to help so many people in \nour country is that we are the richest, most humanitarian country in \nthe history of mankind. In the year 2014 alone, we gave away nearly \n$400 billion in private charity in this country. I fear that will not \ncontinue to last. I fear that as this deficit mounts, as the debt \nmounts, they will drag us down.\n  Already some economists estimate that we are losing a million jobs a \nyear because of the burden of debt. I think what we need to do is to \nhave compromise in Washington, but the compromise needs to be that the \nright and the left need to say we don't have enough money at this \npoint. Some say we need to have military readiness. But this week in \nthe Armed Services Committee, they talked about $20 billion of waste in \none program within the military. We have had Secretaries of the Cabinet \nDepartments and a Secretary of the Navy saying: You know what; we can \nsave money within the Pentagon. But if we keep adding to the top line, \nif we keep adding more money, if we keep spending good money after bad, \nwe are going to bankrupt the country.\n  I hope my colleagues will listen to their constituents, because I \nhave been in 40 of the 50 States and I have yet to meet a single voter \nwho says: Keep adding to the debt; keep spending more money.\n  What I find is the opposite. They say: Work together to save the \ncountry. Work together not to add more debt.\n  This debt ceiling vote does something that is unprecedented. It \ndoesn't even add a certain amount to the debt. It adds an unspecified \namount. Over the next year or year and a half, we will add as much debt \nas can be crammed into the budget, as much money as can be spent. There \nwill be no limit. We are giving an unspecified amount of borrowing \npower to the President. I don't care whether it is a Democratic \nPresident or a Republican President. It is unconscionable to give \nunlimited borrowing authority to the President.\n  As we contemplate this decision, we need to think beyond the short \nterm. We need to think beyond the short term of self-constituencies on \neither side of the aisle and say enough is enough. We don't have the \nmoney. Let's take a stand now and try to reform the process before it \nis too late.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to once again express my support for \nthe Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 and urge my colleagues to vote in \nfavor of invoking cloture on this legislation.\n  As I have said before, this is not a perfect bill, and I haven't \nheard anyone argue that it is. Indeed, any Senator looking for a reason \nto vote against this budget deal could easily find one.\n  However, at the same time, this bill will accomplish a number of \nimportant tasks and clear a number of hurdles out of our way to allow \nus to govern more effectively in the coming months.\n  For example, the bill will suspend the statutory debt limit through \nmid-March of 2017, eliminating the threat of an immediate default and \nensuring that conflicts over the debt limit do not get swept up in the \npoliticking and pandering of next year's election campaign.\n  This bill will also extend the life of the Social Security Disability \nInsurance--or SSDI--trust fund for an additional 6 years, preventing \nmassive benefit cuts to disabled American workers and removing the \ncurrent uncertainty. It actually goes further than that, putting in \nplace SSDI reforms that are the most significant changes to any Social \nSecurity program in more than 30 years--not an insignificant \naccomplishment.\n  In addition, this legislation will prevent millions from seeing huge \npremium hikes in the Medicare Part B Program, again ensuring that our \nseniors don't suffer as a result of political\n\n[[Page S7668]]\n\ngridlock and grandstanding in Congress.\n  And it will repeal an unpopular and obviously ineffective provision \nfrom the so-called Affordable Care Act: the employer auto-enrollment \nrequirement.\n  Finally, the bill will partially lift the budget caps established \nunder the Budget Control Act. And, while I share my colleague's \nconcerns about rolling back real spending cuts, I think that it is \nimportant to note that the bill does not add to the debt, nor does it \nraise taxes. Even more important is the fact that it will increase \nfunding for our military at a time when we face so many challenges and \npotential conflicts in the world.\n  As I said earlier in this debate, sometimes--many times, in fact--\ngoverning effectively is about the art of the doable. While neither the \nsubstance of this bill nor the process that got us here are ideal for \nanyone, we need to take a close look at where we are and, more \nimportantly, where we want to be in the near future.\n  I won't speak for anyone else, but I personally would rather focus on \nsubstantive, long-term solutions to the problems plaguing our country \nthan spending so much time navigating from crisis to crisis. Meaningful \nand lasting policies are very rarely crafted or enacted when we are \nspeeding toward a cliff, and this bill would eliminate a number of \ncliffs in our very near future and give us a real chance to do more \ngood for the American people.\n  Therefore, in addition to voting to move this bill forward, I want to \ncall on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle--particularly those \nwho have real reservations about the legislation before us today--to \nwork with me on these issues. I currently chair the Senate committee \nwith jurisdiction over many of these areas, and I have been working for \na number of years to address these problems.\n  I want to reform our entitlement programs in order to put our debt on \na sustainable trajectory.\n  I want to put in place fundamental, long-term fixes for the SSDI \nprogram and Social Security more generally.\n  And I want to work to get long-term spending under control.\n  I know many of my colleagues share these desires, and nothing in this \nbill prevents us from doing more work to get us where so many of us \nwant to be. I am willing to work with anyone--Republican or Democrat--\nto get us there.\n  But it will be extremely difficult to do any of this with ticking \nclocks hanging over our heads. That is why, once again, I urge my \ncolleagues to vote to move this bill forward.\n  This bill has been an important undertaking. And I know that many of \nour leaders are taking no small amount of criticism for the work they \nhave done to put it together. I want to thank them for their efforts \nand particularly for their willingness to set aside partisanship and \npolitical expedience to do what needs to be done.\n  Most notably, I want to thank Speaker Boehner for his efforts in \ncrafting this compromise and getting it across the finish line. He had \na difficult road over in the House of Representatives--being Speaker of \nthe House is never an easy job. Even if you disagreed with Speaker \nBoehner, which I did from time to time, you could never doubt his \ncommitment to the people he represented in Congress and his courage to \nalways do what he believed was the right thing for the American people.\n  While I have every confidence in the new Speaker of the House--\nSpeaker Ryan and I have worked well together on a number of issues, and \nI think we can all acknowledge that he is an effective leader--I have \nto say that Speaker Boehner will be missed.\n  I also have to once again thank our distinguished majority leader \nhere in the Senate. He also has a difficult job and is no less willing \nto take a lot of heat and put up with a lot of criticism in order to do \nthe right thing. Under Senator McConnell's leadership, the Senate is \nfinally a functioning body where things actually get done. Things \nhaven't gone perfectly--they never do--but, I expect that, as time goes \non, things will continue to get better.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  If no one yields time, the time will be charged equally to both \nsides.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

On this vote, the yeas are 63, the \nnays are 35.\n  Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Cloture having been invoked, the motion to refer falls.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, could we have order.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, the No. 1 threat to our country's future is \nour debt. The No. 1 threat to our national security is our debt. When \nAdmiral Mullen was asked about the debt in the recent past, he said \nthat it is indeed the debt that is the No. 1 threat to our national \nsecurity.\n  This deal gives the President the power to borrow unlimited amounts \nof money. This is extraordinary in the sense that we are not to specify \nhow much money the President can borrow; we are to allow the President \nto borrow unlimited amounts of money.\n  This deal represents the worst of Washington culture. One of the \ncolloquial ways of putting this is guns and butter. What this deal does \nis allow one side to have more guns and one side to have more butter. \nIt is the old proverbial guns and butter that is bankrupting this \ncountry.\n  Often people want to point fingers in Washington and out in the \ncampaign hustings and they want to say, well, it is Democrats' fault or \nit is Republicans' fault. What this bill shows is it\n\n[[Page S7669]]\n\nis really the fault of both parties. There is an unholy alliance in \nWashington between right and left, frankly, and it is the guns and \nbutter caucus. On the right they say we need more money for military. \nOn the left they say we need more money for welfare. So they get \ntogether, there is a secret handshake, we spend more money on \neverything, and the country is going bankrupt as a consequence.\n  We borrow $1 million every minute. This threatens the very foundation \nof our country. If we ask people--and I think if we ask people \nthroughout America, Republican, Democrat, or Independent--if we ask \nthem whether or not it is a good idea to continue to borrow money \nwithout reforming what we do, to continue borrowing money at an \nalarming rate, they would say enough is enough; we should spend only \nwhat comes in.\n  Now, some have said we shouldn't negotiate over something like \nraising the debt ceiling, that it might potentially cost us our bond \nrating. But the interesting thing is that in 2011 when we had this \ndiscussion, what we found was that actually our bond rating went down, \nand the S bond rating agency said that it went down because we failed \nto enact meaningful budgetary reform.\n  Mr. President, could we have order.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. PAUL. Often people wonder why the deficit gets worse, either \nunder Republicans or under Democrats. Under the previous Republican \nadministration, the debt doubled. It went from $5 trillion to $10 \ntrillion. Under this administration, it will go from $10 trillion to \nabout $20 trillion, although we don't know the exact number because we \nare now letting the President borrow an unspecified amount of money. \nBut we are on target to add more debt under this President than all of \nthe previous Presidents combined.\n  People ask: Why does this go on? Where are the fiscal conservatives? \nI guess I would maintain that there are very few fiscal conservatives \non either side of the aisle. Both sides of the aisle have what I would \ncall sacred cows. On the right they have the sacred cow of military \ncontracts. And then the interesting thing is they say: We don't have \nenough money to properly defend the country. But the interesting thing \nis that when you look at military spending, we actually spend more on \nour military than the next 10 countries combined. Think about it. \nRussia, China, and eight more countries--add up all of their military \nspending, and it still doesn't equal what we spend on the military.\n\n  Since 9/11 we have increased our military spending by 50 percent. How \ndo we do that? How do we get the money for the military? It only \nhappens by a compromise with the other side. The other side will \nsometimes resist excessive spending in the military, but they say: You \nknow what; we will give it to you if you give us what we want. So the \nleft wants more domestic spending; the left wants more welfare. The \nright wants more military spending. So what is the unholy alliance? \nWhat is the great compromise? This is being touted as a bipartisan \ncompromise. Well, it is a bipartisan busting of the budget caps. It is \na bipartisan compromise that is ruining the country.\n  The No. 1 threat to our national security is the debt. So for those \nwho say that we just need more military spending and somehow we will be \nsafer, I think we are actually becoming less safe as we get further and \nfurther mired in debt. We need to seek something like the opposite of \nthis compromise. We could have compromise, but I think the compromise \nwould be that the right acknowledges that we don't have an unlimited \ntreasury and that we actually are making the country weaker by \nhollowing the country from the inside out through this massive debt \nthat we are accumulating.\n  I don't think you project power from bankruptcy court. To the left, I \nwould say: If your goal is humanitarian, if your goal is to help people \nwho are in need, if your goal is to help the poor and help those who \ncan't help themselves, we are doing a disservice to the country if we \nare going further into bankruptcy to do so. We have to understand what \nthe contrast is.\n  We have to understand the contrast between our country and other \ncountries. One of the great contrasts and one of the things about \nAmerica that allows us to be the most humanitarian nation probably in \nthe history of man is this engine of capitalism. The engine of \ncapitalism, however, I think, is being brought down. The engine of \ncapitalism is being burdened by this enormous anchor of debt.\n  I think we really should be concerned about whether we can continue \nto do the things we do to help our fellow man if we are burdened by \nthis debt. So I think both the right and the left mistake their purpose \nhere in the short run by saying: Well, we are going to get what we \nwant--more money, more money, more money. Frankly, we don't have any \nmoney. We are borrowing money at $1 million every minute.\n  There has been much discussion as I traveled around the country. \nThere has been much discussion about education. People say they want \nfree education for everyone. They say we should just give education to \neveryone. Well, the interesting thing is this: Do you know to whom we \ngive free education? We give $15 million of free education to foreign \nstudents just for community college. The things that go and riddle \nthrough the government of what we are spending money on and the reason \nwe never get reform is because we are doing this unholy compromise when \nwe are not going through item after item after item of waste.\n  I will give you a couple of examples of the waste that exists in \ngovernment. We spent $800,000 last year in Afghanistan on a televised \ncricket league--a televised cricket league for Afghanistan, $800,000. \nThey don't even have televisions in Afghanistan. Why does this go on? \nWhy are we never able to fix any of these problems? Because of the \nunholy compromise between the right and left that skirts these issues \nand continues to blithely go on.\n  We do not self-examine what is wrong with government because we \nbundle government into one large continuing resolution in which there \nis no self-examination of waste.\n  We spent $150,000 on yoga classes for Federal employees. We spent \n$200,000 last year studying whether Japanese quail are more sexually \npromiscuous when they are on cocaine. The American public is outraged \nat the waste.\n  Even within the Defense Department we have had hearings just this \nweek that said we wasted $20 billion on one program. This program is \ncalled Future Combat Systems. So we waste money, but nobody is fixing \nit. The American people are asking themselves: Why does it go on? Why \nis there never any reform? Why? Because there is an unholy alliance \nbetween the right and the left. Everybody gets what they want. The \nright will get more military money, and the left will get more welfare \nmoney--guns and butter in abundance. Who gets stuck with the bill? The \ntaxpayer. The taxpayer is stuck and burdened with the bill, and we have \nmade our future generations indentured servants. We are making the next \ngeneration bear the burden of our profligate ways, and there is no \nsustained force to say enough is enough.\n  When we look at waste in the military, former Secretary of the Navy \nJohn Lehman, who was the youngest Secretary of the Navy under Reagan, \nhas said that he believes we do need to modernize our navy. He thinks \nwe do need more ships. But he also says we should pay for it by \nreducing the costs in the Pentagon by reducing the bureaucracy in the \nPentagon. When John Lehman was Secretary of the Navy there were seven \njoint task forces. There are now 250 joint task forces.\n  But here is what I would ask you: We have this program about which we \npointed this out last week called Future Combat Systems--$20 billion \nworth of waste in the Pentagon. Do you think it is going to get fixed \nif we raise the level of money we spend? The only way waste is ever \nferreted out is if we lower the amount. If you lower the top line \nnumber, if you lower the amount of money that is given, waste will have \nto be ferreted out. In fact, what we need are the constraints of the \nmarketplace that ferret out waste within the private marketplace.\n  The opposite happens in government. When you look at government \nspending and you look at it department by department, what really \nhappens is the opposite. As each department gets to the end of their \nfiscal year, what do they do with the remaining money? They spend it. \nThey try to spend their money at the end so they will get it the next \nyear.\n\n[[Page S7670]]\n\n  I proposed a budgetary reform which wouldn't fix the entire \ngovernment, but it would actually do something I think to lead us in \nthe right direction. I proposed legislation that I think actually would \nhelp to right some of the problems and try to have correct incentives \nin the way we spend our money, both on the military side as well as on \nthe domestic side. I would give all Federal employees bonuses based on \ncost savings. When the American people read about the waste throughout \ngovernment, they say: How come it never gets better? Do you want to \nknow why Congress has a 10-percent approval rating? Because you guys \njust raise all the money. You blithely go on, rubberstamp, and give the \nmoney. We have to go for the weekend. But there are ways that we could \nreform this. If you gave bonuses to Federal employees for finding \nsavings, then you would have the correct incentive--the same kind of \nincentive that you have in private business, which tries to maximize \nprofit by reducing costs.\n  In government, though, you never get that. In the government people \nkeep spending their money and spending their money. In fact, what we \ndiscovered is that as the fiscal year comes to a close, spending \naccelerates and multiplies. People spend more money in the last month \nthan they spend in the other 11 months. They spend more money in the \nlast week than they spend in the early weeks. They spend more money in \nthe last day of the fiscal year than on any other day of the year. In \nfact, as the sun rises and as the sun sets, you can watch the spending \naccelerate on the last day of the fiscal year. As 5 o'clock approaches \nin the East, there is a fury to spend money. As the sun continues into \nthe West and to Federal agencies in California, they are spending it \nlike crazy as 5 p.m. approaches.\n  Why don't we fix any of these problems? We don't fix them because we \nhave become a rubberstamp and we give everybody what they want. The \nright gets their money for guns, the left for butter. Guns and butter \nare bankrupting the country.\n  What we really need are fiscal conservatives. You can be liberal and \nbe a fiscal conservative. You can be conservative and be a fiscal \nconservative. But the problem we have now is that there are people on \nthe right who are actually liberal with military spending. I don't \nthink you can be a fiscal conservative if you are for unlimited \nspending for the military.\n  If you look at what we are spending on the Pentagon, if you look at \nwhat we are spending on military spending, we spend more than all the \nnext 10 countries combined. We have increased our defense spending by \n50 percent. Perhaps we should look at the amount spent and try to \nferret out waste and try to figure out what is working and what is not \nworking. While we are doing it, we should think--and we should think \nlong and hard--about whether or not we want to get back involved with \nanother war in Iraq.\n  The first war in Iraq cost us $1 trillion. In Afghanistan we have now \nspent more than the entire Marshall Plan. We don't have a lot to show \nfor it. Many of the things that have been built in Afghanistan have \nbeen wasted. Much money has been stolen. There are stories repeatedly \nof the Karzai family being involved in drugs and drug running and money \nbeing wasted and squandered.\n  We have to decide this: What is our mission currently in Afghanistan? \nWhat is the purpose of our mission in Afghanistan? What is the purpose \nof our mission currently in Iran and Iraq? Are we going to be back in \nIraq with another half million troops over there? Are we prepared to \nspend another trillion dollars in another war in Iraq?\n  The message that I am trying to get across tonight is that it is not \nthe fault of one party or another. It is the fault of both parties. I \nthink the American people actually recognize this because essentially \nthere is a universal disdain for all of those in office. If you have \nmissed this, if you haven't noticed this, you are missing out on \nsomething big that is happening in America. What is happening in \nAmerica is that people are very, very upset that nothing seems to \nimprove, that the waste continues on and the spending continues on.\n  Look at projects that are wasteful. I will give you another example \nof a project that really annoys people. This project is one where we \nspent $250,000 bringing 24 kids from Pakistan and bringing them to \nSpace Camp in Alabama. There are hundreds and hundreds of these \nprojects. We have American kids who can't afford to go to Space Camp in \nAlabama. What in the world are we doing borrowing money from China to \nsend it to Pakistan to bring some of their kids to Space Camp? It is \noutrageous. We are bankrupting the country with this, and it goes on \nand on.\n  One of the reasons there is never any reform in our spending is \nbecause we don't address spending the way we properly should. There are \n12 different departments of government and about 10 years ago was the \nlast time that we actually passed appropriation bills. So there are 12 \ndepartments of government. We should pass them and exercise the power \nof the purse by passing the individual appropriations bills. If we were \nto do that, that is when we would begin to reform. That is when we \nwould begin to say that we don't have the money to spend on this. That \nis when we would ask tough questions.\n  But Congress has become a shell of itself. Congress has become so \nminiscule as to be almost insignificant. This is with regard to almost \nall policy. The executive branch writes the regulations. The executive \nbranch fights the wars, and we do nothing. We have been at war almost \nconstantly for the last 20 years. We have been at war in Syria and now \nin Iraq for over a year, and yet Congress has not weighed in.\n  Congress has not voted to give the President any authority. Some will \nsay: Well, we gave him that authority on 9/11. Well, go back and read \nthe use of authorization of force from 9/11. Read the use of \nauthorization of force and see what is in there. What you will find is \nin there is that it was directed toward those who attacked us on 9/11. \nWell, they did not attack us from Iraq. Iraq had nothing do with 9/11. \nYet we use that same resolution from 15 years ago.\n  Think about the absurdity of this. Think about the absurdity of using \na resolution from 2001 to fight war forever. Really, can a vote from a \nCongress--and probably more than half of us were not part of that \nCongress in 2001--can that vote really be used to bind generation after \ngeneration after generation in perpetual war?\n  We find also that it is both sides really. Both sides have supported \nthe war in Iraq. You had Hillary Clinton support the war when she was \nhere. She now runs away from this. But you also have Hillary Clinton \nwho is still involved with wanting us to be back involved in Syria, \ncalling for a no-fly zone.\n  Before we get involved, should we not have a debate in Congress? \nThere is an extraordinary amount of money that is spent. There is an \nextraordinary amount of lives that are lost. In the Iraq war, we spent \nover $1 trillion, but we lost also nearly 5,000 of our brave young men \nand women over there.\n  The problem in Washington--and this is an interesting point--many in \nthe media point out that the problem is incivility and not getting \nalong. I guess I would argue the opposite, that we get along too well, \nthat compromise actually comes too easy, and that when you look at \nwhether there is enough discussion on whether the debt is harming us, \nthere is actually too much agreement on both sides and lack of concern \nreally for the debt.\n  So you have both sides coming together with this bill to basically \nsay that we are going to give the President an unspecified and \nunlimited amount of borrowing power. I think that is bad for the \ncountry.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. PAUL. I think I would prefer to finish up. You know what, I think \neach Senator can have an hour. I would love it if you would fulfill the \nnext hour and make points about why we really are spending our country \ninto oblivion. But I think I am going to finish my hour.\n  Mr. President, can you tell me how much time I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has approximately 38 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. PAUL. Good.\n  When we look at the problem here, it is not really a problem that \ninvolves a\n\n[[Page S7671]]\n\nlack of compromise. What we have is both right and left have come \ntogether--and not just tonight, right and left have been coming \ntogether for a long time up here. Right and left have been saying: You \nscratch my back, and I will scratch yours. Basically, the compromise \nis, we both get what we want. The right's sacred cow is military \nspending. The left's sacred cow is domestic welfare spending. Both \nsides end up getting what they want, but as a consequence, we borrow $1 \nmillion every minute.\n  Many economists have said that our debt is actually the biggest \nthreat to our future. Many economists have actually said that our debt \nis actually costing us about 1 million jobs a year. Kids ask me: What \nabout a job? What are you going to do to create jobs? What are we going \nto do to keep America strong, to keep America producing and \nmanufacturing and creating millions of jobs?\n  I think it is the wrong thing to add more debt. I think it is wrong \nto spend money you don't have. So often up here, everybody looks and \nsays ``Well, I am going to do this with the money'' when, indeed, the \nfirst thing we should be asking is where the money is going to come \nfrom. We borrow the money from China, often to send it to Pakistan. We \nhave sent billions of dollars to Pakistan.\n  I will give you an example of where we could save some money, and yet \nthere seems to be very little interest for saving money in Washington. \nI put forward an amendment I think about 6 months ago in the Foreign \nRelations Committee. My amendment said that any country that persecutes \nChristians should not get any of our foreign aid. I have asked people \nabout this in Kentucky and across the country: Should a country that \npersecutes Christians get any of our foreign aid? I have not met \nanybody who is in favor of that, and yet almost everybody here is for \nit. The vote was 18 to 2 in the committee to continue sending foreign \naid to countries that persecute Christians.\n  You say: Well, how are you defining that? How do you define the \npersecution of Christians.\n  Pretty easily, actually. We define it as any country that puts a \nChristian to death or puts anyone to death for criticizing the state \nreligion. In Pakistan, it is the death penalty if you criticize the \nstate religion. It is the death penalty if you convert from the state \nreligion to any other religion. Yet we pour billions of dollars in \nthere.\n  When I tried to end the practice of sending money to countries that \npersecute Christians, the response from the other side was, well, this \nmoney is not going to those who are persecuting Christians, the money \nis going to the moderates to influence their behavior. The problem is \nthat there is no objective evidence that they are changing their \nbehavior. If you look over the last dozen years, you look over the last \ntwo decades in Pakistan, are they becoming more friendly to America? \nAre they changing the laws so they don't persecute Christians? Well, it \nis actually probably the opposite. In some ways, there has been more \nradicalization of Pakistan.\n  I will give you an example--Asia Bibi. Asia Bibi is a Christian. \nThere are not many Christians left in Pakistan. Asia Bibi went to the \nwell in a small Muslim village. She went to the well to draw water. As \nshe was drawing water, they began to stone her. They stoned her and \nbeat her with sticks until she was a bloody pulp. As she lay on the \nground crying out for help and hoping that someone would show up, \nfinally the police came. As the police came, this Christian woman, Asia \nBibi--when the police came, they did not help her, they arrested her. \nShe was arrested and accused of criticizing the state religion. What is \nour response? Our response is to send more money to Pakistan.\n  We continue to send money--good money after bad--to countries that \nabuse their citizenry. Look at a country like Saudi Arabia. Many people \nhave forgotten that 16 out of the 19 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia. \nWe still have some questions from the 9/11 report that do discuss Saudi \nArabia, the possibility of Saudi Arabia's involvement in the 9/11 \nattacks. We also have a Saudi Arabia that has a horrendous human rights \nrecord. This is a question that has been put forward. Some have said \nthat really their goal is to support women's rights, such as Hillary \nClinton. Yet she has taken tens of millions of dollars from Saudi \nArabia.\n  In Saudi Arabia, there was a young woman who was 17. They called her \nthe Girl of Qatif. She was raped. She was gang-raped by seven men. When \nthey finally brought about justice in Saudi Arabia, their idea of \njustice was that the girl who was raped was publicly whipped. She was \nwhipped for being in the car with an unmarried man.\n  If you think foreign aid and selling weapons to a country like Saudi \nArabia is going to change their behavior, you have got another thing \ncoming. If you think selling weapons to Saudi Arabia or selling weapons \nto Egypt is somehow changing their behavior or creating a warm fuzzy \nfeeling in the hearts of Saudi Arabians or Egyptians for us, you have \ngot another thing coming.\n  Over a period of time, we sent $60 billion to Egypt. Probably one-\nthird to half of that was stolen by one family, the Mubarak family. We \nalso sold a lot of weaponry to them. They ended up using some of the \nweaponry on their own people.\n  As protesters gathered in Tahrir Square in Cairo about a year ago, as \nthese protests were occurring and hundreds of thousands of people were \nshowing up, when Mubarak was still in power, Mubarak attempted to quell \nthe protest. He attempted to stifle the crowd by spraying tear gas on \nthe crowd. That is bad enough, to try to quell protests with brute \nforce, but what made it doubly bad is when the Egyptians bent over and \nthey picked up the empty cartridge from the tear gas, it said, ``Made \nin Pennsylvania.''\n  You see, I think America is a great country. I think by our example \nand by our trade and by our diplomatic engagement with the world, we \nare the shining light for the world. But when we sell weapons to \ncountries that then use those weapons to suppress their own people, I \nam not so sure that helps American relations around the world.\n  We should participate as a body more in how the money is being spent. \nI think this is one of the points of this resolution. When we see that \nwe are giving an unspecified amount of borrowing power to the \nPresident--we have done it both ways in the past. We have done it this \nway in the past, and I think it is wrong--it was wrong then. But we \nhave also done it when we have allowed the President to borrow certain \namounts. Many people have argued: We should not have a debt ceiling. We \nshould never have this problem. It is too disruptive, and we should let \nthem borrow as much as they want.\n  I really think the opposite. I think we need to put a closer rein on \nwhat actually happens in government. But I think we also need to \nspecify and lay out the entire budget. A good example of this is when \nwe had the Ebola outbreak, and people were looking for money, and they \nsaid there was not enough money. It turns out there was plenty of \nmoney, but the money was being spent on a lot of bizarre things that \ncome out of the NIH. We looked and we found that over $2 million was \nbeing spent on origami condoms. Well, I think we are fairly good on the \nscience of condoms, and an extra $2 million on origami condoms was \nperhaps not the best use of money. But when you bring out these \noutrageous spending examples, you think: Well, certainly we are going \nto fix it, right?\n  Every year I think for the past 20 years there has been a waste book \nproduced. The waste book has hundreds and hundreds of items that should \nbe eliminated. Why are they in there every year? Why have we never \nfixed any of this? It is because we don't do individual appropriations \nbills, we don't look at the individual bills and say: This is how we \nwill reform it.\n  Some have said: We are not passing those appropriations bills because \nyou are trying to tell the President how to spend the money.\n  Yes. That is what we are supposed to do. That is what the power of \nthe purse is.\n  If you ask people around the country what are the things they are \nmost unhappy about, I know from talking to Republicans and \nconservatives that the thing they are most unhappy about with us--and \nwhen I say ``unhappy,'' I mean really unhappy--they are unhappy that we \nare not exercising the power of the purse, that basically we are a \nrubberstamp for Big Government.\n\n[[Page S7672]]\n\n  Others will argue--they will say: We need to be the adults in the \nroom and we need to govern. We need to govern seamlessly with no \nhiccups.\n  I would say there are two potential problems here. You could argue \nthat, well, by letting us get close to the brink on the debt ceiling or \ngetting close to running out of money, that is disruptive and sends a \nbad signal to the marketplace. You could argue in the short run that \nmaybe that is disruptive. But you could also argue that it is \nincredibly disruptive to the country to keep borrowing money at $1 \nmillion a minute. So I think you have to weigh which is worse. Is it \nworse to keep borrowing money at $1 million a minute or is it worse to \nactually have a little bit of uncertainty about the debt ceiling?\n  With regard to the debt ceiling, though, if you look at the debt \nceiling and ask whether we would ever default, we bring in, in tax \nrevenue, about $250 billion a month. Our interest payments lately have \nbeen averaging about $30 billion. There is actually no risk of \ndefaulting at all.\n  We should do the opposite. Instead of scaring the marketplace and \nsaying that there is any chance of default, we should say that we have \nno intention of defaulting. We should say that we will not default. In \nfact, we have legislation--I have actually introduced legislation; it \nis called the Default Protection Act. It says that we will not default. \nIt says that the first thing we will spend out of our revenue would be \nfor our interest. It also says that out of our revenue we would pay for \nSocial Security. We would fully fund it. We would pay for Medicare and \nfully fund it. We would pay for our soldiers' salaries. We would pay \nfor veterans affairs.\n  People say: Well, we have little else.\n  You know, then maybe the question should be--maybe government should \nnot be doing much beyond interest, soldiers' salaries, veterans \naffairs, Medicare, and Social Security. Maybe that is what government \nshould do and nothing else, at least until we got caught up again, at \nleast until we had as much money coming in.\n  What would happen if we did not raise the debt ceiling? If we don't \nraise the debt ceiling, we have a balanced budget. Is it really so \nawful to concede that we would only spend what comes in? Every American \nfamily does it. Every American family only spends what comes in. I \nthink it would be good for the country to do that.\n  But there is an even better way. What many conservatives have offered \nis something called cut, cap, and balance. This is a way we could raise \nthe debt ceiling, and we would temporarily raise it for about a 5-year \nperiod. We would raise the debt ceiling in a gradual manner over about \na 5-year period. The reason you would do that and the reason I would \nvote for that is I would vote for it because we would be balancing the \nbudget. So cut, cap, and balance, we would cut the deficit in half in 1 \nyear. It is the best way to get on a good footing. Let's go ahead and \ncut out a significant amount in 1 year, and then it makes it a lot \neasier in the successive years if you hold the line.\n\n  Calvin Coolidge was incredible with this kind of stuff. In Amity \nShlaes' book she goes through in exquisite detail--wonderful detail--\nhow he ended up balancing the budget. In those days the President was \npaid a pretty good amount for those days. I think it was about \n$100,000, but everything came out of their salary. So when an \nambassador for France came for dinner, the dinner came out of \nCoolidge's salary. So Coolidge would be down in the kitchen after \ndinner saying: I noticed we cooked five hams. I think we could have \ndone with four hams.\n  That was the kind of handle he had on expenditures. He also had a \nhandle on expenditures throughout government, and he met every week \nwith the Treasury Department. He met every week with the Cabinet \nSecretary to say: This is how we are going to stop spending money. This \nis how we are going to stop wasting money.\n  Cut, cap, and balance is an alternative to what we are putting \nforward. I think if we were a true, open, and deliberative body we \nwould have a vote on that, but no vote has been scheduled for cut, cap, \nand balance. So those of us--and I think there were a significant \nnumber who said that this was not a good deal. Those of us who believe \nit to be not a good deal were not allowed the opportunity to have an \nalternative.\n  The alternative we have is called cut, cap, and balance. In cut, cap, \nand balance, we would cut the debt or cut the deficit in half in 1 \nyear. We would cap spending.\n  This deal actually does the opposite of capping spending. This deal \nactually gets rid of the caps and exceeds the caps on spending. We \nwould cap spending at 18 percent of GDP. That means you would multiply \n18 percent by the total dollar amount of the economy and that is what \nwe would spend.\n  Why did we choose 18 percent? We chose 18 percent because that is \nabout what comes in historically on average. If you look over the past \n20 years, we have occasional times when we bring more money in, \noccasional times when we bring in less, but on average we bring in \nabout 18 percent. So really if you want to balance your spending--which \nwould be the responsible thing if we were responsible adults, if we \ncared about the American people, cared what they thought, and cared \nthat they were worried about the debt we were adding--we would spend \nabout what comes in. So 18 percent is about what comes in. If we spent \n18 percent, we would have a balanced budget.\n  I think people ought to think about it in this perspective: We bring \nin $3 trillion. Our problem isn't so much how much money comes in, our \nproblem is that we spend in excess of what comes in.\n  Couldn't we just spend what comes in? Couldn't we spend $3 trillion? \nCouldn't we have a strong country? I think we would actually be a \nstronger country if we spent only what comes in. We wouldn't have \n``no'' government, and in some ways we might have a government that was \neven bigger than I desire. If we only spent what comes in, if we spent \nthe $3 trillion--and that is all we spent--think how strong we would \nbecome again as a country. Think about the strength of our marketplace, \nthe strength of the stock market, the strength of our job creation if \nwe were only spending what comes in.\n  This is not a new problem. It has accelerated under this President, \nbut I think we should be very ecumenical with the blame. There is \nenough blame to go around. I think there is an unholy alliance. The \nproblem in Washington is not lack of cooperation, it is too much \ncooperation. We have decided, right and left, that we want to spend \nmore money, but we don't have the money. So what do we do? We say we \nare going to simply borrow it, but there are repercussions to \nborrowing. There are repercussions to spending money we don't have. I \nthink this is a point in time when we should reevaluate. It is a point \nin time where maybe you ought to spend time and go home.\n  I know when I am at home I don't meet anybody who is for this deal. \nThose who vote for this deal--maybe if you are from a State that isn't \nconcerned about the budget, isn't concerned about the debt, you may get \naway with it, but I think people are going to have a rude awakening \nwhen they get home because outside of DC the antipathy for this deal is \nrising. The anger is rising. The belief that basically everybody needs \nto be sent home from Washington is a rising sentiment in the country \nbecause we don't appear to be listening.\n  If you ask people--and I ask people all the time. Do you think we \nought to have term limits? The answer is yes.\n  Would the Parliamentarian inform me of how much time remains.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Capito). The Senator has 19 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. PAUL. When I have discussed this issue with folks at home, with \nconstituents in Kentucky, the question they ask me is, How can you give \nthe President an unspecified amount to borrow? Weren't you elected to \ntry to stop this? I was elected in 2010 when the tea party movement \narose. The tea party movement arose--and this is an interesting, maybe \nsome say, historical fact--the tea party arose not so much in criticism \nof Democrats; the tea party folks weren't those who really believed the \nDemocrats would be fiscally responsible. The tea party arose because \nthey were concerned that Republicans weren't being fiscally \nresponsible. The tea party arose largely as a rebuke to the Republican \nParty. The tea party arose and said: You know what, bailing out the \nbanks wasn't something the average middle class,\n\n[[Page S7673]]\n\nordinary, conservative Republican supported. We didn't support the \nbailouts. We didn't support President Obama's huge and enormous \ngovernment stimulus, nearly $1 trillion. We also don't support \nborrowing or lending money for these programs. There are two ways you \ncan stop this. You can stop this by voting against the spending, which \nthere doesn't seem to be a significant amount of will in this body on \neither side of the aisle to stop and discontinue this profligate \nspending. So it is spending and borrowing, spending and borrowing. \nWhich comes first? Well, they go hand-in-hand, but it is a real \nproblem. I think it is a problem that threatens the very fabric of our \ncountry, and it is why I ran for office.\n  The reason I ran for office is because I was concerned we were \naccumulating so much debt that we were piling on debt that ultimately \ncould lead to the destruction of our country. People say: Well, we are \na strong country. The debt will never bring us down.\n  We are at a point where our debt basically just about equals our \neconomy, 100 percent of our economy, and that is a tipping point. Many \neconomists who look at the economics of nations have looked at that and \nsaid: We are at a tipping point. We are at a point where if we do \nnothing, if we continue to give a blank check to the government, if we \ngive a blank check to this President for his final year in office, what \nmight happen?\n  This is a President who is going to add more debt than all of the \nprevious Presidents combined, and we are going to give him a blank \ncheck? Those who vote for this deal will be giving the President a \nblank check. They will say: You can borrow whatever you want. Fill in \nthe blank.\n  That ought to be the title of this bill: ``Fill in the blank.''\n  How much debt do you want? Fill in the blank.\n  There is no specific amount. This bill will allow for unlimited \naddition of debt. This bill is exactly why people are upset and angry \nwith Washington.\n  The fact that this bill is going to slide through is exactly why \nCongress has about a 10-percent approval rating. People here scratch \ntheir heads and can't figure it out. This is why. They don't want you \nto act like adults and govern over this enormous debt. They want you to \nact. They want you to do something. They want you to quit the borrowing \nand spending.\n  The lesson that needs to be learned is that this isn't one-sided. \nThis is not the fault of one party, this is a two-party problem. These \nare the two parties getting together in an unholy alliance and spending \nus into oblivion.\n  People say: Well, how will we defend the country? Don't we need more \nmoney?\n  We have increased military spending by 50 percent since 9/11 in real \ndollars. There is waste in the Pentagon. I have been arguing that we \nshould audit the Pentagon. The Pentagon says they are too big to be \naudited. How insulting. It goes on and on.\n  The frustration of the American people is that as it goes on and on, \nnothing ever changes. The establishment in Washington is completely and \nutterly tone deaf to the way America feels about this. All you have to \ndo is drive outside the beltway, enter into America, and ask the first \nperson you meet at a supermarket: Do you think we should keep borrowing \nmore money?\n  I don't care what party they are in. I defy you to drive outside the \nbeltway, stop at a gas station, stop at a supermarket, and ask the \nfirst person: Do you think we should increase the debt and increase \nspending at the same time? Do you think we should increase the debt? Do \nyou think we should increase the debt ceiling with an unspecified \namount?\n  Ask any parent of a college-age kid whether we should give them a \ncredit card with no limit. If your child comes to you and has $2,000 on \nthe credit card, what do you do? You tell them they have to watch their \nspending. Do you give them more money? No.\n  Should we give Congress more money? Hell, no. Congress is bad with \nmoney. They are not good with money. Do not trust them with any more \nmoney. It is a mistake, a huge mistake, to give this body any more \nmoney. We should be doing the opposite. We should be binding this body \nwith the chains of the Constitution that say only certain powers were \ndelegated to Congress, only certain powers under article I, section 8, \nand we shouldn't allow for unlimited government.\n  Our Founding Fathers were concerned about a big government, but they \nwere also concerned about a big and overwhelming military that was \nthere all the time and would tend to grow. Even some of our greatest \nheroes--President Eisenhower worried about the military industrial \ncomplex. So there have been leaders in the past who have said we have \nto be careful that we don't get to a point where the contractors are \ndriving Congress, where the contractors are creating a situation in \nwhich their concerns and their well-being are more important than the \nwell-being of the country.\n  Will the Parliamentarian report on the time remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 13 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. PAUL. Some will criticize this exercise of keeping the Senate \nawake at night. The rumblings can be heard, but what I would say is \nthat the future of the country is worth the time spent. One of the \nreasons we are spending the middle of the night discussing this is that \nwe don't have an ordinary process for proposals. We don't have an \nordinary process for amending bills.\n  Were there to be an ordinary process where conservatives would be \nallowed an alternative such as cut, cap, and balance--we actually did \nthat in 2011 when the opposite party was in charge. We did have a vote \non cut, cap, and balance. It actually passed. It passed in the House \noverwhelmingly and was defeated in the Senate, but the fact is there \nare other alternatives. There isn't just one alternative. The only \nalternative shouldn't be that we continue to go further and further \ninto debt.\n  Sometimes people say: Well, I can't even conceive of $1 trillion. It \nis just this enormous money, this enormous amount of money. What is $1 \ntrillion?\n  To illustrate what $1 trillion is, imagine if you had thousand-dollar \nbills in your hand and you had thousand-dollar bills stacked four \ninches high. That would be $1 million. But if you want to imagine $1 \ntrillion, in thousand-dollar bills it would be 63 miles high. That is \nwhat we are talking about adding.\n  While they have not specified how much debt they are going to burden \nus with, many are estimating that it will be over $1 trillion. So when \nyou think about what your government is doing to you tonight, think \nabout how much of a burden of debt the next generation will get in just \nthe next year, just from this bill over the next year and a half--over \n$1 trillion. If you want to know how much that is, imagine thousand-\ndollar bills stacked 63 miles high. That is the burden we are passing \non to the next generation.\n  None of this is an argument for no government. None of this is an \nargument for no Federal Government. In fact, this is an argument for \njust spending what comes in. We actually have a lot of money that comes \nin; $3 trillion comes in. Could we not simply live with the $3 trillion \nthat comes in? What would happen to the country if we only spent what \ncomes in? Would there be some sort of calamity? I think it would \nactually be the opposite. I think it would send a signal to the world \nthat we are serious, that we are going to make America great again. \nAmerica's greatness was founded upon fiscal sanity, small government.\n  Liberty thrives when government is small. We need a government that \nis small and restrained by the Constitution. If we had a government \nthat was restrained by the Constitution, we wouldn't be in this fix. \nMany of the functions of government we do up here are not written into \nthe Constitution and were never delegated to the Federal Government. \nThe reason we have gotten into this fix is because we have gotten away \nfrom the confines of the Constitution.\n  Jefferson once said that the chains of the Constitution will bind \ngovernment. Patrick Henry said that the Constitution is not about \nrestraining the people; the Constitution was intended to restrain the \ngovernment.\n  There has been a long history of this. This is not something that has \noccurred overnight. If you want to go back and see the history of \npeople trying to restrain their government and keep their government \nsmall, you can\n\n[[Page S7674]]\n\nprobably go back to the plains of Runnymede in 1215. When the Magna \nCarta was passed, that was one of the first explicit sort of explosions \nof people saying to government enough is enough; the king does not have \nunlimited power.\n  This goes against the character and the charter of the Magna Carta, \nwhich tried to limit the power of the monarch. Instead, we are giving \nunlimited power to borrow to the President. So if you look at the \ncharacter of the Magna Carta and you look at the character of our \nFounding Fathers, who wanted to have restraint, who wanted government \nto be restrained by rules, what you find is that we are going headlong \nin the wrong direction. What we need is to obey the Constitution once \nagain. When we obey the Constitution, I think what would happen is that \nthe budget would balance almost automatically. It would balance every \nyear.\n  Washington does need to have compromise, but this is the wrong kind \nof compromise. The compromise is going in the wrong direction. What we \nneed is compromise that actually reduces spending. Instead, we have \ncompromise, or so-called compromise, that is actually increasing \nspending.\n  This deal will give the President unspecified and unlimited power to \nborrow money without limits. In the President's last year in office he \nwill be able to borrow whatever--no limits whatsoever. We are \nabdicating our role as a constitutional body to limit and check the \npower of the Presidency with this.\n  Some will say: Oh, you are only saying this because it is a President \nof the opposite party. I would be saying this if it were a President of \neither party because we have allowed too much power to gravitate to the \nPresidency, and this allows even more.\n  Will the Parliamentarian give an update on the time remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. PAUL. In the remaining time, I would like to talk about a budget \npoint of order that I will be putting forward. This legislation does \nsomething that many in this body have been critical of in the past. It \nactually takes money from the obligations to Social Security and \ntransfers them to a more immediate program.\n  Specifically written into the budget rules, though, were rules that \nsay: If you are going to take money, if you are going to steal money \nfrom Social Security, from people who are retired and who have put it \nin there, and you are going to spend it on something else, there is a \nspecial budget point of order that says in order to do this you will \nneed 60 votes. So we will be putting forward a budget resolution that \nsays: If you are going to steal money from Social Security, if you are \ngoing to take money from Social Security and you are going to spend it \non other concerns--people will say: Oh, well, we are going to spend it \non disability. Well, the Social Security fund was put forward as a \npension plan. You have an obligation to those who put the money in. So \nstealing money from people who will be getting money in the future to \npay for immediate concerns is robbing Peter to pay Paul.\n  So those in this body will be asked tonight to vote on whether or not \nyou are willing to vote to take money from Social Security to spend it \non immediate concerns. This is sort of like saying: All right, I have a \npension fund. Let's say I have $100,000 in my pension plan, but I want \nto go to the racetrack and I need some money this week. So I am willing \nto take the $100,000 out, and I am willing to pay a $30,000 penalty. I \nam willing to do it because I am an addict, and I am addicted to \nspending, and I have to spend the money now.\n  That is what it is, and you are all guilty of it, right and left. You \nare going to take money out of the Social Security fund, and you are \ngoing to spend it on an immediate fix. And by fix, I mean not fixing \nthe program. By fix, I mean what a junkie does. A junkie is addicted to \nspending. That is what the problem is here, that we are addicted to \nspending.\n  So, Madam President, at this point I raise a point of order against \nthe pending motion pursuant to section 311(a) of S. Con. Res. 11, the \nconcurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2016. The \nlegislation reallocates payroll between the retirement and disability \nprograms and therefore breaches the budget act. I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of \napplicable budget resolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections \nof that act and applicable budget resolutions for purposes of the House \nmessage, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Is there further debate on the motion to waive?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the motion to waive.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Res. 301\n\n       Whereas Alaska Natives and Native Americans are \n     underrepresented in the profession of teaching;\n       Whereas Alaska Native and Native American students benefit \n     academically from the cultural perspectives of Alaska Native \n     and Native American teachers;\n       Whereas Alaska Native and Native American teachers often \n     serve as positive role models for Alaska Native and Native \n     American students;\n       Whereas increasing the number of Alaska Native and Native \n     American teachers working in native communities empowers \n     tribes, benefits native youth, and strengthens tribal self-\n     sufficiency;\n       Whereas the Council for the Accreditation of Educator \n     Preparation (referred to in this preamble as the ``Council'') \n     is the sole accrediting body for educator preparation \n     programs at institutions of higher education in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas the Council approved new accreditation standards in \n     2013 and plans for the standards to be fully implemented by \n     2020;\n       Whereas the 2013 accreditation standards of the Council \n     require that institutions of higher education, when accepting \n     candidates to their schools of education, ensure that the \n     group average performance on assessments such as the ACT and \n     SAT is--\n       (1) in the top 50 percent from 2016-2017;\n       (2) in the top 40 percent of the distribution from 2018-\n     2019; and\n       (3) in the top 33 percent of the distribution by 2020;\n       Whereas because of social, academic, and economic barriers, \n     the average ACT and SAT scores of Alaska Natives and Native \n     Americans are disproportionately lower than other categories \n     of students;\n       Whereas Alaska Native and Native American students have \n     disproportionately inadequate access to exam preparation \n     opportunities and 21st century technology and are less likely \n     to take the ACT or SAT than other categories of students;\n       Whereas no definitive research or data has shown that \n     performance on the ACT or SAT is an effective indicator of \n     the likelihood of success of a prospective student in an \n     educator preparation program or as a teacher;\n       Whereas the 2013 accreditation standards of the Council--\n       (1) will force institutions of higher education to accept \n     fewer Alaska Native and Native American students into teacher \n     preparation programs in order to retain accreditation;\n\n[[Page S7676]]\n\n       (2) will result in fewer Alaska Natives and Native \n     Americans gaining acceptance into those programs; and\n       (3) will exacerbate the already low representation of \n     Alaska Natives and Native Americans in the teaching \n     community;\n       Whereas the Federal Government has a trust responsibility \n     to support the education of Alaska Natives and Native \n     Americans; and\n       Whereas the Council should recognize the negative impact of \n     the standards of the Council on Alaska Native and Native \n     American teacher candidates: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate calls on the Council for the \n     Accreditation of Educator Preparation--\n       (1) to consult with tribes and native organizations;\n       (2) to jointly develop changes to the accreditation \n     standards of the Council to ensure that Alaska Native and \n     Native American teacher candidates will not be negatively \n     impacted by the standards; and\n       (3) to adopt changes to the accreditation standards of the \n     Council expeditiously.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, today I am submitting a resolution, \nwith Senators Sullivan and Schatz, calling on the Council for the \nAccreditation of Educator Preparation, CAEP, to modify one of their \naccreditation standards that applies to the qualifications for \nenrollment of teacher candidates.\n  The goal of accreditation agencies is to ensure that the education \nprovided by our Nation's institutions of higher education and their \nvarious programs meet appropriate levels of quality.\n  In 2013, CAEP--the only accreditor of teacher preparation programs in \nthe country--revised its accreditation standards. Problematic, however, \nis Standard 3.2 that would require teacher preparation programs to \nensure that each cohort of students enrolled in the program has an \naverage SAT/ACT/GRE score in the top 50 percent from 2016-2017; the top \n40 percent from 2018-2019; and the top 33 percent by 2020.\n  I am all for making sure that our Nation's youngsters have the best \npossible teachers. We need well-trained, culturally competent, \nintelligent, effective teachers in every classroom in America.\n  But there is no definitive research or data that shows that \nperformance on the SAT, the ACT, or the GRE is an effective indicator \nthat someone will become an excellent teacher. Worse, basing acceptance \ninto a teacher preparation programs on these tests will have a negative \nimpact on young Native Americans and Alaska natives who want to become \nteachers in their own communities--where they are so desperately \nneeded.\n  Compounding this inappropriate use of these tests is the fact that \nNative American and Alaska native students experience academic, \neconomic, and social barriers that result in their SAT, ACT, and GRE \nscores being disproportionately lower than their peers of other races. \nNative students also have disproportionately inadequate access to exam \npreparation and are less likely to take the ACT or SAT than their \npeers.\n  This new CAEP Standard 3.2 will, therefore, effectively block \ndecades-long efforts to train more Native American and Alaska native \nteachers, when we know that Native American and Alaska native students \nbenefit from having teachers who understand their culture, their \nhistory, and their learning styles.\n  My resolution calls on the Council for the Accreditation of Educator \nPreparation to do three things: to consult with tribes and native \norganizations; to jointly develop changes to these standards to ensure \nthat Native Americans and Alaska natives will not be negatively \nimpacted by these standards; and to adopt changes to the standards \nexpeditiously.\n  I hope that my colleagues will pay close attention to this issue, \nreach out to the teacher preparation programs in their states, and join \nmy colleagues, Senators Sullivan and Schatz in co-sponsoring this \nresolution, as the Council's standards will impact not only our Native \nAmerican and Alaska native communities. This standard will also very \nlikely impact young African Americans and Hispanic Americans who hope \none day to become teachers but who experience similar barriers to \nproducing high scores on standardized tests.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/30/senate-section/article/S7676-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SIGNING AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.
