Mr. President, at this great cemetery we call Arlington, \nthere is a white headstone, which, like so many others, marks the final \nresting place of a courageous servicemember who gave his life in \ncombat. The grave belongs to a man by the name of Kareem Khan. He was \nfrom New Jersey. He was only 20 years old. He was a Muslim.\n  Kareem's rank was that of a specialist in the Stryker Brigade of the \nU.S. Army's 2nd Infantry Division. By all accounts, this young man was \na terrific soldier. He had a Purple Heart and was awarded the Bronze \nStar and a medal for good conduct. Remember, he was barely 20 years of \nage. His career in the Army would have been much more significant, but \nhe gave the ultimate, his life.\n  Here is what happened. This tragedy struck on August 6, 2007, as \nKareem and three other soldiers were checking abandoned Iraqi houses \nfor explosives. In one house they went into, there was a hidden bomb \nthat exploded that killed all four of them. Like thousands of other \nsoldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan, Kareem sacrificed everything for his \ncountry. He gave, as President Abraham Lincoln said, ``the last full \nmeasure of devotion'' for the United States.\n  But yesterday I watched on ``Meet the Press'' as a Republican \ncandidate for President of the United States denigrated Kareem Khan and \nall Muslim Americans. Ben Carson questioned Muslim Americans' devotion \nto the United States. He questioned their integrity, and then Ben \nCarson unilaterally disqualified every Muslim in America from becoming \nthe President of the United States.\n  Shame on Dr. Carson. Shame on any person that spews such hateful \nrhetoric. In America today, there are more than 3 million Muslims. They \nare part of the fabric of America. They teach in our schools, and they \nfight for our military. They serve in Congress. Congressmen Keith \nEllison of Minnesota and Andre Carson of Indiana, both Muslim, \nrepresent their districts in States with distinction.\n  I was proud to have both of these young men come and campaign for me \nthroughout Nevada. Sadly, though, Dr. Carson's remarks are just another \nexample of Republican candidates refusing to speak for 3 million Muslim \nAmericans. We saw it last week with Donald Trump, as he refused to \ndenounce bigotry at his own campaign rally. If these Republican \ncandidates are incapable of going to bat for America's Muslim \ncommunity, then they should not be running for President of the United \nStates. I call upon every Republican to denounce Dr. Carson's \ndisgusting remarks. That shameful intolerance and bigotry have no place \nin America today. Sadly, it seems to have a lasting place in the \nRepublican Party.\n\n[[Page S6822]]\n\n  Republicans should open their eyes and take note of the contributions \nof our country's Muslim community. Until they do that, none of them \nwill be worthy of leading this Nation.\n  In a little more than a week, our government runs out of money. We \nhave precious little time. The Senate will be in session for 3, \npossibly 4 days this week and another 3 days next week. The House of \nRepresentatives is not in session today, tomorrow or Wednesday. Yet it \nseems that the Republicans are simply ignoring or are in complete \ndenial of any fiscal crisis that is coming at year's end.\n  Instead of coming to grips with the reality of the situation and \nworking with Democrats to avoid a government shutdown, the Republicans \nseem more interested in political theater. Keeping with this show-vote \ncraze, the Republican leader and the Speaker--the Republican leader \nover here and the Speaker on the other side of the Capitol--are doing \nthings that are really hard to comprehend.\n  For example, over here there is going to be a forced vote tomorrow \nmorning on cloture on a motion to proceed to a 20-week abortion ban. \nThe 20-week bill is just a way for Senator McConnell to pander to \nextremists in his party who are once again holding government hostage \nso they can attack the health of women. This legislation is going \nnowhere. The Republican leader knows this. Every Senator here knows \nthis. The bill is just another box to check for the Republican leader \nand his Senators. It is pretense to prove their extreme conservative \ncredentials. It is all about political gamesmanship.\n  It comes at the expense of America's women's health. Think about all \nthe ways the Republicans have attacked women in this Congress. \nRepublicans have manipulated a bill to help victims of human \ntrafficking and turned it instead into a political football by \nattaching ideological abortion riders.\n  Again, Republicans tried and are continuing to try to cut off funds \nfor a critical safety net provider for women--Planned Parenthood. It is \nnot the first time they have done it. Now they are wasting time as the \ngovernment runs out of money in just a few days, wasting it on the 20-\nweek abortion ban. Frankly, the American people are tired of \nRepublican's obsession with attacking the health of women. They are \ntired of the never-ending wasteful votes orchestrated by the Republican \nleader instead of meaningful legislation.\n  But more than anything, Americans are watching congressional \nRepublicans' failure to govern. We are fast approaching the year since \nRepublicans assumed control of both Houses of Congress. What do they \nhave to show for it? Nothing. The few things that have passed were \nthings that would have passed easily last Congress, except they were \nfilibustered by the Republicans.\n  If this 20-week abortion ban bill is any indication, nothing is all \nwe can expect from the Republican leader and his party for the \nremaining 15 months of this Congress.\n  Will the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/21/senate-section/article/S6822-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                        Criminal Justice Reform\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to address the topic of \ncriminal justice reform. There has been a lot of discussion in Congress \nrecently on this subject. Nearly all of the conversation has focused on \nsentencing. Various proposals have been introduced to cut prison \nsentences, augment judges' ability to sentence below statutory minimums \nor allow prisoners to earn early release for good behavior.\n  A number of my colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee have been \nmeeting behind closed doors for months to try to reach a compromise--a \ncompromise that incorporates elements of these various proposals. I \nrise today to address the broader parameters of criminal justice reform \nand to remind my colleagues that sentencing reform is only one piece of \nthe broader effort that has been underway for some time now in both \nhouses of Congress.\n  There are a number of other aspects of criminal justice reform that \nmerit our attention, foremost of which is the need to ensure meaningful \ncriminal intent requirements in our statutes and regulations. Over the \npast several years, a unique coalition of Members and stakeholder \ngroups from across the ideological spectrum have been working together \nto address the problem of overcriminalization.\n  There is broad, bipartisan agreement in many quarters that Congress \nhas criminalized too much conduct and mandated overly harsh penalties \nfor too many crimes. Congress's persistent recourse to criminal law as \nthe answer to today's society ills has cost taxpayers millions of \ndollars and branded as criminal conduct that may be unwitting or not \neven blameworthy. It has also resulted in thousands of Americans losing \ntheir livelihoods or liberty for reasons that, upon closer examination, \nseem not entirely justified.\n  The overcriminalization problem manifests itself in a variety of \nways. First is through the sheer number of Federal crimes. There are \nnow nearly 5,000 criminal statutes scattered in the U.S. Code. But \nstatutes are only part of the story. In addition, there are an \nestimated 300,000 criminal regulatory offenses buried in the 80,000-\npage Code of Federal Regulations--300,000. If the administration \npromulgated one criminal regulation per day--that is, if it created one \nnew crime each day--it would take 822 years to create that many \ncriminal regulations.\n  The entire Code of Hammurabi was only 282 laws. Our current Federal \ncriminal code--statutes and regulations together--is over 1,000 times \nthat size. I am not saying Hammurabi should be our model in many \nthings, but surely 300,000-plus Federal crimes is overkill. If \nHammurabi could govern ancient Mesopotamia with fewer than 300 laws, \nsurely we can make do with less than 300,000.\n  It is not just the sheer number of crimes. Overcriminalization also \nmanifests itself through the creation of arcane, obscure, and, frankly, \nridiculous crimes. For example, under Federal law it is a crime \npunishable by up to 6 months in prison to use the 4-H Club logo without \nauthorization.\n  It is also a Federal crime, again punishable for up to 6 months in \nprison, to walk a dog in a Federal park area on a leash that is longer \nthan 6 feet. Why on Earth do either of these actions need to be Federal \ncrimes? I do not dispute that really long dog leashes can be annoying. \nI can understand why the 4-H Club would not want pretenders roaming \naround claiming to serve the heads, hearts, hands, and health of \nyouth. But these are not the proper subjects for criminal penalties. \nWhatever crises exist with overlong dog leashes or imposter 4-H clubs \ncan be dealt with through civil means.\n\n  The problem with such obscure and esoteric crimes--aside from the \nsheer embarrassment they should cause to Congress and the promulgating \nagency--is that they criminalize conduct that no reasonable person \nwould know was illegal. Walking a dog on a 7-foot leash is not \ninherently wrongful, nor is putting a 4-H Club logo on a sign. Even if \ncommon sense might suggest checking with the 4-H Club before using its \nlogo, no sane person would think it is a crime to do so.\n  The upshot is there are who-knows-how-many crimes on the books that \nthe average person has no idea about and that criminalize conduct no \nreasonable person would think is wrong. According to a recent book, the \naverage American unwittingly commits three felonies per day. That \nshould deeply trouble all of us--and not because it suggests anything \nwrong with the average American.\n  We are a nation of laws. We are supposed to be guided by the rule of \nlaw. Our criminal law--indeed, the very idea that it is proper to brand \nsome conduct, and some people, as criminal--is\n\n[[Page S6823]]\n\npredicated on the notion that individuals know the law and are able to \nchoose whether to follow it. If, as I have suggested--and as many \nscholars agree--we live in a country where much otherwise benign \nconduct has been labeled criminal and where decent, honorable citizens \ncan become criminals through no fault or intent of their own, then we \nhave a problem on our hands. Our criminal laws should be aimed at \nprotecting our communities and keeping bad influences off our streets, \nnot tripping up honest citizens.\n  The third way the problem of overcriminalization manifests itself is \nthrough the vague, duplicative, and even conflicting terms of many of \nour criminal laws. Put simply, many of our criminal laws are bad laws. \nThey are poorly written, they sweep too broadly, and they give too much \npower to overzealous prosecutors.\n  Consider the case of John Yates, who was convicted of violating the \nso-called anti-shredding provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This \nextraordinarily broad law, which Congress passed in the wake of the \nEnron scandal, prohibits the destruction of any ``tangible object'' \nwith intent to impede, obstruct or influence a Federal investigation.\n  Yates was not an Enron executive or any sort of corporate executive, \nhe was a fisherman. His crime? Discarding a small number of undersized \nfish from his boat after a State inspector found him carrying fish \nslightly below the minimum legal size. Yates appealed his conviction \nall the way to the Supreme Court on the ground that the statute did not \napply to his conduct. By a 5-to-4 vote the Court agreed.\n  In a remarkable move, the dissenting Justices, who had voted to \nsustain Yates's conviction, heaped scorn on the anti-shredding statute. \nThey called it a ``bad law--too broad and undifferentiated, with too-\nhigh maximum penalties.'' Its vague terms and overly harsh penalties \nwere ``unfortunately not an outlier, [but rather] an emblem of a deeper \npathology in the Federal criminal code.''\n  These words should be a wake-up call. For too long Congress has \ncriminalized too much conduct and enacted overbroad statutes that sweep \nfar beyond the evils they are designed to avoid. Surely, of all the \ncategories of law we pass in Congress, we should take most care with \ncriminal laws. Criminal laws empower the State to deprive citizens of \nliberty and precious, financial resources. They carry serious \ncollateral consequences, including the loss of the right to vote, the \nright to own a firearm, the ability to hold certain jobs, and they \npermit the State to brand citizens with that most repugnant of all \ntitles--criminal. There is simply no excuse for sloppily drafted, \nslapdash criminal laws. Too much is at stake.\n  Related to the problem of poor draftmanship is the fourth way the \novercriminalization problem manifests itself, through the absence of \nmeaningful mens rea requirements. The need for strong mens rea \nprotections, I believe, is of particular concern and will be the rest \nof the focus of my remarks.\n  ``Mens rea'' is Latin for guilty mind. The term expresses a time-\nhonored, fundamental feature of our criminal law that in order for an \nact to be a crime, the actor must have committed the act with malicious \nintent. The requirement of a guilty mind protects individuals who \nunwittingly commit wrongful acts or who act without knowledge that what \nthey are doing is wrong.\n  The person who mistakenly retrieves the wrong coat from the coatroom \ndoes not become a thief merely because he took something that wasn't \nhis. Only if he takes a coat knowing that it belongs to someone else \nhas he committed a criminal act, for only then has he acted with \ncriminal intent. Similarly, a person enters land that he believes is \npublic property but that in fact belongs to another person does not \nthereby commit criminal trespassing. Only if the person knows she is \nnot legally entitled to enter the property is she guilty of a criminal \noffense.\n  In an era when our statute books and regulations overflow with \ncriminal offenses, mens rea protections are even more important. Many \nmodern criminal offenses, such as the dog-walking offense I mentioned \nearlier, involve conduct that is not inherently wrongful. Only a person \nwho knows the details of such offenses--and knows they exist--would \nknow that conduct in violation of the offenses is criminal.\n  This is different from traditional crimes such as assault or theft, \nwhich even a child knows is wrong. With 300,000-plus Federal crimes on \nthe books, you can be sure the vast majority are not traditional crimes \nthat everyone knows are wrong but rather obscure provisions known only \nto a select few in the bowels of the Federal bureaucracy. It doesn't \ntake 300,000 individual crimes to cover the categories of conduct \neveryone knows is wrong.\n  Without adequate mens rea protections--that is, without the \nrequirement that a person knows his conduct was wrong or unlawful--\neveryday citizens can be held criminally liable for conduct that no \nreasonable person would know was wrong. This is not only unfair, it is \nimmoral. No government that purports to safeguard the liberty and \nrights of its people should have the power to lock up individuals for \nconduct they did not know was wrong. Only when a person has acted with \na guilty mind is it just, is it ethical to brand that person a criminal \nand deprive him of liberty.\n  Unfortunately, many of our current criminal laws and regulations \ncontain inadequate mens rea requirements or even no mens rea \nrequirement at all. Far too often, such laws leave people vulnerable to \nprosecution for conduct they thought was lawful. Consider two examples.\n  The first is Wade Martin, an Alaskan fisherman who sold 10 sea otters \nto a buyer he thought was a Native Alaskan but who turned out not to \nbe. Authorities charged Wade with violating the Marine Mammal \nProtection Act, which criminalizes the sale of sea otters to non-Native \nAlaskans. The fact that he thought the buyer was a Native Alaskan was \nirrelevant. Prosecutors had to prove only that the buyer was not, in \nfact, a Native Alaskan. The absence of the criminal intent requirement \nmeant Wade could be convicted regardless of whether he knew what he was \ndoing was wrong. Wade pleaded guilty to a felony charge and was ordered \nto pay a $1,000 fine.\n  Second is Lawrence Lewis, a janitor at a retirement home who was \ncharged with criminally violating the Clean Water Act when he diverted \nbacked-up sewage at the retirement home to a storm drain. Lawrence \nthought the storm drain was connected to the city's sewage system, but \nit turned out it emptied into a creek that ultimately connected to the \nPotomac River, a protected waterway. The Clean Water Act required proof \nonly that Lawrence diverted the sewage into the storm drain. It \nrequired no proof that he knew the drain connected to a creek that \nemptied into the Potomac or that he knew he was violating the law. \nLawrence pleaded guilty and was sentenced to probation.\n  These and other examples demonstrate the danger of missing or \nincomplete mens rea requirements. Even before we get to the point of \nsentencing, the fact that people can be swept up in the criminal \njustice system and convicted for doing things they thought were lawful \nis deeply troubling. Any sentence they receive for their purported \ncrimes is unfair because they should not even have been charged \ncriminally in the first place--or at the very least the government \nshould have to prove criminal intent in order to convict.\n  This is why it is important for my colleagues to keep in mind the \nfull scope of our overcriminalization problem. Sentencing is only one \npart of the criminal justice process--an important part to be sure but \nonly one part in a very long process.\n  That process begins in Washington, where we in Congress decide what \nconduct to criminalize and what the government must prove in order to \nconvict. Among the most important choices we make when crafting a \ncriminal law is deciding what level of criminal intent the government \nmust prove. Must the person know he or she was acting unlawfully? Is it \nenough that the person intended the wrongful act or is it enough merely \nthat he or she knew their actions would produce a certain result? The \nanswers to these questions determine whether the person even committed \na crime in the first place, separate and apart from what the felony \nshould be if he is convicted.\n  As one expert has written, ``While sentencing reform addresses how \nlong people should serve once convicted,\n\n[[Page S6824]]\n\nmens rea reform addresses those who never should have been convicted in \nthe first place: people who engaged in conduct without any knowledge of \nor intent to violate the law and [conduct] that they could not \nreasonably have anticipated would violate a criminal law.'' Surely we \ncan all agree that a person should not be branded a criminal and locked \nup for doing something they did not know was wrong.\n  Unsurprisingly then, from the inception of the anti-\novercriminalization movement, ensuring that criminal laws have adequate \nmens rea protections has been a bipartisan priority. During the \nhearings of the House Overcriminalization Task Force, Chairman \nSensenbrenner declared that ``[t]he lack of an adequate intent \nrequirement in the Federal code is one of the most pressing problems \nfacing this Task Force. . . . '' Ranking Member Bobby Scott similarly \nwarned that without adequate mens rea protections ``honest citizens are \nat risk of being victimized and criminalized by poorly crafted \nlegislation and overzealous prosecutors.'' Representative Conyers said \nthat ``when good people find themselves confronted with accusations of \nviolating regulations that are vague, address seemingly innocent \nbehavior, and lack adequate mens rea, fundamental principles of \nfairness and due process are undermined.''\n  But in the Senate there has been a notable absence of discussion \nabout mens rea and the need for robust mens rea protections. There has \nbeen a lot of talk about sentencing but little about mens rea. It is \ntime to change that.\n  For the past several months, I have been working on legislation to \naddress the deficiencies in mens rea requirements in existing statutes. \nMy bill would set a default mens rea requirement for all statutes that \nlack such a requirement. It would ensure that courts and creative \nprosecutors do not take the absence of an express criminal intent \nstandard to mean the government could convict without any proof of a \nguilty mind. My bill would also clarify that when a statute identifies \na mens rea standard but does not specify which elements of the crime \nthat standard applies to, the standard identified applies to all \nelements of the crime unless a contrary purpose plainly appears in the \ntext of the statute.\n  My bill would not mandate a particular mens rea standard for all \ncrimes, nor would it override existing standards set forth in statutes. \nAll it would do is set a default for when Congress has failed to \nspecify the criminal intent required for conviction. Congress would \nremain free, however, whenever it wanted to specify a different mens \nrea standard for a statute, replacing the default with its own chosen \nstandard. The default would operate merely in the absence of \ncongressional action. It would bring clarity, ensure that Congress does \nnot--through oversight--create crimes without any mens rea requirement, \nand protect individuals from being convicted for conduct they did not \nknow was wrong.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on this important \nlegislation and urge all of them to give it their support. Any deal on \nsentencing and any package of criminal justice reform must include \nprovisions to shore up mens rea protections. In fact, I question \nwhether a sentencing reform package that does not include mens rea \nreform would be worth it, and I am not alone. Many members of the \novercriminalization coalition--members who helped lay the key \nintellectual and political groundwork for the negotiations now \nunderway--believe strongly that any criminal justice reform bill that \npasses this body must include mens rea reform. I agree. There can be no \nmore important work that we do here in Congress than ensuring that \nhonest, hardworking Americans are not unjustly imprisoned.\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to express my \nstrong opposition to the bill we are going to be voting on tomorrow \nmorning, and that is a bill to limit women's choice by banning \nabortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. I would like to make several \npoints today: Why the bill is unconstitutional, the truth about late-\nterm abortions, the bill's rape certification requirements and the \nabsence of a health exception, and, finally, how this debate is much \nmore than this one bill.\n  Let me be clear, Mr. President. This bill is just one part of a \nsustained assault on a woman's access to health care and her right to \nmake decisions for herself and her family.\n  First, this bill is unconstitutional. Similar State laws banning \nabortion at 20 weeks have been struck down by the courts. The Supreme \nCourt in the controlling opinion in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 1992, \nstated:\n\n       The woman's right to terminate her pregnancy before \n     viability is the most central principle of Roe v. Wade. It is \n     a rule of law and a component of liberty we cannot renounce.\n\n  Viability refers to the point at which a fetus could survive outside \nthe womb. The Supreme Court's 2007 decision in Gonzales v. Carhart \nsummarizes that portion of the Casey decision stating, ``Before \nviability, a State may not prohibit a woman from making the ultimate \ndecision to terminate her pregnancy.''\n  In 2012, Arizona enacted a law prohibiting abortions after 20 weeks. \nThe Ninth Circuit found that statute unconstitutional. Now that is a \ndirect case in point from one circuit. The Ninth Circuit said the law \nconflicted with a long line of Supreme Court cases that found bans on \nwomen's right to abortion prior to viability as unconstitutional.\n  In that case, Arizona admitted that a fetus at 20 weeks was not \nviable. A conservative judge on the Ninth Circuit, Andrew Kleinfeld, \nsaid he was ``compelled'' to strike down the Arizona law based on \nexisting precedent. The Supreme Court subsequently denied Arizona's \npetition to hear the case.\n  Other State laws banning abortions at 20 weeks or earlier have also \nbeen struck down on these grounds. For example, Idaho's 20-week ban was \nstruck down by the courts. The opinion in that case stated that the \nIdaho law was ``directly contrary to the court's holding in Casey that \na woman has the right to `choose to have an abortion before viability \nand obtain it without undue interference from the State.' ''\n  The court's rulings have been informed by medical experts, and \nmedical experts have said repeatedly that a fetus is not viable at 20 \nweeks. Let me give you a good example. Dr. Hal Lawrence, the chief \nexecutive officer of the American Congress of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists, recently addressed this issue, and I would like to read \na portion of his remarks:\n\n       The 20-week mark is just not notable from a fetal \n     development standpoint. More than 40 years ago, the Supreme \n     Court stipulated that abortion is legal until a fetus is \n     viable. Well, in no way, shape, or form is a 20-week fetus \n     viable.\n\n  Now, this is a medical OB/GYN, who is head of the association \nspeaking. Continuing to quote him:\n\n       There is no evidence anywhere of a 20-week fetus surviving, \n     even with intensive medical care. Unfortunately, some \n     advocates of abortion bans are pointing to a new study they \n     claim heralds 22 weeks as being the new point of viability. \n     They suggest that we might someday reach viability at 20 \n     weeks. It is essential that we address that now, before this \n     becomes another myth about abortion that is accepted as \n     reality.\n\n  The doctor goes on to say:\n\n       First, this new study was not conducted to add fuel to the \n     fire of abortion rights opponents. It was intended to help \n     give OB-GYNs and neonatologists improved understanding of the \n     challenges and opportunities associated with early premature \n     delivery. Second, even in this study, survival at 22 weeks \n     was only 5 percent overall. This is why the medical community \n     refers to the ``threshold of viability,'' because there is no \n     point at which viability is clearly established. Even among \n     babies that receive intensive medical care, survival only \n     reached 23 percent, and most of those babies had moderate to \n     severe neurological impairment. Importantly, this study only \n     looked at babies without fetal anomalies, which surely would \n     have lowered the survival rates even more.\n\n  Bottom line: A ban on abortion before viability, which is exactly \nwhat this bill represents, is unconstitutional, and the courts have \nspoken on the issue.\n  Next, I would like to set the record straight on the widespread \nmisconceptions about late-term abortions. First,\n\n[[Page S6825]]\n\nthey are not usual. They are extraordinarily rare. Just 1 percent of \nabortions occur after 20 weeks. Secondly, many of the pregnancies \nterminated after 20 weeks occur because something has gone terribly \nwrong--the fetus has a fatal disease or the woman's health is in \ndanger. Let me give an example. Christy Zink, a mother of two here in \nWashington, testified before Congress against this bill. In 2009, after \ntrying for years to become pregnant, she and her husband were elated to \nbe expecting a boy. Unfortunately, when Christy reached the 21st week \nof her pregnancy, the MRI revealed that her baby's brain had not \ndeveloped correctly. One side of it was missing.\n  Everything up to that point looked normal. The brain scan wasn't \ncapable of detecting the problem any earlier. Christy and her husband \nconsulted the best doctors hoping there was some treatment, but nothing \ncould be done. They were devastated.\n  If Christy's baby had made it to the end of the pregnancy, according \nto her doctors, he would have been in terrible pain and likely died \nsoon after birth. Christy said, ``The decision I made to have an \nabortion at almost 22 weeks was made out of love and to spare my son's \npain and suffering.''\n  Christy's incredibly difficult story isn't just an isolated example. \nThere are many fatal diseases that can't be detected until later in a \npregnancy, including one that causes the fetus's organs to develop \noutside of the body. Another, called severe brittle bone disease, \ncauses the fetus's bones to break inside the womb.\n  Our own colleague, Congresswoman Jackie Speier from California, \nsomeone I know very well, shared her story on the House floor in 2011. \nShe terminated a much-wanted pregnancy at 17 weeks due to a medical \ncomplication. She said, ``To suggest that somehow this is a procedure \nthat is either welcomed or done cavalierly or done without any thought \nis preposterous.''\n  Congresswoman Speier is right. Making this personal medical decision \nis one of the most gut-wrenching decisions a woman could make, and \nthere is no good option. But these decisions need to be made by women, \nin consultation with their doctors and their families, not by \npoliticians. Every situation is different, and we shouldn't pretend to \nstand in a woman's shoes and make these choices for them. We shouldn't \nmake a difficult decision even harder.\n  Next, I wish to discuss the fact that this bill has no exception for \nthe health of the mother. Only when a mother's health deteriorates to \nthe point that she could die does it allow an exception. This is \nunconstitutional as well. The Supreme Court's controlling opinion in \nPlanned Parenthood v. Casey said that even after viability, the \ngovernment may restrict abortion ``except where it is necessary, in \nappropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or \nhealth of the mother.''\n  The Supreme Court's 2000 decision in Stenberg v. Carhart reiterated \nthis point. The decision quotes Casey and other cases about the need \nfor a health exception. It is true the Supreme Court in Gonzalez v. \nCarhart in 2007 upheld a Federal ban on a particular abortion \nprocedure, a law many of us opposed, but the Gonzalez decision still \nquotes Casey and other cases about the need for a health exception, and \nit does not suggest that the government can completely ban abortion \nafter a particular week of pregnancy without a health exception.\n  The bottom line: This bill would endanger women by banning abortion \neven when necessary to protect the mother's health--and that is also \nunconstitutional. This is shocking because in no other circumstance \nwould we restrict medical care until the patient is at risk of death. \nIn cases where the mother is bleeding severely or has gone into septic \nshock, it could be too late to save her or prevent serious injury.\n  Another shocking provision of this bill requires rape victims to \nprovide certification from law enforcement that they have been raped, \nas well as proof that they have attended counseling or received medical \ntreatment.\n  Just a few months ago I spoke on the Senate floor in support of anti-\nhuman trafficking legislation. The bill was stalled because some of us \nwanted to ensure that trafficking victims had access to the medical \nservices they needed, including abortion. There seemed to be agreement \non both sides that a trafficking victim who has been raped repeatedly, \nimprisoned, and abused should be able to get the health care she needs. \nYet under the bill we are voting on, a 13-year-old sex trafficking \nvictim--a rape victim--would not be eligible for an exception unless \nshe gets a note from law enforcement or a child welfare agency.\n  I just did a sex trafficking meeting in Los Angeles with three \ndistrict attorneys from big cities in California, as well as the \nsheriff of L.A. County and the chief of police. What they told me is \nthe average girl, sex-trafficked, is between the ages of 12 to 14. So \nthis isn't some outrageously small example. Let's say the victim is 12 \nto 14. She has been traumatized, she has been emotionally and \nphysically abused. Supposing she was one of those in Oakland, where she \nwas handcuffed at night and stripped naked and then worked the streets \nduring the day. She may not be ready or even able to go to the police. \nShe wouldn't qualify for a rape exception under this bill. That is just \nterrible. My Republican colleagues would force her to endure the \npregnancy--the result of rape--because she didn't have the right \npaperwork.\n  Finally, I wish to talk about why it is important to view this bill \nin the broader context of efforts to dismantle women's access to health \ncare and ban abortion outright. Anti-choice groups have been trying to \nmake it as hard as possible, bit by bit, piece by piece, for women to \naccess safe, legal abortion care.\n  Take this latest attack on Planned Parenthood. The individuals who \nmade the highly edited videos spent years trying to befriend Planned \nParenthood officials and obtain the footage--you can read about it on \nthe front page of Politico today--and they are under investigation for \npossible criminal activity. They used false identification to represent \na fake medical company. The videos were presented to the public as \nunedited, but forensics experts at the firm Fusion GPS tell us that is \nnot the case. Content is missing and numerous edits have been made to \neven the so-called full footage videos. Many Members of Congress have \nrequested the full videos. These requests have gone, as one might \nexpect, unanswered.\n  The point is, a woman's ability to make her own health care decisions \nis under sustained, unrelenting attacks, most of them by men. \nHistorically, it has always been interesting to me to see that some of \nthe most vocal, the most sustained voices, are male voices, and all \nwomen have asked is to be able to control their own reproductive \nsystem.\n  As a result, more than one in three American women lives in a county \nwithout a single health care provider that offers abortion services. \nToday these services are unavailable for millions of low-income women \nin the country, just the way it was when I was young, when we had to \npass the plate at Stanford so women could go to Tijuana for an \nabortion, and many of us felt she would kill herself if that didn't \nhappen.\n  As a result of new restrictions, women are once again turning to \nunsafe methods, much as they did before Roe v. Wade. Women were forced \ninto unsafe conditions, often in back alleys. Some were permanently \ninjured or died. I am old enough to remember those days. In the early \n1960s, when I set sentences in California, as a member of the \nCalifornia Women's Board of Terms and Parole, I set a sentence--which \nthe State had determined the sentence law at the time for abortion was \n6 months to 10 years. I remember interviewing the woman when she came \nback. I remember her name. I said to her: Anita, why did you do this \nagain? You should know better. She said to me: Because people are so \ncompelling, and I felt so sorry for these women. That is what this \nleads to. That is what this leads to.\n  In 2013, Bloomberg News reported on the increasing number of women in \nTexas buying pills on the black market to induce abortion. One woman \ninterviewed, a mother of four, was on her way to buy these pills at a \nflea market. She said:\n\n       You'd be amazed at how many people, young people, are \n     taking those pills. I probably know 12 to 20 people who have \n     done this. My cousin just went to the flea market a few \n     months ago.\n\n\n[[Page S6826]]\n\n\n  That is the result of actions like this. When those of us who lived \nthrough pre-Roe recount the risks of returning to the way things were, \nwe truly are not exaggerating. Restricting access to safe, legal \nabortion doesn't reduce abortions; it makes women desperate, it \nincreases health risks, and can lead to death.\n  At the same time women are facing these attacks on access to health \ncare and the ability to make health care decisions, there is also an \neffort underway to cut programs that help new mothers and their \nchildren. Nearly 15 million children in the United States live in \npoverty--15 million. That is less than $24,000 a year for a family of \nfour, and nearly half of these families don't have enough food to eat. \nThere are more homeless children in this country--2.5 million, 500,000 \nof them in California alone--than ever before. One in five of these \nchildren actually lives in my State. It is astonishing to me that with \nall the talk about supporting children, Republicans continue to cut the \nvery programs that support them. These are programs such as the \nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Head Start, child care \nsubsidies, Medicaid, and housing assistance.\n  House and Senate Republican budgets have proposed cutting $5 trillion \nfrom nondefense spending, which includes programs to help low-income \nfamilies. These attacks on vulnerable families must stop.\n  In conclusion, the bill we are considering today is unconstitutional, \nand the highest Court of the land has found that so. It would trample \non a woman's right to make her own medical decisions. It would even \nforce women to continue pregnancies in the most tragic of \ncircumstances. But this bill is only the start.\n  If the groups pushing this bill have their way, only the most \nprivileged women in our country will have access to safe, legal \nabortion. That is how it was before Roe v. Wade. I remember it well. \nAnd the women of this Nation will not stand to return to this time. Not \non this Senator's watch.\n  I strongly urge a ``no'' vote.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COTTON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COTTON. Madam President, over the last year I have learned a lot \nabout the magic of human life--from conception to growth in the \nmother's womb, to childbirth, to newborn development. This wasn't a \npart of my legislative work or my public duties. My newfound knowledge \ndidn't come from a course of study reading scientific journals or \nconsulting with medical experts; instead, like many parents, I learned \nthrough experience the blessings of my first child.\n  My wife Anna gave birth to our very own little angel Gabriel almost 5 \nmonths ago. Since then, Gabriel has joined me on this very floor, at \nthis very desk. Many of you have met our little man and happily agree \nthat he appears to take after his mother.\n  Gabriel has been a part of our family from the beginning, long before \nhe was born. I remember when Anna and I first discovered she was \npregnant. We were so excited, yet like so many new parents, also \napprehensive for his health and safety. Then 1 year ago this week, we \nhad our first appointment with the OB-GYN in Russellville. We couldn't \nbelieve it when we heard his little heartbeat on the ultrasound at \nbarely 9 weeks. Anna recalls that she almost started crying, though I \ndon't recall an ``almost'' for either one of us. Just 4 weeks later, as \nthe first trimester concluded, we got one of those perfect ultrasound \nshots. We saw Gabriel in profile lying on his back, hands near his \nface, feet and legs kicked up in the air.\n  We now know how much of his personality and habits he had already \ndeveloped by that point because that position is how we usually find \nhim when he wakes from his nap. Soon after, he began to flip around, \nkick and hiccup, which he also likes to do to this day. All of these \nthings happened before the halfway point in Anna's pregnancy, before \nGabriel reached 20 weeks. While he is precious and one of a kind for \nus, it is quite normal for a typical baby, as expecting parents can \ntell you and as modern medical science can now document.\n  While Anna carried Gabriel to term and he was born happy and healthy, \nmany babies aren't as lucky, but thanks to the miracle of medical \nscience, babies age just 20 weeks after fertilization can increasingly \nsurvive if born at that extremely premature age. A remarkable study \npublished earlier this year in the New England Journal of Medicine \nconcluded that babies age 20 to 22 weeks can survive with skilled and \nproper, though not extraordinary, medical intervention and treatment. \nLikewise, advances in perinatology have made fetal surgery more common \nand successful, sometimes as early as 16 weeks.\n  These breakthroughs can help correct or ameliorate certain fetal \nconditions. Not only can 20-week-old babies survive outside of the \nwomb, but they can also undergo successful surgery inside the womb. It \nis common practice in these surgeries to administer anesthesia, not \njust to the mother but specifically to the baby in utero to prevent \nboth from feeling pain. In other words, medical science increasingly \nconfirms the common experience of parents and the religious and ethical \nbelief of the ages that an unborn baby is just as much a person as you, \nas I, as each of us, only more innocent, more helpless and therefore \neven more deserving of protection, especially by the halfway point of \nthe pregnancy. They feel pain and they seek life. It is particularly \nheartbreaking that such babies are killed in our country.\n  By some estimates, 10,000 babies 20 weeks or older are aborted each \nyear. By this point most Americans have seen the gruesome videos of \nPlanned Parenthood officials callously discussing the dismemberment of \nbabies to harvest and sell their organs. They cavalierly talk about \nusing ``less crunchy procedures'' to preserve the organs, subjecting \nthe baby to excruciating pain and death for profit.\n  This is a sad reality in America today. Just 2 miles from where I \nstand, just 5 blocks from the White House is an abortionist who \nadvertises on his Web site for abortions without restriction up to 26 \nweeks--right up to the third trimester. It is far past the medically \naccepted point of viability. Who knows how many other abortionists do \nthe same, just more discreetly.\n  It is past time to end this barbaric practice and protect these \ninnocent babies. Therefore, I strongly support the Pain-Capable Unborn \nChild Protection Act and urge my fellow Senators to do the same. This \nlegislation would stop the abortion of babies 20 weeks or older, with \ncertain reasonable and widely supported exceptions.\n  I understand that abortion provokes strong feelings on both sides of \nthe question. I acknowledge that reasonable people of good will \ndisagree about the wisdom and morality of early first-term abortions, \nbut I am mystified as to why we cannot come together and agree to \nprotect babies who feel pain and who can survive outside of the womb. \nIt is not just I and large majorities of the American people who feel \nthis way; the civilized world overwhelmingly rejects this kind of late-\nterm abortion. Only seven countries allow elective abortion after 20 \nweeks, including Communist dictatorships like China and North Korea, \nwhich also inflict enforced abortion and sterilization on their people. \nBy contrast, countries to our left, like France and Germany, heavily \nrestrict or ban abortion after the first trimester and so does Belgium, \nhome of the European Union. Even Russia bans elective abortion after \nthe first trimester.\n  Our abortion policy is one case where we should be ashamed of our \ninternational isolation and follow Europe's lead in protecting innocent \nlife. In our country, founded as it is on the equal rights of mankind \nand the unalienable right of life, it is deeply disappointing that the \nlaws don't protect those most innocent lives among us, particularly \nwhen medical science now has the ability to do so. These scientific \nadvances, like life itself, are miracles. These days it may seem like a \nmiracle when a law passes around here. If that is the case, as a \nfather, as an American, as a lawmaker, I think a miracle is called for \nnow if it ever was.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n[[Page S6827]]\n\n  \n\n\n\n                             The Filibuster\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, during the last several days several \nRepublicans have suggested that the Senate should abandon a tradition \nthat has existed in this body since Thomas Jefferson wrote the rules of \nthe Senate in 1789. It is the tradition of extended debate--a tradition \nthat when an issue comes up, under the rules of this body, we continue \nto talk, we continue to debate until every Senator has had his or her \nsay, at least enough of a say that 60 Senators then say it is time to \nstop talking and start voting.\n  Republicans who want to abolish the filibuster in the Senate are, I \nwould suggest, Republicans with very short memories. The Senate's 226-\nyear tradition of extended debate was created for the purpose of \nprotecting the minority from the tyranny of the majority. For the last \n70 years, most of the time Republicans have been the minority needing \nthat protection.\n  Since World War II, Democrats have controlled the Presidency and both \nHouses of Congress for 22 years; Republicans have had such complete \ncontrol for 6 years. Let me say that again. Since World War II, \nDemocrats have controlled the Presidency and both Houses of Congress \nfor 22 years; Republicans have had such complete control for only 6 \nyears.\n  During those 22 years when the Democrats had complete control, \nwithout a Senate filibuster to protect the minority, Democrats could \nhave enacted any law they wanted. To see what can happen when Democrats \nhave complete control and Republican Senators can't filibuster, one has \nto look back only to 2009 and 2010. Then, because there were 60 \nDemocratic Senators making a Republican filibuster futile, the country \ngot ObamaCare. This is because the so-called filibuster rule says that \nthe Senate cannot vote on legislation until 60 of the 100 Senators \ndecide it is time to end the debate. When more than 40 Senators want to \ncontinue debating and object to moving to a vote, that is called a \nfilibuster.\n  Let's look at the future, to the possibility of a President Hillary \nClinton, a Democratic majority in both Houses, and no Senate filibuster \nrule. My prediction is that at the top of the Democratic agenda would \nbe a Federal law abolishing right-to-work laws in the 25 States that \nhave them. This is precisely what President Lyndon B. Johnson tried to \ndo in 1965 and 1966. President Johnson was not successful. What stopped \nthe President? A threatened filibuster by the Senate Republican leader \nEverett McKinley Dirksen.\n  You can make your own list of what else would be on the agenda if \nDemocrats had complete control and there were no Senate filibuster. I \nwould predict higher taxes, more gun control, fewer abortion \nrestrictions, making every city a sanctuary city, card check instead of \nthe secret ballot for union elections, and numerous other liberal laws.\n  The most important reason to keep the filibuster rule is that the \ncountry needs one legislative body that takes its time to think through \nan issue and try to develop a consensus. The House of Representatives \nis, quite properly, the Nation's sounding board. If the country is \nboiling, the House of Representatives is boiling. On the other hand--as \nGeorge Washington told Thomas Jefferson--the Senate is the saucer into \nwhich hot tea is poured to cool. The Senate's tradition of extended \ndebate requires continuing debate until 60 Senators decide it is time \nto stop discussing and time to start voting. That allows every Senator \nto have a say. It encourages bipartisan consensus, which is the best \nway to govern a large, complex country such as the United States of \nAmerica.\n  When both parties agree on a solution to a controversial issue--such \nas the civil rights laws of the 1960s--the country accepts the laws \nmore easily. When the laws are jammed through by a partisan vote--as \nhappened with ObamaCare--the losers start the next day trying to repeal \nthe law and the country is plunged into confusion.\n  There is one more serious problem with the current proposals to use \nthe so-called nuclear option to change the Senate rules. Senate rules \nrequire 67 votes to change the rules. If Republicans use the nuclear \noption, we would be operating in the same lawless fashion that the \nDemocrats did in 2013, when they used a mere majority vote to eliminate \nthe filibuster for most Presidential nominations.\n  The Democrats' action in 2013 made little difference in how the \nSenate actually operates by custom. By custom, nominations have almost \nalways been decided by a majority vote, but the 2013 use of the nuclear \noption set a damaging precedent. As one dissenting Democratic Senator \nsaid, a Senate that can change its rules any time it wants by majority \nvote is a Senate without any rules.\n  How then could the country's chief rulemaking body earn respect for \nthe rules it makes for 320 million Americans if we don't follow our own \nrules? Unlike nominations, the opportunity for extended debate on \nlegislation has existed since Thomas Jefferson wrote the Senate rules \nin 1789.\n  Of course, the current proposals to abolish the filibuster wouldn't \nchange a thing in the Congress. President Obama could simply veto \nwhatever he wanted to. According to the U.S. Constitution, it takes 67 \nvotes in the Senate to overturn a Presidential veto.\n  Now, it is true that Democrats and Republicans have used the \nfilibuster too often. There absolutely should be an up-or-down vote in \nthis body on the President's Iran agreement and on the 12 \nappropriations bills that our committee has completed work on and are \nready to come to the floor. All of them are being blocked by Democratic \nfilibusters.\n  To solve this problem, some suggest eliminating the filibuster only \nin ``some cases,'' but who will decide which cases are ``some cases''? \nIf the minority decides, nothing will be changed. If the majority \ndecides, the minority is crushed. The only way to reduce the number of \nfilibusters is by consent and by restraint on the part of both \npolitical parties.\n  In 1995, Republicans were elected majorities in both Houses of \nCongress. A Democratic Senator proposed abolishing the filibuster. Even \nthough this temporarily would have seemed to benefit Republicans, every \nsingle Republican voted no. House Republicans are often frustrated \nbecause legislation that runs through the House like a freight train \nslows down or even grinds to a halt in the Senate. But that was the \nsystem of checks and balances that our Founders created, and sometimes \nthe shoe is on the other foot.\n  This year, the Senate has passed important legislation on a 6-year \nhighway bill which is still stalled in the House. Republicans and \nconservatives who are thinking about abolishing the filibuster should \nthink some more about how ObamaCare became law. They should think about \nwhat it would be like to live in the 25 States that now have right-to-\nwork laws if Democrats gained the Presidency and majorities in Congress \nand abolished those right-to-work laws because there was no Senate \nfilibuster. Think about what might happen if Democrats again have \ncomplete control and Congress dances to the tune of the White House and \nthe Republican minority might have no filibuster to protect itself and \nthis country from the tyranny of that Democrat majority.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have an editorial from \nthis morning's Wall Street Journal printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 21, 2015]\n\n                    Editorial: Republican Filibuster\n\n\n   Blowing up the Senate's 60-vote rule would gain no policy victory\n\n       In the movie classic ``Animal House,'' the fraternity \n     brother Otter reacts to the Delta House's closure with the \n     line, ``I think that this situation absolutely requires a \n     really futile and stupid gesture be done on somebody's \n     part.'' To which Bluto replies, ``We're just the guys to do \n     it.'' The film ends by noting that Bluto becomes a Senator, \n     so perhaps this explains the growing frenzy to abolish the \n     filibuster.\n       Conservatives are frustrated that Republicans lack the 60 \n     votes necessary to end Senate debate and send bills to \n     President Obama that disapprove the Iran nuclear deal and \n     defund Planned Parenthood. Thus they want Majority Leader \n     Mitch McConnell to break Senate rules midterm and exercise \n     the ``nuclear option'' to pass legislation with a simple \n     majority instead of the current three-fifths requirement to \n     end debate and allow a vote.\n       Conservatives also want some understandable revenge for \n     then Majority Leader Harry Reid's 2013 decision to kill the \n     filibuster for most executive nominees and appellate\n\n[[Page S6828]]\n\n     judges to pack the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The \n     liberals who used to wail that the filibuster undermines \n     democracy have suddenly gone silent now that Democrats are \n     using the tool to obstruct conservative priorities.\n       In a letter last week, 57 House Republicans declared that \n     some bills are ``so consequential that they demand revisions \n     to the Senate's procedures.'' In a press conference, Kevin \n     McCarthy, the House Majority Leader, also endorsed the idea \n     ``to let the people have a voice.''\n       Presidential candidate John Kasich said Sunday that he \n     favored ``extreme measures,'' including blowing up the \n     filibuster. ``Forget about the 60-vote rule,'' fellow \n     candidate Scott Walker said at last week's debate. ``Pass it \n     with 51 votes, put it on the desk of the President and go \n     forward and actually make a point. This is why people are \n     upset with Washington.''\n       Maybe so, but surely Messrs. Walker and Kasich know that \n     Mr. Obama will veto anything that emerges from Congress on \n     Planned Parenthood or Iran. Senate Republicans still wouldn't \n     have the 67 votes to override a veto. So they'd achieve no \n     policy victory.\n       In exchange, they'd end an important check on majoritarian \n     control--an action they may one day come to regret. Over the \n     years the filibuster has helped block numerous progressive \n     priorities such as union card-check, limits on political \n     speech, and cap and trade. The filibuster also allows a \n     minority to help shape legislation, not merely to block it, \n     and on balance the procedure has served the country well by \n     moderating extreme proposals.\n       If Republicans do want to convert the Senate into a high-\n     end version of the House, where even a near-majority is \n     powerless, then they should at least do so when they can \n     accomplish something significant with a Republican President. \n     The precise wrong time is 14 months ahead of an election that \n     may result in a new Democratic President and Senate majority \n     under leader-in-waiting Chuck Schumer.\n       Now that Mr. Reid has cashiered the filibuster for \n     nominees, we agree that Republicans should follow that \n     precedent the next time there's a GOP President. A GOP Senate \n     majority should refuse to let Democrats filibuster a \n     conservative Supreme Court nominee. But giving up the \n     filibuster over policy now would be a futile gesture that \n     liberals would exploit to expand government in the future.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, I rise today to speak about yet another \nRepublican attempt to limit women's health care choices.\n  Congress should be focused on funding the government and keeping our \ncountry open for business. Instead, we are wasting our limited \nlegislative days on H.R. 36, a bill that will not pass, and therefore \nis just for show. This bill is yet another example of a relentless \nanti-woman agenda. Rather than doing our jobs to keep important \ngovernment services funded, we are debating a 20-week abortion ban.\n  The decision to end a pregnancy is a difficult one that involves many \nfactors. Each case is unique, and any decision made is a very private \none. Ending a pregnancy after 20 weeks is extremely rare. It is often a \nmedical necessity.\n  This weekend in the Washington Post a woman bravely wrote about her \nneed to end her pregnancy after the 20-week mark. When Rebecca and her \nhusband went in for a routine checkup, they received the tragic news \nthat her pregnancy was no longer viable. After consulting many \nphysicians and specialists, Rebecca was left with an untenable \ndecision, but she was able to access all of her health care options and \nget care that was right for her.\n  This bill would severely limit the ability of women to access vital \nand necessary health care options. H.R. 36 contains few exceptions, and \nthese exceptions are so burdensome that they may as well not be there.\n  I have met with providers who stand on the frontlines of this choice \ndebate. Despite threats lobbied at them every day, they work hard to \nensure that the United States is a country where women are fully \nempowered to make decisions about their own health care. These \nphysicians have seen the heartache and agony women experience making \nthis difficult decision. Women should not be subjected to medically \nunnecessary, financially taxing, and just plain cruel treatment at the \nbehest of some Republican lawmakers.\n  If my colleagues truly wanted to improve women's health care, they \nwould fund title X programs, bolster the Maternal and Child Health \nBlock Grant, and support the Affordable Care Act.\n  We have no business attempting to legislate a private, \nconstitutionally protected right using unsubstantiated science and \nhyperbole. In fact, numerous courts have found similar laws by States \nto be unconstitutional. We need to move on from these votes for show \nand get back to the real work of the Senate. I am calling this bill \nwhat it is: An unnecessary, unwarranted, and likely unconstitutional \nintrusion into women's private health care decisions.\n  Meanwhile, time is running out to reach an agreement to keep our \ngovernment open, and we cannot afford another shutdown. We need to pass \na clean continuing resolution to keep the government going. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in focusing on legislation to improve the lives \nof every single American. We need legislation that increases access to \neducation, promotes job growth, strengthens our national security, and \nkeeps America vibrant.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in voting no on cloture on H.R. 36.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PERDUE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PERDUE. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Appropriations\n\n  Mr. PERDUE. Madam President, I rise today to talk about why I am \nhere, and really why all of us are here. We are here to represent the \npeople of our great States. We are here to do the people's business and \nto be good stewards of taxpayer dollars.\n  We just finished an ongoing debate about how Congress can direct and \nguide foreign policy in the United States. In doing so, we have seen \nthe dangerous consequences of partisan politics right here on the \nSenate floor and how that can affect this process. Just last week, 42 \nof my Democratic colleagues supported President Obama's dangerous \nnuclear deal with Iran while still having serious concerns about its \nglobal ramifications.\n  Now we must refocus our attention on solving our fiscal crisis and \ntackling our skyrocketing national debt. State governments across the \ncountry set both funding levels and clear priorities for their States \neach year based on the needs of their people and their local \ncommunities. Washington has been distracted from this for far too long. \nBalancing the budget and efficiently allocating resources is what \nWashington has not done well for the last several years. Too many \npeople here are preoccupied by politics of the day when getting our \nfiscal house in order should always be the top priority. In other \nwords, Washington has stopped listening to the American people. Well, \nI--and a few of us, including the Presiding Officer--am indeed \nlistening. The American people told us what they wanted in November of \nlast year when the Presiding Officer and I were elected. Georgians tell \nme repeatedly--even now--what they want. They want less government. \nThey want less spending. They want us to push back against President \nObama's out-of-control spending and Executive overreaches that are \nfailing the working men and women of America. The bottom line is they \nwant us to deal with this debt crisis.\n  Earlier this year, the Senate Budget Committee took a great first \nstep by passing a balanced budget for the first time since 2001. This \nbudget outlined our conservative principles and spending limits. This \nbudget spends $7 trillion less than the President's budget over the \nnext 10 years. What it doesn't do is reduce the debt today or deal with \nthe over $100 trillion of future unfunded liabilities coming at us like \na freight train. It does balance in 10 years, which is quite an \nachievement given what we had to work with, but more can and must be \ndone right now. So I am going to continue my focus on cutting wasteful \nspending and reducing Federal expenditures with the goal of developing \na long-term plan to pay down this out-of-control massive $18 trillion \nof Federal debt.\n  In the last 6 years, we spent $21\\1/2\\ trillion funding our Federal \nGovernment. That is so large that it is hard to spend. What I can't \nunderstand is of\n\n[[Page S6829]]\n\nthat $21\\1/2\\ trillion, $8 trillion was borrowed. We simply cannot \ncontinue going down this road. While one side wants tax increases, the \nother side wants spending cuts. In my experience, neither alone will \nsolve the equation in its entirety. Growing our economy is the only \nreal solution. Again, the budget is just the first step. We must put \nour conservative principles into action and work through the regular \nappropriations process to determine how we responsibly allocate Federal \nfunds.\n  The Senate Appropriations Committee has put forward 12 appropriations \nbills that adhere to the Republican budget and that reflect the \npriorities of the American people. Overall, these bills are under the \nBudget Control Act caps that were put in place by Congress in 2011 to \ncontrol spending. More importantly, they better prioritize taxpayer \ndollars to meet the goals of the American people. For example, these \nappropriation bills decrease spending on ObamaCare and increase \nspending for border security. They end the EPA's waters of the United \nStates rule and stop the Obama administration's onerous greenhouse gas \nregulations. They also prohibit the NLRB from changing the rules of the \ngame, such as the ambush election rule and changing the joint-employer \nrelationship, in order to prevent negative impacts to American workers \nand business.\n  They subject the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, to \ncongressional oversight and eliminate hundreds of duplicative programs \nthat have outlived their original mission. The list goes on and on.\n  The fiscal year ends on September 30. That is only a few days from \nnow. We must move forward and debate these 12 appropriations bills that \nreflect Georgia values and fulfill the promises we all made to \nrepresent the American people.\n  While we have already seen our Democratic colleagues block such \ndebate on these important bills, I hope we can immediately restart this \ncritical process and return to regular order. Certainly, a full and \nrobust debate on all of these bills is necessary to ensure that our \nFederal Government continues to function without overspending.\n  Now, I can tell my colleagues there are some things I would like to \nchange in these bills, but they ought to be debated. It ought to be \ndebated in the open and not blocked by more partisan gridlock that we \nsee here every day. I hope the majority leader will continue to bring \nthese bills to the floor and I hope the objections of my Democratic \ncolleagues will finally end, and let's get to an open and honest \ndebate.\n  Georgians sent me to the Senate to fight for them, and that is what I \nintend to do. This is just a start. I will not and I cannot stand by \nwhile Senate Democrats continue to block the Senate from doing the \npeople's work as they did every day when they were in charge.\n  Madam President, I also wish to speak for just a moment on a bill \nthat is going to come up this week focusing on the unborn. I wish to \nsay a few words today in support of the Pain-Capable Unborn Child \nProtection Act of which I am a proud cosponsor in the Senate. Simply \nput, this legislation protects unborn babies from unimaginable pain.\n  Every child is a blessing, and I am incredibly fortunate that God has \nblessed my wife and me with two great boys and three grandsons. I will \nnever forget the day we found out we were going to have our first \nchild. It was life changing. When the doctor gave us the exciting news, \nwe were overjoyed, but, at the same time, we were a bit overwhelmed. We \nwere young, like most parents. We were going to become parents. We were \ngoing to have a baby. There is a difference.\n  Like every expectant mother, my wife was glowing. She may not have \nfelt great and maybe didn't think she was glowing, but I assure my \ncolleagues, she was. I will never forget seeing our baby on the \nultrasound for the first time, or feeling him kick. And, the day my \nfirst son was born, holding him for the very first time was one of the \nmost incredible moments of my life.\n  When the doctor told us we were going to have our second child, I was \nconcerned we couldn't possibly love this second child as much as we did \nthe first, but, wow, how I was wrong.\n  Later in life, my wife and I have been blessed with three grandsons \nwho are all great. There is no greater love than that of a parent, \nalthough it can be rivaled by that of a grandparent. Believe me, my \nthree grandchildren know how to tug at my heartstrings.\n  My children and grandchildren are why I am here in the Senate, \nfighting for them and others like them to have a better future, for my \nfellow Georgians, for them, and for all Americans.\n  We live in the most compassionate country in the world. We send food, \nclothing, and medicine all over the world to help save underprivileged \nchildren and families who are struggling to find the basic things they \nneed to survive. It is extremely troubling, therefore, that our \ncountry's compassion for life is absent here at home. Only seven \ncountries in the world allow parents to abort a baby after 5 months--\nonly seven. That is not a list America should aspire to be a part of.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, over 10,000 unborn \nbabies 20 weeks or older are killed in America every year. Imagine that \nfor a moment. Each year, more than 10,000 lives, who feel and react to \npain, have their lives brutally taken from them.\n  In my view, this is a national disgrace. It is absolutely \nunconscionable. I cannot believe protecting life, especially that of \nthe unborn, is an actual subject of debate. One would think this would \nbe an issue of unity, but debate on this important legislation could \nnot have come at a more urgent time.\n  Recent gruesome videos describe the harvesting and selling of fetal \norgans and remind our Nation just how barbaric the abortion industry \nhas become. As a parent, and now a grandparent, I find it difficult to \nimagine that something so horrific can happen in a country as \ncompassionate as America.\n  Our Nation must promote a culture that values all life. We must \nprotect the innocent and the most vulnerable among us, especially the \nunborn.\n  We can protect unborn babies from unimaginable pain. We can protect \nlife.\n  That is why I support this legislation. That is why I cosponsored it. \nI urge my colleagues to take it very seriously.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his suggestion?\n  Mr. PERDUE. Yes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Georgia.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  I rise today in my series of ``Time to Wake Up'' speeches to bring \nattention to two of God's humblest but most useful creatures.\n  Here in the high political majesty of the Senate, it is easy to \nforget Matthew: ``No man can serve two masters. . . . Ye cannot serve \nGod and mammon.''\n  Who do we serve here? I submit it is mammon, all day long, no doubt \nabout it. Mammon surrounds and submerges us. We swim in its currents. \nThis Senate of ours, this is ``Mammon Hall.''\n  How easy it is from our perch of worldly power here in Mammon Hall to \noverlook the humble, and what could be humbler than God's humblest \nbeasts? So, today, I want us to remember two: The bumblebee and the \npteropod.\n  When was the last time any of us thought of the humble bumblebee? Not \nrecently, I expect, and not often. We have important things to do. Who \ncan be thinking about bumblebees? Yet, by the millions, by God's plan, \nthese small creatures spend their days out busily pollinating the \nplants that yield the crops that turn into the food we humans depend on \nto survive.\n  The humble bumblebee does much more good in God's natural realm than \nwe humans do. On the spectrum between givers and takers of this good \nEarth's blessings, we humans are way over on the taker end of the \nspectrum, and the bumblebee--it is humble--but it is way over on the \ngiver end. And the humble pteropod, how many of us even know what it \nis? Not many in this Senate, I would bet. The pteropod is a winged \nsnail that populates the ocean in immense numbers. It is sometimes \ncalled the sea butterfly because, over millenia, God's evolution of \nthese creatures has turned their snail foot into\n\n[[Page S6830]]\n\nan oceanic wing. A cousin species is called the sea angel.\n  Like the bumblebee, the pteropod performs an unheralded service in \nGod's natural realm. The pteropod is an essential link in the oceanic \nfood chain, supporting the whole great network of trophic levels and \nspecies above it.\n  In what Pope Francis calls ``the mysterious network of relations \nbetween things''--in that mysterious network of relations between \nthings, the pteropod gives its life to transmit food energy from the \nmicroscopic plants it eats, that would be no use to us, up to the fish \nthat consume the pteropod--fish, which we, in turn, consume--all in \nthat great ``mysterious network.''\n  Back here in Mammon Hall, many interests can only appreciate nature \nin monetary terms and can only value things to the extent that they can \nbe monetized. They are the mercenary sort Pope John Paul II said ``see \nno other meaning in their natural environment than what serves for \nimmediate use and consumption.'' Or, as Pope Benedict said, think \n``everything is simply our property and we use it for ourselves \nalone.'' They are the interests who, as Pope Francis said, have the \nattitude ``of masters, consumers, ruthless exploiters, unable to set \nlimits on their immediate needs.'' According to them, if you can't grab \nit and sell it, it has no value--not here in Mammon Hall.\n  So, to them, let me say that the money-making salmon fishery depends \nin large part on the humble pteropod. For them, let me say that our \nenormous agribusiness enterprise depends on pollination by the humble \nbumblebee.\n  In Mammon Hall here, we have actually gotten used to this kind of \nbehavior. It no longer even seems deviant to us. It has become \nnormalized, but in our hearts we have to still know it is not normal. \nIt is wrong.\n  Pope Francis reminds us in his recent encyclical: ``When nature is \nviewed solely as a source of profit and gain,'' that is ``[c]ompletely \nat odds with . . . the ideals . . . proposed by Jesus.''\n  Completely at odds with the ideals proposed by Jesus.\n  The Pope was blunt. He said: ``Today, . . . sin is manifest in . . . \nattacks on nature. . . . a sin against ourselves and a sin against \nGod.''\n  That is what the interests we traffic with do all day long--no doubt \nabout it.\n  The Pope has said that ``our common home is falling into serious \ndisrepair. . . . [T]hings are now reaching a breaking point. . . . \n[H]umanity has disappointed God's expectations.'' The Earth herself, he \nsaid, ``groans in travail,'' and we are leaving to our children a world \nthat, to use his words, ``is beginning to look more and more like an \nimmense pile of filth.'' If we don't see that, it is because we see so \npoorly outside our privileged bubble of consumption.\n  But if we don't see that, the bumblebee and the pteropod do. Here is \nwhat is happening to them.\n  A study in the peer-reviewed journal Science, published in early \nJuly, shows that as temperatures warm, bumblebee populations are \nretreating northward from the hottest part of their ranges as they warm \nfurther and further. But here is the rub: The northern range for the \nbumblebees for some reason is not expanding, which means the changing \nclimate is crushing bumblebee populations in a climate vice.\n  ``Bumblebee species across Europe and North America are declining at \ncontinental scales,'' warns study author Dr. Jeremy Kerr of the \nUniversity of Ottawa. ``Our data suggest that climate change plays a \nleading role, or perhaps the leading role, in this trend.''\n  Carbon pollution from burning fossil fuels floods the atmosphere and \ncauses climate change. But about 25 percent of it actually enters the \noceans, and there, it acidifies the waters, souring them for creatures \nsuch as the pteropod.\n  Research led by NOAA scientists published last year found that \nacidified water off our west coast is hitting the pteropod especially \nhard. They found ``severe shell damage'' on more than half of the \npteropods they collected from Central California to the Canadian \nborder. That was more than double the expected rate. The pteropods are \nbeing eaten away by acidic water.\n  Oceanographer William Peterson, coauthor of the study, said, ``We did \nnot expect to see pteropods being affected to this extent in our \ncoastal region for several decades.'' The pace and extent of ocean \nacidification that we are observing now, that we are measuring now, \nthat we are driving now with our carbon pollution, are nearly \nunprecedented in the geological record. The closest historical analogs, \nscientists say, are the great extinctions, when marine creatures were \nwiped out en masse and ocean ecosystems took millions of years to \nrecover.\n\n  John Kenneth Galbraith knew something about importance, and he said \nthis about importance: ``The threat to men of great dignity, privilege, \nand pretense is . . . from accepting their own myth.'' That happens \nwhen that ``great dignity, privilege, and pretense'' become so great \nthat we no longer feel the need to listen--certainly not to something \nas insignificant as a bumblebee, as humble as a pteropod. But remember \nwhy Jesus was so angry with the Pharisees. What was their sin? Their \ndignity, their privilege, and their pretense blinded them to how out of \ntouch they were with the truth.\n  So here we are in mammon hall, where powerful special interests court \nus, gigantic corporations lobby us, and billionaires pay us attention, \nand indeed they fund some of us. Presidents must deal with us. Truly, \nwe are today's Pharisees. But Jesus taught that truth is among the \nthings that are humble.\n  We had better start listening to the bumblebee and the pteropod, to \nthe coral polyp and the oyster spat, to the New Hampshire moose and the \nIdaho pine, to the Utah snowfall and the California drought, to the \nmeasured carbon concentration of our only atmosphere and the measured \npH level of our only oceans. These are gifts, and these gifts are all \nGod's creations, and their signals are all God's voice. We ignore them \nin our arrogance, we ignore them in our folly, and we ignore them at \nour peril.\n  It has already begun, as we careen into the next great extinction. As \nPope Francis wrote, ``Because of us, thousands of species will no \nlonger give glory to God by their very existence, nor convey their \nmessage to us. We have no such right,'' he said.\n  Indeed, we have no such right. The day the bumblebee and pteropod no \nlonger give glory to God by their very existence will be a bleak and \nperilous day for humankind. In the meantime, we had better smarten up \nto the message they convey to us. If their message, if the message of \nGod's creatures--if that message of warning is not God's voice, then \nwhose voice is it?\n  I challenge you. If the voice of God's creatures to us in the way \nthey lead their lives and the way they are dying is not God's voice, \nthen whose voice is it and what message does it convey?\n  As Pope Francis comes to this Congress this week, I hope we will \nlisten to the voice of God as expressed through his humblest creatures \nand just for a second turn off the noise from mammon that surrounds us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair.\n  This Senator wants to take a few moments to talk about the Pain \nCapable Unborn Child Protection Act, which I think is a good piece of \nlegislation. I support it, and I hope my colleagues will allow it to \nmove forward. I think when God speaks, maybe He would speak about that \nissue too.\n  However, I really want to talk a little bit more about where we are \non the funding of Planned Parenthood, the two aspects of it. One is a \nlarge--hundreds of millions of dollars--appropriations that goes there \nthrough the Medicaid program, and another is $28 million that was \ndirectly appropriated last year from the government to this Planned \nParenthood agency. I call it an agency, but that is not really correct. \nIt is a nongovernmental entity, a nongovernmental activist group that \ndoes some good things and some things I don't think are good.\n  I think we ought to recognize that Congress has certain powers. It is \nvery clear, I would submit, that a majority of the Members of the \nSenate and a majority of the Members of the House of Representatives do \nnot want to fund this agency--certainly not as it has been funded in \nthe past. What we have, as I understand it now, is at least $28\n\n[[Page S6831]]\n\nmillion of federal money that goes to it unless Congress decides not to \nfund it.\n  Colleagues, the power of the purse resides in the United States \nCongress. Not one dollar can be spent by the President, any of his \nDepartment heads, or the U.S. military, unless Congress has \nappropriated the money. That is an ultimate power of Congress.\n  At the end of this fiscal year--September 30--if Congress has not \nappropriated money for the future, then it can't be spent. That is why \nwe have a so-called shutdown. If you don't fund the whole government, \nit is blocked in some way and then the government can't expend the \nmoney that has not been appropriated by the elected representatives of \nthe people of the United States.\n  Let me just say it this way. I don't believe the American people's \nmoney that has been extracted from them by the Internal Revenue Service \nand other government extractors--I don't believe that money should be \nspent on any program that is unhealthy or not wise. That is what we are \nall elected to do; is that not right? Fund programs that are good, \nworthwhile, and that create value for the American people, and not fund \nthe programs that we don't think are wise and create value, and \nadvocate and promote principles we think are healthy for the American \nculture, the American people. We don't have to fund any program \nCongress decides not to fund. The power of the purse resides in the \nCongress of the United States. A majority of the Congress does not \nfavor advancing funding for Planned Parenthood and certainly not the \n$28 million that goes through the HHS grant-writing process, so I \nsuggest we don't fund it. That is what I think. Let's not fund it. Why \nare we funding it?\n  Well, we have to fund it, Sessions. You don't understand.\n  What don't I understand?\n  If it is not funded, you are shutting down the government.\n  So if we do not provide the money for a nongovernmental agency that \nwe think is not spending the taxpayers' money wisely, we are shutting \ndown the entire government of the United States? I suggest that is a \nludicrous position, one that goes beyond any rationality, and I am \nprepared to say so.\n  How did this happen? How could they say that?\n  We are funding the government. We are passing a bill that funds all \nthe government agencies. It just doesn't fund this nongovernmental \nagency--the money they would like to have to advance their agenda, \nwhich isn't my agenda, so I am not for funding it. I got elected.\n  How did this happen?\n  Well, the President says he will veto the bill, and since Congress \nhasn't passed any of the appropriations bills in series like we should \nbe doing, it is going to be cobbled together in one monumental matter, \none monumental omnibus bill or continuing resolution. The President is \ngoing to veto the entire Federal funding because he doesn't want us to \ncut $28 million. He wants it to be spent the way he thinks it should be \nspent.\n  I think we should tell the President: Mr. President, you have your \npower. You can sign your agreement--not valid beyond your tenure--with \nIran even though we disagree with it. A substantial majority of both \nHouses opposes it, but apparently, you have the lawful authority to do \nso. But you don't have the lawful authority to spend money on an \nentity--not even a government entity--that Congress chooses not to \nspend money on. This is our business.\n  We are in a bad trend here of Congress just capitulating in favor of \nthe Executive. By any historical standard, I have never seen a more \nsupine Congress.\n  So should we fund this program? I say no. Don't put it in there. And \nI think we should send a note to the President:\n  Dear Mr. President, we funded the Defense Department, we funded \nMedicare, we funded Medicaid, we funded other programs, hundreds of \nthem, at $1 trillion. That would be in this bill, basically, around $1 \ntrillion. That is a thousand billion dollars. But we have chosen to cut \n$28 million of one of the programs we don't think is good. Congress \ndoesn't like it, and Congress chose not to fund it. And somebody told \nus that you declared that if we do that, you are going to veto the \nentire funding for the government of the United States, including the \nDefense Department and all the other programs that aid us, including \nthe Environmental Protection Agency. You are going to veto funding for \nthose agencies and blame the Congress and go on to say Congress caused \nthis. Wow.\n  He is going to say that we who funded the government and he who \nblocked the funding for the government have a disagreement over this \namount of money, and as a result he is going to veto the funding for \nthe government and accuse the Republicans, who passed the bill to fund \nthe government, of shutting down the government.\n  Now, some people are afraid of the President.\n  Oh, he always wins. The President always wins, and Congress always \nloses. Sessions, don't you understand?\n  But the facts of the case matter. The situation matters. If we follow \nthe budget and we appropriate at a level for the Defense Department \nthat the President wants and Congress wants and we do all these things, \nbut we just choose not to fund this program, I don't believe the \nPresident has the moral authority, the political clout to tell the \nAmerican people that the Congress shut down the government when he \nvetoes the bill that will fund the government.\n  So I just want to say that it is time for this Congress to do its \nduty, and we should fund programs that need funding and not fund \nprograms that don't need funding, and we should try wherever possible \nto reach a compromise the way we have done in the Armed Services \nCommittee. All the members of the committee argued about this, that, \nand the other, and we created a military bill which we think is a \nhealthy bill and which had overwhelming bipartisan support. Almost all \nof the appropriations bills that have come out of the committees have \nhad bipartisan support, I think many of them unanimous, Republicans and \nDemocrats--every one of them--supporting them. We get along around here \na lot better than people say. But there are certain things Congress \nshould not cede. It should not cede to the Executive the power of the \npurse. That is all I am saying.\n  At this point in time, we will be dealing directly with the HHS grant \nprograms that are giving money to an entity that I don't think should \nbe funded. I am not voting to fund it. I think that is a reasonable \nposition. And I think it would be extraordinary if the President were \nto take the view that he will not fund the Department of Defense and \nother programs of the government because of a disagreement over this \nissue.\n  Indeed, colleagues, I believe the House has proposed legislation that \nwould have generous funding for women's health. The money that would \nhave gone to Planned Parenthood would instead go through a general plan \nof community health centers and other quasi-government entities that \nserve women throughout the country.\n  So I thank the Presiding Officer for allowing me to say that. It is a \nmatter we are going to have to wrestle with as a Congress. In the long \nrun, I truly believe Congress needs to fulfill its constitutional role, \nand that congressional role calls on it to evaluate every dollar spent \nby this government, to examine those programs that we think are valid \nand fund them, and if they need more funding, to give them more funding \nconsidering the debt situation the country is in and to not fund \nprograms we do not think should be funded.\n  What other role do we have in the Congress greater than that, the \npower of the purse. The President is not authorized to demand Congress \nspend money on every program he desires, a program that sells body \nparts and other things of that nature that I do not think is decent and \ngood. So I am not for funding it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I rise in strong opposition to \ncontinued attacks on women's access to health care. Today, the Senate \nmajority leader is attempting to advance a bill to ban abortion after \n20 weeks. This is a blatantly unconstitutional proposal that injects \npolitics into a private and deeply personal decision, one that should \nremain between a woman and her medical provider and her family.\n\n[[Page S6832]]\n\n  This bill is the latest--but not the last, I know--in a serious of \nunrelenting attacks on safe and legal abortion in this country. It not \nonly represents a cynical affront to well-settled law, it poses a \nserious threat to women's health. Let me tell you why. Nearly 43 years \nago, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the Constitution protects, as a \nfundamental right, a woman's ability to decide whether and when to \nstart a family. This bill is plainly at odds with that holding and \nplainly at odds with the Constitution, which is why Federal and State \ncourts have found laws like this one unconstitutional time and time \nagain, but our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are now \npushing forward with this bill and doing it at the expense of women who \nneed medical care in the most desperate of circumstances.\n  Bills like this one demonstrate a callous disregard for the risks \nwomen face during pregnancy--women like Danielle Deaver, from Nebraska, \nwho went to the doctor in a desperate attempt to save her pregnancy \nwhen her water broke at 22 weeks. Tests revealed that Danielle's \namniotic fluid had ruptured, and her doctors explained that the baby \ncould not be expected to survive, but that was not all. The rupture \nalso put Danielle at risk, at risk of an infection that could \njeopardize her fertility and her ability to have children in the \nfuture. Together, Danielle and her husband made the heartbreaking \ndecision to terminate her pregnancy, but because Danielle lived in a \nState with an abortion ban that made no exception for a woman's health \nand had not been challenged in court, her doctor was unable to help. \nDanielle endured 8 days of severe pain and infection before delivering \na daughter who survived for just 15 minutes.\n  Christy Zink of Washington, DC, was 21 weeks pregnant when an \nexamination revealed that her pregnancy suffered from a severe fetal \nanomaly--meaning, effectively, that the entire hemisphere of the brain \nwas missing. Christy and her husband consulted her physician and other \ndoctors in an attempt to save her much wanted pregnancy, but after \nhearing of a near inevitability that if delivered, their child would \nnot survive, she and her husband ultimately made the very difficult \npersonal decision to end her pregnancy.\n  The bill we are discussing today has no exception for cases where a \nwoman's pregnancy experiences a fetal anomaly. If a ban like this were \nto become law, families like Christy's would have no options. As a \nfather of two grown children, with one grandchild and another on the \nway, I know what it feels like to celebrate the news that your wife or \nyour daughter or daughter-in-law is pregnant, to accompany them to \ndoctor's visits and checkups, to look forward to welcoming a child or \ngrandchild into your family, and to look on with hope and worry as the \npregnancy progresses, but my family has been very fortunate. I can only \nimagine the pain and heartbreak a family experiences when they are \nfaced with the kind of tragic news Danielle and Christy received when \nthey learned something was wrong, but the idea that Congress should \ninsert itself into those moments and act to limit the difficult choices \navailable to women and their families confronting unimaginable pain and \nsorrow is unconscionable.\n  This bill ignores women like Danielle and Christy. It ignores the \nunique circumstances surrounding every woman's pregnancy. Instead, it \nsubstitutes the judgment of Congress for that of medical professionals, \neven going so far as to threaten doctors with a 5-year prison sentence \nfor providing women with the care they need.\n  Make no mistake, this is an extreme proposal. Unfortunately, it \nrepresents just the latest salvo in an unending campaign to make safe \nand legal abortion virtually impossible to access. Since the 114th \nCongress was gaveled into session, we have seen no fewer than 65 \nlegislative attacks on the right to choose. Just last month, the Senate \nvoted on a measure that would have defunded Planned Parenthood, a \nhealth care provider that serves millions of Americans, including more \nthan 54,000 people in my State of Minnesota. That legislation failed, \nbut as the end of the fiscal year approaches, some of my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle--both in the House and in the Senate--have \npledged not to support a spending bill that continues funding for \nPlanned Parenthood. They prefer to see the government shut down rather \nthan allow a single penny to support the family planning services, the \ncancer screenings, and tests for sexually transmitted diseases that \nPlanned Parenthood provides.\n  My good friend from Alabama Senator Sessions--and he is a good \nfriend--suggested that we instead send that money to community health \ncenters. They do not have the staffing, they do not have the capacity \nto provide these needed services for the millions of people Planned \nParenthood serves. That is why the public does not agree. According to \na poll released last week, more than 7 in 10 Americans oppose shutting \ndown the government to defund Planned Parenthood.\n  One of the reasons the public does not buy into these tactics is they \nunderstand that access to reproductive health services, including \ncontraception and abortion, has a powerful effect on the decisions \nwomen and their families make every day, decisions about whether to \nstart a job or how much a family can afford to save for college.\n  For the vast majority of Americans, this is not political; this is \npersonal. It is not a place for Congress to interfere. I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose legislation that would restrict the ability of \nwomen and families to make their own reproductive choices.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, tomorrow this Chamber will vote on \nsomething called the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, \nlegislation I have cosponsored, that would recognize that a women has a \nlegal right to have an abortion up to the point of 5 months' gestation; \nthat is, after 5 months' gestation, an unborn child is beginning to \ngrow hair on their head, their fingernails are growing.\n  By this time in development, mothers are beginning to feel the baby \nkicking and moving for the very first time. In other words, this is the \npoint at which the child literally becomes viable, becomes a human \nbeing, capable of life outside of the mother. Obviously, a typical \nperiod of pregnancy is 40 weeks. So obviously we hope that in most \ncases a child will remain in the womb until it is fully developed. But \nthe fact is, talk to any neonatologist, talk to any physician, they \nwill tell you that at a point around 20 weeks, certainly 5 months of \ngestation, you have no longer a child dependent upon their mother for \nlife but somebody who can actually live independently.\n  Indeed, as many of us have done, go into some of these nurseries, \nwhere they have literally babies who weigh 1 pound or less, and see \nwhat medical science is able to do to actually save the lives of these \npremature babies--in a way that will allow them to grow up and be \nhealthy and productive. It is nothing less than a medical miracle.\n  But at 20 weeks of gestation, which is 5 months, an unborn child is \nwithout a doubt a life--a life worth defending and worth protecting. \nThis is something that is commonly accepted around the world. I don't \nknow how many people realize that actually this legislation would bring \nthe United States in line with the developed countries around the \nworld. As a matter of fact, the United States is just one of seven \ncountries worldwide that permit access to an elective abortion after 5 \nmonths of gestation, and we are in some pretty tough company. Right now \nwe are in company with China, Vietnam, and North Korea. The United \nStates, China, Vietnam, and North Korea basically permit an abortion up \nuntil the time a child is born naturally.\n  This bill is also important because it would significantly curtail \nthe horrifying practices depicted in the videos we have seen of Planned \nParenthood's operations over the summer. I am surprised to see in the \npress that only about 49 percent of the American people have actually \nseen these videos because they are so horrific, but I think they are \nalso shocking. And perhaps it is that people would just rather turn \ntheir gaze and look away rather than see the barbaric practices \ndepicted in\n\n[[Page S6833]]\n\nthese videos. But indeed these videos show Planned Parenthood \nexecutives callously discussing the value of an unborn child's organs, \nand it is truly morally reprehensible. I think, unfortunately, it \nreveals a dark side of humanity--one that prizes the organs of an \nunborn child over the potential life that child could have. And I have \nasked myself: How did we get here? How did we become so desensitized to \nthis practice? And if there is anything these videos have done, \nhopefully it is to awaken the conscience of the American people as well \nas the Members of Congress to realize exactly what is going on and to \nconduct the investigations that are now underway by four committees of \nthis Congress and to do what we can, such as passing this Pain-Capable \nUnborn Child Protection Act. It would make out of bounds the sort of \nlate-term abortions that apparently this sort of enterprise depicted in \nthe video depends upon.\n  This legislation is a unique and powerful opportunity for us to act \nand defend the lives of unborn children across this country. It is the \nbest chance we have to advance a culture of life in this country. I am \nnot suggesting that it is going to be easy or that we will have this \nvote and we will be finished. We will not be. I remember the long road \nto passage of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act over a decade ago, and \nI think the distinguished majority leader, who has set this matter for \na vote, recognizes that this is the beginning of raising the visibility \nof this horrific practice and asking the American people whether they \nare comfortable with the sort of conduct they see depicted on these \nvideos or whether we ought to think again about whether we want to be \npart of a coalition of China, Vietnam, and North Korea when it comes to \nsanctioning these late-term abortions after a baby has literally become \nviable in the womb.\n  If this bill becomes the law of the land, it will be the first time \nCongress has significantly and meaningfully advanced the pro-life \nagenda in over a decade. It took a long time for us to get the passage \nof the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act over a decade ago. And I don't \nthink we should underestimate the difficulty of passing this \nlegislation and other pro-life legislation, but we need to start. These \nvideos have given us the opportunity because they have awakened \nAmerica's conscience.\n  This legislation, if passed, would save the lives of thousands of \nunborn children and make impossible the sort of organ-harvesting \npractice that we have seen on fully developed, unborn babies that we \nhave seen depicted in these videos.\n  Tomorrow the Senate will have a unique opportunity to stand up for \nthe most vulnerable, and if we are not here to stand for those who \ncannot speak for themselves, the most vulnerable in our society, not \nthe least of whom are the unborn, what are we here for? I hope my \nSenate colleagues will vote to advance this legislation and in doing so \nvote to invoke a life of culture in this country.\n  Moving this bill forward should be seen as a moral imperative by \nevery Member of the Chamber. We can unite behind an understanding of \nobvious right and wrong and save thousands of lives by making the Pain-\nCapable Unborn Child Protection Act a reality.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Majority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                              Papal Visit\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I know many Americans are looking \nahead to the visit of Pope Francis this week with a great deal of \ninterest. Thousands will gather on the Capitol grounds for the chance \nto hear him speak. I think I can speak for every colleague when I say \nthe Senate welcomes him with open arms. We look forward to his visit.\n\n\n                           Government Funding\n\n  Madam President, it obviously is going to be a busy week in the \nSenate. That is true of the legislative issues before us as well. One \nis government funding.\n  Earlier this year, a new majority took office with a different \noutlook on government funding from that of the previous majority. We \nthought it made sense to actually pass a budget and then to fund it. So \nwe passed a budget for the first time in 6 years. Then we passed all 12 \nappropriations bills through a committee for the first time in 6 years. \nDemocratic colleagues voted for and praised the appropriations bills in \ncommittee. Had we passed the 12 appropriations bills on the floor, it \nwould have funded the government without the dramas of the past. But \nDemocrats didn't change their minds and decided to pursue a regrettable \n``filibuster summer'' strategy of blocking all government funding for \nmonths. Some blocked bills they had just praised, all with the aim of \npushing Washington into another one of these manufactured crises they \njust cannot seem to shake. It is truly unfortunate, but they have \nsucceeded in making this a reality we now face.\n  We have to push forward, and we will. I will have much to say on the \nissue as the week progresses. Discussions on the best way forward are \nongoing. Discussions about the character of our country continue as \nwell.\n  Madam President, tomorrow we will take up a bill the House of \nRepresentatives has already passed. It is legislation that would allow \nAmerica to join the ranks of most civilized nations when it comes to \nprotecting the lives of the most innocent and vulnerable.\n  We--along with countries like North Korea--are one of just seven \nnations to allow late-term abortions after 20 weeks, in other words, 5 \nmonths, when science and medical research tell us unborn children can \nfeel pain. As the father of three daughters, I find that both tragic \nand heartbreaking. Many Americans feel the same way. Polls show that \nboth men and women support protections for innocent life at 5 months.\n  I am asking colleagues to open their hearts and work with us to help \ndefend the defenseless. Help us pass the Pain-Capable Unborn Child \nProtection Act. I will have more to say about this important bill \nbefore we take a vote on it tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today in strong support of the \nPain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. This bill recognizes an \nindisputable fact and it stands for an indispensable principle. The \nfact is that each of us was a living human being before birth. The \nprinciple is that each human being has inherent dignity and worth.\n  The Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade degraded the \nConstitution, and the regime of virtually unrestricted abortion that it \nspawned continues to degrade our culture. It degraded the Constitution \nby reducing it to little more than a prop and using it as a cover for \nimposing the opinions of individual Justices. This decision is perhaps \nthe best example of what Justice Benjamin Curtis warned about in his \ndissenting opinion in Dred Scott v. Sandford. He wrote that when the \nopinions of individuals control the Constitution's meaning, ``we have a \ngovernment which is merely . . . an exponent of the individual \npolitical opinions of the members of [the Supreme] Court.'' That is \nexactly what Roe v. Wade is.\n  In addition to degrading the Constitution, the abortion regime \nspawned by Roe and maintained by its progeny continues to degrade our \nculture. This effect is inevitable because that regime is built on the \ndark proposition that humanity itself has no inherent worth that \ndemands respect and that individual members of the human family can be \nkilled for any reason at any time before birth.\n  It was not always like this. Just 25 years before Roe v. Wade, the \nUnited States voted for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The \nvery first statement in the preamble recognizes ``the inherent dignity \nand . . . the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human \nfamily.'' Article 3 states that everyone has the right to a life.\n  Just 2 years after the U.S. Supreme Court created an unlimited right \nto abortion in Roe v. Wade, the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany \ncame to a very different conclusion. Reviewing a law that allowed \nabortions in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, the German court said \nthat human life is the supreme value in the constitutional value and \n``the vital basis for humanity and the prerequisite of all other basic \nrights.'' What a contrast.\n  The United States has degraded human dignity by striking down a law\n\n[[Page S6834]]\n\nprotecting preborn children. Germany promoted human dignity by striking \ndown a law endangering preborn children. Our Supreme Court said that a \npreborn child is not a person under the U.S. Constitution and would not \neven address whether that child is a living, human being. The German \ncourt said that every human individual possessing life is covered by \nthe German Constitution, including preborn human beings.\n  One of the most successful coverups in legal and social history has \nmisled Americans into believing either that abortion is not legal for \nany reason at any time in this country or that this radical abortion \nregime is the norm around the world. Neither is true. Today the United \nStates is one of only seven nations in the entire world to allow \nelective abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Other members of that \nclub include China and North Korea.\n  The bill before us would prohibit the unjustified killing in the womb \nof human beings who can feel pain. The bill recognizes three \njustifications: when abortion is necessary to save the life of the \nmother and when the pregnancy resulted from rape or from incest against \na minor. This bill would do nothing more than move the United States a \nstep away from the most extreme abortion position in the world.\n  The Supreme Court may be preventing us from upholding in law the \ninherent dignity of all human beings before birth. That does not mean, \nhowever, that we should not defend that dignity for as many members of \nthe human family as we can. That is why I support the Pain-Capable \nUnborn Child Protection Act before us today.\n  This bill is consistent in two different ways with how the Supreme \nCourt has set rules for abortion regulations in the past. In Roe v. \nWade, the Court drew a line at certain points in pregnancy reflecting \nsomething that the Court found to be medically meaningful. The end of \nthe first trimester, the Court said, was related to the relative safety \nof the abortion procedure. The end of the second trimester, the Court \nsaid, marked the time when a preborn child could potentially live \noutside the womb, at least with artificial aid. The Court said that \nthese lines, which identify when certain abortion regulations are \npermissible, should be drawn ``in the light of present medical \nknowledge.''\n  That is exactly what this bill does. As its findings state, there is \nsubstantial medical evidence that a preborn child is capable of \nexperiencing pain by 20 weeks after fertilization, if not earlier. I \nmight add that this is not a recent discovery. Americans United for \nLife, for example, published a monograph more than 30 years ago \nreviewing the medical evidence. Dr. Vincent Collins, professor of \nanesthesiology at the University of Illinois, wrote that the entire \nsensory nervous system is functioning well before the 20-week point.\n  More recently, Dr. Maureen Condic, Associate Professor of \nNeurobiology and Anatomy at the University of Utah School of Medicine, \nhas testified before Congress and written that the scientific evidence \nregarding fetal pain is undisputed. That evidence shows that the \nbrain's circuitry responsible for the detection, and its response to \npain is established well before the 20-week mark.\n  This bill is consistent with precedent in another way. The Supreme \nCourt has approved actually prohibiting abortion after a point when the \npreborn child takes on an important quality that justifies protection. \nIn Roe v. Wade that reality was the viability or the ability to survive \noutside the womb with artificial aid.\n  In this bill, that quality is the ability to feel pain, which has \nbeen universally recognized as compelling. Both medicine and the law, \nfor example, impose a duty to relieve or to avoid pain. Just look at \nthe Web site of the National Institutes of Health. It includes an \narticle by Dr. Eric J. Cassell, Professor of Public Health at the \nCornell University Medical College. He writes that the obligation of \nphysicians to relieve human suffering stretches back into antiquity, \nand he calls relief of suffering ``one of the primary ends of \nmedicine.''\n  The clinical guidelines for acute pain published by the Federal \nGovernment stated that ``the ethical obligation to manage pain and \nrelieve the patient's suffering is at the core of the health care \nprofessional's commitment.'' The American Academy of Pain Medicine has \npublicized an Ethics Charter which outlines how physicians must \nimplement ``the ethical imperative to provide relief from pain.''\n  If medical professionals have a fundamental obligation to relieve \nhuman suffering, they should be prohibited from imposing human \nsuffering before birth. In its most recent abortion decision, the \nSupreme Court acknowledged that certain ethical and moral concerns can \njustify a specific abortion prohibition. The prevention of intentional \npain and suffering, the very core and one of the primary ends of \nmedicine, certainly qualifies and justifies the policy in this bill.\n  Turning to the law, the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \nprohibits cruel and unusual punishment. Federal courts across the \ncountry are considering whether the drugs used in lethal injection \ncause extreme or unnecessary pain and, therefore, violate the Eighth \nAmendment. Some have said that it does.\n  If the infliction of pain can make executing the guilty \nunconstitutional, I believe that the infliction of pain should make \naborting the innocent illegal.\n  Or look at the civil side of the law. Juries award multimillion \ndollar verdicts against medical professionals and facilities for \nfailing to relieve pain in their patients. One article in the Western \nJournal of Medicine reviewing such cases concluded that ``there is a \nstandard of care for pain management, a significant departure from \nwhich constitutes not merely medical malpractice but gross \nnegligence.'' If failing to prevent pain in the sick can make a \nphysician liable, physicians should be prohibited from inflicting pain \non healthy children before birth.\n  Madam President, I began by saying that Roe v. Wade and the abortion \nregime it spawned has degraded both the law and our culture. I am \nechoing the thoughtful words of President Ronald Reagan, who in 1983 \npublished an essay entitled ``Abortion and the Conscience of a \nNation.'' He wrote that abortion-on-demand is not a right granted by \nthe Constitution but was an act of raw judicial power. And he wrote, \n``We cannot diminish the value of one category of human life--the \nunborn--without diminishing the value of all human life.''\n  The American people have embraced this view. By more than 2 to 1 \nAmericans support what this bill would do--prohibiting abortions after \n20 weeks--and the percentage of women supporting a 20-week ban is even \nhigher than the national average.\n  I think opponents of this legislation owe the American people an \nexplanation. Why does a physician's ethical duty to prevent pain begin \nonly when someone is born? Why shouldn't that duty begin when someone \ncan feel pain? Why do we care so much about preventing even the most \ndespicable criminals from feeling pain but turn a blind eye to the pain \ninflicted on innocent preborn children?\n  The Supreme Court has said from the beginning that the right to \nabortion must be balanced with other compelling interests. Why does \nmedical knowledge matter when it facilitates abortions but not when it \ncan prevent the pain caused by abortion?\n  This bill recognizes the indisputable fact that each of us, including \neach individual Member of the Senate, was a living human being before \nwe were born. This bill reflects the indispensable principle that each \nindividual member of the human family has inherent dignity and worth. \nProhibiting the killing of innocent human beings who can feel pain is \nonly a small step in the right direction, but it is a step we must \ntake. I don't think there is a legitimate excuse for not taking that \nstep.\n  It is horrifying to me that some in the Senate don't understand this \nor, if they do, continue to march down the path of indiscriminate \nabortion on demand. I think they are going to have to pay a price for \nthat someday. It is a shame it has come to this type of a standard \nwhere you cannot protect preborn children who can feel the pain of \nabortion and feel the pain of some of the medical techniques some of \nthese abortionists use.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S6835]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, it is customary when rising in support of \nlegislation to speak in gracious terms about the opportunity to vote \nfor the legislation in question. This is a good day for the Senate. The \nAmerican people can be proud. This bill represents legislating at its \nvery best. That is what we say. I have said it in the past myself many \ntimes.\n  While I will soon join the majority--though maybe not the necessary \nsupermajority--of our colleagues voting to take up the Pain-Capable \nUnborn Child Protection Act, it is a tragedy that we should have to. \nThat late-term abortions, abortions after children are viable and their \nnervous systems can feel pain, are legal in this country, is itself an \naffront to American democracy and a stain on America's great history.\n  It is not the fault of the American people, who, like the rest of the \ncivilized world, are appalled by the violent extremism of aborting \nviable unborn infants. Rather, in 1973, it was originally the fault of \na constitutionally unhinged and scientifically illiterate Supreme Court \nmajority.\n  Four decades on, the fault is now fully shared by a Democratic Party \nso corrupted by special interest politics that it has forsaken the one \nprinciple--standing up for the little guy--that once earned them all \nAmericans' gratitude and respect. Our friends on the other side of the \naisle still claim that surrendered high ground, but that claim gets \nharder to take seriously every time they not only abandon but deny the \nvery humanity of the littlest guy or girl of all. Let's not forget that \nthe Democratic Party today is not just the party of taxpayer-\nsubsidized, late-term abortion on demand; it is also the party of \ntaxpayer subsidized, late-term, sex-selective abortion on demand. Seven \nor eight or nine months along, with eyes and a nose, a full head of \nhair, with a beating heart and a perfect smile and late-night hiccups, \nthey think it should be legal for a doctor to take her life, just \nbecause she is a girl or just because she may have Down Syndrome or a \ncleft palate or any reason really. To the Democratic Party today, there \nis no reason so superficial or bigoted that it shouldn't negate the \nright to life of an unborn child or a born child, for that matter.\n\n  As was confirmed by the recently released video testimony of abortion \nindustry insiders, some abortion clinics--clinics funded by the Federal \nGovernment--kill infants that are born alive. There is a word for that, \nand it isn't ``health care.'' Yet even though Philadelphia abortionist \nand serial infant killer Kermit Gosnell was convicted of first-degree \nmurder for doing just that, physician-assisted infanticide is something \nlike a stated principle of the Senate Democratic caucus. Remember, it \nwas on this very floor a few feet from here that in 1999, one of our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle said that legal protection of \na child should begin only ``when you bring your baby home.''\n  When we get down to it, what difference does a few centimeters make, \nanyway? Why should it be legal to kill a perfectly healthy 8-month-old, \n6-pound little girl right here and illegal to kill her over here? After \nall, abortion is not the first peculiar institution that has \narbitrarily dehumanized certain Americans based on geography, \nespecially with such a high progressive principle at stake.\n  As a Supreme Court Justice, of all people, put it in a 2009 interview \nwith the New York Times, describing the social, political, and moral \nattitudes that led to the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade, \n``Frankly, I had thought that at the time Roe was decided, there was \nconcern about population growth and particularly growth in populations \nthat we don't want to have too many of.''\n  As chilling as that sounds--and one certainly must wonder which \npopulations liberals wanted to cull--to me, the most important part of \nthat statement is not the hint toward genetic cleansing at the end; \nrather, it is the word ``frankly'' at the beginning. That was a window \ninto the soul of abortion extremism, and we see it again and again and \nagain.\n  On the rare occasions when we hear abortion advocates speaking \nfrankly, it terrifies us, and duly so. The conspirators exposed in the \nCenter for Medical Progress videos are only the most recent example. \nWatch the videos, listen to what they say, and pay attention to how \nthey say it. In their detached, dehumanizing euphemisms and stomach-\nturning humor, they speak not like fairy tale monsters, but the real \nthing--the rational, rationalizing men and women with prestigious \ndegrees and cultivated tastes who hide their barbarism in bureaucracy.\n  But we can rest assured, there will be no such talk here today. There \nwill be no such talk here tomorrow. There will be no frank, candid \npublic discussion of late-term abortions because that might eventually \nlead us to the truth--and only one side in this debate is interested in \nthat.\n  When it comes to the reality of abortion, pro-choice politicians \nchoose not to debate; they choose to deceive. They will come down to \nthis floor for the next 2 days not to defend what we all know is \nindefensible, rather they will try to cloak their extremism in a fog of \ndenial and distraction. Politicians who defend the right to kill born-\nalive little girls will, with straight faces, rail about a war on \nwomen. Politicians who defend lax, unsanitary clinic standards will, \nwith straight faces, lecture us all about their commitment to women's \nhealth. Politicians who resurrect embarrassing, medieval superstitions \nabout when life begins will, with straight faces, thunder against the \nscourge of Republican science-deniers--as if none of us has touched a \npregnant mom's tummy and felt a little kick, as if those grisly Planned \nParenthood videos didn't exist, as if none of us took high school \nbiology.\n  But they know the truth. In unguarded moments, as we have heard, they \nspeak the truth and one day the truth will set us all free and the \nDemocratic Party will stop taking its problems out on the kids. We are \nnot there yet, but as the desperate tactics on the other side of the \nquestion reveal, we are getting closer and closer all the time.\n  Truth doesn't wait on partisanship. The truth is, a ban on late-term \nabortions after 5 months should be the law of our land. The truth is \nthat unborn children can feel pain after only 2 months of development. \nIn the words of University of Utah Professor Maureen Condic, with whom \nI met last week, ``Based on universally accepted scientific findings, \nthe human fetus detects and reacts to painful stimuli as early as eight \nweeks following sperm-egg fusion.''\n  Now, for our unfrozen cavemen Senators on the other side of the aisle \nwhose primitive minds are confused and frightened by modern science, \nsperm-egg fusion is when biology tells us that human life begins, on \nday one, a fact that is neither a mystery nor above the pay grade of a \ncurious seventh grader. At 8 weeks, we know a fetus can feel pain. That \nis not just scientific consensus; it is ``universally accepted,'' \n``entirely uncontested'' in Dr. Condic's words.\n  Why then does the bill before us allow abortions even up to 20 weeks? \nBecause that is where the science is directly observable. That is how \nmodest a compromise this bill is. As Dr. Condic puts it, ``Fetuses at \n20 weeks have an increase in stress hormones in response to painful \nexperiences that can be eliminated by appropriate anesthesia.'' In \nother words, at 20 weeks, an unborn child can feel pain. We can see \nthem feel it. We can observe them as they feel it.\n  That is also the age, according to the New England Journal of \nMedicine, at which an unborn child is viable outside the woman. \nPrenatal surgeons can now treat unborn children as young as 16 weeks, \nand with every innovation and advance in perinatology, modern medicine \nstretches its miraculous light further and further into what used to be \n``the valley of the shadow of death.''\n  These are the facts: At 20 weeks, a little boy or a little girl has a \nchance to seize the great adventure of life, and they feel pain when \nthat chance is violently taken away from them, just like any child \nwould, just like our own would, just like we would. We owe it to them \nto give them that chance. The science actually goes much further. This \nbill is only the least we can do right now.\n\n[[Page S6836]]\n\n  Our generation doesn't yet know what chapter we are writing in \nAmerica's long struggle to defend the equal dignity of all human life, \nbut we all do know--even our friends on the side of the aisle, I \nthink--that this story has a happy ending. Like generations past that \novercame ignorance and bigotry to welcome marginalized Americans into \nour hearts and our society, we, too, shall overcome, because even \nthough the unborn don't have a voice, they do have an unflinching ally: \nthe truth, not just the philosophical truth expressed in our \nDeclaration of Independence but the biological, medical, and scientific \ntruth that unborn children are children. There is no us and them, just \nus, and deep down we all know it. We know that children are a gift and \ndeserve our protection. We know mothers are heroes and deserve our \nsupport. The bill before us would provide them a little bit more of \nboth.\n  Despite its majority support, this bill might not pass this time, and \nAmerica's moms and children waiting for the laws of the United States \nto catch up to the justice and compassion reflected in the laws of \nnature and of nature's God will have to wait a little longer--but not \ntoo long. For if our national story has taught us anything, it is that \nextremism in defense of violence will not long stand. This bill will \none day soon be the law of the land. So, too, will those passed last \nweek in the House of Representatives and still others yet to come.\n  The arc of American history may be long, but the American people have \na way of bending it toward life, and after decades of violence and lies \nand corruption, help is on the way. Maybe it is a good day for the \nSenate after all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                           Government Funding\n\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Madam President, here we are again. There is just over \na week before funding runs out to keep our government open, and some in \nCongress are threatening to shut down the Federal Government again to \nadvance their own political agendas.\n  I have said before and I will say it again, most Hoosiers think \nCongress can play a role in improving the economy, but at the very \nleast we shouldn't make things worse. That is exactly what Congress has \ndone with the Export-Import Bank. The Ex-Im Bank helps level the \nplaying field for American businesses, it helps protect and create jobs \nhere at home, returns money to the Treasury, and over 100 companies in \nIndiana use the Ex-Im Bank.\n  In July, some in Congress blocked the bipartisan effort to \nreauthorize the bank just so a few Members could play politics. As a \nresult, the Export-Import Bank is unable to provide any new financing \nto American businesses. In fact, we just found out, we have already \nseen some companies moving American jobs overseas because of this. \nDespite the lessons learned just 2 years ago, we are once again \ndebating whether Congress can meet its most basic needs and duties: \nkeeping the government open.\n  Frankly, it is embarrassing that some in Congress are willing to \nbring us to the brink of a government shutdown and would rather play \ngames with our recovering economy than solve the problems and \nchallenges in front of us.\n  The truth is, there is reason to be optimistic in our country. \nUnemployment is dropping, and nowhere in the world are there more \nopportunities to invest and to innovate in a brighter future and \nstronger economy than right here in the United States, but to realize \nour full potential, we have real work to do. We need to create more \ngood-paying jobs with which we can support a family and strengthen our \ncommunities, we need to invest in a 21st century infrastructure, and we \nneed to prepare and train a workforce ready to lead the world in both \ninnovation and production.\n  Over the last several weeks we have heard a lot of rhetoric about \nmaking America great again. America is already great. It starts with \nthe basics, and that is what we need to get back to--by showing up to \nwork every day and doing our jobs, just like every Hoosier does.\n  I am an optimist. I know we can do great things for our country. \nLet's do the job we were sent here to do in Congress--work together and \nkeep the government open. It is the least we should do. I am ready to \ndo it. I hope my colleagues will join me.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I note that my colleague from South \nCarolina has arrived on the floor, and I would happily yield to him if \nhe wishes to go. Otherwise, I will be very brief.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I want to second the very powerful \nremarks made by my colleague from Indiana. In Connecticut, what I hear \nagain and again is the need for this body to address jobs and the \neconomy. They are talking about putting people back to work and moving \nour economy forward. That is what I have sought to do from day one in \nthe U.S. Senate and what I will continue to fight to do. That is what \nwe should be doing through reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank, \ncreating more jobs in an infrastructure program worthy of the name, and \nrepairing and reinvigorating our roads, bridges, ports, airports, and \nour railroads which need to be made more safe and reliable. That is \nwhat we should be doing in programs for veterans--particularly in \nveterans health care--putting our veterans to work, programs that \nprovide for skill training and job opportunities for them.\n  There are so many momentous issues facing our Nation today, and that \nis the challenge we should be facing in the U.S. Senate. Yet tomorrow \nwe will be voting on a bill that is divisive, dangerous, and doomed to \nfailure. Even today, we are spending valuable time debating it.\n  The bill before us is both unconscionable and unconstitutional. It is \na waste of time because tomorrow it will be defeated, in effect. We are \nengaged in a political charade here. The timing may not be accidental, \nbut there is no good time for a blatantly and plainly unconstitutional \nproposal. Sadly, it is only the latest in a long line of \nunconstitutional proposals since the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in \nRoe v. Wade which enshrined a woman's constitutionally protected right \nto make her own reproductive decisions. There have been incessant and \nconstant attempts by politicians to substitute their own judgment for \nhers, for her doctor's, her family's, and for her religious advisers. \nThese decisions should be a woman's to make.\n  The onslaught on women's health care, unfortunately, has been a fact \nof life in this Nation. The bill before us now will ban abortion care \nafter 20 weeks of pregnancy except for so-called exceptions. The \ninadequacy of those exceptions alone doom this bill to unconstitutional \nstatus. The legislation represents an unconstitutional interference as \na matter of policy and law with the woman's right to choose the care \nthat is best for her and the failure to recognize the many complex \nfactors that may be involved in that decision, medical complications \nthat often lead to a woman's decision to seek a late-term abortion. The \nbill would place in her way a host of unnecessary, unwise, and \nburdensome requirements.\n  In effect, this bill would force women--including all who have been \nthrough the traumatic experience of rape or incest--to meet a \ncombination of a myriad of reporting and recordkeeping requirements. In \nmany cases, the bill would require survivors of heinous crimes to make \nmultiple appointments with multiple providers before having the right \nto reproductive care and force her to relive her traumatic experiences \nbefore having the benefit of those services. It would place numerous \nnonmedical requirements on doctors, such as forcing them to determine \nwhether survivors of rape or incest have reported their experience to \nappropriate law enforcement entities, essentially forcing doctors to \nchoose between criminal penalties and doing what is best for patients' \nhealth, which is why the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists oppose this\n\n[[Page S6837]]\n\nmeasure. None of these requirements placed on women or their doctors \nare rooted in science, health, or safety. None of these requirements \nare consistent with the constitutionally protected right to access \nreproductive care and abortion.\n  Simply put, women's health care decisions should be left to women, \ntheir families, themselves, their doctors, and themselves. That is the \nessence of the constitutionally protected right of privacy that \nunderlies all of these rights. It is the right to be left alone from \nmen and women in this Chamber who would intrude and invade that right.\n  This measure also implicitly encourages an ongoing and indeed \nintensifying assault on women's health care among the States. Many \nother unconstitutional and unconscionable attacks on women's health \ncare are increasing at the State level and making it harder for women \nto access reproductive health care in general. There is an increasing \ndrumbeat of regulations and restrictions that attack women's health \ncare and make it harder to access as State governments pass more \nregulations. Those regulations number now 230 in the past 5 years. They \nare nothing more than embarrassing attempts to deny women's health care \nin the guise of invasive and unnecessary medical tests, arbitrary \nbuilding regulations, and financially unsustainable procedures. That is \nwhy Senator Baldwin and I have proposed the Women's Health Protection \nAct, joined by 31 of our colleagues, to make sure that those State laws \nare stopped before they cause the costs, fear, and uncertainty, as they \nare bound to do and as they have done in many States around the \ncountry. These State laws are beyond wrong. They are dangerous to \nwomen's health care.\n  My hope is that we will be proactive in protecting a woman's right to \ncare, not encourage the worst of State practices that are embodied in \nthese restrictive State laws.\n  Finally, I am dismayed that the House of Representatives actually has \ntaken a step toward gutting a measure designed to help veterans. The \nBorder Jobs for Veterans Act of 2015--a bipartisan measure that I \ncosponsored with my colleague Senator Flake designed to do just what \nthe title says: to utilize the skills and expertise of our veterans to \nhelp fill vacancies at our borders, to use veterans to stop illegal \nimmigration--that bill has been gutted and unfortunately has been made \na vehicle to deny health care to women. The provisions of this \ntransformed legislation are a disservice to our veterans. I thought \nveterans legislation would be out of bounds for this fight. Sadly, \napparently not.\n  I urge my colleagues to find more productive ways to use our time, to \naddress the needs, to expand job opportunities, to move our economy \nforward, and to drive economic growth. A bipartisan goal we should all \nshare is to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank and to make sure we \nserve the best instincts of this Nation and preserve our Constitution \nfrom these unwarranted attacks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfor 15 minutes, and ask the Chair to let me know when my time is close \nto being up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am the author of legislation we will be \nvoting on tomorrow, so I am very proud of the product. I have worked \nwith my colleagues to try to come up with a solution to what I think is \na problem that needs to be addressed.\n  To my good friend from Connecticut, I appreciate where he is coming \nfrom. He is a fine man. We just disagree on this. He has legislation \ncalled the Women's Health Protection Act. He has legislation that will \nroll back State limitations on abortion that have been proved by the \nSupreme Court. He disagrees with what the States are doing in light of \nwhat the Supreme Court would allow a State to do. He has a piece of \nlegislation that would at the Federal level change all these State \nlaws. I respect his point of view. The point I am trying to make is \nthat he wouldn't have introduced the legislation if he didn't think \nthis was an important topic.\n  To my colleagues on the other side, you have legislation that I would \ngladly allow you to bring to the floor. I want to have a debate on what \nwe are trying to accomplish here. You have legislation that--I am sure \nthe reason you did it is you would like to change State laws you don't \nagree with. It is a little bit disingenuous to say we shouldn't be \ntalking about these topics because you drafted legislation on this \ntopic.\n  What am I trying to accomplish? We are one of seven nations in the \nentire world that allow abortion on demand at 20 weeks, the fifth month \nof pregnancy. I would like to get us out of that club. Why? Because at \n5 months I really don't believe it makes us a better nation to have \nabortion on demand. There are exceptions in this bill--for the life of \nthe mother and in the cases of rape, you have to tell the physician \nthis pregnancy was as a result of a rape--but there is no reporting \nrequirement to the police or anything else. That is a balance we have \ntried to achieve. But what I would suggest is that most Americans agree \nwith me, that most Americans believe that at the fifth month, we should \nnot have abortion-on-demand, we should not be in a club of seven \nnations on the entire planet that allow abortion at this stage in the \nbirthing process.\n  The theory of the case is pretty simple. Medical science has evolved \nto the point now that if you operate on a baby at 20 weeks--which you \ncan--to save that baby's life or to help them medically, medical \nscience says you have to provide anesthesia because the baby can feel \nexcruciating pain. We now know scientifically that at the fifth month \nof the birthing process, at 20 weeks, doctors will not operate on the \nbaby without anesthesia. Here is the question: Should we be allowing \nabortion-on-demand at that point in time? Should we be crushing the \nskulls? Should we be destroying the baby's life? Should we be one of \nseven countries that allow this heinous practice in the fifth month? We \ndo have exceptions--for life of the mother, rape, and incest.\n  I would suggest that we should be talking about this. I suggest that \nwe should have done this a long time ago, that we should have gotten \nout of this club of seven nations that allow a baby to be aborted in \nthe fifth month.\n  Medical encyclopedias advise and encourage young parents at this \nstage in the pregnancy to interact with the unborn baby and sing and \nspeak because the baby can associate sound. We are talking about 5 \nmonths, folks. We are talking about changing the law so that this \ncountry will not allow abortion-on-demand at this late stage in the \nbirthing process. This is something I am proud to be talking about. I \nam honored to lead the fight, and all I ask is that we have a vote.\n  The vote is whether or not to have a debate. Our Democratic friends \nare going to deny us a debate as to whether or not this is a good idea. \nWe can't even proceed to the bill. I am willing to allow them to bring \nup their legislation as an amendment to mine, the Women's Health \nProtection Act, where they want to repeal State laws that put limits on \nabortions consistent with the Supreme Court's decisions. I am not \nafraid of my idea, and they shouldn't be afraid of theirs.\n  This is a debate worthy of a free people. This is a debate worthy of \ndemocracy. If this is not worth talking about, what is? When do you \nbecome you? When do you have a soul, if you have one at all? What kind \nof Nation do we want to be in 2015?\n  Roe v. Wade says that for the first trimester, abortions are off \nlimits, but when medical viability is reached, the State has a \ncompelling interest in providing protection to the unborn child. That \nwas 1973. Has anything changed since 1973? I would argue a lot has \nchanged, and all for the better in terms of medical science. We can do \nthings now for patients, including for the unborn, that one could not \neven imagine in 1973. But the theory of the case here is not medical \nviability at 20 weeks, but a new concept that I hope most Americans \nwill embrace. Now that we know the baby has developed to the point \nwhere it would feel excruciating pain if it were operated on to save \nits life, is it appropriate for legislative bodies, such as ours, to \ncome to that\n\n[[Page S6838]]\n\nbaby's aid and take abortion-on-demand off the table?\n  Here is what I believe: I believe this is constitutionally sound. I \nbelieve this is a debate worthy of a free people. I believe the time \nhas come for America to get out of the club of seven that allows this \nprocedure at 20 weeks, the fifth month of the birthing process. I think \nthis is something we should talk about, and I think it is worthy of our \ntime.\n  To my friends on the other side, you have views about this topic too. \nYou have introduced legislation regarding abortion that would roll back \nState protections of the unborn. I am not afraid of that debate. I \ndisagree with you. Bring your legislation forward.\n  What are you afraid of? Why won't you let me debate my bill? Why \ncan't we have a discussion as a free people about where we want to be \nin 2015 regarding the unborn child?\n  To my friends on the other side, the unborn child is not the enemy. \nThe unborn child is something that every American should care about. \nAnd here is what I think: In the fifth month of pregnancy an \noverwhelming number of Americans--not all, but most--are going to side \nwith me and my colleagues who have helped me through this journey and \nsay: No, America will not allow this. We are not going to be one of \nseven nations that allows abortion-on-demand in the fifth month. We are \ngoing to withdraw from that club, and if we do, it will be a good \nthing. We will be a better people if we stop this practice in the fifth \nmonth, knowing that we have exceptions for the life of the mother in \ncases of rape and incest. This doesn't make us anything other than a \ncaring, better people.\n  This is why I ran for office, to have debates like this--not just \nthis, but like this. I want to talk about creating jobs and growing the \neconomy and stopping radical Islam. There is so much we need to do, but \nhere is the question: Do we need to do this? I think so. I think with \nall my heart and soul that America needs to get out of this club, that \nAmerica needs to come to the aid of a baby who is 20 weeks into the \nbirthing process, and we should stand united and stop this practice. I \nthink this makes us a better people.\n  I think at the end of the day, this debate is worthy of our time and, \nquite frankly, is long overdue. I am very disappointed that we can't \neven have the debate. But this I promise: As long as I am here--and \nmany others on our side, and hopefully some on that side over there--\nthis debate will continue until we get the right answer.\n  We came together in a very large vote--bipartisan in nature--to ban \nabortion in the last trimester, except in rare circumstances. That was \nthe right thing to do. Abortions in the seventh, eighth, and ninth \nmonth do not make us a better people. There was bipartisanship to stop \nthat procedure.\n  Here is what I believe: I believe over time the American people are \ngoing to side with me and my colleagues, we are going to rise to the \noccasion, and we are going to say something pretty basic. At 5 months \nwe are not going to allow abortion-on-demand because that baby can feel \nexcruciating pain, and we are not going to put that baby through the \nprocess of having their life terminated in such a gruesome fashion.\n  These Planned Parenthood videos and this discussion about harvesting \norgans from children late in the birthing process have awakened \nAmerica. I promise this is a debate worthy of this body, worthy of this \ncountry, and one that we are going to have over and over again until we \ncan get a vote. I am not going to stop. You have stopped me if we don't \nget those 60 votes to debate this. If we can't get the bill to the \nfloor for a debate, I think that is a bad thing.\n  I think life is more than just about money. I think the quality of \nour country is more than our financial situation. I think the quality \nof our Nation, in many ways, is founded not on our finances, but our \ncharacter. And here is what I believe: America needs to get out of this \nclub of seven that allows little babies to be aborted at a time when \ndoctors cannot operate on them without providing anesthesia because it \nhurts so much.\n  Think about what I just said. Medical science will not put the baby \nthrough an operation to save its life without anesthesia because it \nhurts so much. All I am asking is: Just don't crush that baby's skull \nunless there is a very good reason. Is that too much is ask? I don't \nthink so. Is that worthy of our time? I definitely believe so. Are we \ngoing to keep pushing? You better believe it.\n  I thank Senator Portman, Senator Ernst, and others who have helped me \nso much.\n  I thank Senator McConnell for reserving some time to have this \ndiscussion. I hope it turns into a debate. The Senate needs to be on \nrecord, and this is an opportunity for all of us to be on record as to \nwhere we think the country should be in 2015.\n  Here is what I think: I think in 2015 America needs to withdraw from \nthe club of seven nations that will allow a baby at 20 weeks to be \naborted for any reason at all.\n  I look forward to this discussion. I hope we can have a debate. I am \nnot afraid of my ideas, and they shouldn't be afraid of their ideas. \nBut I promise everybody who cares about this that we will not stop, and \nto me, it has always been about the baby. I think most Americans will \nside with me and my colleagues and say over time with a very strong and \nloud voice: We do not want abortion-on-demand in the fifth month of \npregnancy unless there is a darn good reason because that doesn't make \nus a better people. Quite frankly, it is the opposite.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for his support. To my colleagues over \nhere, and hopefully a few over there, I look forward to this journey \nuntil one day when we can withdraw from the club of seven and protect \nunborn children in a way that I think most Americans would appreciate.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. ERNST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. ERNST. Mr. President, a short while ago, I had the opportunity \nto meet with a very special family from Newton, IA. Micha Pickering, an \nadorable, energetic 3-year-old boy was born prematurely at just 22 \nweeks gestational age--the equivalent of 20 weeks after fertilization, \nthe method of measurement in the bill before us.\n  You will notice the picture I have in the Chamber. This is Micah, \nthat energetic 3-year-old boy. He was just in the office when this \npicture was in there, and Micah ran up and said: That's me. And then he \nsaid: That's a baby. This is Micah when he was born. We are talking \nabout 5 months. Think about that for a minute.\n\n  Micah's parents and the doctors and nurses at the University of Iowa \nhospitals and clinics were dedicated to his survival. Micah's mother \nDanielle has recounted the first time she got to meet her son in the \nhospital:\n\n       The second I was able to meet Micah changed my life. He was \n     so small. I didn't know what to expect. Would he look \n     `normal'? Could I bond with this baby? Those questions were a \n     mess in my head as I was wheeled into his room two hours \n     after his birth. The sight I saw was a perfectly formed baby.\n       We didn't understand at the time that Micah was right on \n     time, but now we do. . . . You can be knowledgeable on every \n     part of prematurity, but that does not change the fact that \n     Micah was just as much full of life at 22.4 weeks as he is \n     now at almost 3 years old.\n\n  I can attest that this little boy pictured behind me is indeed full \nof life.\n  The bill before us today--the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection \nAct--would protect up to 10,000 lives like Micah's every year by \npreventing abortions after 20 weeks or about 5 months of development. \nAs Micah proves, at 5 months babies can live.\n  The United States is currently only one of seven countries in the \nworld that allows abortions after 5 months. We are currently in the \nsame company as China and North Korea. We must do better.\n  Substantial medical evidence indicates that at about 5 months of \ndevelopment, unborn babies can feel pain. This means that thousands of \nunborn lives end painfully through abortion in our country every year. \nIs this really whom we want to be as a nation? We are a country that \nstands for life. Just earlier I heard a colleague across the\n\n[[Page S6839]]\n\naisle talking about how God intends that we should protect bumblebees \nand pteropods but what about human life. In order to rise to meet that \ncommitment, we must protect the most vulnerable in our society, \nparticularly those who cannot protect themselves.\n  The majority of men and women across this great Nation agree. \nAccording to a Quinnipiac poll from last November, 60 percent of those \nsurveyed support a law prohibiting abortion after 5 months of \npregnancy.\n  Although passionate advocates on both sides of this issue of life \noften disagree, there should be no disagreement when it comes to \nprotecting the life of an unborn child who has reached the point of \ndevelopment at which he or she can feel pain. As we can see from the \nphoto behind me, an unborn baby in its fifth month of development is \nnot just a clump of cells; he or she can suck his or her thumb, yawn, \nstretch, and make faces. They have 10 fingers and 10 toes. They can \nalso feel pain, and as Micah proves, they can survive outside of the \nwomb. As a mother and a grandmother, I urge my colleagues not to deny \nthese babies the right to life.\n  Micah's mom has said it best: ``I bet that if Micah could have gone \nup to everyone who opposes this bill and gave them a big hug, he could \nchange all their minds.''\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, in just 10 days, funding for the \ngovernment will expire. So we have just 10 days for the Senate and the \nHouse to come together and figure out a way to keep the government \ndoors open.\n  We have been here before. In 2013--and I remember all too well, as I \nam sure all of the Members of this Chamber do--the impact of that \nshutdown. It was devastating. It resulted in economic confidence \nfalling to its lowest level in several years. It took $24 billion out \nof our economy and cost us 120,000 private sector jobs. Yet at a time \nwhen we should be coming to the table to do our jobs to avoid a \ngovernment shutdown, we are back again talking about limiting women's \naccess to their own health care choices.\n  Once again, those who want to limit women's access to health care and \ntake away our constitutionally protected rights are threatening to \nwreak havoc across the entire U.S. economy, just as they did in 2013.\n  This attack on women is not just at the Federal level; sadly, we are \nseeing it in New Hampshire as well. The New Hampshire Executive Council \nrecently voted not to renew the State's contract with Planned \nParenthood. That vote was totally out of touch with the needs of women \nacross New Hampshire, and it puts women's health care at risk.\n  For many in New Hampshire, Planned Parenthood is the most affordable \nand accessible way to get the care they need, including basic \npreventive care such as family planning services--everything from \nbreast and cervical cancer screenings and immunizations to HIV testing.\n  Last year alone, Planned Parenthood served more than 12,000 women in \nNew Hampshire. Planned Parenthood is a trusted health care provider and \nan important part of our health care system. In some areas of New \nHampshire, Planned Parenthood is the only local provider for women to \nreceive affordable care.\n  On behalf of the millions of women who are served by Planned \nParenthood, I will continue to oppose any effort to defund women's \nhealth care services, but of course, as we know, this week the attack \non women's access to health care does not end with Planned Parenthood. \nTomorrow we will vote on a bill that would ban women's access to \nabortion after 20 weeks.\n  The choice to terminate a pregnancy is a difficult and very personal \ndecision. If that choice needs to be made later in a pregnancy, it is \noften the result of very complex circumstances--the kinds of situations \nwhere a woman and her doctor need every medical option available. This \nbill would place an added burden on women who are placed in that \ndifficult situation. Women who are survivors of rape and incest would \nhave that added burden. Furthermore, it threatens doctors, putting them \nat risk for harsh Federal criminal penalties.\n  Each woman, in consultation with her own family, her own health care \nproviders, and her own conscience, should be able to follow her own \nbeliefs when it comes to her own health care. We must protect women's \nreproductive constitutional rights, and I intend to continue to stand \nup for women as others here play politics with their health care.\n  Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle know they don't have \nthe votes to pass this legislation. They know they don't have the votes \nto pass other legislation related to women's health that would limit \nwomen's access to comprehensive health services. Yet on the eve of a \ngovernment shutdown, they are using precious floor time to bring these \nbills to a vote. This is shortsighted and, furthermore, I think it is \nirresponsible.\n  I remember the 2013 shutdown well. The impact on New Hampshire, on \nthis country, was significant. Small- and medium-sized businesses \nacross the State suffered from economic disruptions and financial \nlosses. Their government contracts were frozen or they were disrupted. \nTheir SBA loans were stalled. That shutdown, much like the one that is \nbeing threatened now, came at the peak of the fall tourism season. \nNational parks and forests were closed, including the White Mountain \nNational Forest in New Hampshire. The impacts on our tourism and \noutdoor recreational facilities were severe, not just in New Hampshire \nbut across the country. FHA and VA loans were put on hold. Thousands of \nFederal employees who live in New Hampshire were furloughed. To shut \ndown the Federal Government for any reason is reckless and \nirresponsible, but to do this, to contemplate doing this in order to \ndeny women access to health care services, is reprehensible.\n  I hope this week or any other week we will not tolerate it, and we \nwill move to the business of funding the government and addressing the \nchallenges we face and leave the personal decisions about personal \nhealth care choices to the women and families and health care providers \nwho should be making those decisions, not having the government make \nthat decision.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, a bill that protects \nchildren from late-term abortions. As cosponsor of this commonsense \nproposal, I am grateful the Senate will be taking a vote on this very \nimportant piece of legislation. Our constituents should know where we \nstand on this issue.\n  The American people support reasonable limits on dangerous late-term \nabortions. A November 2014 Quinnipiac poll shows that 60 percent of \nAmericans support legislation limiting abortions after 20 weeks. In \nline with this prevailing view, several States have already passed laws \nlimiting late-term abortions.\n  I note that Nebraska was actually the first State to pass language \nlike the Federal Pain-Capable Unborn Protection Act. I was a member of \nour legislature at the time, and I was proud to be a cosponsor of that \npiece of legislation that was offered by my good friend, former \nNebraska speaker Mike Flood. Speaker Flood's proposal passed in our \nunicameral legislature by a bipartisan vote of 44 to 5. We had pro-\nchoice Senators, both Republicans and Democrats, who supported it. We \nhad pro-life Senators, both Republicans and Democrats, who supported \nit. Nearly 90 percent of our legislature came together and supported \nthat bill. Why? Well, because it is a piece of reasonable legislation. \nAmericans recognize that and also recognize that opposition to this \nlegislation is extremism.\n\n[[Page S6840]]\n\n  This isn't a new idea. Eleven States already have protections against \nlate-term abortions that are similar to this bill. Science clearly \nindicates that at 20 weeks, these babies can feel pain.\n  On this issue, party affiliation should not matter. On this issue, \nwhether we declare we are pro-life or whether we say we are pro-choice \nshould not matter. These designations didn't matter in my State of \nNebraska. We looked at the facts. We came together from both sides of \nthe aisle and passed a sensible, compassionate bill. Let's do the same \nhere in the Senate.\n  We all agree that we must support women who find themselves with \nunplanned pregnancies. Too many women experience despair, pain, and \njudgment during an unplanned pregnancy. Rather than offering \ncondemnation, we should show kindness and understanding. We should \noffer assistance for these women, these expectant mothers who need to \nknow we will continue to support them in the challenging years ahead.\n  I recognize that abortion remains an emotionally charged issue here \nin this country, but I also recognize that people of good will can \ndisagree on the matter. I respect those opinions that are different \nfrom my own. But this legislation is not controversial, and it \nshouldn't divide us.\n  Before us today is a fundamental question of whether it is worth \nprotecting human life capable of feeling pain. For anyone who believes \notherwise, I would challenge them to explain when a life is worth \nprotecting if not when she feels pain? Nebraska affirmed this principle \n5 years ago. The rest of the Nation should do so as well.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I will be honest. I am deep-down furious \nat the Republican scheme to defund Planned Parenthood. I didn't think \nthe Republican leadership could sink any lower than trying to defund \nwomen's cancer screenings and access to birth control, but then I saw \nthe bill we are voting on tomorrow and I felt sick to my stomach. Here \nwe are just days away from another reckless Republican government \nshutdown, and the Republicans think the best use of our time is to vote \non a bill to give the government the power to intrude on the most \nwrenching, intimate, private medical decisions a woman will ever make.\n  The Republicans want a debate over a 20-week abortion ban, so let's \ntalk about exactly what that means. Nearly 99 percent of all abortions \ntake place within the first 21 weeks of a woman's pregnancy. Let me \nrepeat. Nearly 99 percent are in the first 21 weeks. So based on \nstatistics alone, this bill won't make a big difference in the number \nof abortions, but for the women who get hit, the consequences can be \ntruly horrific.\n  Let's start with the research. Who are these women? Who are the 1 \npercent who get an abortion after 20 weeks? Who? Women or girls who are \nthe victims of rape, incest, or domestic violence and were to \nfrightened to ask for help any sooner. Who? Women whose doctors have \ntold them that if they don't end their pregnancy--pregnancies they \nreally wanted--their kidneys could fail or their hearts could give out \nor they couldn't get the chemotherapy they may need to save their \nlives. Who? Women who go for an ultrasound and get the worst possible \nnews--that their fetus has a giant hole in its stomach or organs \noutside its body or a deformed head and the fetus either has no chance \nof survival or has a severe abnormality that would mean a short life \nfilled with pain. Research also shows that women who have had later \nabortions are more likely to be young--very young girls, really--and \ndidn't understand they were pregnant. They are more likely to live in \nplaces where getting an abortion means driving 3 hours or more to find \na doctor who will perform one. They are more likely to be poor and need \nto save up money to pay for the procedure. That is who gets hit by \nthis.\n\n  I have taken a close look at the Republican bill to see just how hard \nthey get hit. I want to put it right out here in the open for everyone \nto see.\n  There are no--I repeat--no exceptions in this bill for the condition \nof the fetus. Even if a woman knows at 20 weeks that her child will die \nimmediately after birth, she would still be required to carry that \npregnancy for months.\n  An 18-year-old survivor of rape or incest must wait until she can \nprovide written proof that she received counseling from a doctor, and \nthen that counseling is loaded with hurdles: The counseling must come \nonly from a doctor who refuses to perform abortions and who doesn't \nwork in an office with another doctor who does. Think about it. Prolong \nthe pain and anxiety, and for anyone who lives in a rural area or \nanyone who is making it barely paycheck to paycheck and cannot miss \nmultiple days of work, make it twice as hard to get any help.\n  If the victim of rape or incest is a minor, it gets even worse. A \ngirl--a girl who is 10, 12, 14 years old--this girl must face the same \nchallenges and must provide written proof that she reported the crime \nto the police, even if turning in a family member or announcing to the \nworld that she has been raped could destroy her life in a million \ndifferent ways. I cannot imagine that the Senate would pass a law to \nrequire a frightened 12-year-old girl to submit written proof that she \nhad called the police to report a rape by her mother's boyfriend before \nshe could terminate that pregnancy. That kind of cruelty is barbaric, \nand it has no place in our laws.\n  But this is not just about the tiny number of people who must seek \nabortions after 20 weeks; this horrifying bill that we will vote on \ntomorrow is just one more piece of a deliberate, methodical, \norchestrated rightwing plan to attack women's health and reproductive \nrights. A funding cut here, a new restriction here, month after month, \nyear after year, and Rowe v. Wade will be chipped away to nothing. That \nis what this is all about. That is what this has always been all about.\n  We have lived in an America where women died in back-alley abortions. \nWe have lived in an America where high school girls tried poisons and \ncoat hangers to try to end pregnancies. We have lived in an America \nwhere young woman who faced unwanted pregnancies took their own lives. \nWe have lived in that America, and we are not going back--not now, not \never.\n  We stand here on the brink of another reckless Republican government \nshutdown. We all remember what happened the last time the Republicans \nshut the government down: $24 billion was flushed down the drain for a \npolitical stunt--$24 billion that could have gone to help mothers and \ntheir babies with prenatal care, better infant nutrition, Head Start \nclasses, medical research on birth abnormalities. Instead, the money \nwas flushed away by Republicans who want to play political games more \nthan they want to help children and families all across this country.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on this terrible bill. Stand up to \nthis rightwing assault on women and families. Instead of trying to do \nthe job of physicians and telling women what is best for their own \nmedical care, Republicans in the Senate should start doing the job of \nlegislators and get to work on this Nation's budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, the image I am putting up right now beside \nme is the cover of Time magazine from June 2014, the first issue in \nJune, June 2, 2014. According to the corresponding feature story, the \nbaby on this cover, Emalyn Aubrey Randolph, was born prematurely at 29 \nweeks into the pregnancy. She weighed 2 pounds and 10 ounces. The \nlegislation we are actually talking about today, unlike the legislation \nI just heard described--which we may very well talk about later--the \nlegislation which we are talking about today and which we will vote on \ntomorrow takes us back only a few weeks before this cover-story baby \nwas born at 29 weeks.\n  We know of lots of cases after 20 weeks--where we have seen babies \nsurvive an early birth.\n\n[[Page S6841]]\n\n  In 2010, Freida Mangold was born at 21 weeks and 5 days into her \nmother's pregnancy. Both had complications. The baby was born, and \nafter intensive care she was able to go home. In Florida in 2006, \nAmillia Taylor was delivered by an emergency C-section when she was 21 \nweeks and 6 days into that pregnancy. She received medical care and \nsurvived.\n  In Iowa in 2012, Micah Pickering was born prematurely at 22 weeks and \n1 day. Micah and her family are actually here visiting with the Senate \ntomorrow. Micah just turned 3 this past July. She will be meeting with \nMembers of the Senate to talk about and to be the example that her \nparents will be talking about of what happened to a baby who was born \n22 weeks and 1 day into the pregnancy.\n  In my State of Missouri, we know of a remarkable story where the \nCowan family in Kansas City welcomed their twin sons into the world 39 \ndays apart. Little Carl was so small that his mother Elene could put \nher wedding ring over his wrist when he was born at 24-weeks and 1 day. \nHe weighed barely a pound--twins are often small anyway; he was a \ntwin--at that point in the pregnancy. Thirty-nine days later, his twin \nbrother David came into the world. Carl is busy catching up with David \nin his size as things go on.\n  In St. Louis, Andrew Konopka was born at 23 weeks. Andrew weighed a \npound and a half. He was born at Mercy Hospital there. Today he is 8 \nyears old and is doing well. His family lives in Webster Groves.\n  Also in St. Louis last year, Zeke Miller was born at 27 weeks on \nDecember 10, 2014. He weighed 2 pounds and 15 ounces. Zeke was in the \nhospital 111 days. He is now 9 months old. Just last week his parents \nwere excited to hear that Zeke no longer needs to be on oxygen. He has \npassed another milestone.\n  Across the State line in Overland Park, KS, at the Overland Park \nMedical Center, babies born as early as 23 weeks of pregnancy are \nreceiving care in the neonatal intensive care unit. Their neonatal unit \nhas been featured for its emphasis on what it calls ``kangaroo care'' \nbecause in ``kangaroo care'' the baby's parents come and have that \nskin-to-skin, parent-to-baby contact so that the baby knows for sure \nthere is somebody out there ready to take care of it.\n  I recognize there is no national consensus on the issue we are \ntalking about or even the issue of the early months of pregnancy. \nHowever, the overwhelming majority of Americans know that at this \nstage--20 weeks--they are not talking about a clump of cells; they are \ntalking about a baby. The baby has 10 fingers and 10 toes. It has \nunique fingerprints that nobody has ever had and nobody will ever have \nagain. It has a beating heart. Thanks to advanced ultrasound \ntechnology, this is about the time when people find out whether they \nare the parents of a little boy or the parents of a little girl.\n  The fact that the baby at 20 weeks is a baby is obvious to the larger \nculture. In fact, this cover story in Time magazine--no advocate, as a \nrule, for outlandishly conservative social structure--Time magazine \ntells stories of young babies fighting for their lives and doctors who \nare fighting to save them.\n  Let me quote from the article. It says, ``. . . fragile babies being \nlooked after by a round the clock SWAT team of nutritionists, \npharmacologists, gastroenterologists, ophthalmologists, pulmonary \nspecialists, surgeons. . . . ''\n  It concludes: In some ways, the work of the NICU will always seem \nlike an exercise in disproportion--an army of people and a mountain of \ninfrastructure caring for a pound of life. But it is a disproportion \nthat speaks very well of us.\n  That is not me saying that is a disproportion that speaks very well \nof us; it is Time magazine. The value that our society places on little \n1- and 2-pound premature babies in the neonatal intensive care unit is \nremarkable. It speaks well for us, according to Time.\n  So many of us have experienced now or have friends--in fact, my guess \nwould be that as Members of the Senate go do hospital visits, nothing \nis more riveting than that moment you sometimes get to spend in the \nneonatal unit with a baby who is so little that you don't know how it \nsurvived, but it has, and you know with the technology we have today, \nthat baby is very likely to go home.\n  When everyone in your family is healthy, you have a lot of problems. \nWhen someone in your family is sick, you have one problem, and the one \nthing that is the focus in the case of these families and these babies \nis what they are about to do right then, which is everything they can \ndo to save a life that has all it takes to survive, but it just needs \nsome help.\n  So while the culture is embracing the value of these lives--these \nlittle lives who can survive--on the one hand, our laws really don't \nreflect that science has made that almost an indisputable argument. We \nknow that babies born 20 weeks after conception can survive. Down the \nroad in Maryland, a doctor says he will end a human life at 28 weeks--\nthat is about 7 months--into a pregnancy. Several States and the \nDistrict of Columbia allow life to be ended with an abortion in the \nninth month of pregnancy. Can anyone on either side of this debate \ndefend that? If they can't, really you should favor this fairly easy-\nto-achieve view of this issue.\n  There are only seven countries in the world, including ours, that \nallow this to happen, these lives to be ended after 20 weeks. These \nbabies can feel pain, as I just talked about. They have or are very \nquickly going to have the ability to survive with some help.\n  By the way, the seven countries include China, North Korea, Vietnam, \nand the United States of America--not a list I think we want to be on.\n  Shortly my colleagues and I will be able to cast a vote on the Pain-\nCapable Unborn Child Protection Act.\n  I would like to close by saying a baby is a baby, and science tells \nus they can feel pain. This bill is a commonsense idea. It is broadly \nsupported. I hope the Senate will take a step to protect these lives.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in opposition to my \nRepublican colleagues who are once again bringing forward a political \nattack on the freedom of American women to make their own personal \nhealth care decisions. Instead of focusing on improving access to \nhealth care for women, Republicans are pursuing a divisive policy that \njeopardizes women's health and puts politicians and the government \nbetween a woman and her doctor. Instead of spending our time on \nbipartisan budget negotiations, Republicans are wasting what is \nprecious time on another failed attempt to strip funding for critical \nwomen's health programs, denying women the health services they need.\n\n  They have scheduled yet another show vote. They know it is destined \nto fail, and many believe it is just to pander to extreme allies by \ntaking away women's constitutionally protected health care choices. I \nhave to say I object to this dangerous political game. Women's access \nto quality health care isn't a political game. It is not one for me and \nmany of my other colleagues who join me on the floor today, nor is it a \ngame for women and their families across the country and in my home \nState of Wisconsin.\n  Too many States have enacted what are record numbers of laws--over \n230 of them in the past 4 years--that restrict a women's access to \nreproductive health services and the freedom and right to make her own \nhealth care decisions.\n  The bill before us today would impose a 20-week abortion ban \nnationwide and would have real and grave consequences for American \nfamilies.\n  Last year I heard from a woman from Middleton, WI, who at 20 weeks \nwas devastated to find out that her baby had a severe fetal anomaly and \nthat there would be no chance of surviving delivery. She had to undergo \nan emergency termination, and a clinic in Milwaukee was the only place \nin Wisconsin that would do the procedure, but because at the time our \nRepublican Governor was set to sign into law a new measure imposing \nunreasonable requirements on providers, this particular clinic was \npreparing to close its doors and would not schedule her procedure. She \nand her husband were forced to find childcare for their two sons and \ntravel to another State to get the medical care she needed.\n  Since hearing this mother's story, Wisconsin's Republican lawmakers \nhave attempted to enact even more restrictions, including a bill \nrecently\n\n[[Page S6842]]\n\npassed in the Wisconsin State Senate to ban abortions after 20 weeks \nwith no exceptions for rape or incest. In addition, this bill's medical \nemergency exception is similar to what is included in Senator Graham's \nFederal proposal. It says nothing about the health of the mother.\n  The threat in Wisconsin and States across the country is clear. When \nCongressmen and politicians play doctor, American families suffer. This \nis why my good friend and colleague from Connecticut Senator Blumenthal \nand I have introduced a serious proposal, the Women's Health Protection \nAct. This proposal would put a stop to these sorts of legislative \nattacks on women's rights and freedoms. Our bill creates Federal \nprotections against restrictions such as the proposal before us that \nunduly limit access to reproductive health care and do nothing to \nfurther women's health or safety and certainly intrude upon personal \ndecisionmaking. It is time that we place our trust back in women to \ncarefully consider their options and make their own health decisions, \nand I look forward to working with my colleagues to advance this \nimportant legislation.\n  We know that this week's Republican spectacle is not meant to produce \na serious debate about protecting women's reproductive health; it is \nabout the narrow Republican agenda to take our country backward and \nroll back the important health benefits for American families. We have \nseen this with the numerous failed attempts by Republicans to repeal \nthe protections in the Affordable Care Act, protections that have \nempowered millions of women with more choices and stronger health care \ncoverage. Today women can finally rest assured that they will not be \ncharged more for coverage just because they are women, and someone's \nmother can get a lifesaving mammogram without the fear of high medical \nbills.\n  Over 75 times, congressional Republicans have tried to roll back this \nmeasure, which provides health security and economic security for \nmillions of American families. It seems that Republicans would gladly \ngo back to the days where being a woman was a preexisting condition and \nwhen insurance companies could drop your coverage just because you got \nsick or older or had a baby.\n  We are not going to go back to those days, just as we are not going \nto create a future where politicians in Washington take away from \nfreedom and the right of women to make their own personal health \ndecisions. I am committing to putting a stop to the relentless and \nideological attacks on American families and will continue to fight to \nensure that both men and women have the freedom to access the health \ncare they need.\n  The American people do not want Congress playing doctor, and they are \nsick and tired of Republicans manufacturing crisis after crisis. Just 2 \nyears after they shut down the government because of a partisan battle \nwith the President over the Affordable Care Act, they are again \nthreatening to shut down the government over another partisan attack on \nfunding for women's health care. These political games could come at a \nserious cost to America's economic strength and the well-being of \nworking families.\n  It is time for Republicans to stop playing dangerous games with \nwomen's health. It is time for Republicans to stop manufacturing crisis \nafter crisis. It is time for Republicans to join Democrats and work in \na bipartisan manner to keep the government open and negotiate a budget \nagreement that ends sequestration and invests in economic growth, \ninvests in our middle class, invests in our national security, and \ninvests in women's health.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, this week Pope Francis will be making a \nhistoric visit to Washington, DC, to address those of us in Congress \nand millions of Americans across the United States.\n  While I am not a Catholic, one of the tenets of the Catholic Church \nthat I have long respected is adherence and devotion to the sanctity of \nlife. We have an issue before us regarding the very essence of what \nlife is and how life is treated in this country. So my colleagues who \ndon't agree with the legislation before us and who don't even want us \nto have a debate on this are trying to, through a procedural motion, \nstop us from moving forward to discuss an issue that ought to be \ndebated before the American people and certainly before this body.\n  It is no secret now that the science has proven that pain can be \nexperienced by an unborn child in the womb. And the taking of that \nlife--many of us believe that life begins at conception, but even if \nyou don't adhere to that, it is now a fact, a pure fact, that it is a \nviable life at the age of 20 weeks and that life can experience pain. \nSurgery can be provided for that life. Anesthesia is given to that \nunborn child in the womb to prevent it from experiencing the pain that \nmay result from surgery that is trying to correct perhaps an \nabnormality or some condition in the womb and give that child an \nopportunity to be a healthier baby and to live out the privilege of \nliving.\n  I have spoken a number of times on this floor about the sanctity of \nlife and how we as elected representatives and the American people--\npeople of conscience and conviction--need to protect the sanctity of \nlife. In doing so, it means that we have to discuss the issue of \nabortion. This is not a pleasant or comfortable issue to debate on the \nSenate floor, but we are not elected to come here to just discuss and \ndebate pleasant issues; we are here to face difficult and often \nemotional issues, to face it honestly, to face it openly, and to cast \nour votes either for or against.\n  There are few, if any, issues that I believe are potentially more \ndivisive and emotional than the issue of abortion because it goes to \nthe heart of the meaning of life itself. It is about protecting those \nwho cannot protect themselves. The story of America is a history of \ninclusion and an impulse to protect and uplift those who have been on \nthe margins of society, and no human being is more on the margin of \nsociety than an unborn child who is seen not as a human life but is \nseen as something that can be dissected, can be torn apart, can be \nharvested, and the organs can be sold for research.\n  That is not the issue we will be debating in this vote coming up, but \nit has been debated and it has been raised--I have been on the floor \nlistening to a number of these speeches that raised it a number of \ntimes--that somehow Republicans are denying women health care coverage \nbecause we are not wanting to fund an organization, Planned Parenthood, \nthat uses some of the most brutal and inhumane efforts to harvest from \nunborn children organs to sale for the use of research. We had that \ndebate and we had that vote. Unfortunately, we came up short on that \nvote. That, in and of itself, is an issue that we must continue to \ndebate and continue to deal with, but the issue before us now is the \nability to debate, discuss, vote, and hopefully pass legislation that \nis based on science--not on theory, not on ideology but based on \nscience.\n  We now know that a child growing in the womb of its mother at the age \nof 20 weeks can experience pain, and we also now know that under the \nprocedures that are used by Planned Parenthood, those children are \nharvested--they are dissected, harvested, some of their organs are \ncarefully preserved and sold. It is almost beyond comprehension that a \nnation that has reached out to be inclusive to the most vulnerable, \nthat at this point in life for a child views it as nothing more than \nsomething to be harvested. The descriptions of how Planned Parenthood \ndescribes the cold, calculating, numerical profit that might occur from \nthe sale of certain organs and the techniques used to go into the womb \nto make sure that certain organs are preserved while others are \ncrushed, just goes beyond comprehension.\n  Yet to stand on the floor and simply say Republicans are taking away \nwomen's health--no, we aren't. We are simply saying we don't want the \ntaxpayers to fund an organization that practices these methods, that \ntakes the lives of children, and that ignores the pain that is incurred \nin doing so. We want to transfer that money to women's health \norganizations--about five times as many in my State as there are \nPlanned Parenthood organizations--that will provide for every aspect of \nwomen's health care except for abortion. The question before us on that \nvote was: Should the taxpayer fund something of this nature? And, \nunfortunately, we came up short because our colleagues simply would not \nsupport us in the effort to do so.\n\n[[Page S6843]]\n\n  This goes to the soul of the Nation. This goes to who we are. This \ngoes to a country which has been compassionate and reached out to those \non the margin but now turns its back on those who are the most \nvulnerable. It is not just a matter of politics. It is not, as has been \nsaid on the floor, that Republicans want to roll back important health \ncare coverage for mothers, deny women's health and access to health \ncare. It is not a manufactured crisis, a dangerous game we are playing. \nHow can you describe as a dangerous game the provision before us on the \nSenate floor that addresses the issue of the excruciating pain a child \nfeels, which we now know is scientifically documented and proved in the \ntaking of that life, for the harvesting of that life's organs? How can \nyou describe that as a dangerous game?\n  If we treat this with such total irrelevance, in terms of what is \nhappening here, it says something about our country. I deeply regret \nour colleagues on the other side of the aisle are even denying us the \nopportunity to go forward. We are on a procedural motion here where \nthey can kill the debate. They can prevent us from doing what the \nAmerican people have sent us here to do--to deal with tough issues, \nstate our positions, and let our yes be yes and our no be no. Once \nagain, we are in a situation now where even that procedure to get to \nthat point is being denied. I regret we are here.\n  I have noticed the discussions on the floor have been quite somber. \nThe statements made are made softly. That doesn't mask the kind of \nemotion and the kind of passion that many of us feel. What it shows is \ngrief. What it shows is the grief over a practice conducted in this \nadvanced Nation of ours. It is a grief over the fact we are taking \nhundreds of thousands and have taken millions of lives of unborn \nchildren. It shows a special emotion and a special grief over the fact \nthat we know those children are experiencing the pain of \ndismemberment--of arms and legs being ripped apart, of organs being \nharvested for sale.\n  So without the shouting, without the accusations, it is a sincere \nbelief and grief over what is happening in this country. As has been \nstated by my colleagues, only seven other countries in the world allow \nthis kind of practice. It is shameful that one of those countries is \nthe United States of America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, I am going to make a \nreference to a 20-week sonogram. I will introduce, however, Donelle \nHarden. I am a little bit biased, but I think she is the best \ncommunication director in the U.S. Senate, and you can see she is 31 \nweeks pregnant. At the conclusion of my remarks, I want to demonstrate \nclearly what a 20-week sonogram looks like and what a baby does look \nlike.\n  By 20 weeks, a woman has reached the halfway point of the pregnancy \nand has the opportunity to learn the gender of her child. By 20 weeks, \nthere is conclusive scientific evidence that a baby can feel pain, they \ncan hear sounds, and they can react to sounds. They twist, they kick, \nthey yawn, and they stretch, and some even open their eyes and suck \ntheir thumbs. But most importantly, they feel pain.\n  The United States is just one of seven countries with populations of \nmore than a million that allows abortions past 20 weeks. Other \ncountries who join ours in this practice are countries like China and \nNorth Korea and Vietnam.\n  The abortion procedure after 20 weeks is known as late-term \nabortions. We have been talking about this on the floor, and I think \npeople are pretty familiar with it--much more so now than they were \njust a short while ago. It is very unpleasant and very shocking. During \nthe procedure the baby is rotated and the forceps are used to pull the \nbaby's legs, arms, and shoulders through the birth canal. Once this is \ndone--because the head is too large--an incision is made at the base of \nthe baby's skull to allow a suction catheter to be inserted to remove \nthe cerebral material--that is the brains--collapsing the skull and \nallowing the baby to be completely removed.\n  Now, I lay this out for you because people need to know what inhumane \npractices are taking place in America. When you start to devalue the \nlife of a child just because it hasn't been born yet, you start \ndevaluing life in general, situations like what happened in \nPhiladelphia are allowed to occur.\n  As I am sure the occupier of the Chair remembers very well, in May of \n2013, Kermit Gosnell was convicted of three first-degree murder charges \nfor killing babies who had been born alive at his abortion clinic in \nPhiladelphia. Testimony from the trial indicated he and his staff \nsnipped the necks of more than 100 infants who survived abortion \nattempts. Viable babies were delivered and then murdered. Furthermore, \nGosnell endangered the health and lives of the women who came to his \nclinic by reusing disposable medical equipment, performing procedures \nin unsanitary conditions with unsanitary instruments, overdosing them, \nand causing serious injuries to their bodies. On at least two occasions \nwomen died after visiting his clinic. Talk about a war on women, this \nguy is on the front lines.\n  The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania turned its back on these women when \nit never once inspected the clinic in 17 years, despite receiving \ncomplaints against Gosnell and being notified that a woman died in the \nclinic. Pennsylvania Department of State wouldn't investigate the \ncomplaints they received. These kinds of things can happen when human \nlife is considered disposable.\n  This year, we have seen 10 videos released by the Center for Medical \nProgress, showing Planned Parenthood executives and employees across \nthe country detailing the sale of baby parts and how they manipulated \nand delayed the abortions. What we are saying is they delayed an \nabortion from taking place so the baby could mature and the parts they \nwere using as their specimens would be of greater value to the \ncustomers they were selling the baby parts to. The heartless way they \ntalked about these things and the complete disregard for the life of \nthe baby that is being dissected are shocking and sickening.\n  It is no wonder over the past decade Americans have been waking up to \nthe scientific facts and the moral implications regarding abortions. \nThere was a Gallup poll in 2010 that called pro-life the ``new normal'' \nfor Americans. But 3 years later, in 2013, the Gallup poll showed that \n64 percent of Americans--that is 2 to 1, a majority of Americans by 2 \nto 1, which is a very strong majority--supported banning abortions \nafter the first trimester. That is just one of many polls showing this \ntrend to favor life. In the first trimester you are only talking about \n12 weeks at that point.\n  What is really interesting about these polls is that in each of them \nwomen always support these bans at a higher rate than men. As I have \nlearned from my wife and two daughters, only women can really \nunderstand what is at stake.\n  I had the opportunity to experience firsthand and be there at the \ntime of the birth of my four children and my 12 grandchildren. Life is \ntruly a miracle. It is not just the life of a child but also that of \nthe mother. Thanks to the progress of science it is more evident than \never that abortion ends life. Medical data is now also showing \nsignificant risks to women's health and well-being.\n  Now, what I am going to show--what Donelle is going to show--is the \nbaby she is carrying right now. That sonogram was taken at 20 weeks. At \n20 weeks you can see all the details of the baby, and I would like to \nhave Donelle point out the ear of the baby the sonogram shows. It is \nvery, very clear--the kidney, the heart, the spine, the teeth, the \nlips, and the brain. Now, that was 20 weeks.\n  What we have here in the United States is an opportunity for those in \nfavor of abortion to go far longer than just the 20 weeks. They can go \nall the way up to, in America, the time of birth. All they have to do \nis show the health of the mother is at risk and this can be done. The \nPain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act would ban these abortions and \nprotect these babies.\n  We have 46 Senators signed to the bill. The House has passed its own \nversion, and I think we have the opportunity to take a major step \nforward. That is what this is all about. I have hope. I have run into \nso many people who have not had the opportunity to get some of the \ngraphic details of what Planned Parenthood has been doing in murdering \nthese babies and selling their parts, but I hope this is an \nopportunity.\n\n[[Page S6844]]\n\n  We are going to have a vote so that we will have an opportunity to do \nthis, and I am very hopeful some of these Senators who have not \nacknowledged this is going on, that they will do so. This is what it is \nall about. This is what the baby is, and this is what we have the \nopportunity to reform in our system.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, this week the Senate is considering the \nPain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. This legislation would \nprotect unborn children who have reached the age of 20 weeks--that is 5 \nmonths of pregnancy--from being killed by abortion.\n  Five months into a pregnancy, babies are sucking their thumbs, they \nare yawning and stretching, they are actively moving around, they \nrespond to noises, and they feel and respond to pain.\n  The scientific evidence on this point is incontrovertible. Five \nmonths into a pregnancy, unborn babies feel pain. Their stress hormones \nspike, and they shrink from painful stimuli. In fact, some scientific \nevidence suggests that babies of this age feel pain more keenly than \nadults since some of the neural mechanisms that inhibit pain don't \nfully develop until after birth.\n  Babies are regularly born weeks or months early in this country and \nwith medical care survive and often thrive.\n  A Time magazine article from May 2014 that highlighted the tremendous \nadvances that have been made in the treatment of premature babies noted \nthat 76 percent of babies born at 25 weeks of pregnancy--or about 6 \nmonths--will go on to leave the hospital.\n  A May 2015 article of the New York Times entitled ``Premature Babies \nMay Survive at 22 Weeks if Treated, Study Finds'' highlighted a recent \nstudy published in the New England Journal of Medicine reporting on \nsuccesses in treating extremely early premature births. One baby \nmentioned in the New York Times article, Alexis Hutchinson, was \ndelivered at 22 weeks and 1 day. She weighed 1.1 pounds at delivery. \nToday, the Times reports, ``aside from being more vulnerable to \nrespiratory viruses, Alexis is a healthy 5-year-old girl.'' Let me \nrepeat that. Alexis Hutchinson, who was born at 22 weeks and 1 day--or \napproximately halfway through her mother's pregnancy--is today a \nhealthy 5-year-old girl. Yet, under the laws of this country, a baby of \nthe very same age can be killed by abortion.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that more \nthan 15,000 late-term abortions are performed each year in the United \nStates. Many of those babies could have survived if instead of being \naborted they had been born in a hospital and given medical care.\n  Late-term abortion procedures are so brutal, it is difficult to even \ntalk about them. Americans would rightly shrink in horror from \nperforming one of these procedures on an animal. How, then, are we \nallowing these procedures to be performed on our children?\n  Right now only seven countries in the world allow elective abortion \nafter 5 months of pregnancy. It is hard to believe the United States is \none of them. Among those countries are China and North Korea. \nUnfortunately, our country is on that list. I suggest that might not be \nthe company we want to keep when it comes to protecting human life.\n  A society is measured by how it treats its weakest and most \nvulnerable members, and we have been failing some of ours. But we have \na chance with this legislation to start fixing that today.\n  Ultimately, it is very simple: That unborn baby--the one with the \nfingers and toes, who sucks her thumb and responds to her mother's \nvoice--that unborn baby is one of us, and as such she deserves to be \nprotected. I hope the United States Senate will vote in support of \nprotecting our unborn and vote in favor of this legislation when we \nhave that opportunity tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Pope's visit this week to our \nNation's Capital reminds us all of how very important it is to show \ncompassion and concern for the most innocent and vulnerable among us. \nUnborn children who fall into this category are entitled to the same \ndignity all human beings share. This is true even when their presence \nmight be uncomfortable or create difficulties, the Pope reminds us.\n  We are now considering moving to a bill known as the Pain-Capable \nUnborn Child Protection Act. This legislation would make no change to \nour abortion policy in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. At 20 weeks of \nfetal age, when the unborn child can detect and respond to painful \nstimuli, the bill would impose some restrictions on elective late-term \nabortions. Such a change to existing law would put us in line with the \nvast majority of other countries around the globe.\n  I want to emphasize that the United States is in the small minority \nof countries around the world that allow abortion on demand after the \nfifth month of pregnancy. As some of my colleagues have mentioned \nearlier, we are just one of seven countries that take this unusual \nposition. China, North Korea, and Vietnam are among the other seven. \nAre these countries really the ones we in the United States want to \nalign ourselves with on this particular human rights issue?\n  Many of us in this Chamber actively supported the Americans with \nDisability Act. Could anyone here support an abortion after 5 months \nbecause the unborn baby had a cleft lip? What about a late-term \nabortion of a baby with hemophilia? Under current law, it is quite \npossible to destroy unborn babies with these or other more serious \nabnormalities in utero. I believe these babies' lives have the same \nvalue as those of other unborn babies without disabilities.\n  There are some who say they cannot support this legislation. I say to \nthem, if you do not support restrictions on abortion after the fifth \nmonth of pregnancy, when some babies born prematurely at this stage now \nare surviving long-term, then what exactly is your limit on abortion?\n  Scientists say the unborn child can feel pain perhaps even as early \nas 8 weeks and most certainly by 20 weeks' fetal age. The American \npeople overwhelmingly support restrictions on late-term abortions.\n  Doctors tell us that about a quarter of the babies born prematurely, \naround 5 months, will survive long term if given proper medical \nassistance.\n  Dr. Colleen Malloy, an assistant professor of pediatrics at \nNorthwestern's School of Medicine, testified before a congressional \npanel just 3 years ago that infants born at 20 weeks' fetal age now are \n``kicking, moving, reacting, and developing right before our eyes in \nthe Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.'' She explained that treatment of \nneonatal pain is standard in such cases and added that there is no \nreason to believe an infant born prematurely would feel pain any \ndifferently from the same infant if still in the womb.\n  We also have the statements from Dr. Anthony Levatino, a practicing \ngynecologist with decades of experience. Dr. Levatino estimates that he \nperformed over 1,000 abortions in private practice, until his adopted \ndaughter died in a car crash. The death of his child was a life-\nchanging event that ultimately led him to stop performing abortions. \nDr. Levatino testified before the House Judiciary Committee--again, 3 \nyears ago--that performing an abortion on a 24-week-old child is \npainful for that unborn baby. In the words of Dr. Levatino, ``If you \nrefuse to believe that this procedure inflicts severe pain on an unborn \nchild, please think again.''\n  Scientific studies confirm what Dr. Levatino has noted--that the \nunborn can experience pain after the fifth month. In fact, at least one \nmedical school professor says it is indisputable that unborn babies can \nreact to painful stimuli as early as 8 weeks after conception.\n  Dr. Maureen Condic, a neurobiology professor who earned her Ph.D. at \nBerkeley, explains that the unborn child at this stage of development \nreacts to painful stimuli just as other human beings do at later \nstages. In\n\n[[Page S6845]]\n\nboth the case of the unborn child and human beings at later stages of \ndevelopment, the response is the same: to actively withdraw from the \npainful stimulus.\n\n  As stated in a paper written by Dr. Condic:\n\n       The scientific evidence that the human fetus can detect and \n     react to painful stimuli as early as 8 weeks . . . is \n     indisputable. The neural circuitry responsible for the most \n     primitive response to pain, the spinal reflex, is in place by \n     eight weeks. . . . Connections between the spinal cord and \n     the thalamus, the region of the brain that is largely \n     responsible for pain perception in both the fetus and the \n     adult, begin to form around 12 weeks, and are completed by 18 \n     weeks.\n\n  Babies delivered prematurely also show pain-related behaviors, \naccording to Dr. Condic. Also, the earlier infants are delivered, the \nstronger their response to pain is, she reports. It is perhaps for this \nreason that many doctors use anesthesia when operating on late-term \nbabies in utero. Research suggests that these babies do better and \nrecover faster when anesthesia is used during utero surgery.\n  Many expectant mothers today are encouraged to talk to their babies \nin utero or play soft music for the babies' benefit. Unborn babies can \nhear as early as the fifth month and find their mom's voice soothing, \nnew research suggests. Babies even learn while in the womb, absorbing \nlanguage earlier than previously suspected, according to another \nreport. Regardless of whether you characterize yourself as pro-choice \nor pro-life, common sense tells us that if such techniques work to \nsoothe the unformed baby, then the reverse likely is true as well. Late \nin pregnancy, unborn babies aren't impervious to dismemberment with \nsteel tools in utero.\n  Some say abortion saves and helps women. Remember that 5 years ago a \nwoman walked into a Pennsylvania abortion clinic expecting that she \nwould have her pregnancy terminated and would walk out of that clinic \nwithout major side effects. She was 41 years old and 19 weeks pregnant. \nShe had three children and was a grandmother. She and her daughter \nentered the clinic, but she never made it out alive. Her name was \nKarnamaya Mongar. She was one of the many victims of Kermit Gosnell. He \noperated a clinic in West Philadelphia for four decades. He made a \nliving by performing abortions that no other doctor should ever do. The \ngrand jury report that framed the case around Kermit Gosnell stated: \n``Gosnell's approach was simple: keep volume high, expenses low--and \nbreak the law. That was his competitive edge.''\n  According to the grand jury report:\n\n       The bigger the baby, the bigger the charge. Ultrasounds \n     were forged so that the Government would never know how old \n     aborted babies truly were. Babies were born alive, killed \n     after breathing on their own, by sticking scissors into the \n     back of the baby's neck and cutting the spinal cord. These \n     were live, breathing, squirming babies.\n\n  This doctor didn't care about the well-being of these aborted babies. \nHe didn't care about the health of the women.\n  Extremely experienced doctors like Dr. Levatino, whom I mentioned \nearlier, also tell us that abortion is ``seldom if ever a useful \nintervention'' when life-threatening conditions require immediate care \nlate in pregnancy. In most of these late second and third trimester \ncases, any attempt to perform an abortion ``would entail undue and \ndangerous delay in providing appropriate, truly life-saving care.'' The \nnumber of babies whose lives Dr. Levatino had to terminate in such \ncases was zero, he testified.\n  The bill we are talking about that we are going to vote on tomorrow \nis a commonsense measure aimed at protecting women and children across \nthe country. I urge my colleagues to embrace the sanctity of human life \nand vote to move to this bill so it can at least be considered.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I first want to commend the Senator from \nIowa. Senator Grassley has done a great job of a detailed report on why \nthis bill is so extremely important, and I thank him for his comments.\n  My remarks will be somewhat abbreviated. Today I rise to speak about \nthis very important legislation, absolutely crucial legislation the \nSenate is considering tomorrow. Like so many Americans, I agree that we \nhave a responsibility to protect those who cannot defend themselves. \nThat is why I am a cosponsor of the Pain-Capable Unborn Child \nProtection Act--this critical legislation which simply prohibits \nabortions after an unborn child reaches 20 weeks of development.\n  Scientific evidence--Senator Grassley reported about that--has shown \nthat after 20 weeks, a child's brain has developed to a point where \nthey can experience pain. With modern medical advances, even children \nborn at this early stage have a chance to survive. It is appalling that \nthe United States is one of only seven countries where elected \nabortions after 20 weeks are legal. How can our country take pride in \nprotecting human rights when we continue to allow this practice to \nhappen within our own borders?\n  A poll conducted by the Quinnipiac University found that a majority \nof Americans now support the banning of this abhorrent practice. \nRepresenting the values shared by a majority of Americans should be a \nbipartisan effort. We need to work together to protect innocent life.\n  So many Americans are troubled by the recent videos of Planned \nParenthood employees selling fetal tissue for a profit. Those videos \nhave helped the American people understand exactly what life at \nconception means. This legislation is a line of defense for protecting \nunborn children from Planned Parenthood's unconscionable practices.\n  I commend the States that have stopped this practice in the absence \nof a Federal law. Thirteen States maintain prohibitions of abortion at \n20 weeks. This includes my home State of Kansas. It is now time for the \nSenate to act and ensure that this practice is banned all across the \nNation. I encourage my colleagues to unite on this issue and support \nthis critical legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection \nAct will do exactly that: protect unborn children who can feel pain. \nStudies have shown that babies can feel pain by 20 weeks or 5 months \ninto pregnancy, and it is unconscionable to subject a child, at any \nstage in their life, to such pain.\n  Anesthesiologists protect these children from the pain of surgery in \nthe womb. Today these premature babies have a one in four chance of \nliving a full and complete life.\n  Do a quick Google search and type in ``20-week baby'' or ``20-week \nbaby pictures.'' Take out your smartphone and Google it. The results of \nthat search will pull up something like you see here to my right--a \nbaby whose facial features are clearly visible. In fact, only seven \ncountries in the world allow babies 20 weeks or older to be aborted--\nseven countries. The United States is one of them, along with North \nKorea and China, to name a few.\n  Overwhelmingly, Americans support this commonsense legislation. \nAccording to a November 2014 poll, 60 percent of Americans support a \nban on abortion at 20 weeks, including nearly 60 percent of American \nwomen. This is a bill that a majority of the American people are \nbehind, protecting babies after 20 weeks when they can feel pain.\n  We must continue to fight for the most vulnerable in our society--the \nelderly, the disabled, and the unborn--for they don't have a voice up \nhere on Capitol Hill. Their right to life is protected by our \nConstitution and is part of the framework of the Declaration of \nIndependence, and because of that, we speak up.\n  During the Gosnell trial, we all learned about the gruesome methods \nof ending the life of just-born children by using a method similar to \ndismemberment, which occurs in several clinics throughout our country. \nScience tells us that this method causes pain to the baby, some of whom \nwere a little over 20 weeks old.\n  Why do we allow these late-term abortions? If Gosnell aborted these \nchildren moments before they were removed from the womb, would the loss \nof life have been any less tragic or less appalling?\n  We cannot stand idly by and allow such painful terminations of human \nlife to continue. We must continue to be a voice for those who don't \nhave a voice. The Senate needs to join the House of Representatives and \nget this legislation passed and on the President's desk.\n\n[[Page S6846]]\n\n  I yield back my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak \ntonight. I am rising in strong support of the Pain-Capable Unborn Child \nProtection Act. This is an opportunity for all of us to give voice to \nthe unborn.\n  The fight to preserve the sanctity of life is something I have \nconsistently and proudly supported. I am proud of my record with regard \nto supporting the sanctity of life. I am proud of my 100-percent pro-\nlife voting record by supporting legislation in the House and now here \nin the Senate.\n  Earlier this year I reintroduced the Child Custody Protection Act. It \nprevents the transportation of minors across State lines for the \npurposes of eluding parental notification laws. This is a big deal in \nmy State. The legislation simply says that parents have the right to be \ninvolved in their kids' most important decisions. It is supported, by \nthe way, by an overwhelming majority of Americans. Parental \nnotification laws are key to reducing the number of abortions in this \ncountry and should be supported. We should not allow parental \nnotification laws to be circumvented.\n  I understand that there are raw emotions that are evoked by these \nissues, and I know there are fundamental disagreements on the issue of \nabortion. However, I hope there are steps we can take to promote a \nculture of life, and I think passing the Child Custody Protection Act \nis certainly one of those. I hope the Senate will take up that \nlegislation soon so that we can indeed come together as a group and \npromote the sanctity of life. I think another way to do this is to \nsupport the pain-capable legislation I will talk about in a moment.\n  Along with millions of other Americans, I have watched these deeply \ndisturbing Planned Parenthood videos that were recently released. The \nvideos graphically show how some at Planned Parenthood view the unborn \nas something to be exploited and not as precious life that deserves to \nbe protected. Because of the shocking nature of these videos, \ncongressional committees of jurisdiction are properly now \ninvestigating. Beyond that, I call on the Obama administration to begin \na criminal investigation into this matter to determine if employees of \na federally funded organization have violated the law. These acts must \nnot be tolerated.\n  Last month I cosponsored and voted for legislation that would end \nFederal funding for Planned Parenthood while ensuring that taxpayer \ndollars would continue to be offered to community health organizations \nto continue to provide health services to women across my State of Ohio \nand across America. By the way, there are seven times more community \nhealth organizations in the State of Ohio than there are Planned \nParenthood clinics. So this is an opportunity for us to shift that \nfunding to where women can get the health care support they need. These \nhealth care issues for women are a national priority and should \ncontinue to be. We need to strengthen women's health initiatives \nwithout having to fund Planned Parenthood from the paychecks of \nAmerican workers.\n  The pain-capable legislation that is currently being debated here on \nthe floor is really about science, and it is about advances in medical \ntechnology. Scientific evidence now tells us that at the age of 20 \nweeks post fertilization, an unborn child can feel pain. It is time to \nrecognize this fact and take the necessary steps to protect unborn \nchildren and welcome them to life. I believe this legislation is a very \nimportant part of that overall goal.\n  I have visited the neonatal units at the great children's hospitals \nin my home State of Ohio. I have seen the amazing work that is done \nthere by our doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals. It is \nincredible. I encourage all of my colleagues to make visits in their \nown States. I have seen firsthand this amazing work. I have seen as \nthey help babies who were born extremely premature come to life. It is \ninspirational to see what they are doing. These newborns represent the \nmiracle of life, and it is our duty to make sure they are protected. We \nhave seen advances in neonatal care to allow these babies to survive \nand to live to their full potential. Just a few years ago this was not \nnecessarily the case, so these medical advances have been really \nexciting, and it is one more reason to pass this legislation.\n  As we continue to enhance our medical technologies, more and more \npeople are able to see that we are not talking about unviable fetuses, \nbut unborn children who could one day grow up and become part of our \nAmerican family. As a result, increasingly, the American people believe \nthat ending a child's life should be as rare as possible and that we \nshould work together to reduce the number of abortions performed in \nthis country. That is progress.\n  The debate on this legislation is not just about morals or values or \nreligious views. It is about protecting innocent life from a painful \nact that they do not deserve. We have a responsibility to protect \nunborn children and give them the chance to succeed. This legislation \nand this vote before us here tomorrow in the Senate is an opportunity \nto make that happen.\n  The United States of America is only one of only seven countries in \nthe world to provide and allow for elective abortions after 20 weeks. \nThink about that. On that short list, by the way, are North Korea and \nChina. What does that say about our national character if we know these \nunborn children are feeling excruciating pain, yet we choose not to \nact? When our Founders declared our independence, they wrote of certain \nunalienable truths endowed by our Creator, they said, and among them, \nof course, are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Life is the \nvery first one. So let's stand together today and take a unified step \ntoward protecting life.\n  This is a commonsense bill. It has the support of the American \npeople. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to help provide \na voice for those who cannot provide that voice for themselves, to take \nthis important step toward holding up the sanctity of life, and to pass \nthis important legislation.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, we as a Nation treat bugs in a very \nunique way. There is a little bug called the American burying beetle. \nThey are in many areas of the country. They are all over Oklahoma. In \nsoutheastern Oklahoma, in a lot of areas where there is commercial \nconstruction, we have to wait through the early part of the spring \nbecause, in the springtime, the American burying beetle lays little \neggs and those eggs multiply in the ground and little bugs start \ncrawling up. The folks at the Fish and Wildlife Service tell us not to \nstep on those bugs because they could possibly be threatened, and \nconstruction needs to stop during the springtime so the Earth is not \ndisturbed during that time period. We don't want to disturb the Earth \nbecause those eggs might be damaged, and we will have fewer of the \nAmerican burying beetle.\n  I bring that up not because I am so enamored with that bug, but \nbecause our Nation has a history of protecting life--life wherever it \nmay be--whether it is a burying beetle in southeastern Oklahoma or \nwhether it is a child.\n  For some strange reason, in this room, the conversation tends to go \nmore towards the American burying beetle and their eggs and protecting \nthat bug than it is about protecting children. So I bring up today \nsomething that I don't think should be that controversial. What are we \ngoing to do with children who can feel and experience pain? Will we as \na Nation guard children? That would be a pretty straightforward thing, \nI would say.\n  In 1973 the Supreme Court of the United States struggled with how to \nbe able to define life. This whole conversation the Supreme Court had \nbehind closed doors as they struggled with a decision that we now know \nas Roe v. Wade. In January of 1973, after struggling behind closed \ndoors, the Supreme Court came out with a decision\n\n[[Page S6847]]\n\nthat was brand new to American law, coming from actually common law, \nand that was viability. What used to be in common law when they would \ndiscuss quickening, when the child could kick and move, they would now \nconsider this child a child worthy of protection. They asked the \nquestion: When is it possible for a fetus to be alive? In January of \n1973, they said they would have to leave it up to medical technology as \nto when that child would be viable.\n  Fast forward up to today. Let's talk about when a child is considered \nviable. Let's talk about what happens now. We know at 20 weeks that \nchild can respond to different stimuli. That child feels pain. That \nchild can respond to normal things that are happening around it. I can \ndistinctly remember, with both of my daughters, my wife and I went in \nat 20 weeks to be able to look at the sonogram because at 20 weeks, \nthat was the first time the doctor could say whether we were going to \nhave a boy or a girl, and we could see the health of my two daughters. \nThat was a big day for us, to be able to go in and see the sonogram and \nto know it is a girl and to be able to watch them move around in the \nwomb, to dream about what her name would be and what they would look \nlike. Now one daughter is in college, and one is in high school. But \nthe first time I ever laid eyes on them, they were 20 weeks old, when \nwe got a peak into the womb with the sonogram.\n  This bill asks a simple question, this bill that deals with pain-\ncapable. This pain-capable bill asks the question: Is the child alive \nat five months, when the baby can kick, suck its thumb, stretch, yawn, \nmake faces; when medical science tells us they can experience pain, is \nthat child alive?\n  Recently The New York Times did a report studying this one issue \nabout children that are born extremely early--at this exact time we are \ndiscussing right now--how many of the children that are born even that \nearly make it. The New York Times' latest study said more than 25 \npercent of them make it.\n  Let me tell my colleagues about one of them. Her name is Violet. She \nis the daughter of a friend of mine. She is a pretty amazing young \nlady. She was born at this exact date we are discussing, and she was \nborn at 14 ounces. She would fit into your hand, less than a pound. \nThat tiny little girl who had such a tough start is a 1-year-old now. \nShe is not 14 ounces, she is 15 pounds and--thanks for asking--she is \ndoing great. She is healthy and strong and she is beautiful. You ought \nto see her beautiful face with the bow on the top of her head--a \nsparkling little girl. She was born at 14 ounces.\n\n  I am asking our Nation to think about this again. The discussion in \n1973 about viability needs to catch up to the science of today. At 14 \nounces and at 5 months of gestation, that little girl is doing great. \nYet in many places in our country--not all but in many places in our \ncountry--that child can still be executed in the womb and no one would \nbat an eye.\n  This is a conversation our Nation needs to have. I can't imagine it \nwould be controversial to make a simple statement. When a child can \nfeel pain, when a child is viable--even the Supreme Court from 1973 \nwould look at this time period and say that is viability--at that \nmoment, should we as a nation step up and protect children? This \nshouldn't be about whether a child can feel pain. We know that child \ncan feel pain. It is not even about viability. We know that child is \nviable. In fact, I know her name. It is about when our laws catch up to \nour morals and to our science.\n  Late-term abortions in many areas of our country are already illegal. \nLet's address this. As a people and as a nation, I am asking a simple \nthing. When we know the child can feel pain, when we know they are \nviable, let's treat them as a child. Let's honor that child as alive, \nand let's say we don't do abortions when we know that child is viable. \nIt is a straightforward issue that I hope will not be controversial. \nThis is not about women's health. This is about the health of little \nboys and little girls who need our Nation to stay with them.\n  This bill we can pass. A lot of important things we are dealing \nwith--the budget, the Iran nuclear negotiations--but can we not stop \nfor a moment and say our Nation will guard our most vulnerable? Can we \nnot protect our children? I think we can do both.\n  I yield back.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Pain-Capable \nUnborn Child Protection Act, which protects unborn babies who are \ncapable of feeling pain from abortions. I am proud to be a cosponsor of \nthe Senate version of this bill and applaud our Leader for bringing the \nbill to the floor.\n  According to the National Library of Medicine, a baby's major systems \nand structures develop at week 5 of fetal development. Blood cells, \nkidney cells, and nerve cells develop at this time; and the baby's \nbrain, spinal cord, and heart begin to develop. During the sixth and \nseventh weeks, a baby's brain forms into five different areas and a \nbaby's heart beats at a regular rhythm, with blood pumping through the \nmain vessels. Lungs start to form during week 8, and all essential \norgans have begun to grow by week 9.\n  The National Library of Medicine reports that a baby's face is well-\nformed between weeks 11 and 14. Bones become harder between weeks 15 \nand 18, and the baby's liver and pancreas produce secretions. Between \nweeks 19 and 21, a baby can hear and swallow.\n  Some of my colleagues are aware that this issue is very personal for \nme. Our daughter Amy was born three months premature. She weighed 2 \npounds and the doctor's advice was to wait and see. We took Amy to \nWyoming's biggest hospital to get the best kind of care we could find. \nWhen my wife, Diana, and I would visit her, the nurses often told us it \nwasn't looking good. We were even asked if we had had Amy baptized. \nWhen we said she was, a relieved nurse said, ``Good. We've never lost a \nbaptized preemie.''\n  Amy is a fighter, and she lived. Today, she is a teacher in Wyoming, \nand Diana and I were so proud to see her get married last year. What I \nlearned from watching Amy is how hard a 6-month old baby struggles to \nlive. I want babies like Amy to be protected. I firmly believe that \nevery life demands our respect as a special gift from God, and I urge \nmy colleagues to support the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act \nas a step in the right direction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I recognize the 20th anniversary of \nthe After-School All-Stars of Greater Las Vegas, NV.\n  In 1995, Elaine Wynn established the Greater Las Vegas Inner-City \nGames to provide thousands of young Nevadans with a fun, safe, and \npositive place to go during after-school hours. In 2003, the program \nwas expanded to include more services and the program was transformed \ninto the After-School All-Stars.\n  Over the past two decades, After-School All-Stars has provided more \nthan 120,000 underprivileged Southern Nevadans with a free and \ncomprehensive after-school program. Today, the After-School All-Stars \nprogram has reached 12 states, including the District of Columbia.\n  After-School All-Stars takes pride in providing its students with the \nopportunity to participate in exciting and engaging activities, while \nalso building self-esteem. This important program teaches its \nparticipants the value of saying no to drugs and yes to hope and offers \nstudents academic support, enrichment activities, and health and \nfitness awareness. Through its mission, After-School All-Stars is \nworking to graduate students from high school, prepare them for college \nand future careers, and encourage them to give back to their \ncommunities.\n  This organization has impacted the lives of Nevada students for 20 \nyears, and I applaud the After-School All-Stars program of Greater Las \nVegas for their dedication to improving the lives\n\n[[Page S6848]]\n\nof at-risk students throughout Southern Nevada.

Mr. President, today I wish to join Americans across our \ngreat Nation in recognizing National POW/MIA Day--a day to honor \nprisoners of war, POW, and those missing in action, MIA.\n  Throughout the history of our Nation, Americans have answered the \ncall of duty to defend our country and its interests. They bravely step \nforward knowing of the sacrifices they may endure. At home, we enjoy \nthe security and freedoms they have fought to ensure. We must not \nforget the costs of our freedoms and the Americans who sacrificed for \nour country. We must be resolute in our duty to bring them home should \nthey go missing or be taken prisoner when serving our Nation.\n  The safe return of those who have gone missing in action or are \nprisoners of war remains at the forefront of my thoughts and prayers. \nLikewise, the challenges of families of missing servicemembers as they \nawait the return of loved ones cannot be forgotten. POW/MIA families \nand veterans have remained committed to the pursuit of facts. Finding \nresolution for military families, who have supported the brave men and \nwomen who protect our freedoms, must also remain a priority.\n  We cannot forget the remarkable service of those who put their lives \non the line to secure the return of missing military personnel. Those \ncourageous Americans and their families deserve gratitude for the work \nthey do to bring Americans home.\n  Thank you for the service of our Nation's servicemembers, their \nfamilies, and all those who work to ensure the return home of America's \nbest and bravest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/21/senate-section/article/S6848-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SECRETARY JOHN McHUGH\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the senior \nSenator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed, who serves as the cochair of the \nSenate Army Caucus, together with the members of the caucus, I proudly \nwish to pay tribute to the Honorable John M. McHugh, former Member of \nthe House of Representatives, colleague, friend, and inspirational \nleader as he leaves his current post as one of the longest serving \nSecretaries of the Army in U.S. history.\n  To say this patriot has faithfully served his country is an \nunderstatement. After over 42 years of public service, John leaves our \nArmy, our Nation, and our world both safer and more secure. Moreover, \nhis tireless advocacy and bold leadership for our soldiers, civilians, \nand their family members are legendary. From improvements in family and \nmental health programs to unprecedented strides in combating sexual \nassault and suicide, John M. McHugh has truly earned the oft-stated \nmoniker of ``The Soldier's Secretary.''\n  Raised in Watertown, NY, John served as assistant city manager and \nwent on to serve four terms in the New York State Senate. From there, \nthis great leader was asked to run for Congress, ultimately \nrepresenting his district in the House of Representatives for nearly 17 \nyears, and rising to be the ranking member of the House Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  As Congressman McHugh demonstrated repeatedly, it takes thoughtful, \ndetermined, and visionary leadership to ensure the security of our \nNation. As a Representative of the 24th and later the 23rd District of \nNew York, which includes one of our most important Army posts, Fort \nDrum, John ensured that cutting-edge facilities and programs supported \nour warfighters. To say that Fort Drum is the ``House that McHugh \nBuilt'' is very apropos. From MILCON projects to weapons systems, the \nsoldiers, civilians, and families of that historic post were always \ncared for and supported, and John ensured that the 10th Mountain \nDivision had all of the tools it needed to be at the tip of the spear \nof our Nation's defense. Moreover, his exceptional work as the cochair \nof the Army Caucus for over 15 years and as a critical member of the \nWest Point board of visitors was instrumental in improving Congress's \nunderstanding of the Army's needs.\n  During his tenure as the second-longest serving Secretary of the \nArmy, John M. McHugh has been at the very forefront of national \nmilitary strategy, policy, and programs. His expert leadership, bold \ninitiatives, and pragmatic management of the oldest and largest \nmilitary service has ensured that our Army remains the finest fighting \nforce the world has ever known. And it has been no easy task.\n  John presided over some of the toughest missions the Army has ever \nfaced. From overseeing one of the largest retrogrades in military \nhistory; while holding the Army together as it was hit by \nsequestration; to reorganizing, revamping, and restructuring our force, \nwhile our soldiers conducted combat operations around the world, \nSecretary McHugh led with distinction and results.\n  Of particular note, John's determination, devotion, and love of our \nservicemembers ensured that our most sacred and hallowed ground, \nArlington National Cemetery, overcame years of neglect and transformed \nits management and oversight.\n  With profound admiration and deep respect, we pay tribute to \nSecretary McHugh for all he has done for our Nation. We thank him for \nhis dedication and sacrifice. We wish him all the fullest measure of \npeace and happiness as he boldly takes on new challenges in the next \nphase of his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/21/senate-section/article/S6848-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO PINKY KRAVITZ\n\n Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, today I am honored to recognize \nMr. Pinky Kravitz on the occasion of his retirement from the WOND-AM \n1400 after many years of remarkable broadcasting throughout the Garden \nState.\n  Mr. Kravitz could be heard over the airways for more than 59 years as \na radio broadcaster. He started his illustrious career first in 1956 as \nthe host of a live call-in show on WLDB-AM, now known as 1490 WBSS. \nSince 1958, he has continuously hosted numerous radio programs with \nWOND-AM 1400, including Pinky's Corner, a live call-in program, and \nWMGM Presents Pinky, a weekly television program. Additionally, his \nwritten word could be heard across numerous publications and \nnewspapers, most recently for the Press of Atlantic City. His radio \nshow was one of the longest-running shows in the country, proof of his \nwide appeal and heartfelt reporting.\n  Known widely as ``Mr. Atlantic City'' due to his promotion of the \narea, Mr. Kravitz was the unshakable spokesman of Southern New Jersey. \nA fierce advocate for the region, his voice was unmistakable, as he \nconsistently sought to highlight the very best of what makes New Jersey \ngreat. His in-depth programming spoke to many, as he resonated with the \nhearts and minds of our friends and neighbors. Mr. Kravitz represented \nthe very best of engaging, informative, entertaining, and responsible \nbroadcasting.\n  In addition to these and many more accomplishments, Mr. Kravitz was \nthe first inductee into the New Jersey Broadcasters Hall of Fame in \n2012, a testament to his impact on the industry. He was also the first \nrecipient of the New Jersey Broadcasters Association, NJBA, Lifetime \nAchievement Award.\n  I was honored to appear on Mr. Kravitz's radio show on several \noccasions. He was always the utmost professional while embracing the \nnature of substantive, meaningful journalism. For many years, his radio \nand television shows consistently sought to provide the region with a \nunique and fair perspective while maintaining a sense of familiarity \nand comfort, an accomplishment in and of itself.\n  I recognize, commend, and applaud Mr. Pinky Kravitz in light of his \nextraordinary service to WOND-AM 1400 and his unwavering dedication to \nthe airways of New Jersey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/21/senate-section/article/S6848-4", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6848-S6849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n[[Page S6849]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/21/senate-section/article/S6849-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/21/senate-section/article/S6849-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n                         Enrolled Bills Signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 6, 2015, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on September 18, 2015, during the \nadjournment of the Senate, received a message from the House of \nRepresentatives announcing that the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nThornberry) has signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 230.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Armed \nServices Committee be discharged from further consideration of and the \nSenate now proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 257.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 257) congratulating Captain Kristen \n     Griest and First Lieutenant Shaye Haver on their graduation \n     from Ranger School.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to honor and congratulate CPT \nKristen Griest and 1LT Shaye Haver for their historic accomplishment of \nbeing the first two women soldiers to complete U.S. Army Ranger School \nand earn their highly coveted Ranger tabs.\n  Earning the right to wear a Ranger tab is not for the faint-hearted. \nThe rigors of the course test even the strongest service members. Many \ntry; few succeed.\n  Through their grit and determination, Captain Griest and Lieutenant \nHaver have demonstrated that character, courage, and tenacity, not \ngender, are the hallmarks of great servicemembers and leaders.\n  Just as teamwork and dedication are the benchmarks for military \neffectiveness, they are also the mandates of the U.S. Army Rangers who \nare tasked with our Nation's most challenging and difficult missions. \nCaptain Griest and Lieutenant Haver, along with their fellow Ranger \nSchool classmates, braved the challenges and serve as role models for \ngirls and boys--women and men--in the United States and around the \nworld. This integrated class answered our Nation's call to service. \nThey stood shoulder-to-shoulder, enduring the course's extreme mental \nand physical stress, together. Each carried his or her own weight, and \nat times the weight of others, proving that integration represents not \njust a lofty goal, but an achievable reality. Their collective and \ndistinguished accomplishments embody the values of our Armed Forces and \nour Nation.\n  The journey toward integration, however, has been hard fought. Before \nthem, the first African Americans and women who answered the call to \nservice laid the foundation for making integration possible. These \npioneers inherently understood the importance of their contributions to \nthe realization of integration. They also recognized the undeniable \ntruth that an integrated and balanced force is a successful force both \non and off the battlefield.\n  The effectiveness of a military unit is almost always determined by \nthe cohesion of its individual members, their dedication to the team, \nand their commitment to the mission. No individual servicemember can \nsucceed by his or her efforts alone. Success is forged from equality \nand integration.\n  As we celebrate Captain Griest's and Lieutenant Haver's historic and \ninspiring achievements, we express our pride and gratitude for their \npersonal courage and sacrifice. I am confident that the military and \nour country are more battle ready as a result. I am also confident that \nCaptain Griest and Lieutenant Haver will continue to serve with \ndistinction as they ``lead the way'' as our Nation's newest U.S. Army \nRangers. As a result of their milestone achievements, they have \ninspired a nation.\n  With this in mind, I am pleased to offer this resolution with \nSenators Mikulski, Ayotte, Baldwin, Boxer, Cantwell, Capito, Ernst, \nFeinstein, Fischer, Gillibrand, Heitkamp, Hirono, Klobuchar, McCaskill, \nMurkowski, Murray, Shaheen, Stabenow, Warren, Perdue, Murphy, Kirk, \nTester, Flake, Reed, Donnelly, Grassley, Blumenthal, Isakson, Warner, \nLeahy, Franken, Rubio, Heinrich, Coons, Thune, Merkley, and Gardner, \nhonoring and recognizing the patriotism and historic contributions to \nthe United States by Captain Griest and Lieutenant Haver, and extend my \nbest wishes and heartiest congratulations.\n  Mr. LANKFORD.
