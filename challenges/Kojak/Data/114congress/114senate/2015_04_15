Mr. President, just hours ago, 100 percent of Senate \nDemocrats followed the lead of Republicans and Democrats in the House, \nincluding Nancy Pelosi and the pro-choice caucus, in voting to endorse \nthe bipartisan principle that Federal funds leaving the government \nshould be subject to bipartisan Hyde language. Given that Americans \noverwhelmingly support what Hyde does, it is no wonder this principle \nhas been applied by both parties--both parties--to appropriations and \nauthorizing legislation for as long as anyone could remember.\n  We hope the Democrats' statement of support for Hyde in last night's \nMedicare vote will finally clear the way for passage of antislavery \nlegislation they have been filibustering over the very same Hyde \nprinciple. It was never a morally tenable position. Never. Considering \nwhat we saw just 12 hours ago, it is no longer politically tenable \neither. Democrats couldn't possibly justify voting for Hyde language in \norder to keep doctors--as they did just hours ago--but then look an \nabused victim in the eye and tell her she is not worth it. OK to vote \nfor Hyde to help doctors, but then not OK when it comes to victims of \nsexual trafficking.\n  Human trafficking is a serious problem in our country. It is hard for \na lot of people to believe, but it occurs in every single State. I \nrecently saw a news report about a local nonprofit that is worried \nabout trafficking at big events such as the Kentucky Derby. ``They'll \ntake a girl to one city for one to two weeks,'' an official with that \ngroup said, ``then they'll go to another city, and they just follow \nthese circuits . . . it's really hard to get them out of it . . .''\n  Look, it is unconscionable for anyone to continue filibustering this \nhuman rights bill over a principle that has been a fixture--a fixture--\nin Federal law for decades, that was in the bill when Democrats \nendorsed it, cosponsored it, and voted unanimously to support it in \ncommittee, and that was endorsed again by Democrats just last night.\n  But just to ensure there are no possible excuses left to continue \nthis filibuster, Senator Cornyn offered another compromise last night \nto eliminate any remaining pretext. His compromise ensures that, by \nsupporting this bill, Senate Democrats would only be endorsing the same \nHyde language that 100 percent of them just voted to support last \nnight, less than 24 hours ago. Remember, this is essentially language \nendorsed by Nancy Pelosi and the pro-choice caucus.\n  It is actually the third compromise we have offered on the Senate \nfloor to our friends across the aisle. First, we offered our colleagues \na simple up-or-down vote last month to strike the language that they \nonce were for before they decided to be against it. Then, before the \nrecess, Senator Cornyn offered to make the monies in the fund subject \nto the appropriations process, something our Democratic colleagues had \nsaid was important to them.\n  So this is now the third compromise we have offered on the floor. It \nis time for our Democratic friends to show a little courage to finally \nbring their party's filibuster of antislavery legislation to an end. A \nlarge bipartisan majority of the Senate has already demonstrated its \ncommitment to doing so, and all that is needed now are a couple more \nDemocrats to join us. That is all that is needed now, a couple more \nDemocrats willing to show the same level of compassion to enslaved \nvictims\n\n[[Page S2186]]\n\nthey offered to doctors--to doctors--just a few hours ago.\n  As an official with the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women put \nit: ``Our Democratic colleagues should stop choosing a phantom problem \n. . .''--a phantom problem--``. . . over real victims.''\n  Because as the Los Angeles Times said:\n\n       The Hyde Amendment has been the law for many years. A fight \n     over whether a fraction of the projected millions of dollars \n     in aid to victims of trafficking and hunters of traffickers \n     can be used on abortion services seems fruitless, and the \n     bill should not be derailed by such a fight.\n\n  This has gone on long enough. It is time for Senators of conscience \nto stand up and end this filibuster now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/15/senate-section/article/S2186-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           A BALANCED BUDGET\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on another matter, before Easter, the \nSenate passed a balanced budget. The House of Representatives did as \nwell. The next step in the process is for each Chamber to appoint \nMembers to a conference committee that can work out any differences \nbetween those bills, and then send unified legislation back to Congress \nfor a final vote. We are taking that next step today.\n  Some of our friends across the aisle seem eager to use this \nopportunity to rehash some of the same votes we took in passing the \nbudget. The outcome of those votes won't be different, so I am not sure \nwhat the point would be, other than to slow down the process for its \nown sake. So I would urge them to reconsider and decide if that is \nreally what they want to do.\n  But either way--either way--the new Congress is determined to keep \nworking to finalize the budget. After years of a Senate that often \nrefused to even consider a budget, this is a big change. And it is \nanother example of the new Congress that is back to regular order and \nback to work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/15/senate-section/article/S2186-2", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Republican leader talked about two issues: one, sexual \ntrafficking, and, two, the budget. His statements regarding the two are \nillogical as anything can be. Illogical.\n  First of all, let's talk about sexual trafficking. Senators on this \nside of the aisle, with rare exception, are not wild about the Hyde \namendment, but it has been the law of the land for some 30 years. And \nwhy is it the law of the land? Because it has been put in \nappropriations bills over these many years. But what my friend the \nRepublican leader failed to mention is that if the Cornyn amendment or \nthe Cornyn language were adopted, it would change women's reproduction \nrights permanently. You see, the Hyde amendment has always applied to \ntaxpayer-funded money. But what Senator Cornyn, the author of this bill \nand this amendment, wants to do is direct this to private money. They \nare two totally different things. Hyde has never, ever in the past \napplied to private money--nontaxpayer dollars. So that is why my \nfriend's argument is totally illogical. Illogical. It has no basis in \nfact. We are not going to stand by to enlarge this so-called Hyde \namendment to private money.\n  Now we have tried. We have tried. Ten different offers have been made \nto Senator Cornyn and Senator McConnell to work our way through this. \nThere are many ways we can handle this. But they feel--my friend the \nRepublican leader and the assistant Republican leader feel this is \ntheir opportunity to broaden Hyde. We are not going to allow that to \nhappen. It would be wrong. We have made 10 separate offers of ways to \nget to yes, but Republicans appear unwilling to compromise about the \nHyde language, and that is unfortunate.\n  To carry on the illogic of the Republican leader, every organization \nhas a mission statement, a summary of their goals and values. Congress \nis no different. There are mission statements that are done every year \nand they are called a budget. We have our mission statement; the \nRepublicans have theirs. The budget sets forth our core values as a \nparty, a statement of our values that tells the American people what we \nreally care about and whose side we are on. We are committed to a \nbudget that puts the middle class first, a budget that supports hard-\nworking families, creates jobs, and invests in our future. The \nRepublicans, by contrast, are hell-bent on passing a budget that \ncreates a war on the middle class and serves the interests of special \ninterests and the superwealthy.\n  Let's take a look at what the Senate Republican budget does. \nRemember, this is their statement of core values, and their war on the \naverage American from Reno to Las Vegas to Chicago to Louisville--it \ndoesn't matter where you go--is an attack on the middle class. Why do I \nsay that? It deprives more than 16 million Americans of health \ncoverage. That is the first thing their budget does. It devastates \nMedicare. It makes Medicare something we would not recognize, and they \ndo it, of course, at the expense of America's seniors. It cuts Medicaid \nand hurts millions of families who are not able to pay for their care.\n  Everyone thinks Medicaid is just for poor people. Some people don't \nthink they have much value in our society and Medicaid is something \nthat shouldn't get much of our attention. But a significant amount of \nMedicaid money goes to people who are in rest homes and convalescent \ncenters. So the money they are whacking from Medicaid hurts not only \nthe young but the old. It guts nutrition assistance. It guts food that \ncan go to people who are hungry. It undermines job training and \nemployment services for millions of American families. It cuts billions \nin financial aid for college students.\n  The Republicans not only want to cut aid to families as it relates to \neducation, but then the debts they have accumulated, which are larger \nthan credit card debt--they don't want to cut them any relief \nwhatsoever. We have tried that lots of times. Our budget reflects that; \ntheirs doesn't.\n  While the middle class is decimated by Senate Republicans--and who \nbenefits? Special interests and the superrich. They are protected more \nthan ever. The Republicans refuse to close a single loophole to reduce \nthis deficit.\n  A single tax loophole they will not touch. They will not end tax \nbreaks for companies that ship jobs overseas. They will not close \nloopholes for the wealthy, including hedge fund managers. They will not \ntake away wasteful and unneeded tax breaks for the very powerful oil \nand gas industry. They are attacking the middle class while protecting \nthe super wealthy. That is wrong.\n  Now, the Republican budget is also dishonest. I heard the Republican \nleader come here and boast. He boasted about the balanced budget they \nhave. That is absolutely not true. Their budget does not balance the \nbudget. It is simply dishonest to say so. The Republican budget claims \nto add more money for defense, but it does not.\n  It is no wonder that the New York Times called the Republican budget \n``a trillion dollar con job.'' ``A trillion dollar con job'' is the \nRepublican budget. I agree with the New York Times. In the coming days, \nas we move forward toward a conference--now remember moving forward \ntoward conference has become kind of a joke around here because we do \nnot have conferences like we used to. That is too bad.\n  There will be no meeting of the conferees. There will be no debate in \nopen session as to how the budget should be changed. The Republicans \nwill get to conference. There will be meetings held by the Republicans. \nDemocrats will not be invited. If they are invited, it is pro forma: \nHere is what we have decided to do. The conferences, as we used to do \nthem around here, do not exist. It is a rare occasion when they do.\n  We will not be looking into our efforts to try to improve the budget. \nWe are not looking to obstruct the process to force another all-night \nvote-arama. We could. Under the rules we could offer endless, endless \nmotions to instruct: 5, 6, 50, 100, 200. We could do that. We are not \ngoing to do that. But we will be offering a few motions to make clear \nwhere we stand on important issues.\n  For example, there will be an amendment that men and women who do the \nsame work should be paid the same money. If my daughter works here and\n\n[[Page S2187]]\n\na man works here and they do the same job, they should be paid the same \namount of money. We have tried to do that. The Republicans have \nfilibustered this five times over the last few years.\n  We are going to offer an amendment to provide sick leave to help \nfamilies get through tough times. We are going to offer an amendment to \nensure that same sex spouses have equal access to Social Security and \nveterans' benefits. We are going to offer an amendment to relieve the \ncrushing burden of costly student loans. No one has worked harder on \nthis issue than the assistant Democratic leader. I heard him yesterday \ntalk about this at a meeting we had--the crushing, crushing costly \nstudent loans. We are going to offer an amendment to address the \neconomic and national security threats posed by climate change.\n  In the West, we are in the midst of a 15-year drought. This is the \n15th year. Lake Powell, the largest manmade lake in America, could go \ndry very quickly. Hundreds of thousands of acre feet of water will not \ngo into that lake this year because of what is happening up in \nColorado.\n  So when we are done offering what we feel should be ways to improve \nthis dishonest budget that the Republicans put forward, the American \npeople will have no doubt which party stands with the middle class and \nwhich stands with the special interests and billionaires. Yes, we have \nset forth what we believe are our core values, and we believe our core \nvalues are what the American people need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/15/senate-section/article/S2187-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it was 150 years ago today--150 years ago \ntoday--when who is called the last casualty of the Civil War died. He \nwas a man who was born in the Presiding Officer's home State of \nKentucky. He grew up for a part of his life in Indiana but spent his \nformative years in my State of Illinois.\n  He was a country lawyer, an unlikely Congressman who, because of a \npolitical deal, was given a chance to serve in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. He served only 2 years. He brought his family here to \nWashington for that experience.\n  They lived just across the street, in a boarding house where the \nLibrary of Congress now sits. His family did not like Washington in \nthose days in the 1840s and returned back to his wife's home in \nKentucky.\n  He stayed out here and served in Congress and liked it. He wanted to \nserve for a longer period of time but was reminded that this was not \npart of the agreement--only 2 years. So he left Washington, went back \nto Springfield, IL, practiced law, but continued to aspire to higher \noffice.\n  In 1858, he ran for the Senate against a man named Steven Douglas. \nThey had historic debates across the State of Illinois. When the votes \nwere finally counted, Douglas was the victor, and this man returned to \nthe practice of law. Just 2 years later, though, he was elected \nPresident of the United States.\n  He came to Washington at one of the most dangerous times in our \nhistory. The Civil War had started, and there was a question as to \nwhether the Union could survive, whether the United States of America \nwould survive. This simple country lawyer from what was considered the \nfrontier of America in those days led our Nation during the most \ndangerous moments in our history.\n  He watched as more Americans died in that Civil War than in any war \nthat we have ever witnessed. He saw a nation bitterly divided. The war \nraged on for years. There were moments--bleak and dark moments--when it \nlooked as if the North would fail and the division of the country would \nbegin.\n  But eventually the North prevailed in a victory that really the \nAmerican people had given so much to achieve. In April of 1865, this \nwas a tumultuous period. I commend to all of my colleagues a book \nwritten by Jay Winik, a Senate staffer entitled ``April 1865,'' if you \nwant to get a feel for what it was like in America that month.\n  Many things occurred. The second inaugural address of this President \nis one of the most beautiful, touching, and moving speeches ever given \nby a President, where he turned toward the enemy who had fought the \nNorth for so many years and basically extended an olive branch when \nmany others would have done just the opposite. ``With malice toward \nnone'' and with ``charity for all,'' he gave that speech right outside \nhere--right outside the Senate Chamber on the porch.\n  Then, in celebration of the victory of the Union, he and his wife \nattended a play not far from here, at Ford's Theatre. It was there that \nan assassin took his life. So 150 years ago today, Abraham Lincoln, the \nPresident of the United States, was assassinated. We have learned a lot \nfrom his life, from his leadership, and we enjoy the blessings of \nliberty and the Union today because that President and the men and \nwomen who stood by him saved the Union.\n  I reflect on this because I come from what is known as Mr. Lincoln's \nhometown of Springfield, IL. I am not an expert on Lincoln. I am just a \nfan, as so many people are, not only across the United States but \naround the world. I hope we can remember him just for a moment today \nand reflect on the need for all of us to extend an olive branch to our \npersonal enemies and to our political enemies and try to find how to \neliminate an enemy by making a friend, as Lincoln said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/15/senate-section/article/S2187-4", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2187-S2188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LYNCH NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I cannot believe that Loretta Lynch still \nsits on this Executive Calendar of the Senate. It is put on our desk \nevery day we are in session. She has been on that calendar for a longer \nperiod of time than any nominee for Attorney General in the last 30 \nyears.\n  Senators can vote for or against Loretta Lynch to be Attorney \nGeneral. That is their right. But an Attorney General nominee whose \nqualifications and character are unquestionable deserves better than \nthe treatment she is receiving from this Senate. Ms. Lynch deserves a \ntimely vote, just as other Attorney General nominees of other \nPresidents have received.\n  She was reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee on February 26 \nin a bipartisan vote. Nine Democrats and three Republicans voted for \nthis Presidential nominee. She has now been pending on the Senate \ncalendar right here for 48 days--48 days on this calendar. Not one word \nhas been spoken on this floor in derogation of this fine woman, this \nfine nominee.\n  The last seven Attorney General nominees combined--all seven of \nthem--had to wait on the Senate floor for a total of 24 days--seven \nnominees, 24 days. For Loretta Lynch it is 48 days.\n  The Senate has confirmed other nominees while the human trafficking \nbill has been pending on the floor. There is no procedural obstacle. \nWhile that bill has been pending, the Senate has voted on nominees for \nAssistant Secretary of Transportation, Assistant Secretary of Commerce, \nthe Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission, and the Federal \nRetirement Thrift Investment Board. And on Monday we voted on a Federal \njudge. It is routine for the Senate to consider nominees on the \nExecutive Calendar while still considering legislation.\n  It has been 158 days--more than 5 months--since Ms. Lynch's \nnomination to be Attorney General was announced. A vote still has not \nbeen scheduled. This is far longer than any recent Attorney General \nnominee has had to wait. Janet Reno waited 29 days. John Ashcroft, a \nRepublican nominee, waited 42 days. Alberto Gonzales, 86 days. Michael \nMukasey, 53 days. Eric Holder, 64 days. But when it comes to Loretta \nLynch, it is 158 days.\n  The last Attorney General nominee whose nomination took this long to \nprocess was Edwin Meese in 1984, who\n\n[[Page S2188]]\n\nfaced questions and investigations relating to questions of ethics. \nThere have been no such allegations--none--that have been raised \nagainst Loretta Lynch.\n  Senate Republicans have the capability to bring up nominations \npromptly. The majority leader, Senator McConnell of Kentucky, can walk \nto this floor and within a minute call her nomination, and it will be \nvoted on immediately. It is in his power to do it. Why will he not do \nit?

Mr. President, the Presiding Officer probably does not \nremember these days because of his age, but I do. When I was a child, \npolio was a scare that every family felt. I had friends in school who \nwere stricken with polio. Some of them, in the most extreme cases, \nended up in something called an iron lung. The Presiding Officer has \nprobably seen pictures of it. It is an incredible situation where \nsomeone would be encased in this tube, this metal tube that would help \nthem breathe.\n  Many were stricken with polio and ended up crippled, and their lives \nwere compromised to some degree in those days because disabilities were \nnot treated as well then as they are now. Parents did not know what to \nmake of this. No one knew what caused polio. My mother, God bless her, \nhad a theory that one of the things that might cause polio was playing \nin the street after a rainstorm in the flooded waters.\n  She would just ban me from doing that. ``That can cause polio,'' she \nsaid. That was my mother's theory. It was as valid as any other theory \nin those days. No one knew what was going on, what was causing it. Many \nAmericans lived in fear of that infectious, viral disease that attacks \nthe nerve cells and the central nervous system causing muscle wasting, \nparalysis, and sometimes death.\n  In 1952, nearly 60,000 children in the United States were reported to \nhave polio, with more than 20,000 cases of paralysis. There was a panic \nabout this epidemic. Families were afraid for their kids and the \nscientists struggled to understand the disease. Dr. Jonas Salk, a \npioneer in the field of vaccine research, was recruited in 1947 by the \nUniversity of Pittsburgh to be the director of virus research and to \nwork on finding a polio vaccine.\n  His work caught the attention of Basil O'Connor, the president of the \nNational Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, now known as the March of \nDimes Foundation. The organization decided to fund Dr. Jonas Salk's \nwork to develop a vaccine against polio. For 5 years, Dr. Salk worked \ntirelessly on this effort while the country donated their dimes to the \nfoundation to support his work.\n  Then, on April 12, 1955, Dr. Thomas Francis, Jr.--an epidemiologist \nat the University of Michigan and a mentor to Salk--announced that Salk \nhad discovered a polio vaccine that was safe and effective.\n  When the announcement was made, it was as if time stood still. I \nstill remember it as a kid. Americans turned on their radios and TVs to \nhear the details. Department stores set up loudspeakers and judges \nsuspended trials so everyone in the courtroom could hear this good \nnews.\n  April 12 was deliberately chosen for the announcement because it \nmarked the 10th anniversary of the death of the most famous polio \nsurvivor of all, former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Roosevelt \nalso founded what would become the March of Dimes Foundation in 1938, \nwithout which Salk might not have been able to complete his work.\n  A massive field trial, the first of its kind, was conducted on over \n1.8 million children to prove the vaccine was 80 to 90 percent \neffective. Church bells rang across the country, factories observed \nmoments of silence, and parents and teachers wept to finally be \nrelieved of this fear.\n  But it had only just begun. The U.S. Government invested heavily in \nmass production of the polio vaccine and led campaigns across the \nNation to see that every kid was vaccinated. I hated the thought of \ngetting a shot, but the notion that I would be protected from polio for \nlife was certainly worth it.\n  As a result, polio was eradicated from the United States in 1979.\n  Sunday, we marked the 60th anniversary of the announcement of the \ndiscovery of the first safe and effective polio vaccine. In \ncommemoration of that announcement, I submitted a resolution last month \ncelebrating the discovery of the polio vaccine and supporting the \nefforts to eradicate that disease around the world.\n  The resolution also encourages Federal funding for the Global Polio \nEradication Initiative for biomedical and basic scientific research so \nmore lifesaving discoveries can be made. Thanks to the work of \nscientists funded by the CDC and nonprofit organizations such as the \nBill and Melinda Gates Foundation, polio has been eradicated in all but \na handful of the world's poorest nations.\n  The success of the polio vaccine shows us what medical research can \naccomplish. If we can do this with polio, then we can do it again.\n  I thank Senators Kirk, Leahy, Shaheen, Murray, Boxer, Coons, Markey, \nIsakson, Ayotte, and Reed of Rhode Island for cosponsoring my \nresolution.\n  I also thank the March of Dimes, the American Academy of Pediatrics, \nthe U.N. Foundation's Shot@Life campaign, the Rotary Club, and RESULTS \nfor supporting this resolution.\n  But today, America's place as world leader in cutting-edge biomedical \nresearch is at risk. We no longer invest as we should in basic \nscientific research.\n  From 2003 to 2012, the U.S. investment in the NIH research didn't \neven keep up with inflation, and the number of research grants awarded \nby the National Institutes of Health has declined every year for the \npast 10 years.\n  This is shameful. It is shameful in a great Nation such as the United \nStates, where we have seen achievements such as a polio vaccine, for to \nus walk away from medical research.\n  One decade ago, 30 percent of qualified NIH proposals were funded. \nToday, it is half that--15 percent, the lowest rate in America's modern \nhistory.\n  Dr. Francis Collins, who directs the National Institutes of Health, \ntold me that inadequate funding of basic medical research will cause \nsome of America's best young researchers to take their talents to other \nplaces and even other countries. It has already started.\n  We are on the verge of losing a generation of medical researchers in \nAmerica. In 1982--listen--18 percent of NIH primary investigators, \nmedical researchers, were under the age of 36--1982, 18 percent under \nthe age of 36. Today, 3 percent are under the age of 36. Young \nresearchers have given up.\n  If Congress and the President don't want to put money into the NIH, \nthey are going to go someplace else. How many Jonas Salks are we losing \nbecause of our cuts to basic medical research? How many lifesaving \ndiscoveries are being delayed and ignored? With the right commitment, \nwe can change this.\n  I tried to gather on the floor--during the debate on the budget \nresolution--a dozen different Senators who cosponsored amendments \ncalling for more money for medical research. They were from both sides \nof the aisle: Senator Collins on the Republican side of the aisle, \ninterested in Alzheimer's; Senator Wicker of Mississippi, also \ninterested in medical research.\n  I brought them all together and said: Why don't we cosponsor the same \namendment. We are all trying to reach the same goal. They agreed, and \nit passed unanimously on a voice vote as I hoped it would.\n  This is what we need to do. Dr. Collins spelled this out in clear \nterms. We need to increase the funding in biomedical research by 5 \npercent over inflation every year. Five percent over inflation for 10 \nyears, Dr. Collins tells me, will dramatically change medical research \nin America.\n  Can we afford it? Can we afford a 5-percent real growth in biomedical \nresearch? Think about it for a second. Do you know what that will cost \nus over 10 years--5 percent real growth in biomedical research. It is \ngoing to cost us\n\n[[Page S2189]]\n\n$150 billion. That is a lot of money, isn't it?\n  Do you realize that once every 68 seconds in America someone is \ndiagnosed with Alzheimer's? I didn't believe that when my staff told \nme. I checked it, and it is true. Once every 68 seconds an American is \ndiagnosed with Alzheimer's, and we know what that means: for most of \nthose patients, a steady decline to death, and for their families, the \nheartbreak of losing communication with someone they love and then \ncaring for them in this state of Alzheimer's disease--once every 68 \nseconds.\n  Do you know what it costs us as a government to care for Alzheimer's \nvictims last year, Medicare, Medicaid? We estimate $200 billion.\n  Now, step back, a 5-percent growth in biomedical research over 10 \nyears will cost $150 billion. What if that research could find a way to \ndelay the onset of Alzheimer's for months--maybe for years--and, God \nwilling, find a cure.\n  What I am saying is whether it is Alzheimer's, cancer, heart disease, \ndiabetes, each and every one of these is praying for and depending on \nmedical research to give Americans who are stricken a fighting chance. \nIt is up to us. We have to make that decision.\n  I would take this question to the Iowa caucus, to the New Hampshire \nprimary, any State, any city in the Nation, and ask the crowd that you \nwould assemble, that anyone assembles, what do you think is a high \npriority? Do you think biomedical research by our government is a high \npriority?\n  I know the answer, because every one of us lives in fear that someone \nwe love will be diagnosed with a serious illness. You know the first \nquestions you would ask that doctor: Doctor, is there a medicine, is \nthere a surgery, is there something I can do, something that can be \ndone?\n  And you pray, pray to God, that the doctor says: Yes, we have a new \nmedication in clinical trials at the NIH. It is very promising, and \nthis may be the answer for your son, your daughter, your wife, your \nmother, and your father. That is what this comes down to--real life, \nreal family challenges.\n  The American Cures Act I introduced a couple of years ago sets this 5 \npercent funding goal. I have talked to my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle and asked them to join me. This shouldn't be a Democratic \nidea, not a Republican idea. This is as basic as it gets.\n  The next great scientific and medical breakthroughs will be \ndiscovered by researchers if we fund the research, but it isn't just a \nmatter of biomedical research at the NIH. I had a visit with Department \nof Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, and over breakfast we talked about \nthe American Cures Act.\n  He said: Senator, let me put in a word here. Do you know who develops \nthe technology for diagnostic evaluations--whether it is MRIs, PET \nscans, and things of that nature? Do you know who develops the \ntechnology for the application of radiation therapy for cancer victims? \nA lot of it is done right here at the Department of Energy.\n  He awakened me to the fact that we think about NIH automatically in \nbiomedical research--and we should. There is more to the story.\n  So I have really reached out and said: American Cures Act, 5 percent \nreal growth for biomedical isn't enough. We need 5 percent growth when \nit comes to innovation, the next breakthrough when it comes to \ndiagnosing breast cancer at an early stage, treating cancers with \nradiation, other things. The American Innovation Act would provide an \nannual budget increase of 5 percent for the National Science \nFoundation, the Department of Energy Office of Science, the Department \nof Defense science and technology programs, the National Institute of \nStandards and Technology Scientific and Technical Research, and the \nNASA Science Directorate.\n  You say to yourself, can we afford it? I will say what I know. I know \nthat when we embark on scientific research of real value, it not only \ncan cure disease, in the process it will create a company. It will \ncreate many companies. It could create many jobs in the right fields \nand develop our economy in the right way.\n  We are debating this now on the floor of the Senate. They are not \ndebating it in Beijing. They have decided they are going to pass us. \nThe Chinese have embarked on a medical program in medical research and \nother research, determined--within the next 20 years--to pass the \nUnited States.\n  Will we let that happen? The men and women of the Senate will make \nthat decision, and the men and women of the House and the President.\n  All told, the American Innovations Act would invest $100 billion over \n10 years; the American Cures Act, $150 billion--$250 billion.\n  How much money will we spend on our budget in that 10-year period of \ntime? Somewhere in the range of $18 trillion to $20 trillion. This is a \ntiny, little decimal point, but what a difference it could make.\n  Some of my colleagues talk about burdening our children and \ngrandchildren with debt. I agree. We shouldn't. But the way to reduce \nour deficit and grow our economy is not by killing research and \ninnovation. It pays for itself many times over. We have cut the budget \ndeficit by two-thirds since the start of the recession which we just \nwent through 7 or 8 years ago.\n  Now it is time to close the innovation deficit. In the last years of \nJonas Salk's life, he was searching for an AIDS vaccine. He didn't need \nto do that. His place in history was assured, but Jonas Salk wasn't \ncontent to rest on past achievement. After all, he was an American, and \nwhen his early efforts failed, he was undeterred. Jonas Salk said: \n``You can only fail if you stop too soon.''\n  This is a decisive moment of a historic opportunity for America and \nfor Congress. We must continue to invest in basic science and research \nin order to reap the rewards of decades of work by the best scientific \nand medical minds of the world. The only way we can fail is by stopping \ntoo soon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton).

Mr. President, it has been said that April is the cruelest \nmonth. I think that pretty much captures how Americans feel as tax day \napproaches each year. This year, Americans will spend 114 days working \nto pay their Federal, State, and local taxes. In other words, Americans \nmay have submitted their Federal tax returns or be getting ready to \nsubmit them tonight, but they are still not done working off their \ntaxes. In fact, Americans won't start earning a dollar for themselves \nuntil April 25, almost one-third of the way through the year.\n  Americans spend 6.1 billion hours every year trying to comply with \nthe Tax Code. That is an average of 19 hours for every man, woman, and \nchild in the United States or an average of 76 hours for a family of \nfour. Almost half of small businesses spend more than $5,000 each year \non tax compliance; that is $5,000 on top of their tax bill.\n  Paying taxes is never going to be on the top of Americans' list of \nfavorite activities, but it doesn't have to be the torturous process it \nhas become. The Tax Code takes too much time to comply with, and it \ntakes too much money from hard-working Americans.\n  Comprehensive tax reform is long overdue. Unfortunately, instead of \ntax reform, under the Obama administration Americans have just gotten \nmore taxes. The President's health care law created or raised taxes to \nthe tune of more than $1 trillion over the first decade. Several of \nthose taxes have hit families making less than $250,000 a year, despite \nthe President's campaign pledge not to raise taxes on families making \nless than $250,000.\n  Let's take the ObamaCare medical device tax. Thanks to this tax, \nfamilies are now facing higher prices on lifesaving medical equipment \nsuch as pacemakers and insulin pumps. ObamaCare taxes are also driving \nup prices for families on essential drugs such as EpiPens and asthma \nmedications. Other ObamaCare taxes are costing American families in \nother ways.\n  The ObamaCare employer mandate tax is discouraging employers from \nexpanding and hiring, which means fewer\n\n[[Page S2190]]\n\njobs and opportunities for American workers. Then there is the \nindividual mandate tax that last year began hitting American families \nwithout government-approved insurance. For 2015, the individual mandate \ntax penalty is $325 per person or 2 percent of household income, \nwhichever is greater. In 2016, that tax penalty will rise to $695 per \nperson or 2\\1/2\\ percent of household income, whichever is greater.\n  But that is not all ObamaCare is bringing to tax season. This year, a \nfull half of Americans receiving ObamaCare health insurance subsidies \ndiscovered they have to pay back some or all of their subsidies because \nthey didn't estimate their income correctly. Ultimately, just 4 percent \nof households receiving subsidies had the correct subsidy advanced to \ntheir insurance companies. Unfortunately, the confusion and mistakes \nare par for the course for ObamaCare. The administration apparently \nfinds the law so confusing that it sent out incorrect ObamaCare forms \nto more than 800,000 people. Yet the administration wants us to believe \nObamaCare is somehow working.\n  We need to repeal this broken law and its trillion dollars' worth of \ntaxes, and we need to reform our bloated Tax Code. We need to cut rates \nfor families so that Americans can spend more of the year working for \nthemselves and less of the year working for the Federal Government. We \nneed to cut rates for businesses, both large and small. The U.S. \ncurrently has the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world. \nThat puts American businesses at a huge disadvantage compared to their \nforeign competitors, and American workers suffer the consequences--\nlower wages and fewer opportunities. Reforming both corporate and \nindividual tax rates would go a long way toward making American \nbusinesses more competitive and opening new opportunities and higher \npaying jobs for American workers.\n  Of course, any tax reform measure should include reforms to the IRS. \nFrom mishandled customer service to the Agency's most serious \noffenses--the First Amendment violations involving the deliberate \ntargeting of groups for extra scrutiny based on their political \nbeliefs--this Agency, the IRS, is long overdue for reform.\n  The IRS Commissioner himself, John Koskinen, was quoted in Monday's \nWashington Post as saying: ``We certainly can't afford to have taxpayer \nservice be any worse than it is, although it is hard to imagine it \nbeing much worse than it is.'' That is a quote from the IRS \nCommissioner himself. When even the IRS Commissioner admits the \nAgency's taxpayer services can't get much worse, that is a signal the \nAgency is ripe for reform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/15/senate-section/article/S2190-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRADE PROMOTION AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, before I close, I would like to take a \nmoment to talk about what I think is a bright spot for our economy, and \nthat is bipartisan trade promotion authority. Previous free- and fair-\ntrade agreements have been a boon to the economy, expanding \nopportunities for American workers and giving American farmers, such as \nmany of those I represent in South Dakota, and manufacturers access to \nnew markets for their goods. Nearly every one of those trade agreements \nwas negotiated and enacted using trade promotion authority.\n  The idea behind trade promotion authority is very simple: Congress \nsets negotiating priorities for the administration and requires the \nadministration to consult with Congress during that negotiating \nprocess. In return, Congress promises a simple up-or-down vote on the \nlegislation instead of a lengthy amendment process that could leave the \nfinal agreement looking nothing like what was negotiated. That up-or-\ndown vote is the key. That is what gives our trading partners the \nconfidence to put their best offers on the table, which allows for a \nsuccessful conclusion of negotiations.\n  Trade promotion authority expired in 2007. Republicans have been \ntrying to get it reauthorized ever since. Currently, the administration \nis negotiating two key trade agreements--the Trans-Pacific Partnership \nand the United States-European Union trade agreement--that are unlikely \nto be concluded in the near future unless trade promotion authority is \nfinally renewed. These agreements will expand opportunities for \nAmerican workers and open new markets for American goods. A bipartisan \nreauthorization of trade promotion authority will help bring those \nagreements to a speedy conclusion, and that will be good news for \nAmerican workers and American businesses.\n  The challenges facing our Nation are best solved when Members of both \nparties come together to find solutions for the American people. I look \nforward to continuing to work with my colleagues on trade promotion \nauthority and other issues that will grow our economy, create better \npaying jobs for American workers, and increase the take-home pay of \nmiddle-income families in this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee reported the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015. To \nthe surprise of many people, including me, it was unanimously reported, \nwhich makes me begin to wonder just how much Iran nuclear agreement \nreview there will be in this act.\n  I was an original cosponsor of the Corker-Menendez bill that would \ngive Congress and the American people a voice in what is likely to be \nthe most significant nuclear arms agreement in this decade. I think the \nlikelihood, as we move toward the agreement, as it appears to be \nstructured, is that it won't be able to contain the desire of other \npeople in the neighborhood--and maybe in other places in the world but \ncertainly in the neighborhood--to be just as capable of producing a \nnuclear weapon as we allow Iran to be.\n  Supporting this bill does mean that Congress really gives the \nopportunity for these negotiations to advance, not Congress putting the \nbrakes on these negotiations. Specifically, the bill would give \nCongress the opportunity to review and weigh in on a deal that has \nalready been made. It does appear to prohibit the administration from \nremoving sanctions while Congress reviews and while Congress votes on a \nfinal deal, if that is what Congress decides to do. It doesn't require \nCongress to vote, as I read it, but I look forward to having the people \nwho unanimously voted for this in the Foreign Relations Committee \nexplain how it really does involve the Congress as the Constitution \nwould suggest the Senate would be involved. This does permit removal of \nsanctions only if the Congress passes a joint resolution approving the \nagreement, I have been told.\n  The new bill reported out of committee makes the following changes in \nthe original bill. Under the new bill, the congressional review period \nisn't going to be 60 days, it would be 30 days. The new bill removes \nthe provision requiring the administration to certify to Congress that \nIran is not providing material support to terrorists plotting against \nthe homeland or against U.S. entities.\n  We are continuing to be told: Well, that is a different topic. I \ndon't know why that is a different topic at all. A nuclear-capable Iran \nthat is supporting terrorism is obviously more dangerous than a \nnuclear-capable Iran that is not supporting terrorism. The weapon that \nyou can see being built, the weapon that would compare to weapons we \nmay have built, and other powers, in the past was perhaps not nearly as \ndangerous as the weapon being built that could be used by some \nterrorist.\n  This bill does appear to give Congress the ability to intervene but \nonly to intervene after the parties have made the deal. I am not \nparticularly offended by that. If this were a real treaty, the \nadministration would obviously be negotiating that treaty and then \nwould bring the treaty to the Senate for approval, as the Constitution \nrequires and as has happened over and over again on treaties involving \nnuclear capacity, nuclear ability, nuclear buildup, or nuclear build-\ndown. That is not a new thing for the Senate to deal with, but \napparently nobody in the administration wants this to be this kind of \ntreaty. Now, there is, apparently, a way to weigh in before it is \nimplemented but in a way that I think we are going to have to look at \nvery carefully if and when that legislation comes to the floor.\n\n[[Page S2191]]\n\n  A nuclear-armed Iran, an Iran that is nuclear weapons capable--\nwhether that is in 6 months or 12 months or monitored or unmonitored--\nis a major threat, in my view, to the United States. It is a major \nthreat to our allies in the region. Lifting these sanctions only \nempowers Iran to have more influence in the region. The sanctions did \nbring Iran to the negotiating table, but they have been given a lot of \nbreathing room since these negotiations started a couple of years ago. \nWe wouldn't be negotiating, I don't think, if the sanctions hadn't been \nworking.\n  With what has happened to oil prices, those sanctions would have had \na more dramatic effect on the economy of a country in which we have \nevery reason to believe the population is inclined to be very friendly \ntoward the United States. They are educated, they are capable, and they \nhave long-term ties with many of their family members in this country. \nBut, of course, the population is not in control of the country; the \ncountry is controlled by a small group who has only one view of how the \nworld can work, and, frankly, that small group appears to have only one \nview of what they think about the United States of America. If you \nlisten to the comments the Supreme Leader, the religious leader, makes \nover and over again, that view is dependably negative about our country \nand our people and our system of government and our ability to live \nside by side with each other. So we should be concerned about that.\n  The agreement would allow them to continue to enrich uranium. It \nwould allow them to retain centrifuges, which we said, by the way, we \nwouldn't do. That was a point we wouldn't negotiate away. It would \nallow them to continue to have thousands of centrifuges--something we \nalso said we wouldn't allow them to do. It would allow them to continue \ndeveloping new and better and more sophisticated ways to enrich \nuranium, to weaponize, to have the ability to create a weapon.\n\n  Frankly, it is not even clear what agreement has been agreed to. To \nlisten to our description of the agreement is a very different \ndescription of the framework. There is no agreement, everybody agrees \nto that, but there is supposedly a framework.\n  This framework would build two very different houses. If we listen to \ntheir description of the agreement and we listen to our description of \nthe agreement, we are looking at very different things.\n  This week, for example, the Supreme Leader saw this very differently \nthan the President--the so-called deal--with respect to when the \nsanctions would be removed and what would be happening.\n  President Obama and Secretary Kerry have put a tremendous amount of \neffort into reaching an agreement--in fact, such amount of effort that \nit has been clear from the very start of the negotiations who wanted an \nagreement the most. What hasn't been clear and what isn't clear to me \nis why we are so eager to just check the box and move on here, and \nassume that sometime in the next few years Iran will become a \nfriendlier state and will not want to head in a bad direction. Not only \ndoes it head Iran in a nuclear-weapons direction, but it heads many \nother people in the neighborhood in the direction of wondering if they \nhave this capacity, why wouldn't we want to have this capacity?\n  Most Americans don't believe Iran will stick to a deal. Frankly, I \nhave great questions about that myself.\n  Whether the President likes it or not, this is an international \nagreement with wide-ranging consequences. The Congress and the American \npeople have a role to play here. The Foreign Relations Committee has \nmade a proposal about what that role should be. But it seems to me that \nproposal is still a long way away from the constitutional protection \nthat should be involved when we reach an agreement of this kind, or \nwhen we negotiate a treaty.\n  A number of us sent a letter a few weeks ago which got a lot of \nattention. I thought the reaction to that letter was pretty \ninteresting.\n  The immediate reaction from the Secretary of State was: Well, this \nisn't a treaty, it is just an agreement. The Senate doesn't have to \napprove an agreement. The President would be bound by it, and it would \nbe such a good agreement--according to the Secretary of State--that the \nnext President would want to be bound by it as well.\n  This is a pretty significant moment to decide that we may or may not \nbe bound by what is decided.\n  The Iranian Foreign Minister then was able to give us some sense of \nhis understanding. I think the phrase he said the next day was: We know \ninternational law is what really matters here, not the law of any given \ncountry.\n  I have been all over my State, as many of us have, in the last couple \nof weeks. I don't think there is any courthouse, any coffee shop, or \nany gathering of people in Missouri where they would say: Well, really, \ninternational law is what we care about. We don't care about what the \nConstitution says when we are dealing with other countries.\n  Then 72 hours after that letter was sent, the President's Chief of \nStaff said: Really, the President would probably want to take this to \nthe U.N., but he probably wouldn't want to take it to the U.S. Senate.\n  We will see how this debate goes on the proposal that the Foreign \nAffairs Committee is making, but it clearly does not bode in the \ndirection of a treaty approved by two-thirds of the Members of the U.S. \nSenate. In my view, we are still a long way from a final agreement.\n  There seems to be a lot of disagreement as to what the framework \nmeans. But as we move toward that final agreement, our number one \npriority should be to do everything possible to prohibit Iran--whose \ninfluence in the world and the region is already disproportionate--from \nhaving the capacity to ever have a nuclear weapon. I hope our \nnegotiators continue to keep that in mind, and I hope there is not \nnearly as much disagreement about the final agreement as there is about \nwhat the framework itself says.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, later today, maybe as early as 11 o'clock \nor so, we are going to begin a discussion of the budget. As we know, \nthe budget is a set of national priorities. A budget has to do with our \nvision of where America is and where America should be. We are now in \nthe process of moving the budget to a conference committee between the \nHouse and the Senate.\n  When I think about a budget, I think about a document designed to \naddress the problems facing our country. In that regard, I find the \nRepublican budget that will likely pass to be totally inadequate, and a \nbudget whose priorities are way, way out of place with where the \nAmerican people are.\n  When we talk about the needs of America, the most significant need \nand the most significant economic problem we face is that for 40 years \nthe American middle class has been in decline. Today we have over 40 \nmillion Americans living in poverty, almost more than at any time in \nthe modern history of America. Our real unemployment is not 5\\1/2\\ \npercent; real unemployment is 11 percent. And despite the modest gains \nof the Affordable Care Act, we still have 35 million Americans who have \nno health insurance.\n  While millions of Americans work today longer hours for lower wages \nthan used to be the case, despite a significant increase in \nproductivity, what we are seeing as a nation is an obscene level of \nincome and wealth inequality. That reality speaks to the fact that \nsince the Wall Street crash of 2008, about 99 percent of all new income \ntoday is going to the top 1 percent. I know people find that amazing, \nbut it is true. Which means that no matter what the GDP may be--2 \npercent, 5 percent--it doesn't really matter, because virtually all the \nnew income goes to the top 1 percent.\n  In terms of distribution of wealth, what we are seeing in America \ntoday is worse and more unequal than any major country on Earth, and \nworse in America than at any time since the late 1920s. Today we have \nthe top one-tenth of 1 percent owning more wealth than the bottom 90 \npercent. Unbelievable--the top one-tenth of 1 percent owning more \nwealth than the bottom 90 percent. Today we have one family owning more \nwealth than the bottom 42 percent of the American people--that is, the \nWalton family of Walmart.\n\n[[Page S2192]]\n\n  A recent report came out by Forbes magazine which pointed out--and \nthis is almost beyond belief--that the wealthiest 14 people in this \ncountry, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Koch brothers, others, saw their \nwealth increase between 2013 and 2015, a 2-year period, by $157 \nbillion. That is just an increase in their wealth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SANDERS.

Mr. President, for the last several weeks we have been \ntrying to get unstuck on an important piece of legislation that would \ncombat modern-day slavery.\n  At a time, I think most people were unaware of this phenomenon of sex \ntrafficking primarily of teenaged girls between the ages of 12 and 14. \nI think the country has become much more aware about this scourge, this \ndark side to our culture and our society, and much more interested in \ntrying to figure out what we can do to address it.\n  At a time when we are really beginning to see some true bipartisan \ncooperation and progress here in the Senate--and I say that because of \nthings like the budget we passed last night, which was a very important \npiece of legislation we passed to reform Medicare, particularly to \nimprove access for our seniors to Medicare services performed by \ndoctors and hospitals by making sure they had a predictable and \nsustainable reimbursement rate, and what happened yesterday in the \nForeign Relations Committee, where we had a unanimous vote on \nCongress's prerogative to represent our constituents on having a voice \non the very important negotiations taking place between Tehran and the \nUnited States and our allies on Iran's aspirations for nuclear weapon.\n  Then I think about other things that are happening that are \nencouraging here, after a long period of stagnation and dysfunction \nover the last 2 years. I think we are on the cusp of a breakthrough on \ntrade. Why in the world wouldn't we want to be open to markets when \nbasically 80 percent of the purchasing power of the world and 95 \npercent of the world's population lies outside of our shores? Why \nwouldn't we want to open those markets to our farmers and ranchers and \nour manufacturers--people who grow things and who make things--and \nwouldn't that be great for our economy and job creation?\n  So imagine my surprise when after these past few weeks we have been \nstuck on something that has enjoyed such broad bipartisan support as \ncombating human trafficking. Senator after Senator has come to the \nfloor and talked about this and why we ought to act to do something \nabout it.\n  Just to refresh everyone's memory, what we are trying to do is pass \nthe Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. What it would do is create \na victims compensation fund, in essence, from the fines and the \npenalties assessed against people who are engaging in child pornography \nand other sex-related crimes. In other words, it would address the \ndemand side, and take the money from fines and penalties assessed \nagainst the demand side and use that to help the victims--to help them \nbe rescued, and to help them heal and get on with their lives.\n  This legislation has enjoyed broad support outside of these Chambers. \nMore than 200 different organizations--law enforcement organizations, \nvictims rights organizations, faith-based groups, people who want to \nlend a helping hand to provide beds and a secure place to stay while \npeople heal. Unfortunately, there is just not enough money. There is a \nhuge need across America for the resources this legislation would \nprovide. We estimate, based on historic data, that there could be as \nmuch as $30 million generated from the fines and penalties associated \nwith the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act that would then be \navailable to be granted by the Department of Justice to help these \nvictims.\n  So imagine my surprise when after Senator after Senator on both sides \nof the aisle endorsed this legislation--I think at last count we had 30 \ncosponsors, an almost equal number on the Democratic side as the \nRepublican side. Then this legislation sailed through the Senate \nJudiciary Committee and got the unanimous vote of all Democrats and all \nRepublicans. Then it came to the floor, and at least initially we \nbypassed the traditional procedures to bring legislation to the floor \nbecause all 100 Senators agreed that this was important enough and \nsignificant enough and urgent enough that we needed to act on it \nquickly.\n  So imagine my surprise when, all of a sudden, it was brought to my \nattention that some people objected to a provision in the legislation \nknown as the Hyde amendment, which has been the law of the land for 39 \nyears.\n  To refresh everybody's memory, in the very polarizing debate over \nabortion, this is the one consensus item that has been the law of the \nland for 39 years that Republicans and Democrats have voted for \nrepeatedly. What it says is that no taxpayer dollars can be used to \nfund abortion except in the case of rape or in the case of the mother's \nhealth. Those are basically the exceptions. Do you know what? I cannot \nimagine that those exceptions would not apply in the vast majority of \ncases involving human trafficking because tragically they do involve \nrape, certainly sexual assault of a minor who is incapable by virtue of \ntheir tender age, unable to legally consent, and certainly people who \nare coerced into this sort of activity who do not want to be.\n\n  Notwithstanding the fact that the Hyde amendment itself would provide \nbroad exceptions to provide health care services to the very victims we \nare talking about, some of our colleagues across the aisle said that \nwhat this bill does is it expands the Hyde amendment. The way it does \nit, they claim, is that it now would apply to the fines and penalties \nthat would be assessed on criminals, primarily child pornographers, \nconsumers, purveyors, and other people guilty of various sexual crimes. \nThey claim that is somehow an expansion of the Hyde provision.\n  This is getting more and more baffling because actually last night, \nin an overwhelming vote--I think it was 92 votes in favor of the so-\ncalled doc fix and also funding community health centers and an \nextension of the Children's Health Insurance Program--the very same \nHyde-type provision that was contained in the bill we voted on last \nnight is contained in the amendment we are going to vote on tomorrow on \nthe Senate floor. If this provision is good enough for doctors and \nhospitals, why in the world isn't it good enough for victims of human \nsex trafficking? I think the answer is obvious: It is and it should be.\n  In an effort to try to get us unstuck in order to try to catch a wave \nbased on what we are doing generally here in the Senate--finally being \nproductive and making things work--I have tried to take something that \nvirtually all Democrats have voted for previously and to put that in \nthe bill in order to eliminate their cause for concern. I am not going \nto question at this point whether it is a legitimate complaint. I, \nfrankly, disagree. But let's get on with getting the bill passed and \ngetting something important done.\n  This morning, I heard a familiar argument that was made by the \nDemocratic leader, Senator Reid. The good news is that I have made a \nchange in the legislation that would directly address what the \nDemocratic leader said is their main objection. Here is their \nobjection. I don't agree with it, but here is what it is and here is \nwhat I have done to try to address it. Their claim is that the fines \nand penalties are private dollars, not public dollars, and that \nattaching the Hyde language to those fines and penalties is somehow an \nexpansion of the Hyde provision.\n  As I said, I disagree with that, but what I would ask my colleagues \nto do is look at page 3 of the legislation, lines 3 through 7. What we \nhave done to address their concern is to say that no longer will the \nfines and penalties associated with this fund be directly appropriated \nand paid out in grants to the victims of human trafficking. Instead, \nwhat page 3 of our amendment says--which we will vote on tomorrow, S. \n178--this paragraph is entitled ``Transfers.'' It says:\n\n       In a manner consistent with section 3302(b) of title 31, \n     there shall be transferred to the\n\n[[Page S2193]]\n\n     Fund from the General Fund of the Treasury an amount equal to \n     the amount of the assessments collected under this section, \n     which shall remain available until expended.\n\n  What we tried to do in order to maintain the status quo on the Hyde \namendment is say that the money which will actually be used to help the \nvictims will now come from the general fund. It will be an amount equal \nto the fines and penalties that were going to be available under the \noriginal bill. But because of the objection, because of the stated \nconcern, we are trying to find a way to get unstuck and keep our focus \non these victims and not on some phantom objection based on--again, I \nam not going to reargue here today; I am just going to say we need to \nget this done, and this provision does that.\n  Mr. President, may I ask what the order of business is?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time reserved for the majority under \nmorning business has expired.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \n5 minutes to speak in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I will wrap up.\n  As I have told a number of our colleagues across the aisle who \nbelieve passionately in the importance of this topic, I think this \namendment we will vote on tomorrow addresses their stated concerns. It \ncertainly addresses the concerns stated by the Democratic leader this \nmorning.\n  I would just say that of all the Senators on the other side of the \naisle who agreed to cosponsor this legislation, who previously objected \nto voting on the bill and passing it--I would ask them to please take a \nclose look at that provision. Again, page 3, lines 3 through 7 of my \namendment now would provide that instead of the fines and penalties \nbeing directly appropriated into these programs for grant purposes, \nthat money would come from a general fund of the Treasury in an \nequivalent amount of the fines and penalties. So, money being fungible, \nthere is no loss of funds, but what we have done is we have tried to \naddress their concerns, I think in a way that eliminates them.\n  All the Senators who cosponsored this legislation, for which I am \nvery grateful--Senator Klobuchar, Senator Wyden, Senator Coons, Senator \nUdall, Senator Casey, Senator Feinstein, Senator Gillibrand, Senator \nHeitkamp, Senator Schumer, Senator Blumenthal, Senator Peters, and \nSenator Durbin--I hope all of our Democratic friends who previously \nobjected based on the original provision will take a look at this \nchange because it does directly address their stated concerns.\n  Let's get this done. We will vote on this tomorrow. But I would \nrather not wait for that time. I would rather try to get this done \ntoday if we can. We might be able to do that by agreement if everyone \nagrees that this provision, this change, addresses those stated \nconcerns.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/15/senate-section/article/S2193-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. ENZI.

Mr. President, I ask the Chair to lay before the Senate the \nmessage from the House requesting a conference on S. Con.

Con. Res. 11) entitled ``Concurrent resolution \n     setting forth the congressional budget for the United States \n     Government for fiscal year 2016 and setting forth the \n     appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years 2017 through \n     2025.'', and ask a conference with the Senate on the \n     disagreeing votes of the two Houses thereon.\n       Ordered, That Mr. Tom Price of Georgia, Mr. Rokita, Mr. \n     Diaz-Balart, Mrs. Black, Mr. Moolenaar, Mr. Van Hollen, Mr. \n     Yarmuth, and Ms. Moore be the managers of the conference on \n     the part of the House.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I move to disagree in the House amendment, agree to the \nrequest by the House for a conference, and authorize the Presiding \nOfficer to appoint conferees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is pending.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to make some comments about the \nbudget and the process.\n  Last month, the Senate Budget Committee took an important first step \nin helping to change the way we do business in Washington by reporting \nout a balanced budget. This is crucial as we begin to restore the trust \nof the American people.\n  This week, we will take the next step and start to work on a joint \nbalanced budget resolution with our colleagues in the House that will \nexpand America's economy and increase opportunities for hard-working \nfamilies. A balanced budget approved by Congress will help make the \ngovernment live within its means and set spending limits for our \nNation. A balanced budget will also boost the Nation's economic output \nby more than $500 billion over the next 10 years. That is according to \nthe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n  Why the urgency? Hard-working families are fed up with the \nPresident's spend-now-pay-later policy and are closely following our \nefforts to produce a balanced budget. Senate Democrats could only \nmuster two budgets in 8 years, and we will soon have one after only 4 \nmonths. It is time to show taxpayers that Congress is committed to a \nbalanced budget to make our government more effective and accountable, \nbut we are running out of time.\n  Recent media reports note that the lawmakers in 27 States have passed \napplications for a constitutional convention to approve a balanced \nbudget amendment. I have to add that there are new applications to do \nthat same amendment in nine other States, and they are close behind.\n  Now, if just seven of those nine States approve moving forward on the \nbalanced budget issue, it would bring the number of applications to 34 \nStates. This would mean the two-thirds requirement under Article V of \nthe Constitution would force Congress to take action. It is no wonder \nhard-working taxpayers across the country are feeling anxious.\n  Federal revenues have hit record highs. Yet we are on track to \noverspend by nearly $1 trillion a year. I think we are at the $560 \nbillion level of overspending this year.\n  How much does Congress get to make decisions on? Congress spends \nabout $4 trillion a year, but only gets to make decisions on $1\\1/10\\ \ntrillion. Now, if we overspend by over $500 billion, we are spending \nhalf more than what we take in. No family can exist very long by \nspending half more than they take in year after year after year.\n  We looked at the President's budget and the President increases taxes \nby $2\\1/10\\ trillion and still gets a wider and wider and wider gap of \noverspending as time goes by to that trillion-dollar mark out there in \n10 years.\n  Just this week, headlines around the country reported: ``Budget \nDeficit in U.S. Widens as Spending Exceeds Record Revenue.''\n  On Monday, the Treasury Department reported that spending by the \nFederal Government exceeded its revenue by more than $439 billion from \nOctober through March, which is $26 billion more compared to the same \nperiod last year. In fact, CBO is forecasting that for March our Nation \nspent more than $44 billion, up 19 percent from last year. We are \ngetting more money, and we are spending more money.\n  American taxpayers understand we overspend. The more we overspend, \nthe more debt we owe, and the more debt our children and grandchildren \nwill owe. In fact, we have done this so consistently that it is not \njust our grandchildren and our children who are faced with the crisis, \nit is us as well--everybody in America.\n  I mentioned that we get to make decisions on $1\\1/10\\ trillion \ndollars a year, which is $1,100 billion. If anybody knows how big $1 \nbillion is, they know\n\n[[Page S2194]]\n\nhow big $1,100 billion is. But that is all we get to make decisions on.\n  The amount of interest we paid last year was $235 billion. Interest \ndoesn't buy you a thing, but we spent $235 billion on interest. Now, \nthat is pretty close to 1 percent for the fee for that borrowing. So if \n$235 billion is 1 percent interest, what would the normal 5 percent \ncost? Every single dime we get to make a decision on. That means no \ndefense, no education, no HELP. Everything will be by the wayside just \nso we can pay the interest on our debt. That is why we have to be \nconcerned about the overspending that is happening.\n  American taxpayers understand that the more we overspend, the more \ndebt we owe and the more debt our children and grandchildren owe. If \nthat tax rate goes up, we will soon be responsible for paying off that \ndebt at the expense of everything else America expects. This is why \nRepublicans in Congress are focused on passing a balanced budget that \nwill ensure that Washington will once again live within its means, just \nlike hard-working families do every day.\n  Now, we don't get that balance for 10 years, but it moves toward that \ngoal every year. Ten years is too long. For next year's budget, we are \ngoing to have to figure out better things to do to get it back into a \nframework where our interest will not exceed our expenditures. That is \nthe interest exceeding the expenditures, not the revenue, and again we \nhad a record revenue. That is why we are focused on passing a balanced \nbudget, just like hard-working families do every day.\n  What does the Senate-passed budget do? Well, here is what it does: It \nbalances the budget in 10 years with no tax hikes. It protects our most \nvulnerable citizens. It strengthens the national defense. It improves \njob growth and opportunity for hard-working families. It slows the rate \nof spending growth.\n  Now, it doesn't recede the spending growth, it slows the spending \ngrowth. That is the best we have ever been able to do in Washington. \nWhen we talk about a cut in Washington, what we are talking about is \ngiving them less than what they asked for, not less than what they \nhave.\n  It preserves Social Security by reducing spending in other areas to \nfully offset Social Security's rising deficit and encourages our \nNation's leaders to begin a bipartisan, bicameral discussion on how to \nprotect Social Security and avoid the across-the-board Social Security \nbenefit cuts that will occur later under the law unless we take action, \nbut that is something that has to be done jointly. There would be too \nmuch blame otherwise, and as far as the budget, the reason we have to \npreserve Social Security by reducing spending in other areas to offset \nSocial Security is because we are not allowed to do anything with \nSocial Security in the budget.\n  This budget will also protect our seniors by safeguarding Medicare \nfrom insolvency and extending the life of the Medicare trust fund by 5 \nyears. It ensures Medicare savings in the President's health care law \nand makes sure those savings are dedicated to Medicare. If it comes \nfrom Medicare, it ought to go back to Medicare instead of seeing it go \nto more overspending on new programs that are outside of Medicare.\n  Our balanced budget continues funding for the Children's Health \nInsurance Program and creates a new program based on CHIP to serve low-\nincome, working-age, able-bodied adults and children who are eligible \nfor Medicaid.\n  It increases State flexibility in designing benefits and \nadministering Medicaid Programs to encourage efficiency and reduce \nwasteful spending, and it provides stable and predictable funding so \nlong-term services and support are sustainable both for the Federal \nGovernment and the States.\n  As the Senate and House begin budget negotiations next week, it is \nworth noting that the strong economic growth a balanced budget can \nprovide will serve as the foundation for helping all Americans grow and \nprosper.\n  One of the goals of a Republican balanced budget is to make our \ngovernment more efficient, more effective, and more accountable. If \nCongress does its job, we can have some flexibility and eliminate what \nis not working, starting with the worst first, and then we can \neliminate and streamline what is left.\n  The reason I emphasized ``the worst first'' is because one of the \nthings we talk about constantly is the need to prevent the sequester. \nIn some cases, it is absolutely essential to prevent a sequester, but \nthe sequester should have been done in the efficient way of eliminating \nthe worst first. Instead, there was a memo that went out that said: \nMake it hurt. That should never happen in America. That is why we saw \nsome of the decisions that came down that seemed pretty ridiculous.\n  One of the decisions that affected Wyoming was--I hope everybody will \ncome and see the Grand Tetons--marvelous mountains that look like part \nof the Alps were transplanted over there and made a little bit taller. \nA lot of people like to stop and take pictures there regardless of the \nseason--whether it is snow covered or the aspens are golden in the \nforeground or whether everything is lush and green, and, of course, you \nsee wildlife all through that valley. Naturally, people like to stop \nand take pictures.\n  Well, a bunch of signs were printed up that said you cannot use the \nturnouts. A bunch of barricades were bought so you could not pull onto \nthe turnout, and the sign said it would be illegal to park along the \nhighway.\n  Where did the money come from for the barricades? Where did the money \ncome for the signs that said we could not use the parking lots to take \npictures? Well, I called to find out whose brilliant idea that was and \nwhy parking lots would be closed, and I was told that there would not \nbe any garbage pickup. I suggested they just remove the garbage cans.\n  When people in Wyoming and across the Nation visit a national park, \nthey can haul their garbage another 20 miles before they throw it out. \nThat way the beautiful vista could still be photographed instead of \npeople still parking along the highways to take those pictures and then \ngetting ticketed. That is just one small example of cutting the most \nimportant first instead of the worst first. I am sure there are \nexamples in every State.\n  It didn't just happen with facilities like that. The people at Head \nStart came to see me and said they got a 7.5-percent cut in the \nsequester. It was supposed to be 2.3 percent.\n  How did it get to 7.5 percent? After checking into it, it appears the \nWashington bureaucracy decided to keep more than their share of the \nmoney instead giving it to the kids across America who were supposed to \nhave it. It did get restored, but the discouraging part was that when I \nasked the people who talked to me before how things were going, they \nsaid: Well, we got the extra money, but in order to meet the employer \nrequirements in Wyoming for ObamaCare, we had to spend all of that \nmoney, so none of the kids happened to go back to Head Start. That was \nvery disappointing. That is not the way to run a government and it is \nnot the way to run a business. It should never have happened.\n  We need a budget that can eliminate waste and streamline what is left \nand start with the worst first.\n  Of course, another of my suggestions is that we have a biannual \nbudget. Mr. President, $1,100 billion is too much money to look at in 1 \nyear. Twelve bills to allocate that money to the different agencies are \ntoo many bills for us to handle in 1 year, particularly if they are \ngoing to get scrutiny.\n  I suggested we write the number of bills that we do and separate them \ninto two packages of six and that we do the six tough ones right after \nthe election, because we have a little more appetite for doing them \nthen, and the six easy ones just before an election. Then we would be \nable to get all 12 of them and be able to scrutinize all 12 of them.\n  Why is that important? Well, in going through this budget process--\nand like I said, I only had about 8 weeks to start to put the budget \ntogether--one of the things I discovered was that we have a whole bunch \nof programs that are out of authorization. The ability to spend for \nthem has expired, but that doesn't stop us from spending on them. It \nshould at least constrain us a little bit.\n  Some of those programs go back to 1983. They expired in 1983, 1987, \nand on up to the present day. How many of them? Two hundred and sixty \nprograms. There were 260 programs that we haven't looked at to see if \nwe ought to continue to spend money on them or\n\n[[Page S2195]]\n\nif we ought to revise how we have been spending the money. If they have \nexpired--most of them had been in existence for 6 years before they \nexpired, and in those 6 years, we should have been able to find if \nthere were any flaws or changes. Hopefully, there was somebody who was \nlooking out for it and found some efficiencies that helped with the \nspending.\n\n  So there were 260 programs. Do we know how much that amounts to that \nwe are still spending and there is no authority to spend? It is $293 \nbillion a year. That is a year. Usually, when we talk about the budget \nwe are talking about over 10 years. So that would only be $29 billion a \nyear if it were over 10 years, but it is not. It is $293 billion a year \nof expired authorizations, expired permissions to spend money. We have \nto get that corrected as well.\n  One of the ways we can do that is through a biennial budget, so that \nwe are looking at half of them in a year instead of everything the \ngovernment does every year. The dollars have gotten so big that we \ncan't get through them efficiently, effectively, and scrutinizing them \nas good accounting in a year.\n  There is one exception on that, which is that we look at defense \nevery year. Defense is the most important constitutional requirement \ngiven to this body. So we would continue to do that each year. \nIncidentally, defense is the one authorization that is not out of \nauthorization, and that is because we do it every year. I don't know \nhow many decades we have done the authorization--the permission for \nspending--for defense.\n  Another troubling situation I discovered through this process was \nthat there are some items that are not authorized that were in defense \nthat we are spending money on anyway. I get comments from the people on \nthe committee that looks over defense saying: How can they spend that \nmoney when we just did an authorization that said no, that is not one \nof the authorized items? So there are some problems we need to \ndefinitely work on with budgets. That is what we have done while \nputting this budget together, in trying to eliminate some of the \ninconsistencies we have, but we have not touched that $293 billion in \nunauthorized spending.\n  So when people say we need more money for the nondefense items, I \nwant them to take a look at that $293 billion and see if they can't \nfind $29 billion, $90 billion, whatever, out of $293 billion that they \nthink might be more effectively spent in a different way.\n  I know when I came to Congress there were 119 preschool children's \nprograms. Everybody has ideas for preschool programs, and they are good \nideas. We know that if we teach kids better before they go to school, \nthey do better in school, there are fewer dropouts, there is less \ncrime, and the whole world is better.\n  There were 119 programs. Senator Kennedy and I worked on that, and we \ngot it down to 69 programs. The ones we got rid of are the ones that \nwere under our jurisdiction. So that left a whole bunch more. In the \nmeantime, I have been able to work that down to 35 programs. And in the \nchild care grant program last year, I got an amendment passed--it was \none of 14 amendments that we considered--which required that those 35 \ngo down to just 5 and that all 5 be put under 1 department. I am hoping \nthat is what the administration is doing. That would save enough money \nto fund the truly preschool education programs really well, and that is \nwhat we need to do. There is a lot of money right there.\n  So if Congress does its job, we can have some flexibility and \neliminate what isn't working, starting with the worst first, and then \nwe can eliminate waste and streamline what is left. But to do this, \nfirst, Congress must do what it has not done in the past 8 years. It \nhas to scrutinize every dollar for which they have a responsibility. If \ngovernment programs are not delivering results, they should be \nimproved, and if they are not needed, they should be eliminated. It is \ntime to prioritize and demand results from our government programs. \nWhen these programs are reauthorized, I am hoping there is a matrix in \nthere that says this is what we plan to do and this is how we will know \nif we got it done. Then we will have an easy evaluation of whether they \nare getting their job done. That is mostly what happens in the private \nsector, and it is an efficient way of doing it in the public sector as \nwell.\n  I have made enough speeches about efficiency in government that I had \nsomeone come up to me and say: I hate to say this, but the job I am \ndoing isn't worth having anybody do. He said: I am reluctant to mention \nit because if they eliminate that job, I am probably fired. Well, I \ntook his suggestion, and I spoke to the right people and that job got \neliminated, and he got promoted. That is what has to happen. We have to \ntake the people who are innovative in government, who are figuring out \nways to do things better and more efficiently and more effectively and \nmove them into the positions where they can really do the job.\n  So that is what I am counting on. In the coming weeks, hard-working \ntaxpayers will get to see something they have not had the chance to \nexperience in the last 8 years, and that is an open and transparent \nlegislative process. We are starting that process today with the \nappointment of the conferees for the conference committees, and we will \nhave amendments this afternoon. Members of Congress from both the House \nand the Senate will come together as part of the Senate-House budget \ncommittee to create a balanced budget that will boost our Nation's \neconomic output and help restore the promise of a government that is \nmore effective and that will put more people to work.\n  A balanced budget will allow Americans to spend more time working \nhard to grow their businesses or to advance their jobs, instead of \nworrying about taxes and inefficient and ineffective regulations. Most \nimportantly, it means every American who wants to find a good-paying \njob and a fulfilling career has the opportunity to do just that.\n  I look forward to joining my colleagues in both the Senate and the \nHouse--Republicans and Democrats--as we take this next step to deliver \na government that is more accountable to each and every American.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me applaud Senator Enzi and his staff \nfor their very hard work.\n  I certainly agree with Senator Enzi that we need a government that is \naccountable, that we need to get rid of waste in government, and that \nwe need to get rid of duplicative programs. I don't think there is any \ndebate on that. I look forward to working with Senator Enzi and others \nto make that happen. However, the Republican budget is far, far more \nthan that.\n  Today, I rise in strong opposition to the motion to go to conference \non the budget resolution.\n  The budget resolution the Senate passed on March 27 moves this \ncountry in exactly the wrong direction, and the House budget \nresolution, in many respects, is even worse. The Federal budget is more \nthan just a long list of numbers, although God knows there is a long \nlist of numbers in the budget. The Federal budget is about our national \npriorities and about our values. It is about how we assess the problems \nfacing our country, of which there are many--and I am not sure Senator \nEnzi would disagree with me if I laid it out--and how we go forward in \naddressing the problems on which there is a fundamental divide. That is \nwhat the Senate is now dealing with. What are the problems facing our \ncountry and how do we move forward?\n  Let me begin by saying that despite the modest gains of the \nAffordable Care Act, there remain in this country 35 million Americans \nwho have no health insurance. That means that when they get sick, they \nmay not be able to go to the doctor or they may end up going to the \nemergency room at very high cost.\n  I have spoken with doctors all over this country who tell me that \nwhen people don't have health insurance, because they delay going to \nthe doctor, sometimes by the time they go into the doctor's office, it \nis too late. The doctor says: Why didn't you come in here 6 months ago \nwhen you noticed your symptoms? And they say: I don't have any health \ninsurance; I couldn't afford it. So we are losing tens of thousands of \npeople every single year who die--die--or become much sicker than they \nshould be because they don't have health insurance.\n  The United States remains the only major country on Earth that \ndoesn't\n\n[[Page S2196]]\n\nguarantee health care to all people. Thirty-five million Americans have \nno health insurance. What is the Republican solution to this problem? \nWell, it is a brilliant idea. They are going to end the Affordable Care \nAct and make $440 billion worth of cuts to Medicaid, which will result \nin 27 million Americans losing their health insurance on top of the 35 \nmillion we already have uninsured.\n  I know the newspapers are not particularly interested in it. We won't \nsee it on network TV. That is the reality. They don't deny it. There \nare 16 million people covered by the Affordable Care Act who would lose \ntheir health insurance because this bill ends it. Then, a $440 billion \ncut to Medicaid, and another 11 million gone. Sixteen plus 11 is 27 \nmillion Americans. What is the idea? What happens to those people? How \nmany of them die? How many of them suffer? It is not an issue for them. \nThey are working on something. They have been working on something for \nabout 15 years for health care. If it hasn't happened in 16 years, it \nisn't going to happen.\n  That is what is in this budget.\n  This budget denies over 2.3 million young adults the right to stay on \ntheir parents' health insurance plan until the age of 26. We used to \nhave this absurd situation. My wife and I have health insurance to \ncover our kids, but when they turn 18, they are not on our plan. It is \ngone. Right now, young people are on the plan until they are 26. It is \ngone under this Republican budget.\n  We finally overcame a situation that is so vulgar it is hard to \nimagine that it existed in America, and that is that people who have \nserious illnesses such as cancer, heart disease or diabetes would walk \ninto an insurance office and say: I need insurance. The insurance \ncompany would say: Oh, we can't cover you for your diabetes, your heart \ndisease, your cancer because it is a preexisting condition and we don't \nwant to pay out all of that money if it recurs.\n  Think about that, how crazy that is. What do people want insurance \nfor? They want insurance to cover their needs. If I had breast cancer \nor colon cancer 5 years ago, sure, I want to make sure my insurance \ncompany covers that. It is a preexisting condition. Under the \nAffordable Care Act, we did away with that discrimination. That would \ncome back. So all Americans who have serious health illnesses: Know \nthat if what they put into this budget goes into effect, insurance \ncompanies can reject you.\n  Not only has this Republican budget ended the Affordable Care Act and \nmade $440 billion in cuts to Medicaid, it would also increase \nprescription drug prices for 4 million seniors and persons with \ndisabilities who are on Medicare Part D by reopening the doughnut hole. \nThat means that at a time when senior poverty is increasing and so many \nseniors in Vermont--I speak to them all the time and I suspect it is \nthe same in Wyoming or maybe not--are saying: I am living on $13,000, \n$14,000 a year; I have to heat my home in the winter--if you live in \nVermont, you do--I have to buy food; I have to pay for medicine; I \ncan't do it all. So we closed the so-called doughnut hole, which means \nthat seniors would not have to pay out-of-pocket for their prescription \ndrugs. The Republican budget reopens the hole. All over this country, \nseniors will be paying more for their prescription drugs.\n  The Republican budget not only undertakes a vast attack on health \ncare in this country, which will decimate life for millions of people, \nbut then on another issue of great consequence, education, it is \nequally bad.\n  A couple of months ago in my State of Vermont I held three townhall \nmeetings at colleges and universities in the State to talk to young \npeople about the cost of college and about student debt. In Vermont--\nand I suspect in the other 49 States as well--we have families who are \nstruggling to afford to send their kids to college, and then we have \nothers who are leaving college terribly deep in debt. Just yesterday, I \nwas flying here from Burlington, VT, and I sat next to a woman who said \nher six kids went to college and graduate school, and all of them are \ndeeply in debt.\n  So clearly, what a sensible budget does is two things. It says, \nfirst, how do we make college affordable so that young people will be \nable to get a higher education; and second of all, when they graduate, \nhow do we lower student debt, which is today so oppressive?\n  The Republican budget does exactly the opposite. What the Republican \nbudget does is cut $90 billion over 10 years in Pell grants. Pell \ngrants are the major Federal program making it possible for low-income \nand working-class families to get grants to go to college. This would \nincrease the cost of college education to more than 8 million \nAmericans. Think about it. Our job is to lower the cost of college; \nthis budget increases it.\n  At a time when working-class families in Vermont and all over this \ncountry are having a hard time finding good quality, affordable \npreschool childcare, the Republican budget makes significant cuts in \nHead Start which means that 110,000 fewer children would be able to \nenroll in that program. Under the Republican budget, 1.9 million fewer \nstudents would receive the academic health they need to succeed in \nschool by cutting about $12 billion in cuts to the title I education \nprogram. Dropout rates in low-income communities all over this country \nfor high school kids are atrocious. The Republican budget cuts \nsignificantly the funding that we put into public schools in low-income \ncommunities.\n  At a time when the middle class is disappearing and we have more \npeople living in poverty today than at almost any time in modern \nAmerican history, today there are millions of families who are \nstruggling to put food on the table. I know maybe on Capitol Hill \npeople don't know that, but that is a reality. People are making 9 or \n10 bucks an hour. They have a few kids. They are having a very \ndifficult time affording food--basic nutrition. We have an estimated 40 \nmillion people that are what they call ``food insecure.'' That means \npeople who on any given week, any given month, depending on what is \nhappening, have a hard time feeding their families. The Republican \nbudget would make massive cuts in nutrition programs in this country \nby, among other things, cutting $10 billion to the Women, Infants and \nChildren Program over the next decade.\n  I honestly have a hard time hearing people talk about family values \nand how much they love families and children, and you have a program \nwhich has done a really good job in terms of prenatal care for pregnant \nwoman, making sure they get the health care and the nutrition they \nneed, making sure their babies get the care they need. Who really \nthinks we should cut these programs? What kind of Nation are we or what \nkind of Senate are we that people would vote to cut these programs--not \nto mention massive cuts in the food stamp program.\n  But in the midst of all of these devastating cuts in health care, \neducation, and nutrition that impacts working families, the Republican \nbudget does something else which is quite incredible. And I suspect \nthat people who are listening are saying: Bernie Sanders is being \npartisan; he is not telling the truth; it really can't be this bad. One \nof the problems we have is convincing people this is reality. This is \nreality. This is the Republican budget. I know the media doesn't write \nabout it much, but that is what it is. In addition to making cuts to \nhealth care, nutrition, education, other programs, what else do they \ndo?\n  At a time when the wealthiest 400 Americans--400 Americans--paid a \ntax rate of 16.7 percent in 2012, at a time when hedge fund managers \npay a lower effective tax rate than working families, truckdrivers, and \nnurses, what the Republican budget does based on an amendment they did \nabolishes the estate tax. The estate tax provides a $269 billion tax \nbreak. For whom? For the middle class? Good. Low-income people? That is \ngreat. Not so. This repeal of the estate tax applies to the \nwealthiest--not 1 percent, but the top two-tenths of 1 percent. \nRepublicans passed a tax proposal which impacts the top two-tenths of 1 \npercent and leaves nothing for 99.8 percent of Americans. Cut \neducation, cut health care, cut nutrition, and give the tax breaks to \nbillionaires. By repealing the estate tax, the average tax breaks for \nmultimillionaires and billionaires would be about $3 million.\n  When you go around Vermont and you go around America, do people say: \nHey, what we really need, what our\n\n[[Page S2197]]\n\nmajor priority is, is not to feed the hungry, not to make college \naffordable, not to create jobs, but to give a tax break to \nbillionaires? That is in their budget.\n  Not only do they give a huge tax break to the wealthy--what else do \nthey do? They raise taxes on low-income and working families--folks who \ndo not make a whole lot of campaign contributions. What the Republican \nbudget does is increase taxes by not extending the benefits we put into \nthe earned income tax credit and the child tax credit. It allows those \nadditional benefits to expire, which means that low-income and \nmoderate-income families will pay more in taxes.\n  In fact, we estimate that tax hike for low-income and middle-income \nfamilies will be about $900 apiece for more than 13 million families. \nRaise taxes to low- and moderate-income families and lower taxes for \nbillionaires. Anybody believe those are the priorities that should be \nin a budget for the American people?\n  I will have more to say about this budget later. But the Republican \nbudget does not address the significant problems facing America: how we \ncreate the millions of jobs we need, how we raise the minimum wage to a \nliving wage, how we address pay equity so women workers don't make 78 \ncents on the dollar compared to men, how we rebuild our crumbling \ninfrastructure. It doesn't address any of those issues. But what it \ndoes is make a bad situation worse. I would hope that my colleagues \nwould have the courage to stand up to Wall Street, to stand up to the \nbig money interests, and start defending the working families of this \ncountry and vote no on this resolution.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, as part of this discussion, I want to \nmention something that was very significant that happened last night. \nIt happened after the press went to bed, I think, but a very important \nthing, and that is a thing called the doc fix passed. The SGR passed \nthis body last night in a very bipartisan way, after a series of \namendments that were open floor amendments. That is what is supposed to \nhappen around here.\n  One of the reasons I mention that is, I have always said if you can't \nsee a doctor, you don't have insurance at all. With the way we have \nbeen setting up Medicare payments for doctors, we have been driving \nthem out of the profession. We have been eliminating doctors. We have \nbeen having doctors tell their kids don't become a doctor, because of \nwhat Congress is doing, holding them hostage every 6 months. That got \ntaken care of last night.\n  I don't know, we have been doing that for, I think, about 18 years, \njust 1 fix at a time. So it is nice that we are finally able to make \nthat permanent.\n  I mentioned that was Medicare. This is the first budget the \nRepublicans have gotten to participate in in many years, but the \nDemocrats got to work on the health care bill, and that was part of \ntheir budget. In fact, it was part of the reconciliation in the budget, \nwhich is a special way of passing something without 60 votes. In that \nbudget they took $714 billion from Medicare, and they didn't put it \ninto Medicare. There were just some comments about how the budget I \nworked on has a little over $400 million of Medicare savings. That \nMedicare savings is what the President suggested should be done in \nMedicare savings, and we put that Medicare savings back into Medicare. \nThat is the only way you can save the fund.\n  So we have taken into consideration a lot of these issues. The cost \nof college--I have been through numerous hearings in the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee. I used to be chairman of the \ncommittee and I have been ranking member of the committee, and I \nexpired my time as ranking member on that committee, but we did a lot \nof hearings on the cost of college. Probably the biggest suggestion I \ncan have for people living in the East is send your kids West.\n  I was checking to see why more people couldn't get into community \ncollege on the east coast. I am not talking about the big colleges, \nwhich also have a very big problem on the number of students they can \ntake and are very selective in what they take, but I found out that \nmost of the community colleges were filled out here. Consequently, some \nfor-profit colleges were able to charge considerably more than \ncommunity college and we looked into ways to eliminate that practice. \nOf course, the way it got eliminated, if you did that to the public \ncolleges as well, we would put them out of business. But I would \nmention that it is less expensive for an out-of-State student to go to \nthe University of Wyoming or one of our community colleges than it is \nto get in-State tuition in most of the places in the United States.\n  There was a mention of estate tax. That is a recommendation that was \nput in as a deficit-neutral measure. I am not sure where the raising \nthe taxes on the poor comes from, except for the comment that the \nextensions that we do annually on that weren't in there. There is a \ngood reason why those aren't in there. We have provided a \nreconciliation instruction that would allow for tax reform, although \nthe chairman of the committee said we are going to do that in a \nbipartisan way.\n  We are going to have tax reform that will take care of fairness and \nsimplicity and accountability in our tax system. This is a particularly \nimportant time to talk about that. Today is tax day, and I hope \neverybody in America has or will file their taxes today. I know there \nhas been some difficulty getting through on the lines to be able to \ntalk to the IRS about tax problems, and I want to chastise the IRS a \nlittle bit for that. They are trying to show they need more money, \ninstead of allocating personnel to where they are really needed. If \nthey answer more questions right now, they don't have as many things \nthey have to do later, and they will collect more money than if they \ndon't answer those questions. The proper committee needs to take a look \nat whether they have adequate revenue to do their job, but again, there \nare inefficiencies there. They are talking about needing more money \nbecause when they audit, they are able to get $4 to $6 for every dollar \nthey spend. They should be embarrassed. Public auditors in a company \nexpect to get $15 to $20 per dollar that they audit. They have got to \ncome up with a better selection procedure for who needs to be audited, \nand go after the big bucks. There are a number of things the IRS ought \nto do.\n  When I first came to Washington, I tried to talk to different \nagencies about inefficiencies they had. I was a freshman, so I had a \nlot of time to do some of those things. One of the agencies I wanted to \nlook at as an accountant was the IRS. As a result of some of my \nmeetings at the IRS, we had some hearings here about being taxpayer \nfriendly. People might recall that the people who served as witnesses \nin the past had to be voice-modulated behind screens. That should not \nhappen in America. We should have a tax system that people can comply \nwith without the gestapo kinds of tactics that are sometimes used.\n  So we need to do something to make our tax system more efficient, \nmore accountable, and fairer. I am convinced that Senator Hatch and \nSenator Wyden, the chairman and the ranking member of the committee, \nare going to do some things on taxes, and I think the American people \nwill like it. They are past due. They can end those complications and \nget more accountability, which will make the IRS's job a lot easier and \nalso make it better for hard-working taxpayers in America.\n  So there are a lot of things a budget can do. I am hoping we will do \nthem.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me just pick up on a couple of the \npoints my friend from Wyoming, Senator Enzi, made. The Republicans \noften say, and Senator Enzi said it now, that Democrats cut $714 \nbillion from Medicare. To the best of my knowledge, not one penny \ninvolved in those cuts cut any benefits to the American people.\n  What the Affordable Care Act attempted to do--and maybe we made some \nprogress, as Senator Enzi pointed out, last night with the so-called \ndoc fix--is to make Medicare more efficient. What is wrong with that? \nWhat is wrong with saving money? What the American people want us to do \nis make\n\n[[Page S2198]]\n\nprograms more efficient. In fact, Senator Enzi was talking about that a \nmoment ago. He is right. But the idea, the implication, that those cuts \nresulted in benefit cuts is not accurate.\n  Furthermore, what some of that money--those savings--went to is \nfilling, plugging the doughnut hole so that seniors would not have to \npay money out of their own pockets for prescription drugs.\n  So if you could save money in a bureaucracy--and God knows the U.S. \nhealth care system is the most wasteful and bureaucratic of any in the \nworld--if we can make the system more efficient, save money, put that \nmoney into helping seniors afford prescription drugs, what is the \nproblem with that? I do not think so.\n  Senator Enzi talked about the IRS and people having difficulty making \nconnections, which is clearly not right. He is right. He also \nmentioned, quite correctly, that for every dollar we invest in various \nparts of the IRS which do audits, we can make--what was that, $4 to $6? \nI think that is a pretty good investment. Most business people would \nsay: All right, I can get $4 to $6 for every dollar that I invest. \nLet's do it.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Enzi and other Republicans to, \nin fact, do just that. We can argue about the Tax Code, and we will. \nBut I think we don't argue that when people owe it, they should pay it. \nRight. We should change it if we do not like it.\n  So if we can invest a dollar into the IRS and get $6 to $4 back, I \nthink that is a pretty good investment. Senator Enzi was right in \nsaying that last night we passed a pretty good piece of legislation. \nNot perfect by any means. I had some serious concerns about it. I voted \nfor it. One of the reasons I voted for it is it extended for another 2 \nyears a program that I worked very hard on--that is, the Federally \nQualified Community Health Center Program which is playing a huge role \nin providing health care and dental care and low-cost prescriptions \ndrugs and mental health counseling to many millions of Americans in all \nof our 50 States. We got a significant increase. I fought very hard for \na significant increase in that program as part of the Affordable Care \nAct that was going to expire.\n  As a result of yesterday's legislation, in addition to the doc fix, \nwe have extended--and I see Senator Blunt here, who has been active in \nthat as well--we were able to extend for another 2 years funding for \nthe Community Health Center Program, something that I think was \nimportant.\n  Senator Enzi was right. I think that is a step forward. But that \nshould not be confused with the budget. The Republican budget is an \nunmitigated disaster--tax breaks for billionaires, cuts in programs \nthat Americans desperately need, raising taxes for low-income working \nfamilies.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield back all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to disagree in the House \namendment, agree to the request by the House for a conference, and \nauthorize the Presiding Officer to appoint conferees.\n  Mr. TESTER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n              150th Anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's Death\n\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, today we honor the 150th anniversary of \nAbraham Lincoln's death. We all know the tragic story: On the evening \nof April 14, 1865, the 4-year anniversary of the beginning of the Civil \nWar and just days after its end at Appomattox, President Lincoln was \nshot while attending the theater. The next morning, his last, labored \nbreathing ceased.\n  His fanatically unreconciled assassin was enraged by Lincoln's \nachievements: his saving of the Union; his emancipation of the slaves; \nhis forecast that the freed slaves would soon be voting; his \nrededication of the Nation to the Declaration and to the Constitution \nin which it is embodied. Lincoln lived for these things, and he also \ndied for them.\n  Days earlier Lincoln's assassin, in attendance at the second \ninaugural, had ignored the reelected President's eloquent plea ``to \nfinish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds,'' doing so \n``with malice toward none, with charity for all.''\n  A year-and-a-half earlier, dedicating the cemetery at Gettysburg, \nLincoln had said that ``history would little note nor long remember'' \nwhat he said. Here he was wrong--or at least falsely modest--for the \nGettysburg Address is among the most beautiful and memorable speeches \nin history. He called upon us to ``be here dedicated to the great task \nremaining before us,'' and ``that government of the people, by the \npeople, and for the people shall not perish from the earth.''\n  His words call upon us still to take ``increased devotion'' from \nthose at Gettysburg and every war since who gave ``the last full \nmeasure of devotion.'' Soon he would be among those honored dead, the \nfinal and most poignant casualty in the same war, and his death is \nanother reason for us to renew our devotion to our great country.\n  We should think, then, about Lincoln's message, which is like the \nmessage of our Nation. On the question of equality, Lincoln was as \nprecise as a mathematician and as lyrical as a poet.\n  Of equality and slavery, he said:\n\n       As I would not be a slave, so I would not be a master. This \n     expresses my idea of democracy. Whatever differs from this, \n     to the extent of the difference, is no democracy.\n\n  Of equality and the Declaration, Lincoln said:\n\n       I think the authors of that notable instrument intended to \n     include all men, but they did not intend to declare all men \n     equal in all respects. They did not mean to say that we are \n     all equal in color, size, intellect, moral developments, or \n     social capacity. They defined with tolerable distinctness, in \n     what respects they did consider all men created equal--equal \n     in ``certain inalienable rights, among which are life, \n     liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.'' This they said, and \n     this they meant.\n\n  Now put these propositions together. We are unequal in most respects, \nbut\n\n[[Page S2199]]\n\nwe are equal in our rights. We own ourselves, and no one else may own \nus. We own the government, and the government does not own us. We are \nentitled to our lives with the talents that God gave us. Any form of \ngovernment that interferes with these rights is wrong.\n  But in the world today are rogue nations that are growing in strength \nand violate these principles. They constitute a menace to our freedom \nand to civilization itself.\n  At home, our government grows ever greater in its size, in its reach, \nand in its expense. The law is flouted increasingly by high authority. \nAnd our people say with increasing intensity that they mistrust and \neven fear their government. It may be for the people, but it is less \nand less ``of and by'' the people.\n  On this 150th anniversary of Lincoln's death, let us be here reminded \nand dedicated to that cause for which Lincoln himself gave the last \nfull measure of devotion. Let us dedicate ourselves, in Lincoln's \nwords, ``to finish the work we are in,'' so that we ``may achieve and \ncherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all \nnations.''\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/15/senate-section/article/S2199-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send to the desk my motion to instruct \nconferees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Sanders] moves that the \n     managers on the part of the Senate at the conference on the \n     disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the House amendment to \n     the resolution S. Con. Res. 11 be instructed to insist that \n     the final conference report include a deficit-neutral reserve \n     fund for legislation related to retirement benefits, which \n     may not include legislation cutting benefits under the old-\n     age, survivors, and disability insurance program established \n     under title II of the Social Security Act, increasing the \n     retirement age, or privatizing the old-age, survivors, and \n     disability insurance program.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, I happen to \nbelieve the Republican budget we will be discussing today moves us in \nexactly the wrong direction. At a time when the middle class is in \ndecline and the gap between the very rich and everybody else is growing \nwider, what the Republican budget does is make ferocious attacks on \nprograms desperately depended upon by working families while at the \nsame time providing outrageous tax breaks to the very wealthiest of the \nwealthy. That makes no sense to me at all.\n  One area where the Republican budget is negligent--one of many areas \nwhere the Republican budget is negligent--is in the issue of Social \nSecurity. Social Security is perhaps the most important and successful \nFederal program that was ever initiated. It is life and death to \nmillions of seniors and people with disabilities in this country, and \nit has a history of enormous success. Before Social Security was \nestablished, about half of the seniors in this country lived in \npoverty. Today, while too high, that number is somewhere around 10 \npercent.\n  Unfortunately, in recent years what we have seen is an increase in \nsenior poverty. We have seen many seniors struggling to pay their \nbills, to heat their homes, and to buy the medicine they need. It seems \nto me that in this moment, not only should we not be talking about \ncutting Social Security, as many of our Republican colleagues are, we \nshould be talking about expanding Social Security benefits. I have \nintroduced legislation to do just that. But today I rise to bring forth \nlegislation--bring forth a motion to instruct the budget conferees to \ninclude a deficit-neutral reserve fund to protect retirement benefits \nby not cutting Social Security benefits, by not raising the retirement \nage, and by not privatizing Social Security. So in essence, what this \nmotion to instruct says is that we go on record as Members of the U.S. \nSenate that we will not cut Social Security benefits, that we will not \nraise the retirement age, and that we will not privatize Social \nSecurity.\n  At a time of massive wealth and income inequality, when 99 percent of \nall of the new income generated in this country is going to the top 1 \npercent and when over half of the American people have less than \n$10,000 in savings, the last thing any Member of the Senate should be \nthinking about is cutting Social Security. Today, the average Social \nSecurity benefit is just $1,328 a month--not a lot of money.\n  Now, 20 percent of senior citizens are living on an average income of \njust $7,600 a year. Frankly, I don't know how anybody lives on an \nincome of $7,600 a year. I don't know how you buy food. I don't know \nhow you buy the medicine you need, how you take care of your basic \nneeds. But that is the reality. More than one-third of our senior \ncitizens rely on Social Security for virtually all of their income. In \nother words, Social Security for them--more than a third--is not just a \nsmall part of their total income, it is virtually all of their income. \nTwo-thirds of American seniors depend on Social Security for more than \nhalf of their income.\n  The reality is, despite some of the rhetoric we hear around here or \nsee on TV, we do not have a Social Security crisis. America has a \nretirement crisis. Given this reality, our job is to expand Social \nSecurity benefits, not cut them.\n  I have been distressed that in three out of the four major Budget \nCommittee hearings held this year, Republicans invited witnesses who \ntestified in support of cutting Social Security. John Engler, the head \nof the Business Roundtable, representing the CEOs of some of the \nlargest corporations and Wall Street banks in this country, was one of \nthe Republican witnesses. Mr. Engler and the Business Roundtable are \nthe leaders of corporate America. These are the guys who make millions \nof dollars a year in salary. These are the guys who have huge \nretirement benefits. They are asking Congress to cut Social Security \nCOLAs for senior citizens and disabled veterans and to raise the \nretirement age to 70 years of age.\n\n  Imagine that. People who are multimillionaires and have huge \nretirement benefits are coming to Capitol Hill and telling Members of \nCongress to cut Social Security. It turns out, in fact, that the CEOs \nof the Business Roundtable have retirement benefits of their own of \nsome $88,000 a month. So we have the heads of large corporations who \nhave retirement benefits of $88,000 a month--$1 million a year--and \nthey are telling the Congress to cut benefits for people who are trying \nto survive on $14,000 a year. That is an outrage.\n  I am getting a little bit tired of being lectured by CEOs of large \ncorporations who want to cut the Social Security benefits of elderly \npeople. That is wrong.\n  I am also tired of hearing folks on TV say that Social Security is \ngoing broke. Well, the truth is Social Security is not going broke. \nSocial Security has a $2.8 trillion surplus and could pay out every \nbenefit owed to every eligible American for the next 18 years. Now, is \n18 years a terribly long time? No, it is it not. Should we develop \nlegislation to extend Social Security for decades after those 18 years? \nYes, we should, and I have done that. But, please, I hope that my \ncolleagues will not stand up here and tell us that Social Security is \ngoing broke because it is not.\n  I believe the American people feel very strongly that in these \ndifficult times Social Security is a major safety net for so many of \nthe elderly and disabled. When we vote tonight, our job is to send a \nvery, very clear message that the Senate is not going to cut Social \nSecurity, it is not going to privatize Social Security, and it is not \ngoing to raise the age at which people get those Social Security \nbenefits.\n  With that, I yield the floor for the Senator from Hawaii.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n[[Page S2200]]\n\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee, the Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                           Motion to Instruct\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \nmotion and call up my motion to instruct, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the motion.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Schatz moves that the managers \n     on the part of the Senate at the conference on the \n     disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the House amendment \n     to the resolution S. Con. Res. 11 be instructed to insist \n     that the final conference report include the deficit-\n     neutral reserve fund relating to ensuring all legally \n     married same-sex spouses have equal access to the Social \n     Security and veterans' benefits they have earned and \n     receive equal treatment under the law pursuant to the \n     Constitution of the United States in the concurrent \n     resolution as agreed to by the Senate.\n\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, 3 weeks ago, the Senate held an important \nvote on an amendment to the budget resolution, and 56 of our \ncolleagues, including 11 Republicans, joined me in affirming the need \nfor legislation to ensure that all legally married spouses, including \ngay couples, have access to Social Security and VA benefits that their \nfamilies have earned.\n  This amendment passed with bipartisan support because it is \nfundamentally about fairness.\n  Imagine a veteran who served his country for decades fighting for \nequality and freedom around the world and he gets married in a State \nthat allows gay marriage. If he is permanently disabled from his \nservice, his spouse is eligible for veterans' spousal benefits. They \nhave earned these benefits. But if they move or if they drive over the \nborder from Florida into Georgia, for example, they lose those \nbenefits. The same scenario applies to our seniors and their right to \nSocial Security spousal benefits.\n  Why does this happen? Simply because the Federal right to these \nbenefits happens to be defined in law with respect to the State of \nresidence rather than the State of celebration of the marriage. In \nother words, eligibility for these Federal benefits is based on where \nyou live, not where you were married. So we have one Federal right and \ntwo unequal outcomes based on the person's residence. This is the \ndefinition of unequal treatment under the law.\n  No one is denying that Americans earned their Social Security and \nveterans' benefits regardless of whether they are gay or straight. And \nsince the Supreme Court's decision in the Windsor case struck down \nparts of the Defense of Marriage Act, no one can deny that the Federal \nGovernment is required to recognize all legal marriages.\n  For almost all Federal agencies, this went into effect right away. \nGay married couples can now file joint taxes. In legal proceedings \nbefore the Federal Government same-sex spouses are given the same legal \nrights as all other spouses. Under the Family and Medical Leave Act, an \nemployee can now take leave to care for a same-sex spouse. These are \njust a few of the ways that the Federal Government brought its policies \ninto line with the law.\n  The Social Security Administration and the VA, however, are tripped \nup by an old wording in their authorizing statutes. Working together, \nwe can fix this. We can pass legislation to ensure that all legally \nmarried couples receive equal treatment under the law regardless of \nwhere they live. The amendment that the Senate voted to include in the \nbudget affirms the need for this legislation.\n  Allowing unequal treatment under the law goes against American \nvalues, and it goes against our Constitution. Equality under Federal \nlaws should not end when you cross State lines. We are not debating \nwhether gay marriage should be legal in all 50 States. That question is \ncurrently in front of the Supreme Court. We are debating whether a \nFederal right should be afforded to all Americans regardless of where \nthey live.\n  For those who are concerned with preserving States' rights, I \nunderstand that perspective, but we should all support fixing the \nstatutes governing Social Security and veterans' benefits. Fixing these \nstatutes does not impact State law whatsoever. In contrast, by not \nfixing these statutes, the Federal Government is ignoring the laws of \nStates that allow gay marriage. It actually does harm to States' rights \nto allow this situation to continue.\n  This is not an ideological proposal, and I should point out that the \nSenator from Washington, Patty Murray, and the Senator from New \nHampshire, Jeanne Shaheen--this was originally their idea. First, \nSenator Murray provided this as a piece of legislation on the Social \nSecurity side, and Jeanne Shaheen, likewise, presented this on the VA \nside. We worked together during the so-called vote-arama to merge these \nproposals into one because the same principle applies for both Federal \nbenefits, which is that equal protection under the law should not \ndepend on which of the 50 States an American citizen resides in. This \nis about treating veterans, disabled Americans, and our seniors \nequally, no matter where they live or what their sexual orientation may \nbe.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I yield time to the Senator from Ohio, \nMr. Brown.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont and also \nthe senior Senator from Wyoming for their work.\n\n\n                           Motion to Instruct\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending motion be set \naside and that my motion be sent to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing none, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the motion.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Brown]  moves that the managers \n     on the part of the Senate at the conference on the \n     disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the House amendment \n     to the resolution S. Con. Res. 11 be instructed to insist \n     that the final conference report include the deficit-\n     neutral reserve fund relating to ending ``Too Big To \n     Fail'' bailouts for Wall Street mega-banks with over \n     $500,000,000,000 in total assets, as set forth in \n     amendment 994 to S. Con. Res. 11 (as agreed to by the \n     Senate).\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, this amendment, about which I asked to \ninstruct the conferees, passed by a voice vote, and I appreciate the \nacceptance of it by Senator Enzi and Senator Sanders during the vote 2 \nweeks ago. We know too big to fail is still with us. We know that it is \nreally all about those megabanks that are over $500 billion in total \nassets. That is what my amendment speaks to.\n  In the 6\\1/2\\ years since Wall Street pushed our economy to the brink \nof collapse, the biggest banks have gotten, as we know, bigger.\n  Think about this statistic. Just 18 years ago, the 6 largest banks in \nthe United States had assets equal to 18 percent of our Nation's gross \ndomestic product. Today, the 6 largest banks have assets equal to 63 \npercent of our GDP, with an average of more than 5,000 legal entities \noperating in 57 countries.\n  These institutions are not just massive, too big to fail in terms of \nsize. They are risky and complex. In many ways they are too big to \nfail, they are too big to manage, as we have seen from the mistakes \nthey have made, and they are too big in many ways to regulate.\n  If a financial institution is too big to understand, then it is \nprobably too complex to manage and too opaque to regulate. Dodd-Frank \nrequires large banks to produce an annual living will explaining the \nbank's plan for its own rapid and orderly resolution through the \nbankruptcy process in the event of material financial distress or \nfailure.\n  Last year, the largest 11 banks--all 11 of them--were informed that \ntheir living wills were insufficient. In other words, it was not clear \nto the regulators that these 11 banks would know how to go through \nresolution. That means they failed to show that their collapse would \nnot cause devastating harm to our economy as a whole. It raises this \nquestion: What happens if one of these banks fails?\n  Today, I urge the Senate to instruct budget negotiators to create a \ndeficit-neutral reserve fund to ensure that the largest Wall Street \nmegabanks can be put through bankruptcy or resolution\n\n[[Page S2201]]\n\nwithout a taxpayer bailout. This is the amendment that Senator Vitter, \nmy Republican colleague from Louisiana, and I spoke out about, and it \nwas passed unanimously in the Senate a couple of weeks ago.\n  Congress should act on the remedies provided in the law for any bank \nthat cannot produce a credible living will this year. We need to end \nthe cycle that enables large, unsafe banks to enjoy government \nbailouts. The public is cynical about these too-big-to-fail banks. The \npublic does not believe they are not too big to fail, if you will.\n  The cycle that allows Wall Street to pile up private profits while \nforcing American taxpayers to be ready and willing to pick up the tab \nfor their losses and failures is outrageously bad public policy. The \nAmerican people don't want Congress to wait until we are faced with \nanother crisis. Congress needs to take action now to prevent future \neconomic collapse and future taxpayer-funded bailouts.\n  As Senator Shelby, the senior Republican who sits on the banking \ncommittee with me, told the Senate banking committee last month, if a \nbank is too big to fail, it is it probably too big to exist.\n  This motion to instruct will put the Senate on record that the \nAmerican taxpayer should never ever again be on the hook for risks \ntaken by megabanks.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote yes.\n\n\n                            Paid Sick Leave\n\n  Mr. President, for too many Americans, a sick day means a day without \npay. Each day workers across the country face impossible dilemmas. Do \nthey go into work knowing the risks to their own health and to others \naround them or do they stay home and lose a paycheck? Do they send a \nsick child to school, knowing they are risking the health of their \ndaughter and her entire classroom or do they jeopardize their job by \ntaking a day off? This is a choice too many families face, and it needs \nto end.\n  Guaranteeing paid sick and family leave to all Americans would \nprotect public health and increase economic security for millions of \nfamilies.\n  In the 20th century, unions fought for workers' rights to \ncollectively bargain--and often one of the protections they were \nbargaining for was paid sick leave. But after decades of attacks on our \nlabor movement and on our middle class, most Americans are not \nprotected by unions. Too often they have no protection if they have to \nmiss work because of their own illness or that of their child.\n  43 million workers--including 2 million Ohioans--currently have no \npaid sick leave. Workers earning the lowest wages are the least likely \nto have paid sick days and are often unable to afford to take a day off \nwhen they or their children get sick.\n  Not only does this affect their own health, but these workers are \noften working in service jobs where they risk infecting others. They \nare often caring for seniors or children or working in stores, hotels, \nor restaurants where they risk food contamination.\n  Adults without paid sick days are 1\\1/2\\ times more likely than \nadults with paid sick days to report going to work with a contagious \nillness, according to the National Partnership for Women and Families. \nThat's why the National Partnership for Women and Families and more \nthan 100 employers support this legislation. And so do many business \nowners, who realize that healthy workers are often more productive \nworkers.\n  But too many do not, and that is why I urge my colleagues to pass the \nHealthy Families Act. This legislation would end the agonizing choice \nfaced by families by allowing workers to earn up to 7 days per year in \npaid sick time.\n  This plan is good for both workers and businesses. Employers already \nproviding sick time would not have to change their policies as long as \nthey meet the minimum requirements and businesses with fewer than 15 \nemployees would be exempt.\n  We know that when workers are healthy, they are more productive, and \nproviding sick days decreases turnover and gives employers safer, \nhealthier, and more stable workplaces. Paid sick leave will also save \nprecious health care resources.\n  When workers go in sick, they can spread illnesses like the flu, and \nthey increase the risk of workplace injury. The American Journal of \nPublic Health found that the lack of paid sick days contributed to an \nadditional 5 million cases of H1N1 during the 2009 pandemic.\n  The Institute for Women's Policy Research found that paid sick days \ncould decrease emergency room visits by 1.3 million each year, saving \nthe country $1 billion in health costs. And most importantly, \nguaranteeing paid sick leave will give families the peace of mind that \nthey can protect their jobs, their families, and their health. That is \nwhy it is far past time for us to finally guarantee paid sick leave for \nall of our workers.\n  My colleagues have all seen and heard me talk about my canary pin.\n  Our duty to protect our workers continues and our work is not yet \nfinished. To truly embody the spirit of this pin, we must extend paid \nsick leave to all Americans--not just those lucky enough to be \nrepresented by a union or wealthy enough to have a high-wage job with \nprotections.\n  No parent in America today should have to choose between a paycheck \nand a sick child.

Mr. President, 2 years ago today, the people of Boston \ncame face-to-face with terror at the finish line for the Boston \nMarathon. The cowardly attack and its aftermath took four lives, \ninjured many more, and forever changed the lives of the survivors and \ntheir families.\n  In the face of this horrific terrorist attack, Boston responded with \ncourage and community. Our heroic first responders acted swiftly and \ntheir bravery saved many lives.\n  In the days, weeks, and months after the marathon, families and \nfriends came together to lift each other up, to raise the spirit of our \ncity, and to help us heal.\n  Now, 2 years later, Boston continues to move forward together. A jury \njust reached a verdict that is another step toward justice for victims \nand for their families. The strength and perseverance of survivors \ncontinues to inspire us, and our community works to keep alive the \nmemories of Krystle Campbell, Lu Lingzi, Martin Richard, and Sean \nCollier.\n\n[[Page S2202]]\n\n  Recently, Mayor Marty Walsh announced the city of Boston will now \nrecognize April 15 as One Boston Day. One Boston Day is a chance to \nhonor the victims and survivors of the marathon bombing and an \nopportunity for people to give back to the community through acts of \nservice. This day helps us remember that in the face of tragedy and \nviolence, our community responds with an open heart.\n  Next Monday, tens of thousands of people from across the Nation and \naround the world, once again, will come to Massachusetts for the 2015 \nBoston Marathon. Our Commonwealth, once again, will commemorate \nPatriots' Day with reenactments, baseball, parades, and celebrations.\n  Today, as we mark One Boston Day and the second anniversary of the \nattack at the Boston Marathon, we recall the spirit of strength and \nresilience that brought our city and our Commonwealth together, the \nsame spirit of strength and resilience that helps us heal.\n  As a tribute to honor the victims and survivors of the attack at the \n2013 Boston Marathon, I ask my colleagues to join Bostonians in a \nmoment of silence at 2:49 p.m. today.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I would like to join Senator Warren and \nthe rest of the Senate in observing a moment of silence in honor of the \nvictims of the Boston Marathon bombings.\n  The people of the United States will always remember the victims of \nthe previous acts of terrorism that have occurred in the United States \nand will always stand together as one people. Two years ago today, \nthree innocent people were killed and hundreds injured in two bombings \nthat occurred during the running of the 117th Boston Marathon. On the \nhappiest day in Boston, Patriots' Day, two bombs detonated by the two \nevil men took lives, limbs, and livelihoods away. That day, we lost \nMartin Richard, an 8-year-old boy from Dorchester; Krystle Campbell, \nfrom Arlington; and Lu Lingzi, who came to the United States from \nChina; and 232 innocent people were also wounded in the bombings.\n  In the aftermath of the attacks, Officer Sean Collier, of the \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology police force, was assassinated by \nthe two twisted individuals who bombed our city. Officer Collier wasn't \njust protecting the best and the brightest minds, he was the best and \nbrightest, an impressive and loved officer who has been greatly missed \non campus and in our community.\n  I want to express my deepest thanks to all of the men and women in \nlaw enforcement in Massachusetts and around the Nation for their \nunwavering determination, courage, and resolve to bring to justice \nthose responsible for the Boston Marathon bombings. We were ``Boston \nStrong'' because we were Boston ready, with the best training and \npersonnel available to save lives and to seek justice.\n  Many others responded decisively: the citizens of the Commonwealth of \nMassachusetts, fire and rescue workers, caregivers, Armed Forces, and \nthousands more who, through their many expressions of care and \ncompassion, brought forth comfort, hope, and the promise of recovery.\n  Today, under the leadership of Mayor Marty Walsh, the city of Boston \nis turning April 15 into a new tradition, honoring the resilience, \ngenerosity, and strength called One Boston Day. As Mayor Walsh said, \n``It's a day everyone should come together, spread goodwill throughout \nthe city and recommit ourselves to our deepest values.''\n  Mayor Walsh is right. This is a day for the citizens, businesses, and \norganizations in the city of Boston to display their humanity and draw \nneighbors together.\n  Thank you, Mayor Walsh, for helping all of us understand that the \ncompassion and support we all felt that day should never be forgotten \nbut instead should be a part of our lives every single day.\n  May the light of One Boston Day shine as an example of how our Nation \nresponds to times of crisis.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nobserve a moment of silence in honor of the victims of the Boston \nMarathon bombings.\n  (Moment of silence.)\n  Mr. ENZI.

I send to the desk my motion to instruct conferees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending motion?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the motion.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Sanders] moves that the \n     managers on the part of the Senate at the conference on \n     the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the House \n     amendment to the resolution S. Con. Res. 11 be instructed \n     to insist that the final conference report include the \n     provision in the concurrent resolution as agreed to by the \n     Senate that provides for the establishment of a deficit-\n     neutral reserve fund related to strengthening the United \n     States Postal Service by establishing a moratorium to \n     protect mail processing plants, reinstating overnight \n     delivery standards, protecting rural service, allowing the \n     Postal Service to innovate and adapt to compete in a \n     digital age, or improving the financial condition of the \n     Postal Service.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I move to instruct conferees on S. Con. \nRes. 11, a concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2016, to \ninclude in the conference report the provision in the concurrent \nresolution as passed by the Senate establishing a deficit-neutral \nreserve fund related to strengthening the U.S. Postal Service by \nestablishing a moratorium to protect mail processing plants, \nreinstating overnight delivery standards, and protecting rural \nservices.\n  During the so-called vote-arama, that amendment passed by voice vote. \nThis time I hope we can get a strong rollcall vote on it because it is \nterribly important that we tell the Postmaster General of the United \nStates that the U.S. Senate wants a strong and vibrant U.S. Postal \nService.\n  What we are saying to the Postmaster General of the United States is \npretty simple; that is, do not destroy up to 15,000 middle-class jobs, \ndo not shut down up to 82 mail processing plants, stop slowing down \nmail service delivery in this country. Speed it up by reinstating \nstrong overnight delivery standards for first-class mail.\n  I do not know about Arizona and I don't know about Wyoming, but I can \ntell you that in Vermont we have gotten a significant number of \ncomplaints from people who are upset by the slowdown of mail delivery \nstandards. It is, to my mind, just unacceptable, and what we are saying \nnow and will have to say in the months to come is you can't shut down \nanother 82 processing plants, you cannot continue with these inadequate \nmail delivery standards, and it has to change. The American people and \nthe business community are entitled to know that when they put a letter \nor document in the mail, it is going to get delivered in a prompt way. \nToday, that, sadly, is not the case.\n  For over 230 years and enshrined in our Constitution, the Postal \nService has played an enormously important role for the people of our \ncountry and for our economy, and that mission today remains as \nimportant as it has ever been. The beauty of the Postal Service is that \nit provides universal service 6 days a week to every corner of our \ncountry, no matter how small or how remote. It will deliver mail on \nWall Street and it will deliver mail to a home at the end of a back \nroad in the State of Vermont.\n  The U.S. Postal Service supports, through its efforts, millions of \njobs in virtually every sector of our economy. It provides decent-\npaying union jobs to some 500,000 Americans and, by the way, is the \nlargest employer of veterans in this country.\n  Whether you are an elderly woman living on a dirt road in a rural \narea or you are a wealthy CEO executive on\n\n[[Page S2203]]\n\nPark Avenue, you get your mail delivered 6 days a week, and the \nAmerican people pay for this service at a cost which is far less than \nany place else in the industrialized world. In other words, we get a \npretty good bargain when we put a stamp on an envelope.\n  Unfortunately, despite the success and popularity of the Postal \nService, it is under constant attack and has been under constant attack \nfor years, including from those who would like to privatize the Postal \nService and ultimately destroy it. Let's be clear. The same people who \nare attacking the Postal Service are often the same people who are \nattacking Social Security, Medicare, and so forth, and they essentially \nwant to move to the privatization of virtually every major public \ninstitution in this country.\n  Today, the U.S. Postal Service is in the process of shutting down up \nto 82 mail processing plants and eliminating up to 15,000 decent-paying \njobs. This is in addition to the 141 mail processing facilities that \nwere closed between 2012 and 2013. In January, the Postal Service ended \novernight delivery for first-class mail. It didn't get a whole lot of \nattention, but it happened.\n  The purpose of this motion is to put the Senate on record in strong \nopposition to these plant closings and to demand that the Postal \nService reinstate strong overnight delivery standards and not destroy \ngood-paying jobs.\n  We have been told that all of these horrendous cuts are necessary \nbecause the Postal Service is experiencing terrible financial problems. \nThey are losing money every single year. Well, the truth is somewhat \ndifferent. The major reason the Postal Service is in tough financial \nshape today is not because of email or the Internet, the major reason \nthe Postal Service is hurting financially is because of a mandate \nsigned into law by President Bush in December of 2006, during a \nlameduck session of Congress that forces the Postal Service to prefund \n75 years of future retiree health benefits over a 10-year period. No \nother government agency or business in America is burdened with a \nmandate anywhere close to what the Postal Service has to expend, which \nis $5.5 billion a year. So the main point is that when you see articles \ntelling you the Postal Service is having financial problems, the main \nreason--the overwhelming reason--is this necessity to prefund 75 years \nof future retiring health benefits over a 10-year period at about $5.5 \nbillion a year. In fact, all--A-L-L--all of the so-called financial \nlosses posted by the Postal Service since October 2012 are due to this \nprefunding mandate. That is it. Without that mandate, they would be \nmaking a modest amount of money.\n  We don't hear much about it, but I think it is very important for the \nAmerican people to understand the reality of the finances in the Postal \nService. Excluding the prefunding mandate, the Postal Service has \nactually made a $1.8 billion profit. So it is a modestly profitable \noperation excluding the $5.5 billion prefunding mandate.\n  Revenue at the Postal Service has been increasing in recent years. At \na time when Postal Service revenue is going up, it makes no sense to \neliminate thousands of jobs and slow down the mail service that \nmillions of Americans rely on.\n  We should be working to strengthen the Postal Service and not to send \nit into a death spiral. Before this prefunding mandate was signed into \nlaw, the Postal Service was also profitable. In fact, from 2003 to \n2006, the Postal Service made a combined profit of more than $5 \nbillion.\n  I think there is broad bipartisan support, especially from Senators \nwho come from rural areas and who understand just how important the \nPostal Service is to the people of our States.\n  Once again, when offered as an amendment at the vote-arama, this \npassed by voice vote. We are going to ask for a rollcall vote when the \nvoting takes place. I hope we win this vote with a very strong vote and \nsend a message to the Postal Service that we want our Postal Service to \nprovide the quality mail service the American people deserve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, that passed by a voice vote, which is \nconsidered unanimous around here. You cannot get more unanimous than \nthat. I am hoping that out of the 10 to 13 votes we are going to have \nthis afternoon, that some can be done on voice votes. I do not think \nthere is anybody who disagrees with what the Senator has said about \nclosing the postal plants and the extra time it is taking for \ndeliveries. You can add to that how little money it saves because the \nemployees who are in one town, even though their job got moved \nsomewhere else, still have to be retained in that town at some job. It \ndoes not amount to much in the way of savings, but it really hurts in \nthe way of efficiency, delivery, and trust in the post office.\n  So I think we will all be behind you on that one again. I hope that \nby the time we get to that, it will be a voice vote again.\n\n\n                           Motion to Instruct\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \nmotion and call up Senator Burr's motion, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the motion.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Enzi], for Mr. Burr,  moves \n     that the managers on the part of the Senate at the \n     conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on \n     the House amendment to the resolution S. Con. Res. 11 be \n     instructed to insist that the final conference report \n     include a provision relating to addressing student loan \n     debt, which may include reducing overlapping student loan \n     repayment programs and creating a simplified income-driven \n     student loan repayment option, as included in section 358 \n     of S. Con. Res. 11, as agreed to by the Senate.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I would mention that this is a side-by-side to Senator \nWarren's amendment. I am hoping that at the time we vote, we can do 1 \nminute on each side so they have a chance for their explanation.\n  I now yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                       Trade Promotion Authority\n\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the need for the \nSenate to pass trade promotion authority legislation. It is no secret \nthat trade matters in the ability of the United States and our \nbusinesses here to sell goods to foreign markets and to buy what we \nneed from abroad to keep our businesses humming along right here at \nhome and to keep Americans employed. This is paramount to our Nation's \nprosperity. You do not need to be an economist to see it. Anyone who \nowns an iPhone, drives a foreign car, or shops at Costco--everyone \nunderstands even in a small way that trade is beneficial to American \ncompanies and to customers alike. Likewise, American farmers and \nmanufacturers and service providers want and need to sell their corn, \ncotton, beef, tractors, furniture, airplanes, their businesses and \nfinancial services to customers around the world who want and need \nthem. Sadly, not all countries see it that way, and they throw up \nbarriers to American goods and services. They do not want them entering \ntheir countries. That is why passing trade promotion authority is so \nimportant.\n  Increasing free trade levels the playing field for U.S. companies. It \nincreases competition. It increases access to foreign markets.\n  According to the Office of U.S. Trade Representative, the United \nStates is the world's largest economy, the largest importer, and the \nlargest exporter of goods and services. In 2014, figures from the \nInternational Trade Administration show that the United States exported \na record $2.35 trillion in goods and services.\n  For those of us who represent border States, this issue hits close to \nhome. In recent years, Mexico has been America's third largest trading \npartner and our second largest export market. According to the Arizona-\nMexico Commission, Arizona ports of entry are gateways to $41.6 billion \nin U.S.-Mexican trade annually, of which nearly $16 billion is \nattributed to Arizona's own trade with Mexico.\n  Simply put, without trade promotion authority, the United States \nwould be forced to stand on the sidelines as other countries move \nforward with their own trade agreements. Without renewing fast-track \nauthority, there is little chance of a successful resolution of the \nongoing negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP. This \nagreement will allow American companies to do business more freely with \nsome of the world's fastest growing economies.\n\n[[Page S2204]]\n\n  As the Washington Post editorial put it this week, ``To this boon to \nthe U.S. and world economies, add the fact that TPP would ensure that \nthe Pacific Rim plays by U.S.-style rules and regulations rather than \nChina's neo-mercantilist rules, and you have a compelling case for \nswift approval.'' I agree. But unless we pass trade promotion authority \nlegislation, it will be difficult for the United States to become part \nof this vital partnership.\n  I am proud to continue to voice my support for free trade. I look \nforward to the Senate giving trade promotion authority careful \nconsideration in the coming weeks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the motion.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski]  moves that the \n     managers on the part of the Senate at the conference on \n     the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the House \n     amendment to the resolution S. Con. Res. 11 be instructed \n     to insist that the final conference report include a \n     provision relating to amending the Equal Pay Act of 1963 \n     to allow for punitive damages, limit the any factor \n     ``other than sex'' exception, and prohibit retaliation \n     against employees who share salary information, as \n     included in amendment 362 to S. Con. Res. 11 (as not \n     agreed to by the Senate).\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to offer a motion to instruct the \nconferees based on a bill that I have offered for the last three \nCongresses; that is, the Paycheck Fairness Act.\n  What does the Paycheck Fairness Act do? It finishes the job that we \nstarted with Lilly Ledbetter. It would, in fact, instruct the conferees \nto make three reforms:\n  No. 1, to advance the cause of making sure that women get equal pay \nfor equal work. It would stop retaliation for sharing pay information. \nOften workers are harassed and humiliated just for asking about \ncoworkers' salaries.\n  No. 2, it would stop employers from using any reason to pay women \nless: Oh, the guys do harder jobs. Women aren't breadwinners. OK, it is \ntime for equal pay for equal work.\n  It would also allow for punitive damages for women who are being \ndiscriminated against when the only deterrent against pay \ndiscrimination is the threat of paying women backpay. Discrimination \ncan be factored into the cost of doing business.\n  Yesterday was Equal Pay Day, something we, unfortunately, commemorate \neach year. It symbolizes that it takes 104 days longer in a year for a \nwoman to earn what a man earned the previous year.\n  What does that mean? It means that for what a man earns in 365 days, \nit takes a woman 469 days to earn the same amount of money--104 days \nmore.\n  We don't commemorate this day with joy but with a call to action. We \nneed to make a change in the Federal lawbooks to finally get equal pay \nin the Federal checkbooks.\n  Now, we want this in the budget act because we know this will be an \nimportant way of dealing with a variety of issues. We worked on this \nlegislation for a number of years and, quite frankly, we are \nfrustrated. We are frustrated that time and again we are trying to \nadvance this cause.\n  It started over 50 years ago. In 1963, Lyndon Johnson, moving on the \ncivil rights legislation, thought that equal pay for women would be an \neasy thing to pass. At that time, only 11 percent of mothers were in \nthe workforce. Now, there are over 70 percent of mothers in the \nworkforce.\n  At that time, women were, again, paid 59 cents for every $1 a man \nearned. Well, we passed the Civil Rights Act. Now, 50 years later, we \nare up to 78 cents for every $1 a man earns. So it has taken us 50 \nyears to advance 20 cents.\n  Well, that just doesn't work. The women in America feel sidelined, \nredlined, and pink-slipped for the way they are discriminated against, \nand then they face the harassment and intimidation when they simply ask \nquestions to get the pay they deserve.\n  What we now know, again, is that the facts speak for themselves. \nWomen earn 78 cents for every $1 a man makes. For women close to the \nretirement age, the wage gap increases to almost $14,000 a year. By the \ntime she retires, the average woman has lost almost $400,000 in a \nlifetime of wages.\n  The impact is you get less in Social Security benefits, you have less \nin savings, and you face the grim possibility of poverty. What we also \nknow is that this has a tremendous impact in terms of single mothers.\n  Over the weekend, there was a terrific article in the Washington Post \nsaying if you wanted to eliminate poverty among children, you could \ntake a major step in doing so if you closed the pay parity gap. In \neffect, by paying single women and single mothers equal pay for equal \nwork, you could reduce the poverty rate among children by over 20 \npercent.\n  What a startling fact. Well, the fact is that we have been fighting \nfor this for a long time.\n  I urge the adoption of this amendment. I think it makes important \nfiscal policy, and it is important for the family's checkbook and for \nour checkbook.\n  I wish to close with these remarks. I think it was the day before, in \nthe New York Times. They were talking about how we are essentially \nsubsidizing those people who are paid the minimum wage.\n  Now, my background is that I was a social worker. The Presiding \nOfficer is familiar with that. But when you look at the four major \ncomponents of government subsidies to the poor--Medicaid, TANF, the \nchild care development subsidy, and there is one other thing that I \njust don't recall at this minute--for actually people who are working--\noh, food stamps. Working every single day, they are eligible for \ngovernment subsidies because they are not paid enough for what they do.\n  What we often find is that not only is the minimum wage a terrible \nplace to begin, but as you move up the work ladder, often women are in \njobs where they are paid less than the men who work beside them. As a \nresult--and it often is the case--we end, then, by dealing with that by \nour paying for it in Medicaid, in food stamps, and earned income tax \ncredit.\n  Now, I support those programs. I think when people are poor they need \nour help, but our goal is to make sure that if you were poor and you \nwant to have a way to get ahead, we should help you.\n  If you want to be middle class, we should help you get there. One of \nthe ways to do that is to make sure we pay equal pay for equal work.\n  I hope that my amendment is adopted. I could debate this in more \nways, but year after year we come to the floor and we show the \ndisparity between what women make from men for the same job.\n  This isn't just a woman's issue. Many men here support this. I can \ntell you who supports it: fathers. Fathers, fathers, fathers. Why do \nthey support it? They work hard to make sure that in many instances \ntheir daughters get a break, try to get an education, try to get ahead \nonly to find that although they shouldered the same responsibilities \nfor car payments, paying off student loans, and all of that, they, in \nfact, are not paid equal pay for equal work. We can change that by \nvoting for the Mikulski amendment in this budget bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNET. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I am offering this motion on behalf of Senator Murray.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending motion?\n  Without objection, the clerk will report the motion.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Sanders], for Mrs. \n     Murray, moves that the managers on the part of the Senate \n     at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two \n     Houses on the House amendment to the resolution S. Con. \n     Res. 11 be instructed to insist that the final conference \n     report include the deficit-neutral reserve fund for \n     legislation to allow Americans to earn paid sick time in \n     the concurrent resolution as agreed to by the Senate.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, this is a motion to instruct budget \nconferees to keep in the bill the Senate-passed deficit-neutral reserve \nfund for legislation to allow Americans to earn paid sick time. This \nwas an amendment which passed during a vote-arama of the Senate by a \nvote of 61 to 39. So it passed with pretty strong bipartisan support, \nand I would hope we could pass this language again.\n  The truth is, at a time when millions of Americans are working longer \nhours for lower wages, when our middle class continues to decline, we \nalso have another serious problem in that only 53 percent of workers \nreport having paid sick leave. Well, you know, people get sick. That is \na fact of life, and it is unfortunate that only 53 percent of workers \nreport having paid sick leave. This means people are going to work when \nthey are not well. I don't know about you, but I am not enthused about \nwalking into a restaurant where someone who may have the flu or have \nsome other problem is serving food or preparing food. I don't think \nthat is terribly healthy for this country, not to mention that when \nthere are so many contagious illnesses out there, I don't know that we \nwant to have people who are ill and contagious going to work.\n  So this is a very simple motion and basically reiterates what we had \nin the first discussion. Again, it won by 61 to 39.\n  All over this country, States and cities are in the process of \nenacting paid sick leave legislation, and they are seeing economic \nbenefits from that. They have seen mothers more likely to return to \nwork and higher employment in the leisure, hospitality, education, and \nhealth sectors.\n  So, again, this is the same language Senator Murray offered. I \nstrongly support this motion, and I hope my colleagues will vote for \nit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS.

Without objection, the clerk will report the \nmotion.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Sanders], for Mrs. \n     Murray, moves that the managers on the part of the Senate \n     at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two \n     Houses on the House amendment to the resolution S. Con. \n     Res. 11 be instructed to insist that the final conference \n     report include a provision to build on the Bipartisan \n     Budget Act of 2013 and provide sequester relief in 2016 \n     and 2017 by closing tax loopholes.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, this motion is being offered on behalf of \nSenator Murray, and it would instruct budget conferees to build on the \nBipartisan Budget Act and provide sequester relief in 2016 and 2017 by \nclosing tax loopholes.\n  As the ranking member of the Committee on the Budget, I rise today to \noffer a motion to instruct conferees, on behalf of Senator Murray, to \nS. Con. Res. 11, the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal \nyear 2016, to provide 2 years of sequester relief by closing tax \nloopholes. This is a concept, an idea I very strongly support. Many \nMembers on both sides of the aisle are concerned that Congress will not \nbe able to pass and enact appropriations bills at the sequester levels. \nThe President's fiscal year 2016 budget provides sequester relief. \nMoreover, the President has indicated he will veto legislation that \ndoes not lift the sequester caps.\n  Discretionary spending has already been cut by $1.6 trillion, and \nnondefense discretionary spending is currently on track to be the \nlowest in 50 years. Nondefense discretionary spending is on track to be \nthe lowest in 50 years.\n  Instead of continuing to cut nondefense discretionary spending, we \nneed to increase funding for programs, such as education and \ninfrastructure, that reduce income inequality and that create the \nmillions of jobs we so desperately need. We can fund these investments \nby looking at wasteful spending in the Tax Code that has allowed major \ncorporations to pay very little, if anything, in Federal income taxes.\n  Each and every year, we are losing well over $100 billion in revenue \nbecause large, profitable corporations and some of the wealthiest \nAmericans in this country are stashing their profits in the Cayman \nIslands, Bermuda, and other offshore tax havens.\n  Further, the GAO has reported that the effective tax rate of large, \nprofitable corporations is just 12.6 percent--much lower than the 35-\npercent statutory rate because of these tax loopholes. That is much \nlower than what millions of middle-class workers pay to the IRS because \nof the loopholes written into the Tax Code by corporate lobbyists.\n  In 1952, 32 percent of all of the revenue generated in this country \ncame from large corporations. Today, that figure is down to just 11 \npercent. Right now, there are so many loopholes in our Tax Code that it \nends up that many large corporations making billions of dollars in \nprofit pay nothing--zero--in corporate taxes to the Federal Government.\n  As a few examples, General Electric made over $5.8 billion in profits \nin the United States last year but paid just nine-tenths of 1 percent \nof that amount in Federal income taxes. Time Warner made $4.3 billion \nin profits and paid nothing in Federal income taxes; in fact, it got a \nrebate of $26 million. Xerox made $628 million in profits in 2014 and \npaid nothing in Federal income taxes; in fact, it received a tax rebate \nof $16 million.\n  I strongly support this motion which has been introduced by Senator \nMurray to provide sequester relief, particularly for nondefense \ndiscretionary programs, and I would hope very much that this motion to \ninstruct will receive wide bipartisan support.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S2206]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nmotion be set aside so that I may call up my motion, which is at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the motion.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Ms. Stabenow] moves that the \n     managers on the part of the Senate at the conference on \n     the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the House \n     amendment to the resolution S. Con. Res. 11 be instructed \n     to insist that the final conference report not include the \n     Medicare cuts in the concurrent resolution as agreed to by \n     the Senate, which would substantially increase out-of-\n     pocket healthcare expenses for senior citizens, and not \n     include the Medicare cuts in the concurrent resolution as \n     agreed to by the House of Representatives, which would end \n     Medicare as it currently exists by turning it into a \n     voucher-based premium support system and eliminate the \n     guaranteed healthcare benefits earned by the people of the \n     United States.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, my motion would instruct conferees to \nremove from the budget resolution any Medicare cuts that would increase \nout-of-pocket costs for senior citizens, eliminate guaranteed benefits, \nor make structural changes to Medicare by turning it into a voucher-\nbased premium support system.\n  It is incredibly important that something as important as health care \nfor senior citizens and those with disabilities be protected and \nhonored. People are paying into this system. They have paid into this \nsystem their whole lives. They have the confidence of knowing that \nhealth care is available to them, those now on Medicare, and we need to \nmake sure we are strengthening this health care system, not \nfundamentally changing it from a guaranteed system to some kind of a \nvoucher system or making other kinds of changes that will cost people \nmore money.\n  When we began this process, my hope was that we could have a spending \nplan that really would address the middle class and a budget resolution \nthat would make it very clear that this is about giving every American \na fair shot--a fair shot to stay in the middle class or to work hard \nand get into the middle class--that this is really about strengthening \nour country. We don't have an economy without a middle class. It is not \nthe other way around. We don't have an economy without a middle class. \nThat is the economic engine.\n  I was hoping for a budget that would reflect one of our core \nbeliefs--that if you work hard in America, you are going to have a fair \nshot to be able to get ahead. But that is not what this budget is \nabout. Unfortunately, this budget does not do that. Instead, \nRepublicans have written a budget that continues to rig the system for \nthe wealthy and the well-connected rather than creating opportunity for \neverybody to make it.\n  That is really the fundamental fight we have had through this whole \nbudget process. How do we grow the economy? Is it the top down? Do we \ngive to those one more time at the very top and hope that it trickles \ndown and that somehow people who are working hard every day will \nactually feel it and have money in their pockets, or do we focus on the \nmiddle? Do we focus on those working hard to get into the middle class \nand create an opportunity to grow from the bottom up, which is the way \nwe know the economies grow?\n  So I am deeply concerned about the cuts to Medicare in this budget. I \nam also deeply concerned about the other cuts to health care in this \nbudget. We all wish we could control whether we get sick or whether our \nchildren get sick or whether moms and dads get sick, but the reality is \nthat health care is an issue for all of us. It is not a frill; it is a \nnecessity. Medicare has addressed that for seniors and people with \ndisabilities in a way that gives them peace of mind and confidence in a \nquality medical system.\n  We just addressed through a bill last night the whole question of \nmaking sure that doctors are paid and that they are available to people \nwho are on Medicare. We have another part of the health care system \ncalled Medicaid, which is a lifeline to so many Americans who continue \nto feel the effects of the great recession and are struggling for basic \nhealth care needs. In fact, 80 percent of the Medicaid Program \nspending--80 percent of the dollars--goes to seniors in nursing homes \nand in some way impacts all of us--friends, neighbors, relatives.\n  So we are looking at a budget on the Medicaid front--when we combine \nit all, eliminating the Medicaid expansion and having the other cuts in \nthe budget--of a $1.2 trillion cut in the Senate budget. The Senate \nRepublican budget cuts Medicaid health care--80 percent of which goes \nto seniors in nursing homes--by $1.2 trillion. It is even worse in the \nHouse. I worry when we are now looking at going to conference with the \nHouse of Representatives, where their combined cut was $1.7 trillion to \nMedicaid, of which most of the money goes to low-income seniors in \nnursing homes. They would then also turn it into a block grant and cut \nit on top of that, and we don't even know if it would get spent on \nhealth care.\n\n  Unfortunately, this budget, while not really balancing, is attempting \nto be balanced on the backs of the most vulnerable Americans in our \ncountry, and our seniors are taking a huge hit in this budget. The \nHouse cuts all together $316 billion and moves away from the guaranteed \nbenefit to something that has been called vouchers or premium support \nor other structures that don't look like Medicare.\n  In the Senate, all together now, when you add it up and the effects \nof what was done last night, we are looking at a cut of $566 billion.\n  My amendment would stop that $566 billion cut in Medicare or at least \nit would instruct--I should clarify that. I wish it would just \nautomatically stop it, but it would instruct the final conference \ncommittee to not move forward on that $566 billion in Medicare cuts. We \nare talking about Americans who have worked hard all their lives, and \nthey have earned that health care benefit.\n  Let me also say that when we think about a budget that would reflect \nopportunity for everyone to get ahead or one that keeps a system rigged \nagainst the average American, we saw vote after vote where, \nunfortunately, colleagues on the other side of the aisle let \nopportunities slip away to provide real equal pay for women, equal pay \nfor equal work. Yesterday was the day in which women finally made as \nmuch money in 2014 as a man made in 2014. It took the majority of women \nin this country until yesterday to make the same amount of money. We \nhave an opportunity to fix that. The Republican colleagues said no. We \nhad an opportunity to invest in rebuilding America--roads, bridges, \nwater, sewer systems, crumbling infrastructure. Our distinguished \nranking member is a champion on the issue of infrastructure. We had an \nopportunity to create millions of jobs and Republican colleagues said \nno. We had an opportunity to invest in education but instead we saw--\nand we see--a bill that takes away funding for Pell grants that doesn't \nhelp millions of Americans who are struggling to pay back college \nloans.\n  I just left a group of high school students from Brighton, MI, and \nthe question I received was, What are you doing about the cost of \ncollege--and I am worried about the cost of college. I want to do the \nright thing. I want to go to school. They want to do what we are all \nasking them to do to get skills so they can compete in a global \neconomy, be responsible adults.\n  Too many will come out of that college experience with more than \nenough debt to buy a big house, and then they will not be able to buy \nthe house as they dig themselves out of debt.\n  We all know that in this bill, the Republican budget, both in the \nHouse and Senate, repeals the Affordable Care Act--between 16 million \nAmerican people, health care gone, on top of all of the cuts to \nMedicare for senior citizens, senior citizens in nursing homes under \nMedicaid.\n  When we had an opportunity to close tax loopholes, I offered again my \nBring Jobs Home Act to say a company\n\n[[Page S2207]]\n\nshould not be able to move on paper out of this country and avoid \npaying their fair share to contribute to the services of America. They \nstill breathe the air. They still drink the water. They still drive on \nthe roads. They still get the educated workforce. But they move on \npaper, and now they are not a part of those contributing to America. I \ndon't think that is very patriotic, frankly. We had a chance to close \nthat and instead support the middle class, people working hard, \nincrease their earned-income tax credit, and Republican colleagues said \nno.\n  So, unfortunately, we have in front of us a budget that says no to \nopportunity to the majority of Americans and yes to continued policies \nthat, frankly, have not worked because they are focused on the \nprivileged few.\n  If I might take just 1 more minute, I want to put my hat on as \nranking member, former chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee, and \nsay also that as a Member of the Budget Committee and the Agriculture \nCommittee, I strongly urge the leadership in the Senate not to accept \nthe reconciliation instruction related to agriculture and to, \ntherefore, open the farm bill, all of the phases of the farm bill that \nwe worked so hard to get passed in a bipartisan basis.\n  I commend the chairman for not including that reconciliation \ninstruction in the Senate. I very much appreciate that, but the House \ndoes. We have Members on both sides of the aisle deeply concerned about \nreopening what is economic certainty. We have a lot of places that \nthere is not certainty. But in rural America at least we have 5 years \nof economic certainty through the farm bill, and we have nearly 400 \nagricultural organizations led by the American Farm Bureau, food \ngroups, conservation groups, nutrition groups that have asked us not to \nopen the farm bill again in this process. I am very hopeful the \nSenate's position on that will be the position that is maintained.\n  I offer an amendment that we will be voting on Medicare. I think it \nwill be wonderful if we came together and said no to the cuts in \nMedicare and that we would show that we understand what is at stake for \nthat program. Also, I hope we will very clearly indicate that we want \nto stand with rural America and our farmers and make sure they do not \nhave to worry about opening the policies of the farm bill until the 5 \nyears on the farm bill has been completed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield such time as the Senator from Nebraska needs to \noffer two motions. Those will be the last two offered, after which I \nthink both sides are prepared to yield back their time and begin voting \non the 13 different votes which we will be asking consent on when she \nfinishes her speech.\n  I yield time to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as I have indicated on many occasions, I \nthink this Republican budget is, frankly, a disaster. It causes severe \nharm for some of the most vulnerable people in this country. It throws \n27 million people off of health insurance. It forces elderly people to \npay more for prescription drugs. It cuts $90 billion in mandatory Pell \ngrants at a time when young people are struggling to be able to afford \nto go to college. Pell grants are one of the significant ways that they \nare able to go to college; $90 billion is cut. It cuts Head Start \nsignificantly, such that 110,000 fewer young children will be able to \nenroll in Head Start. It cuts title I education program money directed \nto schools with low-income kids, the schools who need help the most.\n  At a time when so many of our families are struggling to put food on \nthe table, this budget cuts nutrition programs, including the WIC \nProgram, by $10 billion. That is the nutrition program that goes to \npregnant women, mothers, and infants. It makes other massive cuts in \nnutrition. It makes cuts in affordable housing. It makes cuts in job \ntraining.\n\n  Now, in the midst of all of this, what it does also, unbelievably, \nwhile wreaking havoc on the lives of millions of working families, it \ndecides that we can afford to give huge tax breaks to the very, very, \nvery wealthiest--the top two-tenths of 1 percent--by abolishing the \nestate tax which would provide $263 billion in tax breaks for the \nwealthiest two-tenths of 1 percent of the American people. But then, \nafter giving huge tax breaks to the very, very, very rich, what it does \nis raise taxes for low-income and working-class families by increasing \ntaxes by $900 apiece for more than 13 million families by allowing the \nexpansion of the earned-income tax credit and the child tax credit to \nexpire.\n  So massive cuts in health care, education, and nutrition for working \nfamilies; huge tax breaks----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for one more \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. As I was saying, huge tax breaks for millionaires and \nbillionaires and then increased taxes for low-income and working \npeople. This is moving the country in exactly the wrong direction.\n  Today, our side of the aisle brought forth 10 separate motions to \ninstruct, which, if passed, would make this budget a much better \ndocument, and I hope very much that both sides of the aisle will \nsupport these motions.\n\n[[Page S2208]]\n\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member for his \ncooperation to date and look forward to working with him on the \nconference committee, along with the Members of the House, both the \nRepublicans and the Democrats. The purpose of that is to make this is a \nbetter budget bill.\n  I will reiterate that I had about 4 weeks to put it together and 4 \nmonths to get it done. We have not done one in 8 years, so it was quite \na challenge. We are getting closer now, and today we will have an \nopportunity to voice some concerns. I am glad we are at this point. I \nlook forward to working with the conferees.\n  I yield back any time.\n\n\n                        Brown Motion to Instruct\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes equally divided prior \nto a vote in relation to the motion offered by the Senator from Ohio \nrelated to Wall Street banks.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, this motion is being offered by Senator \nBrown of Ohio. Our big banks are too big. The largest banks are now 38 \npercent larger than they were before the crisis. In terms of \noutstanding loans, one out of seven Americans is being pursued by a \ndebt collector. U.S. banks are so big that the six largest financial \ninstitutions in this country today have assets of roughly $9.8 \ntrillion, which is equivalent to 60 percent of the Nation's GDP.\n  Being big and powerful is good for the banks and bad for this \ncountry. For example, Bloomberg says the too-big-to-fail subsidy is \nmassive. By being big, they get huge subsidies. It amounts to $83 \nbillion a year, and that is why I support this provision to stop too \nbig to fail.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, this bill is cosponsored by Senator Vitter \nfrom our side. If a big bank fails under the Senator's reform, there is \nnothing that protects the taxpayers from having to save the bank. In \nother words, this approach does not do what many experts believe is \nneeded, which is to expand the bankruptcy laws to permit an orderly \ndisposition to failed banks without taxpayer bailouts.\n  I will note that the specific policies listed are all authorities \nthat exist today in various financial regulatory agencies, and I \nbelieve all Senators support the goal of eliminating the risk of \ntaxpayer bailouts.\n  Having said that, I ask that all the Republicans support this motion \nand offer to take it on a voice vote.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

There is now 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote in relation to the motion to instruct offered \nby the Senator from Vermont relative to postal plant closures.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, in the State of Vermont and I expect all \nover this country, especially in rural areas, what we have seen is a \nsignificant slowdown in mail delivery by the U.S. Postal Service. What \nthis provision is about is the establishment of a deficit-neutral \nreserve fund which establishes a moratorium to prevent the shutting \ndown of up to 82 mail processing plants all across this country. It is \nasking that we reinstate overnight delivery standards, undo what the \nPostal Service has done, that we protect rural services, and that we \nallow the Postal Service to innovate and adapt to compete in a digital \nage.\n  The basic financial problems of the Postal Service are that they have \nto pay $5.5 billion every year in retirement benefits. That program \nalready has $50 billion in its account. Do away with that, and the \nPostal Service will make a modest profit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, there is a huge concern, particularly in \nrural America, about the closing down of the processing centers in \nStates. Our State no longer has a processing center. It takes at least \nan extra day to get the mail.\n  So I would urge my colleagues to accept this motion, and I would ask \nif the sponsor would take it by voice vote.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I have to call for a rollcall vote on this one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  Mr. SANDERS.

Mr. President, I rise to offer a motion to instruct \nconferees that would insist that the final conference report on the \nbudget include a provision to address student loans. This very simple \nmotion to instruct tracks the amendment introduced by me and Senators \nKing, Warner, and Alexander that was included in the budget resolution \nby a voice vote.\n  The Senate has already demonstrated its support by unanimously \npassing this under a voice vote.\n  I yield to my cosponsor, Senator King.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I rise to support this amendment. This \nsimply simplifies the repayment options for students under the present \nstudent loan program, which is, frankly, very confusing--up to nine \ndifferent programs with confusing names and confusing terms. This boils \nit down to two simple ones: a fixed repayment schedule or a variable \nschedule based upon income. I should mention that I see this as an \nimportant stand-alone provision.\n  I am also going to support Senator Warren's amendment on refinancing \nstudent loans.\n  I believe this is an important amendment.

There is now 2 minutes equally divided prior \nto a vote in relation to the motion offered by the Senator from \nMassachusetts relative to student loans.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I support simplifying student loans--the \nmotion that just passed 97 to 0--and I commend Senators King and Burr, \nbut it is not enough. We need to cut the interest rate on student \nloans. The Federal Government should not be making a profit off the \nbacks of our kids who are trying to get an education.\n  This bill is paid for by asking millionaires and billionaires to pay \ntaxes at the same rate as middle-class families.\n  This is a bill which really puts it to the Senate. Are we here to \nwork just for the millionaires and billionaires or are we here to work \nfor young people who are trying to get an education? This Senate works \nall the time for billionaires. Today, I hope we can make it work for \nour students.\n  I urge adoption of this motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote against the \nWarren motion. What the Senator wants to do is to create yet another \nrepayment program, which ultimately ends up costing students more than \nthe income-based repayment. She puts hundreds of billions of private \ndebt on the Federal books and pretends the cost is free. Rather than \nfixing the maze of repayment programs, she adds to it with a new \nprogram that is ultimately less generous than the existing program. \nWhereas the Federal Government income-based repayment program and other \nrelated loan repayment programs will cap payments as a percentage of an \nindividual's income, Senator Warren's legislation would only lower the \ninterest rate on those payments, potentially steering students into \nhigher monthly payments than they face in those other programs. So I \nurge my colleagues to oppose the Warren motion.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  Ms. WARREN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Social Security is arguably the most \nimportant Federal program we have. It is life and death to millions of \nsenior citizens, people who have to figure out how they pay for food, \nhow they heat their homes, how they pay for their medicine. Social \nSecurity is not going broke. It could pay out all benefits for the next \n18 years.\n  What this provision does is make it clear that we go on record to not \ncut Social Security benefits, not raise the\n\n[[Page S2210]]\n\nretirement age, not privatize Social Security. Let's stand with the \nseniors of this country. Let us protect Social Security, not cut it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, under the budget rules we can't do anything \nto Social Security. So this doesn't provide permission or denial of \nanything that we can do at the present time.

Mr. President, I rise to offer a very simple motion to \ninstruct the budget conferees. It encourages the conferees to address \nthe economic and national security threats posed by climate change. \nDuring our consideration of the budget, I offered an amendment that \noutlined these threats and highlighted the need to act. That amendment \npassed the Senate by a 53-to-47 vote. It was supported by both \nRepublicans and Democrats. The same language should be included in the \nfinal budget conference.\n  During the markup, the Budget Committee adopted a complementary \namendment which discussed the importance of climate change initiatives \nin the Department of Defense. The language should be included in the \nfinal budget resolution.\n  Let's make it clear that the Congress plans to respond to the serious \neconomic and national security threats posed by climate change.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote on this motion to instruct.\n  I yield the floor, and I ask for a voice vote.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, we are willing to accept it on a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the motion?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n\n\n                       Fischer Motion to Instruct\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes equally divided prior \nto a vote in relation to the motion offered by the Senator from \nNebraska relative to equal pay.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, this motion takes an important step \nforward by providing necessary updates to current law regarding \nnonretaliation. The change was supported on a bipartisan during our \nrecent budget debate.\n  This motion reinforces current law by banning gender discrimination \nunder both the Equal Pay Act and title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights \nAct. Contrary to the claims of some, both of these laws enable women to \nsue for discrimination.\n  Furthermore, my motion contains language similar to President Obama's \nApril 2014 Executive order stating that employees cannot be punished \nfor exercising their First Amendment rights by speaking with employers \nor coworkers about their wages.\n  I cannot support the motion of the Senator from Maryland. It removes \nmerit pay, which I believe provides women with opportunities to advance \nin their careers, and merit pay recognizes a woman's hard work and her \ncontributions.

Mr. President, I have an alternative and far more \ncomprehensive approach than the Senator from Nebraska just offered. \nAlthough I respect her and her advocacy for women, the Mikulski \namendment in the well would really finish the job we started with Lilly \nLedbetter. Yes, it would deal with the issue of harassment on the job \nif one asks for information, which the Fischer amendment only dealt \nwith. My amendment would go several steps further. No. 2, it would \nprovide punitive damages for women who have been wrongly denied equal \npay for several years. No. 3, it also eliminates the false reasons \npeople give for not paying equal pay for equal work.\n  The Mikulski amendment is more comprehensive, more robust, and will \nreally finish the job and close the loopholes big corporations have had \nfor years. So if my colleagues like the Fischer amendment, they will be \ncrazy about the Mikulski amendment. Go all the way, not just part of \nthe way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Congress, we have to vote on an economy that works for all of our \nfamilies, not just the wealthiest few. Today, 43 million Americans do \nnot have access to paid sick days, and when they are sick, they have to \nchoose between losing money out of their paycheck or toughing it out \nand showing up to work.\n  I was delighted that during our budget debate, a bipartisan \nmajority--61 Senators strong--agreed that Congress should allow workers \nto earn paid sick days. The amendment that just passed is voluntary. It \nwould only benefit a select number of people who work for employers who \nalready do the right thing.\n  This amendment will make sure that we boost worker productivity and \nreduce turnover, which are benefits to both employers and employees. I \nurge my colleagues to vote for this in a strong vote.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. ENZI.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to the \nmotion offered by the Senator from Washington relating to sequestration \nelimination.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, Democrats and Republicans agree that the \nautomatic spending cuts across defense and nondefense investments are \nterrible policy and need to be fixed. The bipartisan Budget Act we \npassed last Congress did exactly that for the past 2 years and offered \nus a template for how we can tackle this challenge in a bipartisan way, \nonce again.\n  We do not need to rely on gimmicks in this budget or the hopes that \nwe will somehow solve this later. We can fix this now in this \nconference. I urge my colleagues to support this vote instructing the \nconferees to roll back sequestration, allow the Appropriations \nCommittee to do their work and not kick this can down the road for all \nof us to address later.\n  I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, there is a difference between how it got \nvoted through last year, which was actually an appropriation rather \nthan a budget. This does raise taxes in order to overcome the \nsequestration. So I am urging a ``no'' vote. We have agreed to have a \nvoice vote on this one.\n  We yield back all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having been yielded back, the \nquestion is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The motion was rejected.\n\n\n                      Stabenow Motion to Instruct\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2\n\n[[Page S2212]]\n\nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to the \nmotion offered by the Senator from Michigan relating to Medicare cuts.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, my motion would instruct conferees to \nremove from the final budget resolution any Medicare cuts that would \nincrease out-of-pocket costs for senior citizens, eliminating \nguaranteed benefits or making structural changes to Medicare by turning \nit into a voucher-based system or premium support system.\n  I think one of our greatest concerns in this budget, among many, is \nthe fact that when you add it all up, there are $566 billion in \nMedicare cuts in this Senate resolution. Shockingly, it is more than \neven the House cuts. I would urge that we stand with people who pay \ninto a health care system that works. They have earned those benefits. \nThey are counting on those benefits.\n  Seniors and people with disabilities across the country need to know \nMedicare is an intact, guaranteed health care system for them.\n  I urge support for my motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am going to urge my colleagues to reject \nthis motion to instruct. I credit Senator Stabenow's instincts to \napproach the question of Medicare seriously. I am sure she knows we all \ntake Medicare's future seriously. There are some problems with Medicare \nthat need to be solved.\n  The budget shows Medicare's rate of growth for an average annual rate \nof 6.4 to 5.5 percent over the next 10 years. Why does the budget \nresolution adopt these numbers? Because Republicans and the President \nagree we must act on policies which extend the life of the Medicare \ntrust fund.\n  The budget does this by adopting the President's goal of extending \nthe life of Medicare's hospital insurance trust fund by at least 5 \nyears. According to the Medicare trustees themselves, the hospital \ninsurance fund could be insolvent as early as 2021, just 6 years from \nnow.\n  Independent actuaries at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid report \nthat over the next 75 years, the Federal Government has promised more \nthan $35 trillion in Medicare benefits. So Republicans joined with the \nPresident in looking to extend the life of the hospital insurance trust \nfund and make the Medicare program sustainable.\n  So I ask that you reject this motion to instruct.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, if I might take just 1 more moment, I do \nnot think I used all my time.\n  I just want to say for the record, the President of the United States \nis not supporting $566 billion in cuts to Medicare.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me today in \nhonoring the world famous Kilgore College Rangerettes on the occasion \nof their 75th anniversary.\n  In an effort to increase female enrollment and to keep fans in their \nseats during halftime at football games, Kilgore College Dean of \nStudents B.E. Masters invited Gussie Nell Davis to create an all-\nwomen's precision dance-and-drill team. On September 19, 1940, the \nRangerettes performed their first halftime show during a Kilgore \nCollege football game.\n  With their signature Western-styled red, white, and blue uniforms and \ncowboy hats, the Kilgore College Rangerettes brought show business to \nthe football field. Their precise and graceful performances captured \nthe hearts of the fans and pioneered a brandnew type of halftime show.\n  The Rangerettes have attained national and international recognition. \nDubbed ``The Sweethearts of the Gridiron,'' the Rangerettes travel \nacross the country performing at high-profile events, including every \nCotton Bowl halftime show since 1951, the 60th Pearl Harbor Memorial \nCommemoration, Presidential inaugural events, and multiple Macy's \nThanksgiving Day Parades. Their fame and prestige have spread across \nthe globe with performances in Venezuela, the millennial St. Patrick's \nDay Parade in Ireland, and a 15-day tour of Romania.\n  The Rangerettes' achievements and honors have been highlighted in \ncover stories in magazines including Life, Newsweek, Esquire, Texas \nMonthly, and Texas 24/7. Additionally, they were featured in the \nCinerama movie ``The Seven Wonders of the World.'' Today, they continue \nto set training and performance standards to which other drill teams \naspire.\n  I am honored to congratulate the Kilgore College Rangerettes on their \n75th anniversary and look forward to their continued tradition of \nexcellence as they perform across Texas, the United States, and the \nworld.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/15/senate-section/article/S2212-3", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2212-S2213]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LYNCH NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Loretta Lynch's nomination to be Attorney \nGeneral has languished on the Senate floor for 48 days. This \nunnecessary wait time is twice as long as the last seven Attorney \nGeneral nominees combined. Under any standard, she is not being treated \nfairly. For nearly 7 weeks, she has waited for her confirmation vote to \nbe scheduled by the majority leader. She has now earned the support to \nbe confirmed, and if the leader would simply schedule her vote, this \neminently qualified prosecutor could get to work as our next Attorney \nGeneral.\n  Last month, after Ms. Lynch's nomination had already been pending on \nthe floor for weeks, the majority leader inexplicably chose to hold her \nnomination hostage until he got his way on a partisan provision in \nunrelated legislation. That Loretta Lynch is being denied a \nconfirmation vote over human\n\n[[Page S2213]]\n\ntrafficking legislation is a cruel irony since she has a proven record \nof prosecuting child rapists and human traffickers. If Members want a \nprosecutor with a deep commitment to fighting human trafficking, then \nthey should support Loretta Lynch.\n  The American people deserve to know that while the majority leader \nsaid he would block a confirmation vote on Ms. Lynch until we passed \nunrelated legislation, the Senate has voted 74 times on other matters. \nIf the Senate can vote on a Republican budget, legislation to increase \npayments to doctors, and on the confirmation of several other nominees, \nthen of course we can and should vote on the nomination of our Nation's \nnext chief law enforcement officer. There is simply no excuse.\n  Every additional day that Ms. Lynch's nomination languishes on the \nfloor is another day Senate Republicans fail to govern responsibly. \nThis Congress, it took more than 3 months for Senate Republicans to \nschedule a vote on a single judicial nominee. And even though the \nSenate finally did confirm a district court nominee this week, nine \nmore judicial nominees are waiting to be considered. This is no way to \nrespect the dedicated public servants who have been nominated and no \nway to treat our coequal branches of government.\n  The Republican leader has the opportunity to show the American people \nwhat we can do when we work together. He should call Loretta Lynch's \nnomination up for a vote without further delay.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with my colleague from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       JOB CORPS 50TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator King in \nrecognizing the Job Corps program on its 50th anniversary. Job Corps \nhelps at-risk young people ages 16 through 24 improve the quality of \ntheir lives through vocational and academic training. On August 30, \n1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed legislation creating Job \nCorps. Today, one-half century later, generations of graduates in Maine \nand across America demonstrate why Job Corps has been one of our \nNation's best investments.\n  Since its founding, more than 2.7 million young people have entered \nthe Job Corps program with the determination to succeed and have \ngraduated with the confidence and the skills to do so. The success rate \nis extraordinary. Nearly 86 percent of Job Corps graduates find \nemployment in their fields, go on to higher education or serve our \ncountry in uniform. Job Corps students do not just learn a trade--they \ncultivate high aspirations and a commitment to service.\n  As I travel throughout Maine, I have extensive conversations with \nsmall business owners and workers about the challenges they face. While \nthere is no doubt that our Nation's unemployment rate remains \nunacceptably high, I have met with employers in Maine who have jobs \navailable but who cannot find qualified and trained workers to fill \nthese vacant positions.\n  With two centers in Maine, Job Corps not only helps young people in \nour State gain the skills that lead to rewarding careers, but it also \nimproves their lives, assists employers, and strengthens communities. \nThe Penobscot Job Corps Academy in Bangor, ME, and the Loring Job Corps \nCenter in Limestone, ME, have the capability to serve nearly 800 at-\nrisk youth on a daily basis. Over the past several decades, these two \ncenters have compiled an impressive record of success in preparing \ndisadvantaged youth for the workplace or higher education.\n  The combination of skills, self-confidence, and determination Job \nCorps offers can help young people overcome the setbacks, obstacles, \nand failures that often are part of life. The focus on community \nservice at both centers helps to create the involved citizens that are \nso important to Maine's future. These centers put these young men and \nwomen on a path to being successful and vital contributing members of \nour country.\n  Job Corps was founded on the noble idea that, if given the \nopportunity, the support, and the training, America's young people \ncould overcome any obstacles and achieve. For 50 years, Job Corps \ngraduates have turned that idea into reality. I congratulate Job Corps \nagain on this accomplishment.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I join the senior Senator from Maine in \ncongratulating Job Corps on 50 years of service to our country's youth. \nAcross the Nation, Job Corps provides training and career skills to \neconomically disadvantaged young adults, helping them attain a high \nschool diploma or equivalent and career technical training to prepare \nthem for success in today's job market. This program is extremely \nimportant, giving young people who need a second chance the opportunity \nto forge a better career for themselves through hard work and \nmeaningful study.\n  The Penobscot Job Corps Center in Bangor, ME, and the Loring Job \nCorps Center in Limestone, ME, have consistently proven to be \noutstanding assets to our State, helping young Mainers prepare to enter \nthe workforce or pursue post-secondary education every year. Through a \ncombination of unique learning experiences, these institutions are \nhelping the next generation of Maine students work towards stable, \nlong-term jobs.\n  In October of 2013 I was proud to congratulate the Penobscot Job \nCorps Academy for its certification as a Center of Environmental \nExcellence. This distinction recognizes Job Corps campuses that show \nleadership in implementing Job Corps' guiding principles for high \nperformance green buildings. At the time, the Penobscot Job Corps was \none of only two centers in the country to receive this distinction.\n  This initiative prompted Job Corps facilities across the United \nStates to not only reduce their environmental impact, but to also teach \ntheir students to live and work sustainably. The skills and knowledge \nthat students receive from this program will surely help them compete \nin an increasingly environmentally focused labor market.\n  Job Corps centers are an important facet of our workforce development \nsystem and have a proven record of success in preparing disadvantaged \nstudents to obtain and hold a job or pursue opportunities in higher \neducation. I wish Job Corps another 50 years of success, and I am proud \nof the many young people in Maine and across the country who have used \nthis program to make a better life for themselves.\n  The contributions of Maine's Job Corps centers simply cannot be \noverstated, and I look forward to watching their continued development.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/15/senate-section/article/S2213-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2213]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 GREELEY HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL OBSERVANCES\n\n Mr. BENNET.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and pay \ntribute to the heroic first responders of Edgewater, NJ, and \nsurrounding communities, who successfully extinguished one of the \nlargest fires in the history of Bergen County. On Wednesday, January \n21, 2015, a massive fire destroyed an apartment building and displaced \nover 1,000 Borough residents, leaving many homeless during the bitter \nmid-winter months.\n\n[[Page S2214]]\n\n  At 4:20 p.m. that day, smoke billowed along the western skyline of \nthe Hudson River as Edgewater first responders rushed to the scene of a \n7-alarm fire. Mayor Michael McPartland declared a local state of \nemergency, and the Edgewater Fire Department fought to control the \nblaze, which ultimately destroyed 240 of the 408 apartments in the \ncomplex. While civilians and first responders reported no serious \ninjuries, hundreds of residents lost their homes, pets, and \npossessions. Were it not for the quick response of Edgewater's \ndedicated first responders, there could easily have been loss of life, \nand property damage would have been far greater.\n  By the end of the event, 35 departments and agencies from across the \nregion had responded to the call for help. Over 500 police officers, \nfirefighters, emergency medical technicians, and other emergency \npersonnel were on the scene, many of whom stayed until 7 a.m. the next \nmorning. I would like to take this opportunity to recognize and honor \nsome of these brave individuals for their fearless service to our \ncommunity:\n  Chief of Police William Skidmore, head of the 27-member Edgewater \npolice force, who made sure his officers secured the fire perimeter and \ncontrolled crowds, ensuring that both emergency personnel and residents \nremained at a safe distance.\n  Emergency Management Coordinator Robert Christiansen, who worked \nclosely with Chief Skidmore to lead coordination efforts among the many \ncounty, State, and Federal emergency services that responded to the \nfire.\n  Fire Chief Tom Jacobson, who managed the overall firefighting \nresponse and coordinated 250 firefighters, 2 fireboats from the Fire \nDepartment of the City of New York, 2 Jersey City marine units, and 1 \nNew Jersey State Police boat in fighting the blaze.\n  First Aid Squad Captain Kathy Frato, who led her team of EMTs in \nassisting residents and those firefighters who continued to battle the \nfire into the morning hours.\n  The firefighters of the Edgewater Volunteer Fire Department, who \nworked through the night to battle this massive blaze.\n  All of the first responders of the Edgewater Fire Department, Police \nDepartment, and First Aid Squad, in addition to the first responders \nfrom the 35 assisting municipalities, who helped to protect life and \nproperty. Their courage and commitment to their community is an example \nto all, and I could not be more grateful for their service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/15/senate-section/article/S2214-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CONGRATULATING JOE VENTO\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today, I wish to congratulate \nGrammy Award-winning musician Joe Vento on receiving the Century Award, \nan accolade well deserved in recognition of his many sacrifices. Mr. \nVento has served both this great Nation and the city of Las Vegas \nthroughout his life and is a true inspiration for all Nevadans.\n  Mr. Vento's passion for music began at an early age and had him \nplaying the piano and accordion in New York by age 4. He later used his \ntalents in a different setting, bringing the joy of music to those \naround him in time of war. Mr. Vento was in the U.S. Army Band near the \nend of World War II and served in World War II, the Korean war, and \nVietnam. He received a battlefield commission of three stars from \nMarine Commandant Lew Walt during his time in Vietnam at a special \nconcert for U.S. troops. Mr. Vento not only deserves recognition for \nhis bravery in serving our country but also for his determination in \nproviding entertainment for those courageously fighting for our freedom \nalongside him. His actions prove his selflessness and compassion for \nothers.\n  There is no way to adequately thank the men and women who lay down \ntheir lives for our freedoms. I extend my deepest gratitude to Mr. \nVento for his courageous contributions to the United States of America. \nHis service to his country and his bravery and dedication earn him a \nplace among the outstanding men and women who have valiantly defended \nour Nation. As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I \nrecognize that Congress has a responsibility not only to honor these \nbrave individuals who serve our Nation but also to ensure they are \ncared for when they return home. I remain committed to upholding this \npromise for our veterans and servicemembers in Nevada and throughout \nthe Nation.\n  Mr. Vento's service to others did not end on the battlefield. He \nspent the next 70 years bringing incredible music to the city of Las \nVegas. In the 1950s, he began performing with the Three Sons and \nremained with the group for 27 years. He made numerous appearances on \nprestigious shows, appeared in command performances at the White House \nand Imperial Palaces in Tokyo and Beijing, and conducted performances \nwith Victor Borge, Nelson Eddy, and the Veteran Tonight Show Big Band. \nHe also performed at the Paris hotel in Las Vegas. Most recently, Mr. \nVento has lent his musical talent to the Royal Resort just off the \nstrip. Mr. Vento's unwavering commitment to the Las Vegas community \nwill never be forgotten. His music will be legend for years to come.\n  Today, I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in \ncongratulating Mr. Vento on his award and in recognizing his years of \nservice to both the United States of America and the Las Vegas \ncommunity. I wish him the best of luck in all of his musical years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/15/senate-section/article/S2214-2", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2214-S2215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO SAM KAPOURALES\n\n Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I wish to recognize a dear friend, \na dedicated public servant and a passionate West Virginia leader, Sam \nKapourales, who is celebrating his 80th birthday on April 19, 2015. \nAfter proudly knowing Sam and his lovely wife Dee for more than four \ndecades, it is a special privilege to celebrate Sam's vast achievements \nand his many years of steadfast service to Mingo County, to West \nVirginia, and to our Nation.\n  I have never met anyone more humble, community-minded and family-\noriented than Sam. Throughout his 80 years, and still today, Sam has \nalways answered the call of service. At every turn of the road--whether \nas the mayor of Williamson in Mingo County for nearly 21 years, as the \nprosperous business owner of Kapourales Properties, as a successful \npharmacist or as an invaluable member of countless boards and \norganizations that focused on helping others and impacting our local \ncommunities--Sam has never lost touch with his faith, his family and \nthose in need.\n  As a devout Mason, Sam has lead a life devoted to personal \nreflection, self-improvement and social betterment. He is a pure, true-\nblue West Virginian who has shown time after time that he loves his \nState and the people of West Virginia through his actions of service \nand philanthropy. For instance, Sam served as president of the \nChildhood Language Center in Charleston, where children with speech \nimpediments could receive necessary treatments and services.\n\n  He also helped recruit much-needed medical services and physicians to \nthe Tug Valley region as a sponsor of the Tug Valley Area Ambulance \nService. And as proud Shriner and member of the Beni Kedem Temple in \nCharleston, even serving a term as Potentate--a true honor indeed--Sam \nhelped raise funds to transport disabled, burnt or sick children to \nregional medical facilities. Sam and Dee even started a scholarship to \nprovide additional educational opportunities for graduating seniors at \nMingo Central High School.\n  Yet Sam's tireless community efforts do not even begin to stop there. \nThroughout the years, Sam served as a member on the West Virginia Board \nof Pharmacy, the West Virginia Health Care Authority Board, and the \nWest Virginia Housing Development Authority Board. He was Director of \nthe First National Bank of Williamson, the First Bank of Charleston, \nthe Summit State Bank, and the Energy Services of America Corporation. \nHe also chaired the advisory board of Southern West Virginia Community \nCollege of Nursing.\n  Because of his passion, discipline, and staunch work ethic, it is no \nsurprise that Sam has been recognized for his community efforts \nmultiple times throughout the years. Yet to Sam, he says that the \ngreatest of honors bestowed upon him is being a recipient of the 33rd \nDegree of the Scottish Rite, which is only granted for exceptional \nservice to Freemasonry. His entire life, I never knew Sam to turn down \nparticipating in worthwhile cause or helping a neighbor in need. And I \ntruly think\n\n[[Page S2215]]\n\nthat dedication stems from that of Sam's mission as a heartfelt Mason.\n  Sam's unwavering dedication to Mingo County and the Mountain State, \naccompanied by his innovative vision, inspirational spirit, and savvy \naptitude, have helped countless West Virginians throughout the years. \nHis loyalty, trustworthiness, and dedication know no bounds. So today, \nI join his wife Dee his two wonderful daughters, Stephie-Anna and \nSusanna, and all West Virginians in wishing Sam Kapourales a very happy \nbirthday. I look forward to celebrating many more birthdays with my \ndear friend for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/15/senate-section/article/S2215-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/15/senate-section/article/S2215-2", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/15/senate-section/article/S2215-3", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:54 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nagrees to the concurrent resolution (S.

A bill to establish a tax credit for on-site apprenticeship \nprograms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I wish to speak in support of the \nApprenticeship and Jobs Training Act, which I have introduced with my \ncolleague Senator Cantwell. Few issues are as important to the American \npeople as the availability of good jobs in our communities. \nUnemployment in Maine and across the country remains unacceptably high. \nIt is crucial that we continue to improve job training initiatives to \nhelp people find jobs in fields with open positions.\n  Many business owners in Maine have told me that they have jobs \navailable, but they cannot find qualified and trained workers to fill \nthese vacant positions. One way for employees to acquire the skills \nneeded to succeed in these in-demand fields is through apprenticeship \nprograms. Apprentices gain hands-on experience that is invaluable to \nemployers and can help workers secure a well-paying job.\n  According to the Department of Labor's Employment and Training \nAdministration, more than 44,000 participants graduated from the \napprenticeship system in fiscal year 2014. In Maine, there were almost \n700 registered apprentices. That number, however, is likely \ninsufficient to meet tomorrow's needs. One manufacturer in Maine \nestimates that nearly 2.7 million manufacturing employees are expected \nto retire in the next decade. We must do all we can to ensure that an \nadequate pool of skilled workers is available to fill these well-paying \njobs.\n  Our bill helps achieve this goal by giving tax credits to businesses \nthat hire apprentices. To ensure that workers are given adequate time \nto prove their value, the apprentice must be employed for seven months \nin order for a business to claim the credit. Our bill also provides \nincentives for experienced workers who spend at least 20 percent of \ntheir time passing their hard-earned knowledge on to the next \ngeneration. These workers would be allowed to receive some retirement \nincome early, without facing tax penalties. Finally, our bill ensures \nthat the brave men and women who defend our country are given credit \nfor the skills they learn while serving. Training received while \nserving in the Armed Forces would count toward an apprentice's training \nrequirement.\n  This bill would help better align the needs of our Nation's employers \nwith potential employees to promote hiring and the creation of new \njobs. I encourage all my colleagues to support this bill, and I am \npleased to join Senator Cantwell in introducing it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Ms. Ayotte, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Whitehouse, \n        and Mr. Markey):\n  S. 962. A bill to extend the same Federal benefits to law enforcement \nofficers serving private institutions of higher education and rail \ncarriers that apply to law enforcement officers serving units of State \nand local government; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Equity in Law \nEnforcement Act to extend Federal benefits to law enforcement officers \nwho serve at private institutions of higher education and rail \ncarriers. Through this legislation, these individuals would be eligible \nfor many of the same benefits provided to public law enforcement \nofficers, including line-of-duty death benefits and access to federal \ngrant opportunities through the Department of Justice's Bulletproof \nVest Partnership Grant and Byrne Justice Assistance Grant, JAG, \nprograms.\n  In 1976, the Public Safety Officers' Benefits PSOB program was \nenacted to aid in the recruitment and retention of public safety \nofficers. Recognizing the danger that law enforcement officers, \nfirefighters, and first responders face while serving in our \ncommunities, the PSOB provides a one-time financial benefit to \nsurvivors of officers who die as a result of injuries sustained in the \nline of duty.\n  Although the officers protecting our private universities and \nrailways face the same risks, they are currently not included in the \nPSOB program These brave individuals protect our communities every day, \nenforce the law within their jurisdiction, and receive similar training \nto their government counterparts. However, they are currently excluded \nfrom the line-of-duty federal death benefits available to law \nenforcement officers serving units of State and local governments, and \nfrom access to federal grant programs for protective body armor and \nother equipment.\n  Since 1960, approximately 35 college or university law enforcement \nofficers have lost their lives while protecting our communities. While \nsome families of officers that have been gravely injured while serving \nat public universities have received PSOB line-of-duty death benefits, \nthe families of those who lost their lives while serving at private \ninstitutions have been ineligible. We should fix this inequity.\n  Inscribed on the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial are the \nnames of the heroes who gave their full measure while protecting our \ncommunities. This memorial includes Patrol Officer Joseph Francis \nDoyle, who was killed in the line of duty at Brown University in 1988, \nas well as the other officers who died while working at private \nuniversities and colleges and on our railways.\n  A recent name on the Memorial is Patrol Officer Sean Collier. Today, \nwe mark the second anniversary of the Boston Marathon bombings, an act \nof terror that tragically killed three and injured hundreds of others. \nThree days after the bombings, during the manhunt for the attackers, \nOfficer Collier of the MIT Police Department was shot and killed by the \nperpetrators on the university's campus. Officer Collier died while not \nonly bravely serving the students and faculty of MIT. He was also \nserving the city of Boston, working with others in the law enforcement \ncommunity during an exceptionally difficult time to keep the city and \nour nation safe. However, since he was employed by a private \nuniversity, Officer Collier was not eligible for line-of-duty death \nbenefits. To honor Officer Collier's service and sacrifice, this bill \nwould be retroactive to April 15, 2013, the day of the Boston bombings.\n  I am pleased that Senators Ayotte, Leahy, Whitehouse, and Markey have \nonce again joined me in introducing this legislation, which would \nensure that officers who have lost their lives protecting our \ncommunities and their families are eligible for the benefits associated \nwith law enforcement work as well as access to the protective equipment \nthey need. The bill would only apply to officers who are sworn, \nlicensed, or certified to enforce the law within their jurisdiction, \nand is supported by the International Association of Campus Law \nEnforcement Administrators.\n\n[[Page S2223]]\n\n  I urge our colleagues to join us in cosponsoring and passing the \nEquity in Law Enforcement Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS:\n  S. 965. A bill to prohibit the use of funds by Internal Revenue \nService to target citizens of the United States for exercising any \nright guaranteed under the First Amendment to the Constitution of the \nUnited States; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that would \nprohibit the IRS from the targeting any U.S. citizens for exercising \ntheir constitutional rights under the First Amendment.\n  The history of the IRS offers abundant examples of the Agency \ntrampling on these rights. In the most recent controversy, which came \nto light in 2013, the IRS applied a heightened scrutiny to applications \nfrom conservative groups that were seeking tax-exempt status. Delaying \nthese groups' applications suggests an attempt to chill the \nconstitutional right of speech and association by groups that hold \nconservative views. No matter what your political views, the details \nthat have emerged are truly alarming. The IRS admitted that it \ndeliberately targeted conservative groups' applications for tax-exempt \nstatus for extra review if they included such words as ``tea party,'' \n``patriots,'' or ``9/11'' in their names. It also acknowledged \ntargeting applications from groups that criticized how this country is \nbeing run or whose purpose was to address government spending, \ngovernment debt, taxes, or simply to make America a better place. These \ninappropriate criteria stayed in place for more than 18 months and \nresulted in substantial delays in processing the applications of many \ndifferent groups. In some cases, the applications remained outstanding \nfor more than 2 years.\n  The IRS also sought to compel some of the targeted groups to divulge \ntheir membership lists. IRS officials have subsequently admitted there \nwas absolutely no reason for Agency personnel to have sought that kind \nof information.\n  Such behavior, unfortunately, is not a one-time aberration, and the \ntargets have been on both sides of the aisle. A May 2013 Time magazine \narticle noted that the IRS has been involved in scandals going back at \nleast as far as the Kennedy administration, which used the service to \ninvestigate so-called rightwing groups. President Nixon employed a \nsecret IRS operation to investigate and audit political opponents. \nDuring the Johnson administration, the IRS targeted some antiwar \nactivists. In the decades since, a number of political activists from \nboth the conservative and liberal ends of the spectrum, as well as \nwhistleblowers, have been subjected to intimidating and discriminatory \nscrutiny by the IRS.\n  The IRS's history of abuses demonstrates that Congress must be ever-\nvigilant in protecting taxpayers. The Agency's power allows it to \npervade the most sensitive aspects of Americans' private lives. \nIrrespective of whether those singled out are liberal or conservative, \nDemocrat or Republican, Independent or Green Party members, regardless \nof their personal views, the targeting of private citizens for \nexercising their First Amendment rights is out of bounds and cannot be \ntolerated.\n  Seventeen years ago, when the IRS was accused of using abusive \ntactics towards taxpayers, Congress responded by passing the IRS \nRestructuring and Reform Act. That act created the Taxpayer Bill of \nRights, strengthened taxpayer protections against unauthorized \ncollection activities, and established an oversight board to ensure \nthat taxpayers are properly treated by the IRS.\n  The bill I am introducing today builds on the 1998 act, as well as an \namendment I authored in 2013, which became law, that prohibited the IRS \nfrom using funds provided through the fiscal year 2014 IRS funding bill \nto target American citizens for exercising their First Amendment \nrights. That prohibition on the use of funds was continued in the \nfiscal year 2015 funding bill, and the legislation I am offering today \nwould make that prohibition permanent.\n  The First Amendment is one of our most cherished and sacred freedoms, \nand its free exercise must be vigorously protected.\n  It has been said the power to tax is the power to destroy. The \nAmerican people cannot and will not tolerate any abuse of that power.\n  It is imperative that Congress act to make sure the power of the IRS \nis never again used to harass or abuse Americans for exercising their \nFirst Amendment rights. The bill I have introduced is tailored to that \nend. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/15/senate-section/article/S2223-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n               committee on environment and public works\n\n  Mr. ENZI.
