Mr. President, ObamaCare is a direct attack on the \nmiddle class of our country. It is a partisan law that puts ideology \nbefore people, that hurts many of the very Americans it was supposed to \nhelp. It resulted in millions of cancellation notices for hard-working \nAmericans who had plans they liked and who had done nothing wrong. It \nraised premiums, it raised copays, and it raised deductibles and taxes \nfor Americans who were already struggling. It restricted choice and \naccess to doctors and hospitals for patients in need.\n  We see the pain and the hurt of this law all across the country. We \nsee it where we live. In my home State of Kentucky, health costs have \nspiked. ObamaCare first caused tens of thousands of Kentuckians to lose \nthe health care plans they were promised they could keep during the \nfirst year of implementation, then victimized 50,000 more when the \nCommonwealth's much-vaunted ObamaCare co-op completely collapsed. \nObamaCare has also contributed to Kentucky hospitals being forced to \ncut jobs, reduce wages, and even shut down altogether.\n  Some in Washington may have cheered when a Democratic administration \nin Frankfort poured one-quarter of a billion dollars of tax money into \nKentucky's ObamaCare exchange or when our Democratic Governor \nconfidently declared it an ``undisputed fact''--this is what he said: \nan ``undisputed fact''--that ObamaCare's Medicare expansion had added \n12,000 jobs to Kentucky's economy. But like so much of ObamaCare, it \nwas just another broken promise. Those jobs numbers were not an \nundisputed fact at all; they were just projections, and they failed to \never materialize. Health care jobs have actually declined in Kentucky. \nThey did not go up; they declined.\n  Today, few of those ObamaCare cheerleaders are cheering anymore. \nNearly 80 percent of Kentucky's enrollees were simply shoehorned into \nan already-broken Medicaid system, and many of the remaining 20 percent \nfound themselves stuck with unaffordable ObamaCare coverage.\n  Listen to what this mom from Breckinridge County wrote to say:\n\n       My family is being pushed out of the middle class by the \n     Obamacare law. How can we pay almost $1,200 a month on health \n     insurance?\n\n  Listen to what this father of two boys from Owensboro wrote to tell \nme:\n\n       Before the Affordable Care Act, we paid around $100 bi-\n     weekly for the family plan. That has now increased to $235 \n     during the same timeframe. It seems these days there is no \n     incentive to work. We are punished for working hard and \n     trying to provide for our children while others are \n     encouraged to not further themselves because if they do they \n     would be in our particular situation. What happened to being \n     rewarded for working hard in America? What happened to the \n     American dream?\n\n  This Kentucky dad is not the only one wondering this; Americans \nacross the country continue to demand a better way forward. Americans \nmade that clear last November. Kentuckians made that doubly clear again \nlast month.\n  This is simply the reality. Democrats cannot deny it. They cannot \ndeny it. They can try to deny it. Democrats can again dismiss \nAmericans' real-life experience as lies. Democrats can continue to \nlecture Americans about their supposed inability to understand just how \ngreat ObamaCare has been for them. But Americans are intimately \nfamiliar with the painful reality of ObamaCare.\n  Americans want a fresh start. Americans want to see Washington build \na bridge away from ObamaCare and toward better care for them. That is \nwhat the bill before us would do. It is something every Senator should \nsupport, Republicans and Democrats alike. Democrats may have forced \nthis law on the middle class. Democrats may own the pain they have \ncaused across the country, especially in States like Kentucky. But it \nis not too late for our Democratic colleagues to work with us to build \na bridge to better care. This is their chance and President Obama's \nchance to begin to make amends for the pain and the hurt they have \ncaused.\n  For all of the broken promises, for all of the higher costs, for all \nof the failures, this is America's chance to turn\n\n[[Page S8248]]\n\nthe page and write a new and more hopeful beginning. This is our chance \nto work toward a healthier and more prosperous future, with true reform \nthat moves beyond the failures of a broken law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/senate-section/article/S8248-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE NEW CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on another matter, in the past few days \nI have noted some of the achievements of a new Congress that is back to \nwork on the side of the American people. We have passed bills no one \never thought Washington could touch. We have made reforms that have \npreviously languished for years without result. Even more remarkably, \nwe have often done so on a bipartisanship basis.\n  Consider just the bills I have mentioned already:\n  A landmark, bipartisan education bill that would take decisionmaking \naway from distant Federal bureaucrats in order to empower parents and \nteachers instead. The pundits said we would never pass it. We did, 81 \nto 17.\n  A breakthrough, bipartisan highway bill that would finally provide \nStates and local governments the kind of certainty they need to focus \non longer term road and bridge projects. After years of short-term \nextensions, this long-term highway bill passed the new Senate 65 to 34.\n  A milestone, bipartisan cyber security bill that would protect the \npersonal information of people we represent by defeating cyber attacks \nthrough the sharing of information. The issue languished in previous \nCongresses, but this Senate passed it with 74 votes.\n  Today, I would like to mention another important bill this new \nCongress has passed. It is hard for many Americans to believe that \nhuman trafficking--modern-day slavery--can happen where they live, but \nit does right here in our country. It happens in all 50 of our States. \nIn Kentucky alone, the Commonwealth has been able to identify more than \n100 victims since they began keeping relevant records in 2013. This \nkind of abuse often begins around the age of 13 or 14.\n  The victims of modern slavery deserve a voice. They deserve justice. \nAfter years of inaction, the new Congress was determined to give them \nboth. Of course, there was an unforeseen impediment, to put it mildly, \nto getting this bill done, but success was possible because the new \nmajority kept its focus on facts, on substance, and on good policy for \nthe people who have always remained our focus throughout the debate, \nthe victims of modern slavery.\n  The bill we ultimately passed with strong bipartisan support, the \nJustice for Victims of Trafficking Act, represents a vital ray of hope \nfor the countless victims of modern slavery who need our help. Victims \ngroups and advocates told us that this human rights legislation would \nprovide unprecedented support to domestic victims of trafficking. They \nurged the Congress to pass it. We did. The President signed it into law \nas well. It proves that with unwavering compassion and unbowed \ndetermination--something Senator Cornyn knows a thing or two about--\njustice can prevail. I am grateful to him and so many other Senators \nfor working so hard to ensure that it ultimately did.\n  The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act was another important step \nforward for our country. It is another example of what we can achieve \nin a new Congress that is back to work for the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/senate-section/article/S8248-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--H.R. 427\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, the Republican leader comes to the floor \nvirtually every day and talks about this great new Senate.\n  He talked about the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. We tried \nto do that many times. It was blocked by Republicans. That is why it \nwas not done before.\n  Highways. We tried valiantly to do something on highways, but all we \ncould ever get, because of the obstruction of the Republicans, was \nshort-term extensions.\n  Cyber security. My friend the Republican leader comes to the floor \nand talks about, we got cyber security done. We got it done. It is not \na great bill. It is better than nothing. But we tried for years--5 \nyears. Every time we tried, it was blocked by Republicans.\n  One of the newspapers here has a Pinocchio check. They look at the \nfacts and analyze them, and they can give up to four Pinocchios, \nmeaning people simply did not tell the truth.\n  So I want to remind everybody here that I am happy to participate in \ngetting something done with the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, \nled by, on our side, the senior Senator from Washington. We were able \nto get that done because of her good work and others. It was not \nbecause we did not try before. We could not get it done before because \nof the obstruction of the Republicans.\n  This is the most unproductive Senate in the history of the country, \nand there are facts and figures to show that. So we are not going to be \nawarding Pinocchios here based on the statements of my friend the \nRepublican leader, but everyone should understand there are different \nways of presenting the facts. It is always best to present facts that \nare accurate. He said, for example, that bills--TSA, highways, and \ncyber--languished in the Senate. That is true, because of Republican \nfilibusters. We tried to pass those bills in the last two Congresses. \nThey were blocked by Republicans. We are now helping pass legislation, \nand that is our job. The job of Republicans was to oppose everything \nPresident Obama wanted, and that is, in fact, what was done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/senate-section/article/S8248-5", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8248-S8249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               OBAMACARE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on ObamaCare, one newspaper reports:\n\n       Fewer Patients Have Been Dying From Hospital Errors Since \n     ObamaCare Started.\n       Report says about 87,000 lives have been saved since 2010.\n\n  This is as a result of that legislation. I am not going to read the \nwhole article.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe article to which I just referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Huffington Post, Dec. 1, 2015]\n\n  Fewer Patients Have Been Dying From Hospital Errors Since Obamacare \n                                Started\n\n                           (By Jonathan Cohn)\n\n       Hospitals have cut down on deadly medical errors, saving \n     around 87,000 lives since 2010, according to a new government \n     report.\n       Pinning down the precise reasons for this change is \n     difficult, to say nothing of predicting whether the decline \n     will continue. Improvement has slowed in just the last year, \n     the report suggests. But many analysts think government \n     initiatives within the Affordable Care Act have played a \n     significant role in the progress so far.\n       In short, Obamacare may literally be saving lives.\n       The new report comes from Agency for Healthcare Research \n     and Quality, which is part of the Department of Health and \n     Human Services and is something like an in-house think tank \n     dedicated to making medical care safer and more effective. \n     Since 2010, the agency has been tracking the incidence of \n     common and frequently fatal medical errors, which include \n     everything from a nurse accidentally giving a patient the \n     wrong medication to a doctor inserting an intravenous line in \n     a way that leads to a blood-borne infection.\n       On Tuesday, the agency announced its latest findings on \n     these ``hospital-acquired conditions,'' based on preliminary \n     data from 2014. For every 1,000 patients admitted to and\n\n[[Page S8249]]\n\n     then discharged from a hospital, the agency found, roughy 121 \n     of them developed such a condition. That rate is unchanged \n     from last year, but it is down 17 percent from 2010, when it \n     was about 145 out of every 1,000 patients.\n       Based on the existing research about what happens to \n     patients who get sick in the hospital and what it costs to \n     treat them afterwards, that decline works out to roughly \n     87,000 lives saved and $19.8 billion not spent on extra \n     medical care, according to the report.\n       ``The progress is historic,'' David Blumenthal, president \n     of the Commonwealth Fund, told The Huffington Post.\n       ``We have never demonstrated a comparable decline in the \n     history of the U.S. health system,'' added Blumenthal, a \n     physician and researcher who also served in the Obama \n     administration.\n       Broadly speaking, the progress is the result of a crusade \n     that dates back at least to 1990s, when the Institute of \n     Medicine released ``To Err Is Human,'' a seminal report \n     suggesting that nearly 100,000 people were dying each year \n     because of preventable medical mistakes. Over time, \n     researchers learned more about why these errors were so \n     common and started developing methods for avoiding them. \n     Probably the most famous of these was the introduction of \n     checklists, like the ones that airplane pilots use before \n     takeoff, for making surgery safer.\n       But getting hospitals to adopt these methods was difficult, \n     despite the best efforts of some private-sector \n     organizations, in part because existing financial incentives \n     did not reward hospitals for improving quality. If anything, \n     the opposite was true. Hospitals made money for every new \n     treatment and a patient who got sick in the hospital needed \n     more care, rather than less.\n       A major goal of the Affordable Care Act was to reduce and \n     eventually eliminate these incentives for poor quality care, \n     while rewarding the hospitals that getter better results. \n     Today, for example, Medicare pays less to institutions with \n     high rates of hospital-acquired infection, injury and \n     readmission--in other words, large numbers of patients \n     returning to the hospital for treatment shortly after \n     discharge. That's because of a series of penalties the health \n     care law created in 2010, which started affecting hospital \n     revenue three years later. And under an initiative called \n     Partnership for Patients, the federal government provides \n     extra funding to hospitals that agree to monitor patient \n     safety and implement schemes for improving quality.\n       Experts can't be sure about the impact of these reforms, in \n     part because previous studies showed that errors were \n     declining even before 2010, albeit at a slower rate. And the \n     new initiatives raise plenty of serious criticisms--whether \n     from hospital officials saying they are cumbersome to \n     implement or from researchers who think the underlying data \n     is unreliable.\n       But after the agency published last year's results, showing \n     the steep decline in errors, a wide array of experts said the \n     law's new incentives were influencing hospital behavior--and \n     that, as a result, patients were getting better care. Lucian \n     Leape, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health and \n     a pioneer in the patient safety movement, told Politifact, \n     ``I think these data reliable, and the ACA (Affordable Care \n     Act) deserves credit.''\n       The real cautionary note in Tuesday's report may be what it \n     says about the future. If this year's preliminary data holds \n     up, and the error rate for 2014 is truly no lower than it was \n     for 2013, that would suggest progress had stalled--with \n     infections and injuries lower than before, but not as low as \n     they could be.\n       ``On the positive side, there has been no backsliding, so \n     hospitals are, in the lingo of quality improvement, 'holding \n     the gains,''' Blumenthal said. ``But from the standpoint of \n     public policy and given our obligation to eliminate \n     preventable problems, we would should aim to see continued \n     reductions in rates.''\n       HHS officials on Tuesday offered similar thoughts. At a \n     conference in Baltimore focusing on health care quality, an \n     announcement of the new data drew large applause. But Patrick \n     Conway, chief medical officer at the federal government's \n     Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, warned his \n     audience not to be complacent. ``The goal is to get to zero'' \n     errors, he said. ``We've made significant progress. Now the \n     question is how you accelerate that.''\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, among other things, this article says: \n``Hospitals have cut down on deadly medical errors, saving around \n87,000 lives since 2010, according to a new government report.''\n  I am not going to read the whole thing, but it is part of the Record.\n  The article also says:\n\n       Many analysts think government initiatives within the \n     Affordable Care Act have played a significant role in the \n     progress so far.\n       In short, ObamaCare may literally be saving lives.\n       The new report comes from Agency for Healthcare Research \n     and Quality. . . . On Tuesday, the agency announced its \n     latest findings on these ``hospital-acquired conditions''. . \n     . . That rate is unchanged from last year, but it is down 17 \n     percent from 2010, when it was about 145 out of every 1,000 \n     patients.\n\n  That is not the case anymore.\n  Continuing:\n\n       That decline works out to roughly 87,000 lives saved and \n     $19.8 billion not spent on extra medical care, according to \n     the report. . . . A major goal of the Affordable Care Act was \n     to reduce and eventually eliminate these incentives for poor \n     quality care, while rewarding the hospitals that get better \n     results. Today, for example, Medicare pays less to \n     institutions with high rates of hospital-acquired infection, \n     injury and readmission--in other words, large numbers of \n     patients returning to the hospital for treatment shortly \n     after discharge. . . . And under an initiative called \n     Partnership for Patients, the federal government provides \n     extra funding to hospitals that agree to monitor patient \n     safety and implement schemes for improving quality.\n\n  So to my friend who continually berates ObamaCare, we have before us \ntoday and tomorrow an effort to show how wasteful the time is trying to \nwipe out ObamaCare. The House has voted 46 times. The Republicans, of \ncourse, have lost every time. In the Senate, I think it has been 16 \ntimes or 17 times trying to repeal ObamaCare. Each time, it failed, as \nit will fail in the next day or two.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/senate-section/article/S8249-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8249-S8250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RHETORIC OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, when Americans elect leaders, they do so in \ngood faith. Our constituents want us to govern responsibly and work to \nembody American values. Both elected officials and candidates must \nrealize that our words have deep meaning and can influence people far \nand wide. That is why I am very disappointed that instead of talking \nabout issues important to the middle class, the Republicans have turned \nto the politics of hatred and division.\n  It seems no one is safe from this Republican vitriol. Republicans \ndemagogue women seeking health care through Planned Parenthood. \nRepublican candidates use women, infants, and children seeking refuge \nfrom terrorism to fearmonger. Muslim Americans, immigrants, and even \nAmericans exercising their constitutional rights in support of the \nBlack Lives Matter movement are all subject to Republican insults and \nslander.\n  Over and over again, Republican candidates have resorted to hatred \ninstead of appealing to the highest sensibilities of the American \npeople. We all know that on race and other controversial issues, \nRepublicans have long practiced subtle bigotry, but Republicans now \nsimply say out loud the many things at which they used to merely hint.\n  Words have power, and when spoken by influential leaders, they \ninfiltrate every corner of our society.\n  In the wake of last week's murderous attack at a Planned Parenthood \nhealth center in Colorado, a leading conservative activist said:\n\n       It really is surprising more Planned Parenthood facilities \n     and abortionists are not being targeted.\n       Given the public light shed on the atrocities committed by \n     Planned Parenthood and both the government and media's \n     turning a blind eye to it . . . it really should be \n     surprising that Americans convicted of the need to stop the \n     murder of children have not taken the law into their own \n     hands.\n\n  That is what the quote says.\n  We know how exaggerated, untruthful, and unfair the film was that was \nput together as some B-grade movie and that has so maligned Planned \nParenthood. One out of every five American women will go to Planned \nParenthood during her lifetime. It is the only health care that women \nhave in many parts of America. Is that the kind of language you want to \nencourage in the United States of America, that there should be more \nviolence in these health clinics? Certainly not, but it is all too \ncommon in the Republican Party of today.\n  Instead of recognizing the concerns of communities riddled by decades \nof police brutality and racial injustice, Republicans have vilified the \nBlack Lives Matter movement, which has been drawing attention to these \ndisturbing inequities. Rush Limbaugh has gone so far as labeling \nprotesters a ``hate group'' for trying to bring equality to our \ncriminal justice system.\n  Just a few weeks ago, supporters of the Republican Presidential \nhopeful Donald Trump attacked a Black Lives Matter protester on video \nat a rally. Instead of condemning the violence displayed by his \nsupporters, Donald Trump encouraged it. When asked\n\n[[Page S8250]]\n\nabout the incident, Trump said, referring to the protester, ``Maybe he \nshould have been roughed up.'' That is stunning. A Republican candidate \nfor President of the United States urged violence to silence his \ncritics.\n  Last week, four masked men with apparent White supremacist ties \nopened fire on Black Lives Matter protestors in Minneapolis.\n  I am amazed that the junior Senator from Texas had the audacity to \nsay earlier this week that ``the overwhelming majority of violent \ncriminals are Democrats.'' And the article he quoted has been said to \nhave been quoted improperly. That is really quite stunning, that \nsomeone with the academic background of the junior Senator from Texas \ncannot read a simple report. ``The overwhelming majority of violent \ncriminals are Democrats.'' Think about that. Fanning the flames of \nintolerance is un-American. We are better than this.\n  I am disappointed that Republicans who should know better are not \nspeaking out against this vile rhetoric. According to the New York \nTimes, ``Some of the highest-ranking Republicans in Congress and some \nof the party's wealthiest and most generous donors have balked at \ntrying to take down Mr. Trump because they fear a public feud with the \ninsult-spewing media figure.'' That is a sad reflection on one of \nAmerica's major political parties.\n  The Republican Party once claimed to stand for American leadership in \nthe world, but as millions of Syrians have fled their country, seeking \nrefuge from death and destruction, Republicans have instead used the \nhumanitarian crisis as an opportunity to spread fear and animosity. \nRepublican Presidential candidate Ben Carson described the Syrian \nrefugees as ``rabid dogs.'' Mike Huckabee referred to the Syrian \nrefugees as a bag of poisonous peanuts. Even more disturbing is the \njunior Senator from Texas, who went so far as to suggest a religious \ntest for accepting refugees fleeing violence and oppression. He only \nwants to accept Christians.\n  The Republican Party used to claim to stand for religious freedom, \nbut they are now just pretending. Ben Carson doesn't think Muslims \nshould be allowed to become President. The junior Senator from Florida, \nalso a Republican Presidential candidate, speaks of a ``clash of \ncivilizations.'' Those are buzz words meaning a crusade against Islam. \nHe is saying that ISIS extremists are representative of an entire \nreligion.\n  It doesn't stop there. Republicans have targeted immigrants also--not \njust people who are seeking refuge, not just refugees, but also \nimmigrants. The Republican Party wants to paint all immigrants as \nmurderers and rapists. Congressman Steve King says all immigrants are \ndrug traffickers. Republicans only talk about deporting families. \nSenator Rubio, the Republican establishment favorite, walked away from \nhis single positive legislative accomplishment--comprehensive \nimmigration reform--to please the party's extreme anti-immigrant base. \nHe has gone from supporting citizenship for undocumented immigrants to \nwanting to deport DREAMers. And even Jeb Bush speaks of ``anchor \nbabies.''\n  With the way our democracy is structured, there will always be \ndisagreement about the best way elected officials can serve our Nation, \nbut as we debate and disagree, we must do so responsibly.\n  President Bill Clinton once said that those of us with influence must \nbe mindful of our words because they fall ``on the serious and \ndelirious alike.'' The venom Republicans continue to spew has \nconsequences. History will judge those who stand idle as fear and \nanimosity become the platform of an American political party.\n  The simple fact is that Republicans are running on a platform of \nhate, and every Republican who fails to speak out against the hateful, \ndangerous rhetoric being spewed by their party is complicit.\n  For the moral character of our Nation, we must demand that the \nRepublicans return to the values on which our country was founded.\n  Mr. President, Senator McConnell and I have finished our remarks. \nWould the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/senate-section/article/S8250-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 3762, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3762) to provide for reconciliation pursuant \n     to section 2002 of the concurrent resolution on the budget \n     for fiscal year 2016.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       McConnell amendment No. 2874, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time spent \nin quorum calls requested during Senate consideration of H.R. 3762 be \nequally divided and come off of the reconciliation bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that for the \nduration of the Senate's consideration of H.R. 3762, the majority and \nDemocratic managers of the reconciliation bill, while seated or \nstanding at the managers' desks, be permitted to deliver floor remarks, \nretrieve, review, and edit documents, and send email and other data \ncommunications from text displayed on wireless personal digital \nassistant devices and tablet devices. I further ask unanimous consent \nthat the use of calculators be permitted on the floor during \nconsideration of the budget resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. For the information of Senators, this UC does not alter the \nexisting traditions that prohibit the use of such devices in the \nChamber by Senators in general, officers, and staff. It also does not \nallow the use of videos or pictures, the transmitting of sound, even \nthrough earpieces, for any purposes, the use of telephones or other \ndevices for voice communications, any laptop computers, any detachable \nkeyboards, the use of desktop computers or any other larger devices.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, earlier this year, Congress approved its \nfirst balanced 10-year budget since 2001. In addition to helping make \nour government more efficient, effective, and accountable, this \nbalanced budget resolution contained reconciliation instructions to \nprovide for the repeal of Obamacare and pave the way for real health \ncare reforms to strengthen the doctor-patient relationship; expand \nchoices; lower health care costs; and improve access to quality, \naffordable, innovative health care.\n  These instructions focused on the key congressional committees with \njurisdiction over Obamacare--the Senate Finance Committee; Senate \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee; House Energy and \nCommerce Committee; House Education and the Workforce Committee; and \nthe House Ways and Means Committee.\n  Our friends in the House passed their repeal bill in October and \nNovember, which repealed key parts of Obamacare, including the \nindividual and employer mandates, the Cadillac tax, and the medical \ndevice tax, which is pending here today.\n  As most everyone knows, while the House and Senate are known \ncollectively as Congress, they both have very different rules. This is \nwhy it is important to ensure that the House-passed repeal bill is in \nline with Senate rules and procedures.\n  The reconciliation process is governed by a combination of statutory \nrules, budget resolution provisions, precedents--and the \ninterpretations of all these applicable standards ensure that any \nlegislation which says it qualifies for reconciliation does actually do \nso.\n  The repeal bill passed by the House, H.R. 3762, contained material \nthat qualified the bill in the House as meeting the conditions for \nreconciliation. The provisions were marked up and reported out of the \nthree House reconciled committees, combined together\n\n[[Page S8251]]\n\nby the House Budget Committee, improved upon by the House Rules \nCommittee, and acted on by the full House of Representatives.\n  The Obamacare repeal bill approved by the House contains provisions \nwhich fall in the jurisdiction of the Senate Finance and HELP \nCommittees and satisfies the Senate reconciliation instruction by \nreducing the deficit well over $1 billion.\n  However, while the House bill does qualify as meeting the essential \nstandards necessary for reconciliation in the Senate, it is not immune \nfrom the Senate-specific requirements under the Byrd rule, which is the \nreason for the McConnell amendment offered earlier.\n  The Byrd rule was crafted in an effort to ensure that matter inside a \nreconciliation bill has at its core a budgetary effect. The Byrd rule \nand the reconciliation instruction work together to evaluate the \nmaterial inside H.R. 3762 for its consideration in the Senate.\n  Working with the committees reconciled in the Senate, Leader \nMcConnell and his leadership team, the House Budget Committee, the \nSenate Parliamentarian and her staff, the staff of the minority and the \nCongressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation, H.R. \n3762 has been exhaustively examined, debated, and had decisions \nrendered as to how to evaluate it from a reconciliation and Byrd rule \nperspective.\n  I think it is important for all Senators to understand what has been \ndone to address those challenges to ensure that the House bill's \nprovisions are not vulnerable to a variety of Byrd rule challenges.\n  In H.R. 3762, section 1 contains both a short title and a table of \ncontents that have no score and therefore do not qualify as \nreconciliation material. The McConnell substitute amendment does not \ncontain section 1.\n  Obamacare mandated that businesses with more than 50 employees \nautomatically enroll their employees in Obamacare, the so-called auto-\nenrollment provision. H.R. 3762 eliminated that mandate. Subsequent to \nHouse passage, the administration struck a spending deal with Congress, \nwhich used the repeal of the auto-enrollment provision as an offset. \nSince that provision is now law, it does not score for purposes of \nreconciliation and was Byrdable. The House removed that language when \nit engrossed the bill and sent it to the Senate last month. It is no \nlonger in the House bill and is not addressed in the McConnell \namendment.\n  Obamacare created a fund, the so-called Prevention and Public Health \nFund, which has been used for a variety of purposes since 2010. The \nHouse bill in section 101 repealed that fund and rescinded its \nunobligated balances. The McConnell amendment does the same.\n  In section 102 of H.R. 3762, a deficit reduction provision for \nMedicaid was included, creating a new class of prohibited entities for \nwhich Medicaid reimbursement is barred. While the House language \nqualifies for reconciliation consideration in the Senate, the McConnell \namendment makes even clearer how the language is to apply to Medicaid, \nnot any Federal spending. As well, it clarifies the tests applied to \nentities to determine whether or not they fall into the prohibited \nclass.\n  Section 103 of the House bill created new resources for community \nhealth center programs, and the McConnell amendment contains the same \nlanguage.\n  Obamacare imposed mandates to purchase health care insurance on both \nindividuals and employers. Sections 201 and 202 of the House bill \nrepealed those mandates.\n  Unfortunately, this language does not qualify under the Byrd rule in \nthe Senate. In the judgement of the Parliamentarian, the policy impact \nof these repeals outweighs their fiscal impact. As well, there is \ntechnical and conforming language in both sections 201 and 202 of the \nHouse bill that do not score and therefore are inappropriate for \nreconciliation in the Senate.\n  As a result, the McConnell amendment addresses the mandates but in a \ndifferent way. Rather than containing language that repeals them, the \nMcConnell amendment repeals the penalties, which Obamacare instituted \nto punish those who wanted the freedom to choose in the health care \ninsurance market.\n  Obamacare imposed a tax on medical devices, which section 203 of H.R. \n3762 repealed. The McConnell amendment does the same without the \nconforming and clerical amendments in this section that the House bill \ncontains. Clerical and conforming amendments do not score and so do not \nqualify for consideration under the Byrd rule.\n  Obamacare imposed a tax on high-quality health insurance, the so-\ncalled Cadillac tax. H.R. 3762 repealed that tax, but the repeal \ncontained technical and conforming language that violates the Byrd \nrule. As well, according to CBO, the House language created a possible \ndeficit sometime well after the reconciliation window, which is another \nviolation of the Byrd rule.\n  To address these problems, the McConnell amendment removes the \ntechnical and conforming language that violates the Byrd rule and \nsunsets the Cadillac tax repeal at the end of 2024.\n  The McConnell amendment also contains an additional policy.\n  Working in concert with the Senate Finance Committee, the McConnell \namendment contains reconciliation-compliant language to recapture \nexcess exchange subsidies that have been paid but which were not \nsupposed to go out the door. Over 10 years, this will have a \nsignificant deficit reduction impact.\n  The pending McConnell amendment, then, addresses the Byrd rule \nchallenges contained within the House bill. It has a deficit reduction \nimpact equal to the House-passed bill. It is reconciliation compliant. \nIt will be the pending language to which amendments should be drafted \nand offered during consideration of the repeal bill.\n  The Budget Act calls for a submission for the Record of Byrdable \nmaterial contained in the reconciliation bill, and I will ask that the \nlist of Byrdable material in H.R. 3762 be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. President, pursuant to section 313(c) of the Congressional Budget \nAct of 1974, I submit for the Record a list of material considered to \nbe extraneous to H.R. 3762, the Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom \nReconciliation Act of 2015.

staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation.\nNotes: Numbers may not add up to totals because of rounding;* = an increase or decrease between zero and $50 million.\nOn October 23, 2015, the House passed H.R. 3762 (see https://www.congress.gov/114/bills/hr3762/BILLS-114hr3762eh.pdf). That bill removed subtitle B of\n  H.R. 3762 as reported by the House Committee on the Budget on October 16, 2015, which would have repealed the Independent Payment Advisory Board.\n  Additionally, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (Public Law 114-74) was enacted on November 2, 2015, and included a provision identical to title I of\n  this legislation. This estimate differs from CBO and JCT's prior estimate of H.R. 3762 as reported by the House Committee on the Budget (see https://\nwww.cbo.gov/publication/50918) as a result of these two legislative actions.\na For outlays, a positive number indicates an increase (adding to the deficit) and a negative number indicates a decrease (reducing the deficit); for\n  revenues, a positive number indicates an increase (reducing the deficit) and a negative number indicates a decrease (adding to the deficit); for the\n  deficit, a positive number indicates an increase and a negative number indicates a reduction.\nb The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-74) was enacted on November 2, 2015. Title VI of that law includes a provision identical to title I of\n  this legislation. Therefore, CBO estimates that title I would have no effect relative to current law.\nc CBO previously estimated additional effects of combining the repeal of the auto-enrollment requirement for large employers with the repeal of the\n  individual and employer mandates. Because the former is now current law (see P.L. 114-74), that interaction effect is included in our estimate of the\n  repeal of the individual and employer mandates.\nd Excluding macroeconomic feedback, all off-budget effects would come from changes in revenues. (The payroll taxes for Social Security are classified as\n  off-budget.) Off-budget effects from macroeconomic feedback include changes in Social Security spending and revenues.\ne An explanation of these estimates of macroeconomic feedback can be found in the cost estimate for H.R. 3762 as reported by the House Committee on the\n  Budget on October 16, 2015. The effects of the changes proposed in the legislation analyzed here are quite similar to the effects estimated\n  previously. As a result, CBO and JCT's estimated economic effects and macroeconomic feedback to the budget are not appreciably changed from that\n  previous analysis.\nf Including macroeconomic effects, CBO and JCT estimate that enacting the legislation would not increase net direct spending by more than $5 billion in\n  any of the first three consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2026; however, the agencies are not able to determine whether enacting the legislation\n  would increase net direct spending by more than $5 billion in the fourth 10-year period. The agencies estimate that enacting the legislation would\n  increase on- budget deficits by more than $5 billion in one or more of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2026. Excluding macroeconomic\n  feedback, the agencies estimate that enacting the legislation would not increase net direct spending by more than $5 billion in any of the four\n  consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2026, and would increase on-budget deficits by more than $5 billion in one or more of the four consecutive 10-\n  year periods beginning in 2026.\n\n\n    PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE OF

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton).\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I think we can all agree there is a lot \nof work that needs to be done in this Congress--priorities such as \ncontinuing to improve health care for our families, creating jobs, \nboosting wages, expanding economic security for workers, and making \nhigher education more affordable and accessible, just to name a few. \nUnfortunately, instead of working with Democrats to focus on those \nchallenges--the ones that families face every day--far too many \nRepublicans have doubled down on a favorite pastime--attacking women's \nhealth and rights in order to pander to their extreme base.\n  I am very proud to be on the floor today with many of my Democratic \ncolleagues to say enough is enough and to make clear that even as \nRepublicans try to take women's health backwards, we are going to push \nharder in the other direction for continued progress on women's access \nto health care and constitutionally protected reproductive rights.\n  This year alone, according to NARAL Pro-Choice America, more than 40 \nbills have been introduced in this Congress that would undermine a \nwoman's constitutionally protected right to make her own choices about \nher own body. The House and Senate have voted a total of 17 times--17 \ntimes--on legislation to undermine women's health care and rights. That \nis right. In the year 2015--in the year 2015 alone--Republicans in \nCongress have introduced over 40 bills and held 17 votes on whether \nCongress should roll back women's rights. That is completely \nunacceptable. The bill we are debating here on the floor today would \ndefund Planned Parenthood, and that is just more of the same. It is \nanother effort to force through extreme policies under a fast-track \nprocess.\n  A vote on the bill before us today is a vote on whether a young woman \nshould be able to go to the provider she trusts to get birth control, \nwhether cancer screenings should be more or less available to women \nacross the country, and whether the 2.7 million men and women who visit \nPlanned Parenthood each year should continue to get health care \nservices they rely on.\n  Over the last few months of Republican political attacks on Planned \nParenthood and women's health, I have been proud to stand with women \nnationwide who are making their voices heard and fighting for their \nright to make their own health care decisions--women such as Shannon, \nwho lives in Tumwater, WA, and says the care she received at Planned \nParenthood as a young woman protected her ability to have children and \nthat today she has Planned Parenthood to thank for her little girl; \nwomen such as Breanne from Seattle, who went to Planned Parenthood as \nan uninsured student, where providers caught abnormal cell growth on \nher cervix wall before--before--it could turn into cancer; and the \nwomen and advocates at the Planned Parenthood Center in Pullman, WA, \nwho, after their building was damaged in an arson attack, came together \nas a community and established a pop-up clinic to make sure that women \nand families could continue to get the care they needed.\n  I know many of us here today are thinking of those who are suffering \nand who lost loved ones as a result of the tragic violence in Colorado \nSprings last week. People across the country--men and women--have had \nenough of extremism and violence, including at Planned Parenthood \nhealth care centers. When a woman seeks health care--constitutionally \nprotected health care--she should not have to feel threatened in any \nway. A doctor in a women's health clinic should not have to worry about \nwearing a bulletproof vest under her lab coat. Women's health care \nshould not be controversial, much less a cause for violence in the 21st \ncentury. Women and their families have had enough.\n  I have heard from so many women and men who are tired of women's \nhealth being undermined, being threatened, and being used as a \npolitical football here in Washington, DC. Who can believe that in the \n21st century a Presidential candidate would claim that expanding access \nto birth control is as easy as setting up a few more vending machines \nin men's bathrooms? These women and men across the country are speaking \nup and saying ``not on our watch'' to those who want to turn back the \nclock on women's health and women's rights. I am going to continue, \nalong with my colleagues, to bring their voices and their stories and \ntheir fight to the Senate floor.\n\n[[Page S8254]]\n\n  As we all know, this is a tired political effort to dismantle the \nAffordable Care Act and take Planned Parenthood down with it. It is at \na dead end. But if Republicans are going to try to cut off women's \naccess to health care, I am going to make sure they hear about it and \nthat people across this country know exactly where Democrats stand--\nwith women. That is why I am very proud to be introducing this \namendment today that would strike the harmful language defunding \nPlanned Parenthood from this legislation and replace it--replace it--\nwith a new fund to support women's health care and clinic safety.\n  There is so much more we need to do to improve women's health care in \nthis country today, from strengthening the women's health care \nworkforce to expanding access to constitutionally protected \nreproductive health care to raising awareness about violence against \nwomen--so much more. This fund that is part of this amendment would \noffer an opportunity to make progress on goals such as these and more \nto support women's health providers and clinics at a time when they \nneed it most. Critically, it would show women and families that their \nconstitutional rights, that their safety and their health care should \ncome before tea party political pandering, not the other way around. By \nthe way, this amendment is fully paid for by the Buffett rule.\n  Democrats are going to keep standing up for women and encouraging \nRepublicans to focus on the real challenges that families face, rather \nthan their political attacks that their tea party base is so focused \non. I urge my colleagues to join me in standing against this harmful \neffort to defund Planned Parenthood and delivering a clear message, \nagain, to Republicans in Congress who want to play politics with \nwomen's health--not on our watch.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2875 to Amendment No. 2874\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON.

Mr. President, at a townhall meeting in Green Bay, WI, \non June 11, 2009, President Obama was trying to sell his health care \nlaw, and this is the claim he made. This is the quote, and this is the \npromise he made to the American public. He said:\n\n       No matter how we reform health care, I intend to keep this \n     promise: If you like your doctor, you'll be able to keep your \n     doctor; if you like your health care plan, you'll be able to \n     keep your health care plan.\n\n  Less than a week later, in remarks to the American Medical \nAssociation, the Nation's largest association of medical doctors, the \nPresident said:\n\n       I know that there are millions of Americans who are content \n     with their health care coverage--they like their plan and, \n     most importantly, they value the relationship with their \n     doctor. They trust you. And that means that no matter how we \n     reform health care, we will keep this promise to the American \n     people: If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep \n     your doctor, period. If you like your health care plan, \n     you'll be able to keep your health care plan, period. No one \n     will take that away, no matter what.\n\n  Now, a number of years have passed since President Obama made that \npromise. It wasn't just those two times that President Obama made that \npromise either. I think it has been documented that he made that \npromise to the American people over 30 times. Other supporters of the \nbill repeated that promise. It was a promise. It was a promise to the \nAmerican public. It was a promise he knew would not be kept. It was a \npromise about which the supporters of the bill knew there was no way \nunder ObamaCare that people would be able to keep their health care \nplan, that they would become able to keep and maintain the relationship \nwith the doctor they trusted, knew, and had faith in.\n  President Obama called it a promise. PolitiFact had another name for \nit. PolitiFact, in 2013, termed that promise its ``Lie of the Year.'' \nThink of that. The President of the United States was trying to sell a \nmassive restructuring of a health care system--and that is what he was \ntrying to do. He was trying to sell it. He was marketing a bill, a law, \na concept, and in order to market that concept, President Obama and \nother supporters of the bill repeatedly made a promise that PolitiFact \ntermed the ``Lie of the Year'' of 2013.\n  I come from the private sector. It is incumbent on people in the \nprivate sector, when they are selling products to consumers, to tell \nthe truth about the product. If you don't, you will be accused of \nconsumer fraud. You can be sued. You can probably be sued out of \nexistence. Imagine how the trial bar would treat a businessperson who \ntried to sell a product by making a promise that turned out to be \n2013's ``Lie of the Year.'' I don't believe that business would be in \nbusiness today.\n  ObamaCare, at its heart, is a massive consumer fraud--a massive \nconsumer fraud. So the purpose of my amendment has the purpose of a \npiece of legislation I introduced in 2013--the same thing. It is \ndesigned to honor the promise that President Obama made and that he did \nnot keep--the promise that was made under ObamaCare that was not kept.\n  The bill I introduced in 2013 was simply titled ``If You Like Your \nHealth\n\n[[Page S8255]]\n\nCare Plan, You Can Keep it Act.'' What is rather unique about my piece \nof legislation is that it used the exact same wording of ObamaCare. \nObamaCare actually did have a section in it called a grandfather clause \nthat purported to allow people to keep their health care and allowed \nthem to maintain their relationship with their doctor if they liked \ntheir health care plan and their doctor. The problem is it was a \ngrandfather clause that allowed you to keep your plan as long as you \ncompletely changed it. So what my bill in 2013 did was it just said: \nListen, you can actually keep your health care plan and you don't have \nto change it.\n  That is what my amendment does today. It restores that promise--the \npromise of President Obama and the supporters of ObamaCare. Let me use \nthe real name: The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Of the \nOrwellian-named laws that have been passed through this Chamber, this \nis probably the most Orwellian because the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act did neither, because that promise was not kept. It \nwas a lie. Patients weren't protected. They lost their health care \nplan. We have all received letters from constituents, often \nheartbreaking letters. There was a couple in Wisconsin, they both had \ncancer. He is recovering from prostate cancer. She had stage IV lung \ncancer. They had health care in the State high-risk pool. They could \nafford it. It worked for them. They lost it because of ObamaCare. They \ncalled our office panicked--panicked--because they couldn't log on to \nhealthcare.gov. They tried almost 40 times. They lost their health care \nplan. That promise was broken. I don't hear supporters of the law \npointing to those individuals.\n\n  So my amendment would restore the promise that if you had health care \nthat you liked in 2013, insurance companies can offer those same plans \nagain. They were far more affordable--far more affordable. As I just \nstated with that one little example, patient protection in the \nAffordable Care Act didn't protect patients, and it certainly hasn't \nbeen more affordable. We have also received hundreds of letters from \npeople whose premiums have doubled, their out-of-pocket maximum has \ndoubled and tripled. They can't even afford to use the health care they \nwere able to secure because it has become so expensive. The reality of \nObamaCare is it has been a miserable failure, and the promises made \nunder it literally were abject lies. That is the reality. That is the \nvery sad fact.\n  I encourage all my colleagues to unanimously support the promise \nPresident Obama and the law's supporters made and vote for my \namendment, which would allow Americans, if they like their health care \nplan, if they like their doctor, they actually will be able to keep it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thoroughly support the right of my \ncolleague to his opinion, but we have never had more people insured in \nmodern history because of ObamaCare. It doesn't mean it is perfect, but \nlet me tell you--I don't know what my colleague's constituents tell \nhim, but I will tell you what mine do. They say thank you. Thank you \nfor the fact that I can get insurance. Thank you for the fact that I \ncan get it even if I have a heart condition. Thank you for the fact \nthat my child can stay on my policy until he is 26 years old. Thank \nyou. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for the lifesaving preventive care \nI get. Thank you. Thank you for the cheaper prescription drugs.\n  So people live in a different universe, I guess, but I prefer to \nstick with the facts, and the facts are millions and millions and \nmillions of Americans now have the peace of mind of being insured. They \ndon't become a burden on their families, they don't become a burden on \nthe emergency room, and they don't become a burden on their \ncommunities. I thank President Obama for his courage. We can fix what \nis wrong with ObamaCare, but time and time again--more than 50 times--\nthey tried to repeal it, the GOP, and they are going to try again, and \nthey are going to fail again. Secretly, I think they hope they fail \nbecause they have nothing--nothing--to replace it with. It is kind of a \njoke. Nothing. Oh, let's just open up the free market. Well, folks, we \ntried that forever. ObamaCare isn't government care. It is insurance \nexchanges, and it is Medicaid expansion in those States that wish to \nhave it. I have to tell you, in those States who have it, the people \nare very happy.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2876\n\n  I rise not only to respond to that attack on health care that we have \nheard again for the 90th time from the other side, I really rise to \nthank Senator Murray. I thank her again for her unbelievable leadership \nin protecting women's health. Beyond that, she is a leader in \nprotecting children's health, men's health, families' health, and our \nseniors' health. Today what she is doing is very important. She is \nsaying to the Republicans: We don't like the fact that you are \ndefunding a health care organization that serves 3 million Americans \nevery year with lifesaving health care, preventive health care, STD \ntesting, breast cancer exams, and these 3 million Americans want us to \nstand and fight for them. That is what Senator Murray is doing today, \nand I am proud to be by her side.\n  What she is simply saying is, no, we are not going to defund Planned \nParenthood. She is going to strike that out of this bill they have put \nforward, but also we are going to pay for an expansion of women's \nhealth care because we know all you have is your health. Just ask \npeople who may have everything else in the world, but somebody gets \ncancer, somebody gets a heart attack, somebody gets a stroke, someone \nin the family is diagnosed with Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, their whole \nworld is turned upside down.\n  So what do my friends on the other side do? They strike funding from \nan organization that has more respect in this country than their party \nor my political party or this Congress has. Well, it would be easy to \nbeat the reputation of this Congress, but the vast majority of the \nAmerican people understand the role of Planned Parenthood.\n  So I strongly support this amendment, and I want to reiterate \nsomething Senator Murray said. Republicans have introduced more than 40 \nbills to take away women's health care in this Congress--40 bills--40 \nbills. And then they say: Oh, no, we are not conducting a war on women. \nYes, you are. Yes, you are. When you want to turn the clock back to the \ndays when women died from back-alley abortions, you are conducting a \nwar on women. By the way, if you don't believe a woman should have the \nright to choose, I respect you. Take that ideology to your own family, \nof course, but don't tell everyone in America they have to think the \nway you think. I don't tell them they have to think the way I think. If \nI have a constituent who says: Senator, I have a certain belief and it \nmeans no abortion, I say: God bless you, of course. But if you don't \nhave that belief and you do believe in Roe v. Wade--which most of the \npeople in this country do, where a woman should have the right to \nchoose early in her pregnancy without government interference--if you \ndo believe in that, and that is the law of the land, then you should \nhave that right.\n  May I ask that there be quiet? Thank you. This is a very serious \npoint--a very serious point.\n  I have to say, you have now, over on the other side, in the House, a \nnew special committee which is going to continue the witch hunt on \nPlanned Parenthood. Why do they need a new committee? They have several \ncommittees. I served proudly in the House for 10 years. There are so \nmany committees that have jurisdiction over health, health care, \nscience, and the rest. If you want to repeal Roe v. Wade, if you want \nto take away a woman's right to choose, then have the courage to \nintroduce an amendment and do it--just do it. The last time it was \ndone, it failed, here, but if that is what you want to do, I respect \nyou. Come on down and say you think abortion should be a crime, subject \nto jail time for women, for doctors. Go ahead. Do it. Do it. I will \ndebate you.\n  I was thinking the other day, the GOP has changed--the Grand Old \nParty that I knew. The first President George Bush was on the board of \nPlanned Parenthood--was on the board of Planned Parenthood. I was on \nthe board of Planned Parenthood in the 1970s. I was one of the few \nDemocrats. This was a bipartisan issue, women's health, reproductive \nfreedom. It was not a partisan issue. So the Grand Old Party has \nchanged from the GOP. I call them the POP, the ``party of the past.'' \nThey are the party of the past. Not only do they\n\n[[Page S8256]]\n\nwant to reverse Roe v. Wade, but they don't have the courage to come \ndown and do it directly. Oh, no, they defund Planned Parenthood. Come \non. I wasn't born yesterday. It is obvious, and I know what this is all \nabout: take away the clinics, take away the health care, take away \nwomen's right to choose. It is happening all over the country. If you \ndon't like Roe v. Wade, come down and try to overturn it here.\n  OK. Now, fetal tissue research. There are organizations all over this \ncountry that do make fetal tissue available to save lives--to save \nlives. How long has this been in place? It was under Ronald Reagan, \nwhen he was President, that he set up this special committee that was \nheaded by a pro-life judge, an anti-choice judge. They studied this and \nsaid it is very important to do it--very important to do it.\n  In 1993, Congress voted to federally fund fetal tissue research. If \nyou don't like fetal tissue research, if you think we ought to stop it, \ncome down with a bill, introduce it, and we will argue it. If you don't \nwant to do fetal tissue research, if you don't think it is good to find \ncures for Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, you come down and put the bill in \nthe hopper. Oh, no, they don't want to do that. They just want to \nconduct a witch hunt on one of the organizations that help make fetal \ntissue research possible, and this after--this after they had the head \nof Planned Parenthood before the Congress for 4 or 5 hours straight, \nonly topped by what they did to former Secretary of State Hillary \nClinton. I think she was there 11 hours. So after all those hours that \nCecile Richards--and they asked her what she was paid to do her work. I \nnever heard them ask anybody else what they get paid. As it turned out, \nshe was on the low scale of what equivalent jobs are. That is not the \npoint. They harassed her for hours--hours--and their rhetoric was not \ngood.\n  What we say matters. What we say matters. When I say I respect people \nwho feel they would never allow their child or their wife to have an \nabortion, I respect that, but if somebody else says we agree with Roe \nv. Wade that in the early stages it ought to be an option for women and \ntheir family, I respect them. I don't demonize one side, but the other \nside does over and over again. I have stood on this floor for many \nyears now, frankly, with my colleague Patty Murray and my colleague \nDianne Feinstein, and we have heard mostly men come down and lecture us \nabout how it is terrible. Roe v. Wade should never be the law of the \nland. There should be no abortion, and the rest of it. That is their \nright. I do not believe it is their right to take away funding from an \norganization that serves 3 million Americans a year and saves lives.\n  So while Republicans--the party of the past--have put in 40 bills to \ntake away a woman's right to choose, essentially, we say today, through \nthe Murray amendment, we are looking at the future, we are looking with \nclear eyes, we are looking at our people, and we support people who go \nto Planned Parenthood for their health care, and we are going to vote--\nand I pray we win this vote--to strip out this attack on Planned \nParenthood. We are here to say: Stop this assault on women's health \ncare. It is wrong. It is absolutely wrong.\n  I want to put it into context. I said that Planned Parenthood serves \n3 million people. I want to give even more specifics. Four hundred \nthousand women receive their Pap tests to protect themselves against \ncervical cancer. They want to stop that funding. They want to take away \nservices from 400,000 women. They say: Oh, no, we really don't. They \nwill go other places. They will go to little health care centers.\n  Excuse me. I have those health care system centers--more than \nanybody. They are overworked, overloaded, and they support Planned \nParenthood. They are attacking 500,000 women who get breast exams, and \nif a doctor finds a lump, they refer them for a mammogram. They go \nafter women and men who have nowhere else to turn for their most basic \nhealth care. We have been down this road before.\n\n  A few months ago in this very Senate, we defeated the Republicans' \nattempt to defund Planned Parenthood, but they are back again with the \nsame old, same old party of the past attitude. They are attacking \nPlanned Parenthood because Planned Parenthood has a host of services, \n97 percent of which have nothing to do with abortion. If you don't want \nto have abortion legal, you want to make it a crime, you want to put \ndoctors in jail, you want to put women in jail, then come down here and \nput something in a bill form, repeal Roe v. Wade, and criminalize \nabortion.\n  I am old enough to remember when it was a crime. Let me tell you \nsomething. There are graves all over this country with women who died \nfrom back-alley abortions and botched abortions. They never said it was \nfrom that because then they would have died as a criminal. We are not \ngoing to go back to those days. The party of the past is not winning on \nthis. They are not going to win, because President Obama is going to \nveto this bill. Maybe this next Senate will have a pro-choice Senate \nfor a change.\n  In 2011, Republicans threatened to shut down the entire Government of \nthe United States of America if Planned Parenthood wasn't defunded. \nRemember, 97 percent of what Planned Parenthood does has nothing to do \nwith abortion, but Planned Parenthood is in their line of attack and \nthey haven't stopped. The rhetoric matters. What they say matters.\n  In fact, these attacks go back to 1916 when Planned Parenthood's \nfounder was arrested because she was providing birth control \ninformation to poor people. Imagine, a woman was arrested for \nexplaining to some people how they could prevent unwanted pregnancies--\narrested. I admit that we have come a long way, but these people want \nto take us back. Yes, a woman was arrested for advocating birth \ncontrol. Now you have Republicans right in this Senate and in this \nCongress who say that women shouldn't have access to free birth \ncontrol.\n  If they don't want to take birth control, fine. Don't; it is fine \nwith me. I respect it. If you don't think your family should ever have \nan abortion, I am with you all the way on your right. That is your \nright. But this is America. We don't have Big Government think. We \ndon't have Big Government telling you what to think about your own body \nor what your religion should be.\n  This is a major issue. I always thought the old GOP was the party of \nindependence. We have our views, but people have a right to think the \nway they want to think. No, that is the old GOP. This is the new POP, \nthe party of the past.\n  Let me say this. This is sad. This is the 21st century. We should be \nworking together to ensure that every family has access to legal health \ncare. If you want to make something illegal, have the courage to come \ndown here and say it is illegal. Don't start defunding organizations \nthat give women health care. Also, stop the demonizing rhetoric. One \ncandidate for President on the Republican side called people who were \npro-choice barbarians, and he happens to be a Senator. He called us \nbarbarians.\n  What we say matters. Political witch hunts are wrong. What we say \nmatters. Special committees set up to demonize an organization like \nPlanned Parenthood--that is wrong. I wrote to Speaker Ryan. I asked him \nto disband the latest House committee that was set up. It is costing \ntaxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars for a special committee when \nthey have a slew of committees that have jurisdiction over health care \nand over science and fetal tissue research. It is a political witch \nhunt being paid for by taxpayers after they hauled the President of \nPlanned Parenthood before them and had her sit there for hour after \nhour.\n  The American people have to wake up to this. That is why I am taking \nall of this time. This isn't a small matter of supporting Patty \nMurray's amendment, which is so important. It is a very simple \namendment. We are going to stop them from defunding Planned Parenthood, \nand we are actually going to increase spending on women's health. I can \nassure you that when you catch breast cancer early, it pays dividends, \nfirst and foremost to the woman and her family--she is going to live--\nand second of all, to the taxpayers. They don't have to treat cancer \nwith expensive drugs and surgeries. The same is true when you catch \ncervical cancer.\n  When my friend suggests that we spend more on health care to prevent \nthese problems, she is doing something\n\n[[Page S8257]]\n\nright for the taxpayers. Let's be clear. There is a dangerous climate \nout there for Planned Parenthood, and it is going to be exacerbated \ntoday. Since 1977, there have been 11 murders, 17 attempted murders, 42 \nbombings, and 186 arsons against abortion clinics and providers for \ndoing something that is legal. Anything we say that promotes this kind \nof terrorism and violence--anything we say that results in this--we \nshould never say. We need to protect medical personnel and staff who \nput their lives on the line every day working in these clinics, and we \nshould protect the patients who rely on them.\n  As my colleague said, imagine a doctor, a nurse having to wear \nprotective gear under their uniform. The Women's Health Care and Clinic \nSecurity and Safety Fund that my friend is proposing is very important. \nIt is a very important vote. It will provide compensation for health \nproviders who provide the full spectrum of comprehensive women's health \ncare services, and it will enhance safety at clinics.\n  The great Ted Kennedy and I worked on the FACE Act. That was his \nbill. The FACE Act was meant to protect patients and doctors at \nclinics. All those years ago--I was a young, new Senator then, and he \nasked if I would be his lieutenant and help him get the bill through.\n  We got the bill through, but I think what Senator Murray is doing \ntoday is responding to the violence, the increased violence, the \natmosphere of fear that we see at these clinics. Her amendment also \nrequires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to work in \ncoordination with the Attorney General's National Task Force on \nViolence Against Health Care Providers to submit an annual report to \nCongress identifying the best practices to ensure the security and \nsafety of clinics, providers, facilities, and staff. We cannot waste \nanother minute on yet another vicious, wrongheaded assault on women's \nhealth.\n  As I said, if you don't want women to have the right to choose, then \nhave the courage to come down here and take it away. But don't do it \nthrough the back door by attacking an organization that provides health \ncare to 3 million people every year. If you don't want fetal tissue \nresearch that has been legal for a very long time--since 1993 we have \nhad government funding. If you don't like it, if you don't think it is \nhelping find cures for diseases, come down here and stop it. Don't \nattack an organization that is involved in that activity legally. If \nyou want to take us back to pre-1973 when women died in back alleys, \nhave the courage to come down here and make your case. Believe me, we \nwill take you on, but do it because that is what you want. Don't hide \nbehind attacking these organizations. That is a phony way to approach \nsomething. Approach it straight ahead.\n  We have fought this fight before. We have won this fight before. They \nwanted to shut down the government. We said: Go ahead; try it. And we \nbeat them.\n  They are doing it again. I have to say, this isn't about me. This \nisn't about Senator Murray. This isn't about any individual Senator on \nthe other side.\n  We are here for a little time in history. In America, we don't go \nback. I say to the party of the past: We don't go back in America. We \ngo forward. We don't take away rights. We expand rights. We don't have \nBig Government telling people what to do in the privacy of their own \nhomes, their own bedrooms, their own lives. We let them make the \ndecision, as long as it is legal. We are going to fight to make sure \nmen and women across this country continue to get the services they \nneed. We are going to make sure that Planned Parenthood is still there \nfor the millions of women and families who depend on it.\n  I strongly support the Murray amendment. I compliment her for putting \nit together. I hope we get a good vote--maybe even a majority vote--and \nmake a strong statement for this Senate that we stand with the 3 \nmillion people who rely on Planned Parenthood, and we stand for health \ncare.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I have been able to sit in and listen to \nthe debate today about bringing forward a bill that will do two simple \nthings: remove funding from the single largest provider of abortions in \nthe country, an organization that has recently sold the body parts of \nchildren to the highest bidder. Also, we would deal with one of the \nmain issues that I face every single day in my State, as people \nstruggle under the harmful effects every day of the Affordable Care \nAct, which has proven to be neither affordable nor caring to many \npeople in my State.\n  Let me say some of the things that I have heard recently--that this \nis all about going after women's health. As a very proud husband of a \nvery beautiful lady and a proud dad of two beautiful daughters and as a \nson of a breast cancer survivor, this has nothing to do with going \nafter women's health, nor demonizing women, nor the war on women, nor \nall the other accusations that I have recently heard. This is not about \nprotecting what I have heard called a lifesaving health care \norganization where 325,000 children died in it last year. This is about \na simple thing: children.\n  In the past, back in the old days, they used to identify tissue as \njust tissue. The wart on your skin and other tissues in your body were \nexpendable, and it was just tissue, so why does it matter? In the past \npeople used to think that way, but now science is able to look inside \nthe womb and is able to count 10 fingers and 10 toes on a child and \nwatch a child suck its thumb. Scientists can look inside and take a \nsample and see that that child has different DNA than the mom and dad. \nWe are now able to look inside the womb and see a unique fingerprint \nthat is different from the mom and dad's fingerprint. We understand \nsomething different now because in the past there was a belief that it \nwas just tissue, but now we understand it is not tissue. It is a child. \nAs Americans we believe in a simple thing: life, liberty, and the \npursuit of happiness. It has been what we have been all about from the \nbeginning. This is not some attack on women's health. These are \nmillions of voices rising up around the Nation and saying: We are \nbetter than this as a nation.\n  Why would we continue to supplement the death of children? Why would \nwe do that? Can we be better than that? In the days ahead, I firmly \nbelieve we are on the right side of history, those of us who stand up \nfor children and for those who cannot speak for themselves. The most \ninnocent and vulnerable in our society need our protection. Just \nbecause they are small and just because you can't see them doesn't mean \nthey are not valuable and can be thrown away. These are children we are \ntalking about--little girls, little boys--and we think it is important \nthat someone in this country speaks out for them.\n  I have heard of late that those of us who speak for life should be \nquieter because there are irrational people in the country who would \nattack a Planned Parenthood clinic. I just have to reinforce this \npoint: No one who speaks for life goes and takes a life. No one who \nspeaks for the lives of children runs out and takes the life of an \nadult and says that is justifiable. It is not justifiable. It is \nhorrific. But just like those individuals who speak tenaciously against \nreligion shouldn't be silenced because there was a shooting in a \nchurch, saying people who are anti-faith should suddenly have no voice \nin America because some irrational person shoots someone in a church, \nthe same is true that individuals who speak out for the lives of \nchildren shouldn't suddenly be silenced by being screamed down because \nan insane person does a shooting in a clinic. Both of them are wrong.\n  It is reasonable for us to ask a simple question: Can we, as a \nnation, start a conversation again about children with 10 fingers and \n10 toes and unique DNA with life and promise? Can someone speak out for \nthem? I think we can.\n  This conversation today is also about the Affordable Care Act, its \npromises, and what has actually occurred. There is no question we have \nmajor health care delivery issues in America. There is no question we \nhave major insurance issues in America. It has been that way for a \nwhile, and it needs desperate resolution.\n  My State, like many other States, started stepping into this. A \nDemocratic Governor from my State led the way with our legislature in \n2004 to pass\n\n[[Page S8258]]\n\nsomething called Insure Oklahoma and start the process in our State, \nasking: What can we do to try to help the most vulnerable in our State? \nHow can we help provide some supplement to another plan?\n  We received waivers around Medicaid and started working through a \nprocess both for those who are employed and not employed to help \nprovide that safety net for those individuals. It was a very successful \nplan until the Affordable Care Act was passed, and then the waivers \nwere removed from our State and those individuals under that plan lost \ntheir plan and had to change to another one. In fact, I had some of \nthose individuals approach me and say: I know this is a plan that is \nprovided by our State so it will be grandfathered into the Affordable \nCare Act, won't it? I had to tell them: No, it will not. We have been \ndenied on that.\n  It is remarkable to me, as we deal with these two topics side by \nside, how some of the opponents of life can say: We want freedom of \nchoice and Big Government out of our lives, but when we get to health \ncare delivery, the bigger the government, the better. We want less \nchoice. We don't want States to have the option to do that. We don't \nwant businesses to be able to choose how they are going to do that. We \ndon't want individuals to be able to have that choice. We want Big \nGovernment to step into people's lives and their health care delivery \nand tell them how it is going to be done. It is fascinating to me to be \nable to see those two issues juxtaposed all of a sudden--get government \nout of our lives but get more government into our health care.\n  Now what do we do?\n  In 2010, President Obama made this statement in his State of the \nUnion Address:\n\n       By the time I'm finished speaking tonight, more Americans \n     will have lost their health insurance. Millions will lose it \n     this year. Our deficit will grow. Premiums will go up. Co-\n     pays will go up. Patients will be denied the care they need. \n     Small business owners will continue to drop coverage \n     altogether. I will not walk away from these Americans and \n     neither should the people in this Chamber.\n\n  It is an interesting statement based on what actually occurred then \nafter the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was actually \npassed, which is another issue to me. It is interesting to me how now \nthis is really called ObamaCare or the Affordable Care Act. Almost no \none calls it the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, when that \nwas originally its name, and now for some reason patient protection has \nbeen dropped from our vernacular when this bill is discussed.\n  So he made the statement that more Americans will have lost their \nhealth insurance. I have already referenced how we had thousands of \nOklahomans lose their health care coverage as soon as the Affordable \nCare Act went into place because they were on Insure Oklahoma. That \ncoverage was lost for them. We now have fewer options in Oklahoma for \nhealth care.\n  Blue Cross Blue Shield began notifying 40,000 Oklahomans it will no \nlonger offer the Blue Choice provider network to individuals. \nCommunityCare of Oklahoma, a Tulsa-based company offering health \nmaintenance organization plans, has notified the Federal Government it \nplans to drop out of the Affordable Care Act market. GlobalHealth, \nanother Tulsa-based HMO insurer, said it has already notified \nOklahomans it is leaving the Affordable Care Act market. Assurant \nHealth, a Wisconsin company that has also covered Oklahomans, has now \nnotified the government it is leaving the health care coverage area. \nUnitedHealthcare, the new participant in Oklahoma's Affordable Care Act \nmarket, has not announced the details of the plans it will offer, but \nState officials said its rates will be competitive. That will be \ninteresting because next year the rates in Oklahoma will go up, on \naverage, 35 percent. That is not some projected number. That is the \nactual number that rates will increase in my State--35 percent.\n  It is interesting to me that yesterday on this same floor I heard \narguments back and forth about the cost-of-living increase and the need \nfor individuals who are in a vulnerable position and are receiving \nSocial Security--need that help for a cost-of-living increase. I \ncompletely understand the dynamic of that, but at the same time \nindividuals who would support a cost-of-living increase for Social \nSecurity recipients don't seem to bat an eye when people in my State \nhave health insurance increases of 35 percent next year. Do you know \nhow difficult it is to cover a 35-percent health care premium increase?\n  While the President was speaking in 2010, he said that the premiums \nwill go up. Under the plan he put into place, the premiums will \ndramatically go up in my State in 2016. The President said while \nspeaking in 2010: ``The copays will go up unless we don't do \nsomething.''\n  The editorial board of the great Oklahoma newspaper, The Oklahoman, \non November 30, said:\n\n       Numerous reports have noted that policies sold through \n     ObamaCare exchanges increasingly rely on very high \n     deductibles with limited provider networks. For someone with \n     a major illness such as cancer, these policies are still \n     beneficial. But for relatively healthy people, the \n     deductibles are so high that there's little functional \n     difference between being uninsured and insured when it comes \n     to an impact on one's personal finances.\n\n  I cannot tell you the number of Oklahomans I have talked to who have \nsaid this one thing to me: I have insurance because the law requires me \nto do it, but it is so expensive I cannot use it. So I literally pay \nfor something because I am forced to, but I can't actually use it on a \nday-to-day basis because the copays are so high.\n  I hear the same thing from doctors and hospitals. Hospitals were told \nthat their charity care would go down because everyone will be forced \nto have insurance. Here is what I actually hear from the hospitals in \nOklahoma: Their charity care has gone up, all of them. Their charity \ncare and their writeoff have gone up because now those individuals walk \ninto those hospitals and say: I have insurance. But when they get the \nbill and realize how high their payment will be, they say: I cannot pay \nit. So the charity care at hospitals has actually gone up.\n  This is from a statement President Obama made in 2010: ``Patients \nwill be denied the care that they need.'' Well, let me give you an \nexample. On June 4 of this year, there was a highlight of Kaylen \nRichter, a 4-year-old who was denied coverage under the marketplace for \na prescription she needed for her asthma. We have a loss of choice and \na loss of competition in my State. Instead of more options, we have \nfewer options.\n  Doctors' offices are selling out because physicians can't seem to \nmake ends meet. There are so many requirements on them, they are \nselling their private practice and going into larger hospital \npractices. Hospitals are actually having to take in diagnostic \nfacilities. Hospitals are taking care of individual physician \npractices. Hospitals are combining with other hospitals.\n  Instead of greater competition, we see a smaller number of hospitals \nand a smaller number of entities. Instead, hospitals and entities are \nbecoming larger and larger to be able to sustain that. We have even \nseen that nationally in the insurance market. Because of what is \nhappening in the Affordable Care Act, it is pushing out insurance \naround the country. Remember the great statement: It is not government-\ncontrolled health care, it is insurance. Right now, Anthem, Cigna, \nAetna, and Humana are all going through a combining process, where \nthose four insurance companies that are national, large-scale companies \nrealize they cannot make it under the Affordable Care Act and are \nmerging into one giant company to see if they can make it as a giant \ncompany, resulting in fewer options, fewer choices, and centrally \ncontrolled health care.\n  How do we turn this back? I will tell you in some ways, you can't. \nThe Democrats and President, who have passed this, have succeeded in \npermanently changing health care in America.\n  Those individual physicians who used to practice individual medicine \nall over the country and have now merged into larger hospitals, you \ndon't undo that. Those individuals who were going to go into medical \nschool but chose not to now, you don't undo that for a generation. \nThese insurance companies that combined into large groups, you don't \nundo that. The diagnostic facilities that are going out of business and \nmerging with large hospitals, you don't just quickly undo that. They \nhave succeeded at permanently changing health care delivery in America.\n  The challenge now is, How do we help in the days ahead? What do we \ndo? I\n\n[[Page S8259]]\n\nwill say that some things can be done. We can continue to provide \ngreater options, but the first thing we can do is stop the \nhemorrhaging. First, do no harm. First, engage and try to help the \npeople who are affected by this.\n  I have offered an amendment in this bill that deals with something \ncalled the health care compact. It allows individual States that want \nto be able to manage their health care to be able to manage the health \ncare in their State. This may seem like a crazy idea except it is \nalready done in every single State right now. Every single State \nalready has a Medicaid process, has a health care authority, and has \nalready made decisions which are severely limited by Federal \nregulations, but that structure is already in place to take care of the \nmost vulnerable in our Nation.\n  The health care compact would allow States to be able to broaden \ntheir authorities and to be able to do what needs to be done in order \nto take care of the individuals in their State, as my State has tried \nso hard to do with Insure Oklahoma and other options to be made \navailable to people in my State that are being forbidden by the Federal \nGovernment. This would open that back up and would allow that \ncompetition.\n  I can assure you that every time I speak to smaller rural hospitals \nin my State, they cannot get the attention of CMS and the Federal \nGovernment because they are small and rural and people in DC don't know \nwhere they are located and they don't have a big enough lobbying voice. \nThey are just another one of those community hospitals out there. That \ndoesn't happen if they are interacting with people in my State. Because \nthose health care parameters are being set by people in Oklahoma City \nand our State capitol, they know every small rural hospital and the \ndynamics and difficulties there. They are not last in line. They are a \npart of the family.\n  Allowing individual States to be able to make health care decisions \nthrough a health care compact that actually allows that State to be \nable to manage health care in their State is a tremendous asset. My \nState, along with eight other States, has asked for that. It is not an \nunfair request. It is something we should make available to States that \nchoose to do that.\n  Will every State choose to do that? No. Some States will probably \nwant the Federal Government to be able to manage their health care. \nThose States are free to do that, but for States that want to be able \nto have that choice, allow them to have the freedom to do that. If they \nhave the structure in place to fulfill the needs within their State, \nwhy would we forbid it? Why in the world would we say that those of us \nin Washington, DC, know and care more for Oklahomans than Oklahomans? \nWhen the folks in Washington, DC, say: No, we care more about that \nState and those people in that State rather than the people of that \nState, I think they are misguided. This can be done differently.\n\n  What are we up against? We are up against real people who face real \nissues. It has been incredibly difficult for them to be able to walk \nthrough the ObamaCare transition. This is not about patient protection, \nand it has been far from affordable as prices continue to go up.\n  Let me read one story from my State. It is from a lady who lives in a \nrural area in my State, which has been one of the toughest areas. The \nAffordable Care Act assumes everyone lives in New York City or some \nmetropolitan area. Welcome to the rest of America. Not everyone lives \nin big, urban settings. This is one of those folks. She lives in a \nrural area, not too far, but a good distance, from Oklahoma City.\n  She said she sold some land recently--and by the way, she is on a \nhealth care exchange. She sold some land recently, which we do in rural \nAmerica. That made her income go up significantly for that 1 year--one \nland sale. She said the marketplace doesn't see it as a 1-year thing, \nso they take all the information about her subsidies on that before \ntaxes. So it raised her premium from $43 to $400. She said she is going \nto try to figure out a way to be able to manage that.\n  Then she says this: Why does she have to pay so much for a plan that \nis not even usable in her area? No one will take her insurance, and \nproviders are dropping it because they are not getting paid. She has to \ntravel now all the way to Oklahoma City so she can find care at all. \nAll she is looking for is an affordable option and providers in her \narea that will actually take it. It is one thing to say it provides an \noption. It is another thing to say people can actually access that \noption.\n  We can do better as Americans. This is a conversation we should have. \nLet's have it. Let's talk about a better way to be able to do this. \nThis is not about fixing something. This is about a transition that is \nhappening in health care in America that needs to be corrected. We can \nnever go back to where we were. There has been too much permanent \ndamage in the system. Now it is a matter of what can be done that is \nbest for people--not what is best for the Federal Government but what \nis best for the people of our States. Let's do it.\n  I encourage the adoption of my amendment, and I encourage the \nadoption of this reconciliation package that is before our Nation and \nthis body in the days ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have a few remarks to respond to my \ncolleague's remarks, and then I ask--I am not going to be long--to be \nimmediately followed by Senator Blumenthal.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I would have objection to that request \nif I am not able to respond to the comments she makes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. OK, I will just yield to the Senator from Connecticut for \na question, and I will give him his time that way.\n  My colleague from Oklahoma came down, and, first of all, he talks \nabout ObamaCare and forgets the fact that there are millions and \nmillions and millions of Americans who now have insurance, the same \nkind of insurance he has as a Senator and I have as a Senator. He \nforgets the fact, No. 1, that we have seen more people insured than in \nmodern history. He conveniently forgets that fact. He forgets the fact \nthat there are no limits on coverage. Insurance companies can't cancel \na person's health insurance.\n  He talks about children with great eloquence--and I am sure he is a \nfantastic parent--but he forgets that 17 million children with pre-\nexisting conditions are insured, which is a pretty important point.\n  I really have to take offense to some of the remarks of my colleague. \nHe makes an eloquent point about States' rights. He finishes his \nargument about ObamaCare saying: Don't have the Federal Government tell \nmy State what to do. Well, in essence, ObamaCare doesn't do that. We \nhave an exchange. But, yes, we do require people to get insurance. That \nis true, and that comes from the plan of a Republican Governor named \nMitt Romney. Then he says: Leave my State alone. Then he wants to take \naway a woman's right to choose an abortion. He wants to do that. He \nthinks the Federal Government should do that. So he makes an eloquent \npoint about States' rights, but he, as a Senator who doesn't believe in \nabortion--and that is his total right, and I respect it and I defend \nit--basically says he wants to decide for everybody in the country that \nthey shouldn't be able to have an abortion because he doesn't approve \nof that. What makes his opinion more important than mine? There are \ndozens--it isn't. This is America. We all have different views about \nwhen life begins, about Roe v. Wade. Yet he stands here and uses \nrhetoric that I say is irresponsible. That is my opinion. It is my \nopinion, not his.\n  Now, the Senator started off his discussion by saying the truth, that \nhe has a beautiful wife and a beautiful family. Well, I want the \nSenator to know I have a handsome husband and a beautiful family. So he \nhas a beautiful wife and a beautiful family, and I have a handsome \nhusband and a beautiful family. What the heck does that have to do with \nanything else? We are both parents. I am a grandparent. I gave birth. \nWhat does that have to do with this conversation? The fact of the \nmatter is it is not about your beautiful family or my beautiful family. \nIt is about the beautiful families out there who, A, need insurance, \nand B, will make their own decision in America about when life begins, \nand who will make their own decision in America as to whether they \nsupport Roe v. Wade.\n\n[[Page S8260]]\n\n  Then my friend says that someone in his family survived cancer--and \nthank God. I have had friends who have survived it, and I have friends \nwho have died from it and family members as well.\n  This conversation has nothing to do with our lives personally. It has \nto do with the other lives that we impact when we say we are going to \ntake away health care from 3 million Americans who get it from Planned \nParenthood.\n  Now, my friend lectures us. He has done this before. He and I have \ngone at this before. It is fine. He talks about his deep feelings about \nhow he is against abortion at any stage. Then why doesn't he come to \nthe floor, after all his rhetoric--I listened to it and I am offended \nby it, frankly--why doesn't he come down here and right a wrong that \nsays it is a crime to have an abortion and you should go to jail. That \nis what he is basically saying, if we listen to his rhetoric, the words \nhe used. No, he doesn't do that. I checked his legislative record. He \njust wants to defund organizations that are operating under complete \nlegality--under Roe v. Wade, the law of the land.\n  Abortion has been legal since 1973. The Senator doesn't agree with \nit. I have total respect for that. But if you think it is a crime, then \ngo ahead, instead of coming here and giving these speeches about those \nof us who happen to believe it is up to a woman to decide these issues. \nHe is really basically saying we are advocating a crime, and that is \noffensive. I would never say that to my friend, never. And then, of \ncourse, the whole party over there is attacking an organization that is \noperating legally under the law. Ninety-seven percent of what they do \nis breast cancer screenings, STD screenings, cervical cancer \nscreenings--saving peoples' lives. I have met them. I have looked them \nin the eye. I know what I am talking about.\n  So if you don't think that 3 percent of the work Planned Parenthood \ndoes--which is absolutely connected to reproductive health, the 3 \npercent--then come down and say it is a crime. But I bet none of my \nfriends would do that, because if I went to my people and I said \nRepublicans think you should go to jail if you have an abortion or go \nto jail if you take a contraception--some of them feel that way, not \nall of them--they would really be in trouble at the polls.\n  When you make these verbal attacks on people who don't agree with \nyou, sir, your words matter. Your words matter. They have an impact. \nYou are here because you are eloquent. Your words have an impact, and \nif what you want to have happen is to put people in jail for performing \na legal procedure, come down here and do that, but don't come down here \nand say what you think is a crime and then say, therefore, we are going \nto defund an organization that is operating illegally.\n  Now, my friend from the other side of the aisle may not like it, but \n3 million people count on Planned Parenthood, and his approach is an \nattack on those 3 million people. More than--I don't know how many \npeople live in Oklahoma, but I would assume it is fewer than that, \nperhaps.\n  This obsession in repealing ObamaCare, despite the fact that it is \nhelping so many people, is of epic proportions. We have seen a repeal \nin the House of Representatives 52 times.\n  I wonder if my friend from Connecticut wanted me to yield for a \nquestion or if he is going to wait.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I will wait.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, just to sum it all up, it is offensive to \nhear someone describe what is the law of the land as a criminal act. It \nis offensive, to describe it as a crime. But more than that, if that is \nwhat you believe--and I respect your right to believe it--then come up \nhere and do what you are doing. Overturn Roe v. Wade. Tell the women of \nAmerica they have no right to choose anymore. If that is what you want \nto do, go ahead and do it. If you want to make it a crime, make it a \ncrime. That is honest. What is dishonest is to attack an organization \nthat is acting within the law, which is helping 3 million people, and I \nwould say that is what this debate is about.\n  I just hope the Murray amendment passes today. It will send a strong \nsignal. And if it doesn't pass, we know this bill is going to be \nvetoed, because this President understands that this government is not \nthe be all and end all. We are not the moral voice of the universe. We \nare not. People don't even like us as an institution. Let them make up \ntheir own minds in their own homes, with their own God, with their own \nfamily. I support them, whatever their decision is. Whether they are \npro-choice, whether they are anti-choice, I will fight for their right \nto decide for themselves, but I will not force my view on somebody \nelse. That is what being pro-choice means, that you are willing to \nunderstand that there are different positions. I don't have every \nanswer, and the Senator from Oklahoma doesn't have every answer. It is \ncalled humility. I don't have the answer. I will trust my constituents \nto make that decision.\n  I hope that we will stop this attack on Planned Parenthood. If this \nis really about a woman's right to choose, let's have that debate. If \nyou want to call it a crime, which I have heard on this floor, then put \nyour bill out there. Tell people they are committing a crime. Put them \nin jail. Do that. We will have the debate, and we will win that debate, \nbut don't go after organizations that are acting completely within the \nlaw.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield such time as the Senator from \nOklahoma needs to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). Senators are reminded that they \nwill refer to each other in the third person.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  That was actually the first thing I was going to say, that we refer \nback to Senate rules that we are to address the Presiding Officer \nrather than each other, and I appreciate the Presiding Officer \nacknowledging that, according to Senate rules.\n  My simple statement today was not intended to be offensive. In fact, \nI think if I went back through the transcript of what I said--I am \nlooking for what was offensive rhetoric that was stated multiple times \nby the Senator from California. As I try to think back through what was \noffensive rhetoric, my saying that children have ten fingers and ten \ntoes, unique DNA, and a unique fingerprint doesn't seem to be \noffensive. I think also if I went through the legislative record, I \nnever talked about criminalizing anything. I heard multiple times \nthrough a conversation on the floor that I was criminalizing, \ncriminalizing, criminalizing. I was actually speaking out for millions \nof children each year that die and saying: Would we not want to \nreconsider the new science that has been available in America for \ndecades now, to look inside the womb and see ten fingers and ten toes \nand unique DNA and a fingerprint that is different from the mom or the \ndad, and to understand that we have a basic principle as Americans to \nlife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness? That is a unique value.\n  Even the Supreme Court, when they ruled on Roe v. Wade, talked about \nviability. Current science continues to press on what is viable. A \nfriend of mine delivered last year a little girl that was 14 ounces. \nThat little girl is a healthy little girl now over 1 year old, \ncontinuing and doing fine. In 1973 that child would not have been \nviable. She is very much a child. She is beautiful.\n  As for this whole conversation about millions of people losing \ninsurance if ObamaCare goes away and don't I care about millions of \npeople and insurance, the issue is not millions of people being \ncovered. There are other ways to be able to help millions of Americans. \nAs I acknowledged when I spoke, there are real issues in health care \ndelivery in America and there are significant issues that continue to \nthis day. My simple statement was that those issues get larger and \nlarger, and my concern is that while individuals would stand up and say \nwe have millions of people covered, they ignore a 35-percent increase \nof premiums in my State. They ignore the reality of a growing copay in \nmy State and that people are forced by law to buy a product they cannot \nactually afford to use. My simple statement is this: Can we not \nacknowledge--not that there are not millions of people not newly \ncovered--that we have millions of people now that have a coverage that \nthey cannot use and cannot afford to keep yet they are compelled\n\n[[Page S8261]]\n\nby law to do it. In fact, they become criminals if they don't buy the \nhealth care coverage required by law. These are real issues and they \nreally do need dialogue. Good civil dialogue will help us work these \nthings out--and centering in on the facts.\n  With that, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2876\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues from \nOklahoma and California for this exchange of views, and most \nparticularly I want to thank my colleague from the State of Washington \nfor the amendment that she has offered that would, in effect, remove or \neliminate a harmful provision in the budget reconciliation bill, a \nprovision that would eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood and other \nproviders of reproductive health services for women. Very importantly, \nit would also establish a fund to assist the Department of Justice in \nmonitoring and combating violent opposition to women seeking access to \nlawful reproductive health services.\n  We can have a broad and comprehensive debate on a great many of the \nsubjects that are related to the amendment offered by Senator Murray, \nbut the simple fact is that funding for Planned Parenthood helps with \nwomen's health care. It provides services such as cancer screening, \nbirth control, and STI testing and treatment that simply are \ninaccessible and unavailable to those women anywhere else. For all the \ntalk about alternatives to Planned Parenthood, the women who receive \nservices through Planned Parenthood have nowhere else to go in so many \ninstances. In the majority of the care provided by Planned Parenthood, \ncancer screenings, birth control, and STI testing and treatment result \nin pregnancies that are wanted and intended and produce healthy \nchildren, as opposed to pregnancies that are unintended and unwanted, \nwhich certainly in this body and in America generally, no one wants to \nsee.\n  So I hope that we have common ground here, that an organization such \nas Planned Parenthood, which does so much good, and the men and women \nof Planned Parenthood, who have so much courage and fortitude in the \nface of threats and intimidation that confront them every day, should \nbe supported, not demeaned or dismissed. Their funding should be \nenhanced, not diminished. So far as enforcement is concerned, the \nDepartment of Justice should be doing more and doing better. It should \nbe provided with those funds that will assist in combatting and \nmonitoring the violent opposition to women who are seeking services. We \nhave seen in just the past few days the impact of that violence, \ntragically, in death and injury in Colorado. But that tragedy is simply \nthe tip of ongoing and apparently unceasing threats and intimidation at \nmany of those clinics and health care services around the country. So I \nsay with sadness--not anger but grief--in seeing the horrific impact of \nthis violence, that the services are necessary, health care should be \nsupported, and violent opposition should be monitored and prosecuted \nwherever it occurs.\n  Today I pay tribute to clinicians, professionals, volunteers, \nescorts, and all those who support Planned Parenthood and who continue \ntheir work in the face of the dangers that confront them day in and day \nout. I hope my colleagues will support me in endorsing Senator Murray's \namendment so we can ensure women continue to have access to these \nnecessary basic health care services.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. At the end of the year, Mr. President, when there is so \nmuch to do, I think it is particularly important for this body to try \nto find common ground on difficult issues, to try to be bipartisan. I \nmentioned it yesterday, but literally 24 hours ago, I joined with the \nsenior Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, on a bipartisan effort to deal \nwith this enormous challenge of making sure that when we have \nbreakthrough cures for serious illnesses here in our country, Americans \nare going to be able to afford them. Senator Grassley and I teamed up \nfor 18 months, reviewed 20,000 documents, did an exhaustive inquiry \ninto the new drugs that have come out to deal with hepatitis C, and \nthey are extraordinary drugs. The question is, Will Americans be able \nto pay for them? Senator Grassley and I thought it was very important \nto do it because this is what the future is going to be about.\n  I know the distinguished Senator's son is very interested in these \nhealth issues. As we try to get cures for Alzheimer's, diabetes, heart \ndisease, and the question of hepatitis C, it is wonderful to have the \ncure. The question is, Is it going to be beyond the reach of the \npeople? Senator Grassley and I, for over 18 months, worked \npainstakingly in a bipartisan kind of way, and it has been very well \nreceived. So 24 hours ago we were talking about that, and what I am so \ntroubled about this morning is that when we need bipartisanship more \nthan ever, we are looking at a partisan reconciliation bill that, in my \nview, will undermine women's health care in this country by denying \nfunding to Planned Parenthood.\n  My view is that to take away health care choices from American women \nthat have nothing to do with abortion--particularly after the horrific \nact last week in Colorado--is just an act of legislative malpractice \nthat is beneath the Senate.\n  I note that it is going to get a veto if it hits the President's \ndesk. My hope is that this body will not let it get that far.\n  It is long past time, in my view, to end the ongoing campaign to \nundermine the fundamental right of all women to make their own \nreproductive choices and access affordable high quality health care. \nMillions of American women, including tens of thousands in my home \nState of Oregon, turn to Planned Parenthood for the routine health care \nservices that this bill puts at risk. I have read this list on the \nfloor before, but it appears not to be sinking in. So let me repeat it. \nThis bill, for millions of women, could eliminate access to pregnancy \ntesting, possibly gone; and birth control, possibly gone; prenatal \nservices, possibly gone; HIV tests, possibly gone; cancer screenings, \npossibly gone; vaccinations, possibly gone; testing and treatment for \nsexually transmitted infections, possibly gone; basic physical exams, \npossibly gone; treatment for chronic conditions, possibly gone; \npediatric care, possibly gone; hospital and specialist referrals, \npossibly gone; adoption referrals, possibly gone; and nutrition \nprograms, possibly gone. When you wipe out Planned Parenthood's \nfunding, you dramatically curb access for women in this country to \nhealth care services that have absolutely nothing to do with abortion. \nI know that there is a smear campaign out there that says that is not \nthe case, but it is.\n  Senator Murray and I have a proposal that has taken a different tack. \nOur amendment says that instead of putting women's health care at risk, \nlet's do more to guarantee that women in Oregon and Washington and \nAlaska and across the country get the high quality care they need. \nLet's help our health care clinics treat more women, and let's help \nthem keep their patients safe when they walk through that door. The \nproposal that Senator Murray and I have put forward, in my view, is \nworthy of support from Democrats and Republicans. That has always been \nthe case.\n  I have enjoyed talking to my new colleague from Alaska, and we talked \nabout what has happened to this question of the Senate's historically \nbipartisan approach, which is why I spent some time talking about how \nproud I was to team up yesterday with the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Iowa, Mr. Grassley, on this question of making sure that when \nthere are breakthrough blockbuster cures, people can actually afford \nthem and can actually get them. Those kinds of issues, along with \nwomen's health, ought to be a bipartisan cause. It has historically \nbeen a bipartisan cause. My hope is that my new colleague from Alaska, \nthe distinguished Presiding Officer of the Senate, is going to continue \nthat as we talk about that kind of historical approach where we try to \nfind common ground on issues such as women's health care.\n  I also wish to note, colleagues, the reconciliation bill involves the \nSenate Finance Committee. Chairman Hatch, of course, chairs the \ncommittee; I am the ranking member. We have a significant role with \nrespect to these public\n\n[[Page S8262]]\n\nhealth programs, and we have tried to work in a bipartisan way. But \nthis reconciliation bill is a rejection of bipartisanship. It is going \nto pump more noise into the echo chamber, but my view is it is going to \ndrive the parties further apart in this effort that I look forward to \ntalking to our new colleague about, which is how we are going to get \npeople together to work in a bipartisan way for improving women's \nhealth care.\n  When you create such a vitriolic fever pitch, there are obviously \nreal consequences. To me, the politics of hostility and extremism help \nspark a culture of violence. And amid that dangerous and toxic culture, \na man walked into a Planned Parenthood clinic determined to do enormous \nharm. In my view, it attacks women's health. It is an attack on the \nAmerican public, and it cannot be tolerated. It must be fought and \nresisted at every opportunity.\n  At a moment when the Senate has a long list of issues to wrap up \nbefore the year's end and many serious challenges to face, my view is \nthat we ought to be in the business of trying to solve problems, not \ncreate more of them. It is not as if there is a shortage of things that \nhave to be addressed; we have plenty of stuff. So why in the world \nwould we want to reject the Senate's long tradition of bipartisanship \nand take a very partisan turn with this reconciliation bill?\n  I hope my colleagues will support the Murray-Wyden amendment when we \nvote on it, end the campaign against women's health, and do everything \nwe can to restore the historic tradition of this body working in a \nbipartisan way on women's health.\n  Without going into too much of the history when I was thinking about \ncoming over and thinking about the tradition of the Senate, one of the \nfirst things that happened when I came to the Senate is I had the \nopportunity to work with our former colleague Senator Snowe of Maine, \nwho was a champion of exactly these kinds of issues: choices for women \nand improvements in women's health care.\n  We can have all of that again--men and women working together in the \nSenate on behalf of the States that sent us to support improvements in \nwomen's health. To do that this week you have to support the Murray-\nWyden amendment.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I support the reconciliation bill that \nis before us. It will do the job. It will end the Affordable Care Act \nthat the American people rightly have opposed, and it will put us in a \nposition to repeal this monstrosity of a 1,700-page bill that was \njammed through Congress in the last hours before Christmas Eve in 2009.\n  I remember that day very well. It was a strict party-line vote and \nwas passed despite the objections of the American people. It resulted \nin quite a number of people who voted for it not being in the Senate or \nthe House again, and it remains a decisive issue for our country.\n  Six years ago, the American people did not favor this legislation, \nthey resisted it. But the Democratic leadership and President Obama \ndetermined they were going to pass it, no matter what the people said. \nThey were going to get this done, and they rammed it through on \nChristmas Eve of 2009, even though Scott Brown was elected a month \nlater in Massachusetts on a campaign to kill the bill. Had he been here \nat that time, there would have been only 59 votes, insufficient votes \nto shut off debate, and the bill would not have passed. He won in \nMassachusetts--one of our most liberal States--on a campaign that said: \nI will be the vote that kills this legislation. So I want to say first \nand foremost that the American people knew this wouldn't work. They \nopposed it from the beginning, they opposed the philosophy of it, and \nthey knew we were going to have a mess on our hands.\n  Now we have a majority of Republicans in both Houses. There are 54 \nRepublican Senators in the Senate. We are going to move this \nreconciliation bill, and it will end the effectiveness of ObamaCare. \nBut we know the President will veto it.\n  I will just say this, colleagues. This is a historic moment. This is \na moment of great importance nearly 6 years after this bill passed. You \ncan be sure the people who pushed it to passage were absolutely \nconfident that although the people opposed it then, they would get used \nto it, they would go along with it, and it could never be repealed. But \nthat has not happened. The voters have elected Members of Congress to \noppose this legislation. The polling data shows continued strong \nopposition to this legislation. What we are going to do is establish \nthat the elected Congress, a majority in both Houses, opposes this \nterrible law and we will vote to end this incredible piece of \nlegislation.\n  We knew it was bad, but there was no way we could have understood \nwhat was in all of those pages. Health care is utterly complex. It is \nso different in every state from Wyoming, Alabama, New York, \nMassachusetts, and California, and even cities within the States--it is \nall different. So, a one-sized-fits-all approach dictated by the \nfederal government simply will not work.\n  The Federal Government cannot run anything very well, frankly. We \nabsolutely do not need to be involving ourselves in and dominating \nhealth care in America. That is not the way to get better health care \nfor our people.\n  It was obvious from the beginning that we were going to have high \ncosts and difficulties, but it actually rolled out with more difficulty \nthan people could have imagined, starting with the failed computer \nsystems. We had Democrats and Republicans concerned over how it was \nbeing carried out. It was bad from the beginning, and things are not \ngetting any better.\n  One of the most dramatic promises the President of the United States \nmade to the American people was in September of 2009. In pushing for \nthis legislation, he said:\n\n       The plan I'm announcing tonight would meet three basic \n     goals. . . . it will slow the growth of health care costs for \n     our families, our businesses, and our government.\n\n  Well, that has not happened. In fact, health care costs for the \ninsured in America are surging. In Alabama we are seeing 28 percent \nincreases in premiums. I am going to read some letters from people who \nsay what has happened to their insurance premiums and how incredibly \nhigh the deductibles are. No one has written my office to tell me that \ntheir healthcare costs have decreased.\n  President Obama went so far at one point to promise that his health \ncare plan would ``bring down premiums by $2,500 for the typical \nfamily.''\n  The American people didn't buy that. They have heard these kinds of \nbig government schemes before. They want to go to their doctors. They \nwere pretty confident in their plans, and they were worried about \ncosts, so this promise meant a lot to them. The President of the United \nStates had said that costs were going to come down. That meant a lot, \nbut they were skeptical. Their instinct, though, was correct because it \nhasn't happened, and health care costs have continued to go up.\n  The administration has acknowledged that many consumers will see \nnoticeable premium increases--and indeed we have--when buying health \ncare on the ObamaCare exchanges in 2016. According to Health and Human \nServices' own data--government's agency--premiums would increase by an \naverage of 7.5 percent for the benchmark silver plans in 2016 in 37 \nStates using the exchanges, which includes Alabama. But, the rates for \nthe benchmark plan in Alabama will increase by even more than that in \n2016--by 12.6 percent.\n  For 2016, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama, the largest insurer in \nthe State, reported an increase of 28 percent for individual plans and \n13.8 percent for small group plans. These are huge costs. Currently, \nBlue Cross Blue Shield plans on the Obamacare exchange cover about \n174,000 Alabamans. This is real money for a lot of people.\n  BCBS initially proposed to increase the premiums for the platinum \nplans, the highest coverage, by 71 percent but later reported a final \nincrease of 28 percent. We saw the same trend with the gold plans--BCBS \ninitially requested a 53 percent increase, but it was finally reduced \nto 28 percent.\n  UnitedHealthcare, the second largest insurer in the State and one of \nthe largest in the country, reported an average increase of 24.5 \npercent. This amounts to real money out of the pockets of real \nAmericans.\n\n[[Page S8263]]\n\n  So, it is clear that the healthcare law is fundamentally raising \ncosts, reducing choice, and is opposed by the American people.\n  In June of 2009, President Obama stated:\n\n       If you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep \n     your health care plan. Period.\n\n  That meant a lot to people. A lot of people said: Well, if they do \nall that--but if I can keep my plan, I am not too worried about it, as \nlong as I can keep my plan.\n  Did that turn out to be true? No, it did not. By the end of 2013, the \nAssociated Press reported that 4.7 million Americans received \ncancellation notices for their insurance plans due to the Affordable \nCare Act.\n  In 2013, PolitiFact defined the ``Lie of the Year'' as President \nObama's promise that ``If you like your health care plan, you can keep \nit.''\n  They just said it. Costs are going down, and you can keep your health \ncare plan if you want to. They continued to say that, and they were \nable to get the law through Congress. But even then, the polling data \nshowed the American people did not support this plan. Scott Brown of \nMassachusetts ran on it in the liberal State of Massachusetts. He said: \nElect me, and I will be the vote that kills it. But, they got it done \nbefore he could take office.\n  Under this so-called ``affordable act,'' we have higher premiums and \nhigher deductibles. Great Scott, I am amazed at how high the \ndeductibles have become. This is a communication from an individual in \nthe Birmingham area. He wrote to me in June of this year:\n\n       I am an owner of a small 10 person CPA firm in Vestavia. In \n     our group plan offered by BCBS, for our family of 5 our BCBS \n     health insurance went up by $6k a year last year and we are \n     facing more increases this year from BCBS. In our case, this \n     puts our family spending right at $24,000 a year on health \n     insurance. We are blessed enough that we don't qualify for a \n     subsidy and our new policy has less coverage much higher \n     deductibles and more out of pocket costs than ever before. \n     But that said, we are currently spending 18% of our family's \n     AGI on health insurance premiums.\n\n  He is not happy.\n  Another individual from Mobile, AL, writes me:\n\n       First year premiums 300 per month, last year 405 dollars \n     per month and now for 2016 premium to be 1562 per month. I am \n     being penalized for having worked all my life and having a \n     retirement and income that puts me in an area with no \n     subsidy. The premium is more than what I get from Social \n     Security. This is going to put me into a area where we \n     decide, my wife and I, on whether or not to get insurance.\n\n  This is from a Ph.D., who wrote:\n\n       For the first time, in 2011, my medical insurance premiums \n     exceeded my mortgage, and they have continued to climb ever \n     since. I now pay over $1,400 a month for mediocre coverage, \n     and it's breaking us. . . . We need a new approach that is \n     market driven and consumer oriented, an approach that doesn't \n     penalize people for failure to participate in the market \n     through a cleverly disguised fine designed to coerce \n     participation from the free citizens of these United States.\n\n  Another individual in the Montgomery area wrote:\n\n       We just received notification at my place of employment \n     that our health insurance premiums are going [up] at least 25 \n     percent this year and possibly 40 percent next year. As the \n     controller here, with 100 employees, we cannot afford these \n     increases. We have already seen our benefits reduced to try \n     to keep the costs lower but if we keep on at this rate we \n     will be paying even more for less coverage.\n\n  That is the real world. And I feel strongly that this is happening \nout there all over our country.\n  What I want to say to those who are frustrated, who think nothing can \nbe done, that is not so. What will be demonstrated today is that the \nmajority of both Houses of Congress has the ability to pass legislation \nthat will essentially eliminate this plan and require a complete \noverhaul of our health care system. We have the votes to do it. Yes, it \nwill be vetoed by the President of the United States. He has rejected \nany and all improvements ever since the bill was passed. He has fought \nvirtually everything that would make the bill better. No changes can be \nmade in this legislation. But he won't be President forever. We are \ngoing to have another President soon. That is a fact. And this new \nPresident can sign a reconciliation bill. We will then be able to \nimprove health care in America, to use common sense and not create a \ngovernment bureaucracy of monumental proportions, and to actually serve \nthe people we represent. We can enable them to have the type of health \ncare policies that they need, at prices they can afford, and help \npeople in need, in the same way we do today. But, we will eliminate \nthis entire government takeover of healthcare.\n  Several years ago, when asked if he believed in a single-payer plan \nfor health care in America, Senator Reid, the Democratic leader, said: \nYes, yes, absolutely yes. I raised that in the Committee on the Budget, \nand we had two Democratic members say: I, too, believe in a single \npayer for health care in America. One said: I will acknowledge the \nhealth care law is not workable today, and the only way to really make \nit work is to go to a single payer--in other words, a government-\ndominated health care system in America. I don't think that is the \nright way to go. The American people don't think that is the right way \nto go. They oppose that now, they opposed it steadfastly throughout, \nand they are being proven correct. It is not working. The promises made \nfor it were wrong then and are being proven wrong every month that goes \nby.\n  Mr. President, this is an important vote. Don't let anyone suggest it \nis not. It is a definitional vote: Do you want to fix the broken health \ncare system or do you want to just continue it with no real reform? \nThat is the choice.\n  I hope we will have bipartisan support for making this kind of \nchange. I hope and believe that if this legislation is vetoed by this \nPresident, we will have a new President in not too many months who will \nsign such legislation and allow us then to create the kind of positive \nhealth care system the people of this country deserve.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to say that it has been interesting \nto hear the debate. It has touched on a lot of things that are close to \nmy heart and that I know are close to a lot of other people's hearts, \nwhich is getting health care to more people--health care that is \naffordable, health care that wasn't available before--and also, \nfrankly, making sure we don't have attacks continue on an organization \ncalled Planned Parenthood that delivers lifesaving health care to 3 \nmillion Americans each and every year.\n  There are a couple of points I would like to make. In a very strong \ndebate I had with the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Lankford, I stated \nthat I was offended because I believed that--Mr. President, I will go \nthrough you. The Senator basically said that those of us who are pro-\nchoice are essentially supporting a crime against children, and he took \nissue with that and said he didn't. Well, I want to place in the Record \nhis exact words, if I might.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. This is from the transcript. After talking about \nabortion, he says:\n\n       Why would we continue to supplement the death of children?\n\n  ``Why would we continue to supplement the death of children?'' As I \nread the English language, that would be an accessory to a crime. So I \nstand by my words. And I would say again, if the issue is whether \nabortion should be legal, that is a fair issue. And I think if people \nfeel it is a crime, then they ought to come down here with their \nlegislation to put women in jail. I think that debate would be \nimportant. But they shouldn't attack an organization that is legal--\nPlanned Parenthood--that is living within the law, and 97 percent of \nwhat they do has nothing to do with choice, and the other 3 percent is \ntotally legal.\n  The GOP has tried to repeal ObamaCare dozens of times. This is \nanother time. I do agree we have to fix certain aspects of the \nAffordable Care Act, ObamaCare. Absolutely. In my State, it is a raging \nsuccess. In California, I want you to know we have 40 million people, \nso this is a very big test case. We are like the fifth or sixth largest \ncountry when it comes to the economy. We have seen the uninsured rates \nin California drop from 17.2 percent in 2013 to 12.4 percent today--in \n2014. We have seen more than 4 million previously uninsured \nCalifornians get some sort of health care coverage. And I can say that, \nyes, we have to make\n\n[[Page S8264]]\n\nsure the competition works. What we have in place is not a single-payer \nlaw. We have in place an exchange where private companies come in. The \ncompetition is important, and if it isn't robust, there are going to be \nthese increases. So I think it is very important. For the people who \ncan't afford to get insurance off Covered California, which is our \nexchange, we have seen 3.5 million more Californians enroll in Medi-Cal \nthanks to the Medicaid expansion.\n  Also, in this country, 30 million women with health insurance are \nable to access contraception without any cost-sharing. That is very, \nvery important because I would hope we would agree that unintended \npregnancies are not what we want regardless of whether we are pro-\nchoice or anti-choice. That is important for planning pregnancies. In \n2013 women across this country saved more than $483 million in out-of-\npocket costs for birth control.\n  I know there is concern about ObamaCare that continues and rages on. \nI think the question is, Do we want to make it work better--of course \nthere are things we can do to make it work better--or do we want to go \nback to the days when if you had high blood pressure or diabetes, you \ncouldn't get a policy?\n  I remember so clearly constituents grabbing me by the arm and saying: \nMy son was born with a disability. I can't get coverage. What am I \ngoing to do?\n  People went broke. People lost their homes and they lost their \nsavings before the Affordable Care Act.\n  As I say, nothing is perfect, nobody is perfect--not each of us, that \nis for sure--and the Affordable Care Act is not perfect. We need to fix \nit, but what we have heard over and over again from the other side is \nnot a legitimate point; it is just an attack, a screaming attack \nagainst ObamaCare--the Affordable Care Act--and there is nothing in its \nstead. We have said to the other side: Let us know. Well, the reason \nthere is nothing in its stead is the underlying form of ObamaCare--the \nAffordable Care Act--is a Republican idea, and it is that everybody \nneeds to get health care, and it was based on Mitt Romney's plan that \nhe put into effect in Massachusetts.\n  So I could go on and on about the amazing results of the Affordable \nCare Act. I mean, I have had people come up and say: Oh my God, my \nchild can stay on my policy until age 26. That is amazing. I have \ncancer, and I used to have a limit on what my insurance would pay. Now \nthose limits are off because of ObamaCare.\n  So whether it is preexisting conditions, or kicking a child off, or \ngetting sick and then finding out, guess what, that is it for you, I \ndon't want to go back to those bad old days. I am willing to sit down \nwith anyone of good will and fix the parts of ObamaCare that aren't \nworking. That is fine. But, again, what we see constantly is this \ntrying to completely torpedo--and in this case by taking away the \nfunds. In the case of Planned Parenthood, it is just: We do not like \nthe underlying women's health reproductive laws, so we are going after \nthe face of women's health--Planned Parenthood. That is an attack on \nwomen.\n  What we are seeing from the other side is an attack on women, an \nattack on reproductive health care, an attack on the Affordable Care \nAct--ObamaCare--which, although not perfect, is saving families, saving \nlives. This is important.\n  I hope we will support the Murray amendment today. If that passes, \nthen Planned Parenthood will still be funded. If it fails, the \nPresident is going to veto this bill, and we will have enough votes to \nsustain that. But this is an exercise that is unfortunate because it is \nan attack on an organization that is doing everything under the law, \neverything that is legal. They had the president of Planned Parenthood \nsit for hour after hour after hour after hour after hour, haranguing \nher--haranguing her--a woman who really, in many ways, is working to \nsave lives because when you discover breast cancer early--I think the \nChair would agree with me--it is so treatable and so curable. If you \nfind STDs, you can treat them. If you find cervical cancer in an early \nstage, you can save a life. That is what they are doing.\n  As my friend Senator Wyden said--he is the ranking member of the \nCommittee on Finance and a champion for women's health and health in \ngeneral--the fact is, 97 percent of what Planned Parenthood does are \nthese screenings, these important screenings. This is basic health \ncare--making sure someone's blood pressure is OK. There are so many \npeople who go there for their first line of health care. The fact that \nthey are in women's reproductive health care--3 percent of their work \nentails that. It is legal. It is legal. It has been legal since 1973.\n  I say to my friends on both sides who don't like it, if you don't \nlike it, come down here and try to change the law. Make it a crime. Do \nwhat you want. We will fight you. We will beat you. But that would be \nhonest. What isn't honest is attacking an organization that has been in \nplace for almost 100 years and the rhetoric associated with it.\n  We have seen across this country--I am not talking about Colorado \nbecause the facts aren't in--an increase in threats to doctors, nurses, \npatients, and clinics. We have seen real problems. So what we say \nmatters. What we do matters. I want to thank my friend, who has worked \nso hard on this. I am so strongly supporting the Murray-Wyden \namendment. I think it is absolutely critical. What I love about it is \nyou expand access to health care, but you pay for it. That is really \nimportant.\n\n  So let's come together over party lines. Let's support that \namendment, and let's defeat this attack on the Affordable Care Act, \nwhich, yes, we can make better. But to toss it out or to make it \nunworkable with cuts that we see in these reconciliation bills would be \na blow to tens of millions of Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2875\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I was listening to the good Senator \nfrom California use a couple words, obviously, calling the health care \nlaw the ``Affordable Care Act.'' To use the full name, the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act is a real Orwellian name. She used \nthe word ``amazing'' about the act.\n  She also accused Republicans of attacking women. Let me read an email \nI received from a 60-year-old woman in Spooner, WI, who describes an \nattack on her by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The \nemail reads:\n\n       I am a 60-year-old married female and have maintained an \n     individual health insurance policy since retiring from \n     teaching in June of 2012. Prior to the implementation of the \n     Affordable Care Act, my monthly premium was $276.16 a month. \n     On December 1, 2014, the premium increased by 23 percent to \n     $339.68 to comply with the coverages of the Public Health \n     Service act. That is a 23 percent increase. In August 2015, I \n     received notification that my insurance plan was no longer \n     available, and in order to comply with the Affordable Care \n     Act I would have to have new coverage effective December 1, \n     2015, with an annual premium of $661.94, a 95 percent \n     increase.\n\n  Let me just review that. Prior to the Affordable Care Act, this 60-\nyear-old woman in Spooner, WI, a retired teacher, was paying $276 per \nmonth for her health care, and she lost her health care plan. She could \nno longer buy that plan. Another plan was going to cost $661.94--a 95-\npercent increase in 1 year.\n\n       Today, October 31, 2015, I received notification that the \n     ACA requires all coverage to renew on January 1st of every \n     year, and that effective January 1, 2016, the premium would \n     be $786.68, an increase over the December premium which would \n     be in effect for only 1 month of 19 percent.\n\n  So she summarizes:\n\n       The increase in my premium between November 2014 and \n     January 2016 is $510, a 185 percent increase.\n\n  She asked the very legitimate question of the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act. She asked: ``How is this affordable?'' Of course, \nthe answer is, it is not, and she was not protected. She goes on:\n\n       I have worked since I was age 16, and I have maintained my \n     own health insurance either through my employer or \n     individually. Now at age 60 I find that I can no longer \n     afford the $9,440 annual premium for my health insurance. My \n     husband and I are not wealthy. We have always lived modestly \n     and saved as much as possible so we could live comfortably in \n     our retirement. Now we are penalized for that savings, \n     because our combined incomes, my husband is on Social \n     Security and has income from a 401(k), we do not qualify for \n     any financial assistance.\n\n  She ends with a pretty simple sentence, a pretty simple request--a \nrequest that I am going to try to honor\n\n[[Page S8265]]\n\ntoday. She says: ``Please work to repeal this unfair act.''\n  Let me review this one more time--again, the results, the attacks, \nthe assault on our freedom caused by ObamaCare, the Patient Protection \nand Affordable Care Act. This 60-year-old woman from Spooner, WI, prior \nto ObamaCare was paying $276 per month for her insurance. She could \nafford it. She liked her health care plan. She probably liked her \ndoctors. Next year, she will be paying $786 per month, a 185-percent \nincrease--actually 2.3 times higher than what she was paying prior to \nthe Affordable Care Act. Again, she lost coverage she liked. That has \nbeen the result of ObamaCare for far too many Americans.\n  So having listened to the Senator from California talk about how \nRepublicans are attacking women, I think this email from a real person \nwho has been damaged, harmed by ObamaCare in Spooner, WI--I would say \nthe attack on women has come from the Patient Protection and Affordable \nCare Act.\n  Earlier this morning I offered my amendment, and I would like to \nthank Senator Cory Gardner from Colorado for helping me offer it. It is \na pretty simple amendment. It was modeled under the bill I introduced \nin 2013, the If You Like Your Health Plan, You Can Keep it Act. We have \na similar type of amendment. It is designed to protect women who are \nunder attack by ObamaCare, such as this 60-year-old woman from Spooner, \nWI, to restore their freedom--their choice--to be able to buy the \nhealth care they could afford, that suited their needs, that paid for \nmedicine and health care with the doctor they trusted.\n  That is what ObamaCare has taken away from the American public, from \nthis 60-year-old woman from Spooner, WI. It has taken away that \nfreedom. It has taken away that choice. It has cost her dearly. It has \nbeen an attack on that woman from Spooner, WI. That is the reality. I \ndon't care how much lipstick you try to put on the pig we call \nObamaCare, the reality of the situation is it has done great harm to \nreal people, and it is past time--well past time--that we repeal it. I \nwill be pleased to vote yes in honor of her request to please work to \nrepair or to repeal this unfair act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I congratulate the Senator from \nWisconsin for his amendment. I look forward to voting on it, this \nafternoon, I understand.\n  This is actually the promise that President Obama made: If you like \nthe coverage you have, if you like your health insurance, you can keep \nit. But, in fact, we know that has not proven to be true.\n  I know when the Senator from Wisconsin ran for the Senate, one of the \nprimary motivating factors was his own experience with his own \ndaughter. I have heard him tell that story time and again. I know he \nfeels strongly about it, as well as he feels strongly about his \nconstituents who have been harmed as a result of this law, which has \nnot performed as advertised.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. The Senator mentioned my daughter, who, by the way, just \nblessed us with a granddaughter just 3 weeks ago. It is a very short \nstory, if the Senator doesn't mind me telling it. It did motivate me to \nrun. I think it illustrates how damaging ObamaCare has been and could \nbe in the future.\n  Our daughter Carey was born 32 years ago with a very serious \ncongenital heart defect. Her aorta and pulmonary artery were reversed. \nThe first day of life, there was an incredibly dedicated, incredibly \nskilled medical professional--a doctor who President Obama just weeks \nbefore had accused of looking to fee schedules--not that individual \ndoctor but doctors in general--to see what they would be willing to \ncharge to take out a set of tonsils or amputate a foot to make a few \nmore bucks. That charge is so offensive on so many levels because those \ndoctors came in on her first day of life at 1:30 in the morning and \nsaved Carey's life.\n  Then, 8 months later, when her heart was the size of a small plum, \nand with 7 hours of open-heart surgery, a team of incredibly dedicated \nmedical professionals in 7 hours of open-heart surgery rebaffled the \nupper chamber of her heart. Her heart operates backwards today, but she \nis 32 years old. She is actually a nurse practitioner, practicing in \nthe same hospital where her life was saved. Now she is a new mom, and \nshe made me a new granddad.\n  Our health care system wasn't perfect prior to ObamaCare, but it was \nstill a marvel. I am so concerned about the loss of freedom. My wife \nand I just went to renew our health insurance policy. We are buying it \nin Wisconsin. We can't buy a policy that will pay for care outside of \nthe network. Our freedoms are being restricted. If I had that health \ncare today, would I be able to go to the specialist outside of our \nnetwork and get that first-class care that saved my daughter's life? I \nam not so sure. That is why it is vital that we repeal ObamaCare and, \nat a minimum, vote for this amendment so that if you actually do like \nyour health care plan, this amendment allows you to keep it.\n  I appreciate the Senator for yielding and allowing me to tell that \nstory.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I appreciate getting to hear that story \nagain. I have heard that story a number of times from the Senator from \nWisconsin. I think it shows how special this effort is to try to get \npeople the health care they want at a price they can afford and how \nObamaCare has done just the opposite. Rather than being part of this \nfalse narrative about a war on women, there are a lot of women and \nyoung girls who have been harmed by ObamaCare, which has been a \ndisaster.\n  Of course, I remember being here on Christmas Eve, 7 a.m., 2009, when \nour Democratic colleagues, then in the majority, had 60 votes and they \npassed ObamaCare without a single Republican vote. I think that was a \nterrible mistake. It was a terrible mistake to take something as \nimportant to most Americans or virtually to every American--their \nhealth care--and totally reform the health care system in a partisan \nway and one that could not be sustained. Indeed, we have seen in the 5 \nyears since that time that our country's health care system is in \ncomplete disarray.\n  We have all read the headlines that describe the double-digit premium \nincreases and the skyrocketing deductibles that make people wonder why \nthey should buy health insurance in the first place. I guess the answer \nto that is this: If you don't, under ObamaCare you are going to get \npenalized. That is the individual mandate that President Obama at one \npoint said he was opposed to when he ran for President in 2008, \nalthough I guess he came to love it.\n  But that is the way the government operates when it mandates what you \ndo. It takes away from your freedom, as the Senator from Wisconsin \nsaid, but it also uses coercion and financial penalties to force you to \ndo something you wouldn't naturally do because it is not good for you \nor your family. You are being forced to buy coverage you don't need at \na price you can't afford. So the only way the government makes this \nfunction--to the extent it has functioned--is out of coercion, out of \npenalizing the American people and forcing them to buy something they \ndon't want. So it is no surprise that such a massive program of Federal \noverreach comes with a major pricetag. This is something that we \nhaven't talked about enough.\n  In order to pay for ObamaCare, the Congressional Budget Office \nestimates it will cost taxpayers more than $116 billion a year--$116 \nbillion. Over the next 10 years, that pricetag totals more than $1 \ntrillion in new taxes. Now, I know for most of us we can't even \nconceive of what that number must be, but that is big. That is huge. It \nis a huge burden on American taxpayers and hard-working families. One \nreason people are struggling to pay the premiums for their ObamaCare \ncoverage is because over the last 7 years wages have been basically \nstagnant. Our economy has been bouncing along the bottom, just barely \nout of range of a recession. So people are finding their cost of living \ngoing up--their price for food, their price for health care. Perhaps \nthe only good news in the last few years has been that the price of \ngasoline has come down because of unrelated reasons. But people are \nstruggling to\n\n[[Page S8266]]\n\nmake ends meet, hard-working middle-class families who previously had \nbeen thriving in this economy.\n  The bottom line is that ObamaCare has left the American people paying \nmore for their medical needs while reducing access and weakening \ncoverage. The people I work for back home are adamant they want this to \nstop. So that is the vote we will have tomorrow--to stop this huge \ngovernment overreach that does not serve the interests of the people \nwhom presumably it was designed to protect and to provide access for.\n  The phone calls and letters and social media posts and face-to-face \nmeetings that I have had in Texas over the last 5 years tell me how \nObamaCare has hurt, not helped, hard-working Texans. Last month I \nreceived even more letters from my constituents who are exasperated \nabout their health care plans. I heard from Texans who have lost their \ndoctors and their insurance plans for the same reason that the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin mentioned. They no longer covered certain specialties \nthat are outside the network, and that is because they have had to try \nto find a way to economize. What they have done is they have restricted \naccess to doctors and hospitals.\n  Then there are the rising premiums. Because of the mandates, you are \nbeing forced to buy coverage that you don't need. For example, healthy \nmen are being forced to purchase maternity care. It makes no sense. \nYoung, healthy individuals are being forced to buy coverage to \nsubsidize older Americans.\n  Then there is the matter of the deductibles. If there is one story \nthat I have heard after another, it is from hospitals in Texas, saying \nthat people are admitted to our hospital but they have such a high \ndeductible, it is as if they are self-insured. Many of them can't \nafford to the pay the deductibles, so we have to eat it. We have to \nfind a way to provide them health care because we know they won't able \nto pay their bill, particularly if it is not within the deductible.\n  One constituent wrote:\n\n       We were happy with our insurance, but we didn't get to keep \n     it. We were happy with our doctors, but we didn't keep them.\n\n  The same constituent said, ``Our plans to retire early have been \nsidetracked by the unaffordable cost of healthcare.''\n  I have also heard from folks who have lost their employer-provided \nhealth insurance and are now forced to pay double their previous rate.\n  One of my constituents wrote:\n\n       Like many other companies [mine] dumped its retired \n     employee medical benefits and said go get your own health \n     care insurance. . . . [Before, it] was only $150 a month. \n     Now, under ObamaCare our [insurance] will cost us $366 a \n     month!\n\n  That may not seem like a lot of money to a lot of people, but if you \nare a retired person and you are on fixed income and if you made plans \nfor your future--including your health care--to see your health care \npremiums more than double is a big deal.\n  The same person continued: ``I know where you stand on this issue, \nbut wanted you to see another example of how terrible the problem is.''\n  That is a good word for it: ``terrible.''\n  I have also heard from other folks back home who are forced to spend \ncountless hours of time and energy researching new plans because their \nprevious insurance was canceled. The President and his allies in this \ntakeover of America's health care system have said to some people who \nliked their health coverage that it wasn't good enough, so they \nbasically made it illegal to continue to sell it.\n  One of my constituents wrote and said:\n\n       I have to spend my valuable time researching yet again, a \n     plan that meets my healthcare needs and possibly stays within \n     my budget. . . . where is the affordable in the Affordable \n     Care Act?\n\n  That is another good question. I think it is useful to understand \nthat ObamaCare is not a topic that Texans or most Americans are simply \nindifferent about. People care strongly about making this law a thing \nof the past. My constituents overwhelmingly want this law repealed and \nreplaced with more choices where people can buy the health care they \nneed at a price they can afford. That does not seem like a lot to ask.\n  With the increasing reports from across the country about how \nObamaCare is hurting American families, there should be no doubt about \nthis vote. Although, I predict this will be a party-line vote where all \nof our Democratic friends who supported ObamaCare are sticking with it \nto the very end. But it is unsustainable. It will not work. What we \nwould be more productive in doing is trying to work together to come up \nwith what the alternative would be that would provide people more \naffordable care and the coverage they need.\n  The American people have made crystal clear--last November, in \nparticular, when they put Republican majorities in both Chambers of \nCongress--that they want us to do something about this ill-advised, \nmisguided law. I look forward to delivering on our promise to vote to \nrepeal ObamaCare tomorrow evening before we adjourn for the week.\n  This legislation we are currently considering would eliminate more \nthan $1 trillion in tax increases and will likely save the American \npeople hundreds of billions of dollars in future spending. This is a \ntime when our national debt is $18 trillion plus. All we are doing is \nadding more and more debt to future generations who someday are going \nto have to pay it back. Maybe my generation will not be around long \nenough to have to pay that bill, but the next generation and beyond \nwill.\n  By repealing ObamaCare, we can craft a better way to provide health \ncare options that actually work for every American at an affordable \nprice. I look forward to getting this bill passed and hopefully \nproviding relief to millions of Americans who are burdened by \nObamaCare.\n  I wish to close by saying a good word about the chairman of the \nBudget Committee who has been a counselor, adviser, and navigator of \nsorts to many of us in this challenging procedural exercise known as \nbudget reconciliation. I am incredibly grateful, not only for the good \nwork he did in assisting us in passing the first budget that we have \npassed since 2009--that is pretty important--but now shepherding us \nthrough this very difficult process and helping us as the new majority \nto keep our promise to the American people to repeal ObamaCare. When we \ndo that and we vote to pass this repeal of ObamaCare tomorrow evening, \nit will be in large part because of the invaluable contributions made \nby the chairman of the Budget Committee, the Senator from Wyoming, and \nhis able staff. This has been a team effort. There is no doubt about \nit, but he has been a leader of that team effort.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Paris Climate Change Summit\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, as the ranking Democrat on the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, my highest priority is America's security. \nLet me share with my colleagues how the climate change summit that is \ntaking place in Paris affects global and U.S. security. Climate change \nis a global problem. Global problems require global solutions. As \nnegotiators from over 180 nations gather in Paris, I think it is \nimportant that the Senate take note of this historic moment--when all \ncountries, developed and developing, are finally coming together to \ntackle the global threat of climate change. The achievement of a new \ninternational agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change in Paris is our chance to ensure that future \ngenerations have the opportunity to enjoy a safer, healthier, and more \nprosperous world. Time is running out for us to act.\n  As world leaders gather to find cooperative solutions to combating \nclimate change, I am reminded of the message of Pope Francis's Climate \nChange Encyclical and the environmental crisis facing our planet. Let \nme quote from Pope Francis.\n\n       The urgent challenge to protect our common home includes a \n     concern to bring the whole human family together to seek a \n     sustainable and integral development, for we know that things \n     can change. . . . I urgently appeal, for a new dialogue about \n     how we are shaping the future of our planet. We need a\n\n[[Page S8267]]\n\n     conversation which includes everyone, since the environmental \n     challenge we are undergoing, and its human roots, concern and \n     affect us all. . . . Climate change is a global problem with \n     grave implications: environmental, social, economic, \n     political, and for the distribution of goods. It represents \n     one of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day.\n\n  Pope Francis is correct. World leaders are heeding the Holy See's \ncall for collective action, and for the first time in history, we are \non the cusp of reaching an agreement where all countries will commit to \ndoing their fair share to lower greenhouse gases. Now, 187 nations \nrepresenting 97 percent of the global carbon emitters have already \nsubmitted plans to lower or limit their carbon pollution.\n  U.S. diplomatic leadership helped spur countries like China, Brazil, \nMexico, South Africa, and others, some of which were previously \nreluctant to pledge any action on reducing emissions or to make serious \ncommitments to curb greenhouse pollution. To underscore these \ncommitments, some developing countries are also contributing to the \ninternational climate finance mechanisms that will help the world's \nmost vulnerable populations adapt to the world's worst impacts of \nclimate change. China alone has pledged more than $3 billion to this \neffort.\n  Now that the United States has finally persuaded the broadest \npossible group of countries to take actions against climate change, it \nis no longer true to argue that the United States shouldn't reduce its \nemissions because developing countries refuse to follow suit. We have \ngotten them all to act. Paris is the best chance we have of forging an \nagreement where all countries pledge to lower their carbon emissions.\n  U.S. leadership brought us to where we are today, and now the United \nStates must seize the opportunity for a truly global agreement to \naddress climate change. The United States voluntarily submitted its \ncarbon reduction goals very early in the process. Our deliberative \nearly action, which included an explanation of the national policies \nthat will result in the achievements of our mission reduction goals, \nspurred more than 180 countries to do the same.\n  China, for example, committed to lower its carbon emissions per unit \nof GDP by 60 percent to 65 percent below 2005 levels and increase \nrenewable energy to account for 20 percent of its electricity \ngeneration by 2030. This will require China to build an additional 800 \nto 1,000 gigawatts of nonfossil electric generation, which is close to \nthe entire installed capacity of all powerplants in the United States.\n  The global outpouring of support for cooperation is a true testament \nto the strength of U.S. global leadership on climate change. Optimism \nand global cooperation in these efforts are at an all-time high, and \nthat is largely due to constructive U.S. engagement. If we want to lock \nin this progress, we must support a strong and ambitious agreement in \nParis.\n  These initial pledges will not put an end to global warming, but they \nare a strong first step that sets the international community on a path \nto limit the rise of temperature by 2 degrees Celsius by 2100. \nContinuing on our current trajectory would result in a projected \nwarming of 3.6 degrees Celsius by the end of this century. But with the \npledges currently on the table in Paris, we can lower this to 2.7 \ndegrees--more than halfway to the 2 degree goal.\n  More importantly, however, these Paris pledges are only the first \nwave of action. Actions coming out of Paris will give us a lasting \nframework whereby countries can update their pledges over time to \nensure that they meet their global goal of 2 degrees Celsius.\n  By implementing their initial commitments and making further \ninvestments in clean energy, cheaper renewable fuels will allow for \neven more ambitious carbon reductions in the future. The Paris \nagreement alone will not end the threat of climate change, but it is a \nsolid first step--one that includes countries at every stage of \neconomic development.\n  The private sector has also come out to voice its support for this \nambitious agreement in Paris. Already 154 U.S. companies, representing \n$4.2 trillion in annual revenue, operating in all 50 States, and \nemploying 11 million Americans, have signed the American Business Act \non Climate Pledge and are voicing their support for a positive outcome \nin Paris. It is not just governments. It is also the private sector, \nwhich we desperately need for Paris to be successful.\n  The Paris agreement will help send a strong market signal for clean, \nrenewable energy worldwide, and that long-term certainty is exactly \nwhat investors need. If we don't embrace the clean energy revolution \nthat the world is poised to leap forward into, then our competitors \nwill. It will be the doubters and the deniers who will be blamed for \nthe United States' descent from a global leader in clean energy \ntechnology innovation.\n  U.S. deployment of clean energy and technologies has grown \nexponentially in recent years. Renewable energy generation has \nexperienced the fastest growth of all generation sectors. Since 2008, \nthe cost of clean energy technologies has dropped dramatically, \nfostering this growth. For example, with wind energy, as of 2014, there \nwere more than 65,000 megawatts of utility-scale wind power deployed \nacross 39 States--enough to generate electricity for more than 16 \nmillion households. In solar energy, by 2014 the total capacity of the \nutility-scale solar PV reached 9.7 gigawatts with 99 percent of these \ninstallations occurring after 2008. This trend has continued with 15 \npercent of all electric generation capacity brought online from January \nto September 2015 arising from the utility-scale PV.\n\n  There is almost limitless growth potential in clean energy. The \nUnited States has traditionally led the world in energy technology \ndevelopment for more than a century. U.S. energy innovations brought \npower and light to the world, and that continued spirit of leadership \nis powering the global clean energy revolution. Strong outcomes in the \ninternational agreement that is coming together at COP21 Paris will be \na catalyst in the clean energy revolution. The world is looking to the \nUnited States for continued leadership.\n  This week's announcement of the new Mission Innovation Initiative led \nby the U.S. Department of Energy and Secretary Moniz, which includes 19 \nother nations, is a gleaming example of U.S. clean energy diplomacy, \nsending another strong signal of U.S. cooperation and commitments to \ngrowing job and investment opportunities in the United States while \nproviding global clean energy solutions that will allow developing \nglobal communities to bypass cheap and dirty power and thrive through \ndeployment of affordable clean energy solutions. It will be U.S. \ntechnology helping the global community produce energy in a more cost-\neffective and cleaner way, thereby creating more jobs in the United \nStates.\n  Climate change affects us all. The people of Maryland understand \nthat. Those who live on Smith Island in the Chesapeake Bay are seeing \ntheir island disappear due to the more frequent storms we are \nexperiencing and the health of the Chesapeake Bay.\n  Climate change is also a world stability issue. Climate refugees are \na real concern for regional and U.S. security, so this is a national \nsecurity imperative. The solution is COP21 Paris. Two percent Celsius \ngoals will dramatically improve the environmental health of the planet, \nthereby helping us with our national security. It will give us energy \nsecurity because we have renewables that are a lot easier to get to and \nare more plentiful than the fossil fuels. Health energy security will \nenable us to no longer be dependent on circumstances that occur in \nother parts of the world. And, yes, we will also create more jobs, \nparticularly by the use of U.S. innovations.\n  The Paris agreement will serve as an important role in transitioning \nthe world toward more renewable energy which will serve as a source of \nAmerican job growth and innovation and put America back in control of \nour own energy future.\n  Paris is our best opportunity to avoid the most devastating impact of \nclimate change. We need an agreement to ensure that all countries do \ntheir fair share to address this problem. In order to lock in years of \nU.S. leadership, we need an agreement to maintain the clean energy \nrevolution that is so critical to job creation here at home and \nprotecting our Nation's energy security, but most importantly, we need \nan\n\n[[Page S8268]]\n\nagreement to make sure we avoid the most catastrophic impacts of \nclimate change that threaten the rights of our children and our \ngrandchildren to pursue a healthy, safe, and prosperous life.\n  I thank my colleagues for their indulgence, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2875\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin \nhas offered an amendment dealing with the Affordable Care Act. I have \nbeen talking to the staff of both the Finance Committee and the Budget \nCommittee, and frankly it is a real head-scratcher because it appears \nthat our colleague from Wisconsin is seeking to bring back the so-\ncalled grandfathered health plans that existed between 2010 and the end \nof 2013. We are still trying to sort through this, but at this point it \nlooks to me like something of a health care Frankenstein. It seeks to \nbring the dead back to life by having all those plans that were \ngrandfathered on December 31, 2013, and died on that date magically \nbrought back to life by the Senator from Wisconsin. Many of the plans \nthat were in existence on December 31, 2013, don't exist anymore. Plans \ncontinually change. Plans also changed in 2014, and they changed again \nin the beginning of 2015.\n  I am a U.S. Senator who believes very strongly in the role of the \nmarketplace in American health care, but it seems to me that the \namendment by the Senator from Wisconsin, as it is written, distorts \nmarketplace forces. Knowing the Senator from Wisconsin as I do, I can't \nbelieve that would be his intent. We have been reviewing this \namendment, and our understanding is that this amendment reflects an \napproach to private insurance that is not the way private insurance in \nAmerica works.\n  I again come back to my desire to work with colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle and to work in a bipartisan fashion on health care. That \nis what the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee did over \nan 18-month period when he was working with me on pharmaceutical \nissues. Yesterday, we issued an exhaustive report together that was \nbipartisan. What we were seeking to do was to make sure that the \nwonderful cures that are going to be coming to America to address \nhorrendous illnesses will also be ones that will be affordable and \naccessible.\n  The important point is that this is bipartisan, and that is the way \nthe big health care issues have historically been dealt with. But I \ndon't see how you can turn back the clock on the health insurance \nmarket and somehow bring a dead period back to life. Plans change. That \nis the nature of the private insurance market. That is the way private \ninsurance in America works.\n  I am sure we are going to have some more conversations about that, \nbut I do want colleagues to know that at this point, I will have to \noppose the amendment offered by the Senator from Wisconsin because I \njust don't see how we are going to take, as I said, health plans that \ndied and bring them back to life.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, for the first time in 5 years, Congress \nhas enacted a full budget that balances. Under our previous leadership, \nwe only passed one budget. We have to look all the way back to 2001 to \nfind the last time Congress passed a balanced 10-year budget.\n  It is vitally important that we go through the regular budgeting \nprocess to ensure we are being efficient and effective when spending \nhard-working taxpayers' dollars.\n  Now that we have a final budget framework, we can have the \nopportunity to adjust spending and make policy changes to rein in the \nexcesses of this administration. The first step in this is the \nconsideration of the budget reconciliation bill.\n  We have before us a budget bill that not only reduces the Federal \ndeficit, but it does so by dismantling many of the key provisions of \nthe President's health care law known as ObamaCare. We are more than 5 \nyears into its implementation; however, many of the same problems that \nthose of us who were here during the original debate warned of are \nstill causing harm to consumers, and new issues continue to arise. We \ncontinue, unfortunately, to see higher costs, less choice for \nindividuals, and higher taxes.\n  Prior to open enrollment starting, CMS released the ``2016 \nMarketplace Affordability Snapshot.'' This shows that across the 37 \nStates that use the Federal marketplace, Kansas included, the cost of \nthe second lowest silver plan, or the benchmark plan, will increase on \naverage 7.5 percent as of next year. That number is more than double \nfor Kansas. On average, they are facing a 16-percent increase in the \nbenchmark plan. I would assume the same thing will happen in Iowa, the \nState of the distinguished Presiding Officer. This is not the promised \nreduction in premiums the President promised. This is simply not \naffordable.\n  Madison from Overland Park, KS, recently wrote to me about her \nfamily's struggles. She said:\n\n       Yet again our rates are going up to the point where we \n     cannot afford our health insurance that I have had since \n     before 2008. Out of network hospital and doctors limit my \n     ability to provide for my children the health care they need.\n\n  Madison, you certainly hit the nail on the head.\n  Even if you can afford the increased premiums to maintain coverage, \nthe high deductibles may make it nearly impossible for you to utilize \nthe health services under your plan or your doctors are no longer in \nyour network, thereby limiting your ability to keep the doctor you \nliked--another broken promise from the President.\n  Another local problem of concern for me was the announcement that one \nof the insurance companies that provided coverage on the exchange in \nKansans will no longer be offering plans as of next year. This impacts \nnearly half of all Kansans enrolled through the marketplace who now \nwill again have to find a new plan and possibly new providers.\n\n  We need to repeal this law--a law that includes more than $1 trillion \nin new taxes over the next 10 years. For Kansas households, the \neconomic impact is an average tax increase of $876 a year.\n  We need to eliminate the individual and employer mandates. The \nemployer mandate is stifling job creation, it is reducing workers' \nhours, and it is a disincentive for businesses to grow and expand.\n  Jeff from Kansas City contacted me about this one and the effect the \nlaw is having on his manufacturing business. He said:\n\n       Without an exemption [from the employer mandate] I will be \n     forced to cut my staff below 50 or let ObamaCare simply put \n     me out of business in the year 2016. Taking the penalty by \n     not offering health care to my staff is the least expensive \n     option in 2016 and will still put me in the red.\n\n  These are not the options our job creators should be stuck \ncontemplating--reducing staff or facing closure.\n  The individual mandate tax is set to increase on January 1. \nIndividuals opting not to purchase or those not able to afford to \npurchase insurance next year will now face a penalty of $695 or 2.5 \npercent of household income, whichever is higher. Again, let me point \nout, whichever is higher not lower.\n  Removing this penalty will not only provide financial relief for \nthese individuals, but it will restore the individual freedom of all \nAmericans to choose whether to purchase the government-approved \ninsurance. We need to repeal the so-called Cadillac tax, which if left \nin effect will lead to reduced benefits and increased costs for \nemployers. We also need to remove the medicine cabinet tax--that is the \nmedicine cabinet tax--a new requirement that people must obtain a \nprescription to purchase over-the-counter medication--the things we \nshould not need a prescription for--with funds from people's flexible \nspending accounts.\n  This reconciliation bill eliminates many of the core provisions--the \nfoundations, so to speak--of ObamaCare, and without a strong foundation \nof mandates and taxes to finance this massive overhaul, we can then \nturn to beginning to fix health care. I emphasize fix health care, not \nObamaCare.\n\n[[Page S8269]]\n\n  We need to give peace of mind to the families hurt by ObamaCare. The \nrelief provided by this package does just that. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bill so we can then provide freedom to all Americans from \nthe mandates of this law and give us an opportunity to pursue more \npatient-centered reforms that will improve access as well as lower \ncosts for patients.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n\n    Expressing Condolences to the Families of Those Affected by the \n                      Shooting in Colorado Springs\n\n  Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, before I begin my remarks, I wish to \ntake a moment to express my condolences to the families of those \naffected by last week's shooting in Colorado Springs, including the \nfamily of Jennifer Markovsky. Jennifer grew up in Waianae, HI. She was \nkilled this past Friday at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado in a \nsenseless act of violence. I spoke recently to Jennifer's husband Paul \nto express my condolences to him, their two young children, her \nparents, and her ohana.\n  Madam President, I wish to speak on an issue of grave importance to \nall women of the United States; that is, the Republican efforts to \ndefund Planned Parenthood. One of my first forays into politics \nhappened when as a young woman I wrote to my elected officials and \nasked them about their views on a woman's right to choose. At that \ntime--1970--Hawaii was considering a bill that would legalize abortion. \nIn fact, Hawaii became the first State to do so for our residents.\n  Choice to me is not something that should be restricted, whether it \nis the right to choose to end a pregnancy or the right to access birth \ncontrol. Having control over one's health care decisions is a \nfundamental right. When a woman has access to a full range of health \ncare services, she has control over her life and her future. Access to \nbirth control and other reproductive options means that women have real \ncontrol over their economic and personal security.\n  This latest attack on women's reproductive rights by defunding \nPlanned Parenthood is a misguided attempt to demonize Planned \nParenthood. There is currently no Federal funding for abortion \nservices--a policy that already hinders the ability of lower income \nwomen to access a full range of reproductive options. Some States such \nas Hawaii recognize how fundamentally unfair this is and provide State \nfunding for abortion services.\n  Limiting the ability of women to access health care services at \nPlanned Parenthood clinics across the country is just one part of the \nRepublican anti-women agenda. They refuse to fund day care, family \nleave or early childhood education. In fact, one Republican health care \nproposal would allow insurance companies to eliminate maternity care. \nWhat is going on here? On the one hand Republicans want to deny women \naccess to reproductive care, on the other they also want to punish \nwomen for having children by not funding programs that support \nfamilies.\n  I repeat, Federal law already prohibits family planning funding from \nbeing used for abortion services by anyone, including by Planned \nParenthood. So the measure before us today does nothing more than deny \nmillions of women across the country access to birth control and other \nhealth care services that are not only not prohibited but which are \nperfectly legal.\n  The real work of Planned Parenthood is preventive health care \nservices. Birth control, STD screenings, and well women exams are the \nbulk of services provided by Planned Parenthood and its affiliates. \nDefunding Planned Parenthood will unjustly punish women who have access \nto no other health care providers for their basic health care needs.\n  The harm caused by defunding Planned Parenthood is brushed aside by \nmy colleagues. They will argue that they have provided additional \nfunding to community health centers to make up for the loss of funding \nfor Planned Parenthood. This is a red herring. This very limited \nadditional funding will not and cannot replace Planned Parenthood \nclinics and their important role as a safety net provided for millions \nof women across the country.\n  Defunding Planned Parenthood is nothing more than an attempt by some \nin Congress to pander to a fringe base. The fact is, the majority of \nAmericans support Planned Parenthood and support health care services \nfor women. The continuing efforts to defund Planned Parenthood are \nfalse proxies for banning abortion--that is calling a spade a spade--\nand all that will happen is that women's health care will be put at \nrisk.\n  These attacks on Planned Parenthood must end. So let's stop wasting \ntime undermining women's health care and get back to the real business \nat hand. Let's fund the government. Let's give middle-class families \nand small businesses tax relief. Let's pass bills to invest in our \ninfrastructure and our children's education. These are all things we \nneed to do in the next week that will actually make a difference--a \npositive difference--in the lives of millions of Americans.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in rejecting this extremely partisan \nmeasure before us and move on to the real business of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, for those of us who were seeking office for \nthe Senate in 2010, one of the primary issues we were engaged with and \nheard from tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of our \ncitizens about was the concern over the passage of the Affordable Care \nAct, now called ObamaCare and now also called the Unaffordable Care \nAct. That was the bill that was jammed through the Senate on Christmas \nEve without one Republican vote. Republicans were denied that vote \nbecause the Democratic Party controlled both the executive branch and \nthe legislative branch, with numbers that put them in a position where \nthey could jam anything through that they wanted without any offsets, \nwithout any amendments, without any changes, without any improvements, \nwithout any input from the other party.\n  I think we have learned through history that when one party has total \ncontrol and passes legislation, it doesn't represent what the American \npeople want. They want debate. They want adjustments. They want the \nother side of the story to be told. Then they want their \nrepresentatives to be able to come to a kind of consensus in terms of \nhow we would deal with, yes, an important issue called health care for \nthe American people.\n  Were there needed improvements in our health care system that had to \nbe addressed? Yes, there were. There was consensus--almost--on both \nsides of the aisle, Republicans and Democrats, that changes could be \nmade, but the way the American people wanted that done was for us to \nrepresent their views, to look at all the options, to have some \nbalance, which is generally how major programs that need to be \naddressed successfully can be addressed successfully.\n  Welfare reform is an example. Under President Clinton, it was a \nbipartisan effort, with both parties recognizing that changes needed to \nbe made to a system that wasn't working as well as it could. By working \ntogether in a bipartisan way, we ended up with a very effective and \nefficient new system compared to the old system. That was not the case \nwith ObamaCare.\n  So throughout the 2010 period of time, when I was campaigning for \noffice, I heard the stories from Hoosiers all across the State--big \ncities, small cities, rural coffee shops, factories, including \nemployers and employees, and I heard their concerns about how this \nwould play out.\n  We were promised by the President that we didn't have to worry about \nlosing our health insurance and that if we liked our current plan, we \ncould hang onto it. That turned out to be totally false. We were also \npromised by the President that this would not cost one penny to the \nAmerican taxpayer. Now we have the contrast to what this program has \ncost and will cost over a 10-year period of time, and it comes close to \n$1 trillion. So one penny compared\n\n[[Page S8270]]\n\nto $1 trillion--there is a pretty good gap between those numbers. Those \nwere the taxes that were inserted into the Affordable Care Act, or \nObamaCare, on the American people that were supposed to cover the cost \nof up to $1 trillion over a 10-year period of time.\n  We were told by the President that if we liked our current plan, the \npremiums would not go up, the premiums would not increase at all, \nperiod. Trust me. Take it to the bank. Obviously, that has not been \ntrue. We have now seen the rolling out of this done in a way that only \nthe Federal Government could screw it up. Only the Federal Government \ncould fail after spending an extraordinary amount of money--well over a \nbillion to roll out this thing in a totally dysfunctional way.\n  Today, we continue to hear from our constituents about failed \npromises, about higher premiums, extraordinarily higher copayments, \nabout how people have not been able to keep the doctor they had, and \nthey are paying taxes to cover something that simply has not worked.\n  It has been a tortuous process to get to the point where we have the \nopportunity of not being blocked by the other side. We have an \nopportunity now that will occur tomorrow to finally get an up-or-down \nvote on a reconciliation bill that essentially is designed to repeal \nObamaCare. There have been many alternatives out there that have been \ntried, tested, and true in terms of how we can deal with our health \ncare system. We are not just simply walking away, leaving people in a \nlurch. We are simply saying this whole thing needs to be repealed so we \ncan build a much better way of providing health care for our citizens, \nand this is the opportunity.\n  There will be all kinds of amendments. There will be gotcha \namendments. I dare you to vote for that. They will be irrelevant to the \nfinal issue of what we are doing and what we are voting on. It will be \nclear to the American people that this is a vote strictly on the repeal \nof ObamaCare. You are either for it or against it. Come down here and \ndefend it if you like it, if it has worked in your State. I haven't \nreally heard any people coming down and singing its praises. But come \ndown to the floor and say this is why we need it, this is why it is \ngood, and refute what we say here. But I think it is pretty hard. I \ndon't think I heard anybody come down and defend the statement that if \nyou like your health care plan, you can keep it; that it won't cost you \na penny, and that your premiums won't rise. We simply know that is not \nthe case. So this is the moment.\n  We will be able to make our yea be yea and our nay be nay, and the \nAmerican people will know exactly where we stand, and I believe we will \nhave the votes to pass this in the Senate, as we will have a vote to \npass it in the House of Representatives. It will then go to the \nPresident, and the President then will know where the Congress stands \nand where the American people stand, if he doesn't know already.\n  I would like to mention one aspect of it that has a pretty astounding \nnegative impact on my State, and that is the imposition of a gross \nsales tax on the sale of medical devices. My State is one of the \nleading States in the Nation of medical device manufacturers. This tax \nis levied on their gross sales, not on their profits. In that sense, \nthose small companies that are trying to develop something that will \nimprove people's lives or save people's lives through medical device \nresearch and development and then ultimately market it have struggled \nbecause through the development process they have to pay a 2.3 percent \ntax on everything they sell, even if they are not yet making a profit. \nIt has been devastating in terms of employment, in terms of research \nand development in this cutting edge business and manufacturing that is \nsaving lives and improving the lives of people. So critical to this \nvote is the medical device tax, which is denying people the opportunity \nto produce medical devices that save people's lives and enhance their \nlives.\n  We have more than 300 FDA-registered medical device manufacturers in \nIndiana. It is boosting our State's economy and producing technologies \nthat are changing and saving lives, but since the implementation, these \ncompanies have had to lay off workers and shelf plans to expand and \nbuild new facilities. One major manufacturer had lined up five new \nplants in Indiana for a significant increase in employment, a \nsignificant increase in research and development and production of \nmedical devices, simply to cover the costs they now had to pay on the \ntax for previous sales of their other products. It is an egregious tax \nthat has affected many companies in the State of Indiana.\n  In conclusion, how ironic it is that ObamaCare, which President Obama \nsaid would increase health care coverage, is actually a barrier to \nimproving lives. So it is long past time for Washington to stop \npunishing the medical device industry and innovators in Indiana and \nacross this country.\n  I want to conclude by saying ObamaCare, a poorly written and poorly \nexecuted health care plan, is not working for the overwhelming majority \nof Hoosiers in my State and the majority of Americans. Remember when \nthe then Speaker of the House said: Well, we really don't know what is \nin this plan; we will have to pass it before we know what is in it. We \nnow know what is in it. We now know what the impact has been. I have \nbeen on this floor for hours over the past 5 years talking about real-\nlife examples of impacts of this Unaffordable Health Care Act on \nHoosiers. I have given personal testimonies that have been given to me \nby people. I have heard the horror stories of people losing their \ninsurance, of their premiums skyrocketing, of their deductible putting \nthem in a position where they are not able to afford health care and \npraying every day that someone in the family won't get sick because \nthey can't even afford the deductible before they get the coverage. \nThis poorly written and poorly executed health care law is not working, \nand the law's continued unpopularity is a testament to what it has \nmeant for most American families: rising premiums, higher costs, \ndecreased choices, and a poor health care process. All the innovation \nand things that we could have done had we worked through a normal \nprocess on this are sitting on the shelf.\n  The time is now. It is an opportunity we have been waiting for now \ngoing on 6 years. So when we have that vote tomorrow--and despite all \nthe chatter and despite all the attempts to define it as something \nother than what it is--the real vote comes down to whether you want to \ncontinue government-run health care or you want to look for a better \nmodel.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, we are on the verge of fulfilling a \npromise that we made to the American people. They selected a new \nmajority here in the Senate to repeal ObamaCare. In Nebraska, words and \npromises still mean something. They are not taken lightly. Trust me; \nNebraskans will let you know when you aren't keeping your word.\n  Since the first day I took office, I have heard from Nebraskans about \nhow this law is making it harder, not easier, for them to get health \ncare. Nearly 20,000 people have contacted my office, and they have \nexpressed their concerns about this law to me. They face a new reality \nand struggle to afford premiums for plans requiring thousands in out-\nof-pocket expenses. I have come to the floor many times to share these \nstories from Nebraskans, and unfortunately, these stories continue to \ncome in.\n  Vivian from Saunders County in the State wrote regarding the \ndeductible on her ObamaCare plan, which is so high that her husband, \nwho is a cancer survivor, is forgoing regular checkups. They simply \ncannot afford the costs.\n  Kevin from Chappell, NE, shared his experience with struggling to \nafford the expensive premium while still facing a $10,000 deductible. \nHe wants answers for why his family is being forced to buy a plan that \nincludes services they just don't need.\n  Ann from Lincoln shared with me her struggle to get coverage for \nherself and her two children. After jumping\n\n[[Page S8271]]\n\nthrough bureaucratic hoops to get health care coverage, she is now \nforced to buy an insurance plan that will take 25 percent of her \nincome. That is a quarter of her income.\n  Some could argue that these are only anecdotes--a small snapshot of \nwhat is happening in the State--but let's look at how premiums have \nchanged in Nebraska since this law was passed. Next year, many \nNebraskans will see double-digit increases in their health care costs. \nIn 2014, some Nebraskans saw their premiums go up over 100 percent. Why \nare we still debating whether this law has been a success?\n  The President has said: ``If you like your plan, you can keep it.'' \nWe have all heard that. Nebraskans were promised they could keep the \nplans they liked. Well, tell that to the thousands of people in \nNebraska who have lost coverage when Nebraska's co-op failed last year. \nThey were blindsided on Christmas Eve with news that they had to choose \na new coverage. Now many more Americans are facing this same challenge \nas over half of the country's co-ops have failed.\n  Democrats have said this law would help the American people. \nAmericans were promised more. They were promised lower costs for health \ncare. We were promised a $2,500 decrease in insurance costs. Well, \nclearly that is not the case. This is a mess, and it didn't have to \nhappen.\n  It is now our duty to fix it. I am proud that Republicans are taking \nthe lead. We are showing the American people our commitment in \nrepealing this law. We can do better. We can provide patient-centered \nhealth care. We can let people decide what kind of coverage they need. \nWe can let people take their insurance with them when they move across \nState lines. We do that with car insurance. But the first step is to \nend this--a law that costs families more money and doesn't meet their \nneeds.\n  So I ask, for the sake of all Americans, it is time to take that next \nstep. We need to step up. We need to fix it.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I want to address an amendment that I have \nfor the ObamaCare repeal bill we will be voting on, possibly soon. It \nis a simple amendment. I think it is an important one, and it addresses \npart of the $1.2 trillion in tax increases that are embedded throughout \nObamaCare. This, in particular, is a tax increase on middle-class \nAmericans who are battling with catastrophic health care challenges and \ncosts. So I think it was a particularly ill-conceived tax increase and \nI want us to repeal it.\n  This is what the tax increase was about. Prior to ObamaCare, if a \nfamily had out-of-pocket medical expenses that exceeded 7.5 percent of \ntheir income, they could deduct from their taxable income any cost \nabove 7.5 percent of their income. ObamaCare raised that threshold to \n10 percent, and that has very real consequences. There was an exception \nfor senior citizens, but that exception expires in 2016, and this tax \nincrease on middle-class Americans makes it harder for families who are \ntrying to deal with, to battle some kind of very problematic health \nsituation they are in. It could be a chronic disease. It could be a \ncatastrophic event.\n  Let me be specific with an example. Prior to ObamaCare, if a family \nwho earned $50,000, for instance, had extraordinary medical costs, for \nwhatever reason, that were, say, $4,500--so 9 percent of their income--\nthat is a huge medical bill for a family who earns $50,000, obviously. \nWell, at least prior to ObamaCare, they could deduct $750 of it. That \nportion which exceeded the 7.5 percent of their income was deductible. \nUnder ObamaCare, they can't deduct any of it. They get no deduction.\n  So think about what we are doing. We are saying that a middle-class, \nworking-class family with unusually, extraordinarily high medical bills \nshould lose the opportunity they have historically had to at least get \na modest deduction to help soften the blow of the catastrophic health \ncrisis they are dealing with. I think this is a terrible idea--to hit \nthese folks with this tax increase--especially at a time when they are \ndealing with these very difficult circumstances or they wouldn't get \nthe deduction anyway.\n  So I think it was a bad idea and one of many bad ideas in ObamaCare. \nWhat my amendment would do is simply restore that deduction to where it \nwas before ObamaCare. It would restore the ability to deduct that \nextraordinary health care cost when it exceeds 7.5 percent of income \nrather than having to hit the 10-percent hurdle ObamaCare created.\n  By the way, I should point out that this is totally a tax increase on \nmiddle-class families. The IRS quantified this. They determined that 86 \npercent of the taxpayers who claim this deduction--86 percent--earn \nless than $100,000. This isn't a tax deduction for rich people. This is \na tax deduction for ordinary Americans who are going through very \ndifficult times.\n  Having the ability to take this deduction is more important now than \nit has ever been because ObamaCare has done so much to drive up \npeople's costs. That is not just I saying this. A November 15 New York \nTimes headline read: ``Many Say High Deductibles Make Their Health Law \nInsurance All but Useless.'' That is the New York Times.\n  High deductibles are one of the main contributing factors to people \nhaving high out-of-pocket costs. So ObamaCare has driven these plans \ninto these high deductibles, thereby forcing people to lay out more \ncash and at the same time they are saying: Oh, but you can't deduct it \nlike you used to be able to.\n  On November 2 CNBC reported that ``ObamaCare's cheapest plans just \ngot more expensive.'' There are deductibles that are soaring to over \n$12,000, out-of-pocket maximums that are near $14,000. People are \nincurring out-of-pocket expenses like never before, and they are \ngetting hit with the fact they can no longer take the kind of deduction \nthey used to.\n  This was a bad idea in the first place. It is a tax increase on those \nwho can least afford it--people who are sick, people who are undergoing \nmaybe a terrible accident, some other disaster that caused them to \nincur these expenses. It could apply to someone who has long-term care \nexpenses for a relative in a nursing home. It could be the special \neducation expenses for a handicapped child. It could be a mom \nundergoing reconstructive surgery after a mastectomy. It could be a \ncouple seeking to conceive a child needing fertility treatment. There \nare any number of circumstances for which I don't think we should be \npunishing people in this fashion.\n  My amendment would simply, as I said, restore the tax deduction to \nthe threshold we had before ObamaCare and I would urge its adoption.\n  As I mentioned, I think this medical expense deduction issue is just \none flaw of ObamaCare. It is important, but it is a narrow aspect of an \nunbelievably flawed bill. It is hard to know where to begin with the \nflaws of ObamaCare, but I would suggest several big categories of \nproblems: The first is higher costs; the second, I would suggest, is \nthe loss of employment; and the third, which is indisputable, is the \nloss of freedom.\n  I think higher costs are undeniable. The President promised us that \naverage premiums would fall, they would fall by $2,500 in fact. He was \nconfident enough to give us a figure, and of course the exact opposite \nis what has actually occurred. ObamaCare premiums have gone up \ndramatically. In my State of Pennsylvania, premiums are up, for next \nyear alone, 11 percent. That is after several years of increases prior \nto an 11-percent increase. Whom do you know who has gotten an 11-\npercent pay raise? I don't know anybody. That is not what is happening. \nYet their expenses are going up because of ObamaCare. Deductibles are \nrising at the same time. So not only does it cost more to buy the \ninsurance, but the insurance covers less.\n  I have gotten letters from literally thousands of Pennsylvanians \nexplaining their personal circumstances. One letter came from the \nDiBello family of Montgomery County and says that before ObamaCare they \npaid $662 a month for a health insurance plan for their family and they \nhad a $6,000 deductible.\n\n[[Page S8272]]\n\nThey were happy with their plan. They were promised if they were happy \nwith their plan they could keep their plan. We all heard that promise. \nHow many times was that promise made? That promise was made to the \nDiBello family. The only slightly unfortunate problem here is everybody \nknew it was untrue, including the people making the promise because the \nlegislation explicitly forbids whole categories of plans. How could you \nkeep your plan if it is being banned by the Federal law?\n  Unfortunately, the DiBello family experienced that. So the plan they \nare buying that goes into effect in 2016, instead of a $662 monthly \npremium, they are going to have to pay $1,141, and instead of a $6,000 \ndeductible, they are going to have a $12,800 deductible.\n  You almost have to wonder what is your insurance paying for if the \ndeductible is that high, but that is what ObamaCare has done to the \nDiBello family of Montgomery County, PA, and let me assure you they are \nbut one of thousands and thousands of families I have heard from across \nPennsylvania who are experiencing similar real difficulties.\n  I mentioned jobs as another category of problem that ObamaCare has \ncreated. Again, I think it is completely irrefutable. We know if you as \nan employer hire a 50th employee, you are suddenly subject to all the \nmandates of ObamaCare. That means the costs of health insurance for \nyour workforce go through the roof. It creates a huge incentive not to \nhire the 50th employee. That is a terrible incentive to have, \nespecially at a time when we have too few people working and we have \ninadequate wages. Yet this provision guarantees that it will be more \ndifficult to get a job with a company that has 40-some employees.\n\n  In addition, ObamaCare puts pressure on employers to cut back on \nhours for workers because you are deemed to be a full-time worker if \nyou work 30 hours or more. One way to deal with that is to have people \nwork less than 30 hours. The problem is, employees want 40 hours. They \nwant a normal workweek. But they can't get it because of the costs \nObamaCare triggers if they were to have it.\n  Third is the loss of freedom. Again, that is completely irrefutable. \nIf you had a plan you were happy with, if you had a plan that worked \nfor you and your family, if it was the right mix of benefits, premiums, \nand deductibles for you and you wanted to keep that plan, well, good \nluck--you can only keep it if the government approves of it. So now we \ndon't have the freedom to have the health insurance plan we want. We \nare forced to buy the health insurance plan the government dictates we \nshould have whether we like it or not. What an egregious affront to the \npersonal freedom of Americans to decide what is right for them and \ntheir families.\n  The last thing I want to point out is a very fundamental structural \nflaw in the model of ObamaCare--yet another reason why this needs to be \nrepealed--and that is, this bill was designed with the idea that young \nand healthy people would buy health insurance through ObamaCare at an \ninflated price. Of course, in addition to dictating what is in a health \ncare plan, ObamaCare dictates pricing as well. The theory was, what we \nwill do is we will have all these expensive mandates, but we will force \nthis category of people who tend to be younger and healthier--we will \nforce them to pay more than it costs to actually insure them, and that \nis how we will subsidize coverage for people who are older and need \nmore health care. There is only one small problem with that; that is, \nthe younger and healthier people figured out pretty quickly that they \nare being forced to buy a product that doesn't suit their needs very \nwell and they are forced to pay more than it is worth. So guess what. \nThey are not doing it. And ObamaCare is falling short by millions on \nthe number of these younger, healthier people their model depended on.\n  What is the result of that? Insurance companies are left insuring a \npopulation that therefore tends to be older and sicker. That costs \nmore. When insurance companies lose many millions of dollars, which is \nwhat they have been doing, they go back to ``We have to raise premiums \neven further.'' That creates an even more powerful incentive for \nyounger and healthier people not to buy the product. What started off \nas overpriced is now even more overpriced for them. This is known in \ninsurance terms as a death spiral, this downward spiral whereby it \nbecomes impossible to have a viable continuation of these insurance \npolicies, because, increasingly, the only people who will buy them are \nthe people who are very sick, and people who are relatively healthy are \npriced out of the market.\n  This explains why half of all insurance co-ops in America have \nalready folded. Many seem to be heading in the same direction. A year \nfrom now, I doubt there will be many co-ops remaining. This also \nexplains why, increasingly, insurance companies are simply saying: We \nare going to have to consider getting out of this market altogether. We \nare going to have to consider simply not participating in ObamaCare.\n  What does that mean for Pennsylvania families? It means they are \ngoing to be out of choices. If there are no insurance plans being \noffered through this exchange because the whole dynamic doesn't work, \nthen how are my constituents going to get health insurance? This is the \nproblem when the government steps in and tries to take control over an \nindustry--in this case, something so important and so personal as our \nhealth care.\n  This is a fatally flawed piece of legislation. Americans have been \nliving through its disastrous consequences in the form of losing the \nhealth care plans that they want, that they valued, that they chose; \nexperiencing much higher premiums, higher out-of-pocket costs, and \nhigher taxes on the costs they do incur; and fewer jobs and less hours \nfor those who are employed. Now, in addition to all this, we see what I \nthink is the relatively early stages of this death spiral that is going \nto result in probably a pretty massive exodus from this market.\n  It is long overdue that we repeal this legislation. I am very glad we \nwill be able to consider this over the next day or so. I urge support \nfor my amendment, which would restore the ability of people facing \ncatastrophic costs to have the deduction they were able to have before \nObamaCare, and I urge adoption of this repeal legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a massive \nexpansion of government that was fundamentally flawed from the start: \nthe Affordable Care Act, better known as ObamaCare.\n  In the past 100 years, we have had three supermajorities, all \nDemocratic. The first gave us the New Deal; the second, the Great \nSociety; and the third gave us ObamaCare and Dodd-Frank. In many ways, \nthese progressive, sweeping government spending programs have failed \nthe very people they claim to champion: the working men and women of \nAmerica. Together, they come at a massive expense to taxpayers and \nstill continue to add to the Nation's debt crisis.\n  Right now, this law is saddling Americans with more than $1.2 \ntrillion of new taxes over the next 10 years. In my State alone, \nObamaCare is costing taxpayers over $2.7 billion over the next decade. \nThe Senate's actions this week will help reverse the harmful effects of \nObamaCare and remove the law's burdensome taxes on American families.\n  When I am back home in Georgia, one of the most frequent and sobering \nconcerns I hear about is the insidious, negative impact of ObamaCare--\nwhether it is reduced hours, increased premiums, increased deductibles, \nor just the mere fact that they can't get the doctor they want. I hear \nthis more than any other complaint about what is going on in Washington \ntoday.\n  By enacting this law, President Obama and Washington put our health \ncare system--almost one-sixth of our total economy--under government \ncontrol, and the consequences are disastrous. ObamaCare has driven up \nthe cost of health care. In addition, premium costs and deductible \ncosts are also up, precluding many Americans from even applying for \ncoverage. The law has eliminated health care choices, forced rural \nhospitals out of business, created a doctor shortage, and failed to \nlive up to the expectations promised to the American people by the \nObama administration.\n  First, Georgians are seeing their health care costs double. Just this\n\n[[Page S8273]]\n\nweek a headline on the front page of the Atlanta-Journal Constitution \nread ``Health care costs on the rise in 2016'' and ``Some Affordable \nCare Act plans seeing double-digit hikes.'' The article went on to \ndescribe the peril of a Georgia family who plans to cancel their \ninsurance plan because it is no longer affordable for them. And this \nfamily is not alone. As we just heard in the prior speech, deductibles \nhave risen to a point now where people can't afford the health care \nplan that was picked for them.\n  In Georgia, premium increases are expected to range from 27 to 29 \npercent for Alliant Health individual policyholders, and the problem \ncould only get worse as more insurance companies exit the ObamaCare \nexchange program. And deductibles are increasing seven times as fast as \nwages are increasing.\n  Last week, UnitedHealth Group--the largest health insurance company \nin the country--announced it is considering dropping out of ObamaCare \nbecause it is losing so much money and the marketplace doesn't appear \nto be sustaining itself. As a matter of fact, yesterday, UnitedHealth \nCEO Stephen Hemsley even admitted that joining the ObamaCare exchange \nwas ``for us a bad decision.'' He went on to say, ``We did not believe \nit would form this slowly, be this porous, or become this severe.''\n  Washington cannot overlook this warning. Like my wife Bonnie and me, \nmany people have already had their plans canceled--no matter what the \nadministration said. They said: If you like your policy, you can keep \nyour policy; if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. I can \npersonally tell you that did not happen. A lot of people have lost \naccess to their preferred doctors or were forced into insurance plans \nthat cost more, not less--dramatically more. If UnitedHealth Group--the \nlargest player in this space--exits, Americans will only have less \nchoice, not more.\n  Aside from driving up health care costs and limiting insurance \noptions, ObamaCare is forcing rural hospitals out of business as well. \nSince 2010 alone, five rural hospitals in Georgia have closed, and \nthere is a possibility for more in the immediate future. Across the \ncountry, more than 50 rural hospitals--this is incredible--have closed \njust since 2010, and more than 280 are in danger of shutting down. Each \nclosure eliminates local jobs and Americans' access to health care.\n  Additionally, given the growing aging population, ObamaCare is \ncontributing to a dangerous doctor shortage. The Association of \nAmerican Medical Colleges is predicting a shortage of as many as 90,000 \ndoctors by 2025.\n  Another survey by the Physicians Foundation found that 81 percent of \ndoctors describe themselves as either overextended or at full capacity, \nand 44 percent have said they plan to cut back on the number of \npatients they see. They may even retire and/or work part time. This \nfurther reduces access for people who need medical care.\n  Finally, the Obama administration's promise of greater access to \nhealth insurance has proven to be totally misleading. In fact, now \nalmost half of health insurance co-ops created under ObamaCare have \ncollapsed due to their failing financial performance. This has resulted \nin hundreds of thousands of Americans scrambling to find sustainable \nhealth insurance for their families, and the ones who do find it can't \nafford the deductibles that, as we said, have risen dramatically.\n  President Obama promised that his massive restructuring of the health \ncare industry would give more people insurance. In reality, the law \ncontinues to disrupt Americans' health care at every turn, while \nfailing to cover anywhere near as many people as its supporters \npredicted.\n  I am counted as one who signed up for ObamaCare. I didn't have a \nchoice. My plan was canceled. My access to my doctor was eliminated. I \nhad no choice. But I am counted, as a statistic, as one who signed up \nfor it.\n  Make no mistake--our health care system needs to change. But one \nthing is clear: ObamaCare is ill-conceived law and is hurting people \nand our economy. It must be fully repealed and replaced. Georgians and \nAmericans want access to affordable health care options and \ntransportability across State lines. People want to keep their health \ncare decisions between themselves and their doctors and not have to go \nthrough a bureaucrat.\n  These are commonsense health care policies we can debate now that \nwould lower costs, increase accessibility and transportability, and \nrestore the sacred doctor-patient relationship. It won't be easy, but \nit is achievable. We need to start debating replacement plans now. \nThere are alternatives to Washington taking over our health care \nsystem, almost 17 percent of our economy.\n  Today, for the sake of our kids and our grandkids, we are taking a \nvery important step to repeal ObamaCare and stop government-mandated \ninsurance. We are also removing Washington's tax on the very medical \ndevices patients and doctors rely on to deliver quality care.\n  It is quite clear that this law was flawed from the very beginning. \nThe Web site failed, access went down, deductibles went up, and \npremiums are still skyrocketing. The Obama administration is in total \ndenial, and they misled the American people and failed to live up to \nthe promises made during campaigns and afterward. What further evidence \ndo we need to realize this law--this sweeping expansion of the Federal \nGovernment that pushes more tax dollars to Washington--is not working?\n  In order to solve our debt crisis, we absolutely must fix this health \ncare crisis, which is why the Senate is eliminating ObamaCare's fines \non individuals and businesses and finally sending this broken law back \nto the President's desk.\n  Today is a momentous day. This week we will actually have this vote. \nI urge my colleagues to put partisanship aside and do what is right for \nthe people of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my \nremarks, the Senators from Connecticut and Ohio be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Tribute to Fred Sears\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise to recognize a close friend from \nDelaware, Fred Sears, a community leader and a passionate advocate for \nall in our community, a man whose name is synonymous with business \nleadership and public service in my home State of Delaware and a man I \nam proud to call my friend. Fred is known statewide for his generosity, \nhis enthusiasm, and his business acumen. For decades, his impact has \nbeen felt by elected officials, nonprofit, community leaders, and \ncountless Delawareans of all backgrounds and careers. He is a true \nleader, an authentic champion of the community, and the embodiment of \nwhat service means in Delaware.\n  Fred Sears is a Delawarean through and through. He was born blocks \naway from his boyhood home at what was then called Wilmington Hospital, \nand he grew up across the river from Brandywine Zoo. This Delaware \nnative attended Mt. Pleasant Elementary, Aldred I. DuPont Junior High, \nand Wilmington Friends for high school. Fred went on to earn a business \ndegree from the University of Delaware. He had a great deal of fun, \nincluding a truly memorable spring break trip to the Bahamas with Joe \nBiden, his classmate and friend.\n  After graduating from UD in 1964, Fred began a nearly 40-year career \nin banking. Fresh out of college, Fred was scheduled to interview for a \njob with the Bank of Delaware but accidentally walked into Delaware \nTrust instead. Fortunately, Delaware Trust was also hiring. After \nstarting as a management trainee, he rose to become the institution's \nfirst vice president of business development. From there, Fred went on \nto later work at Wilmington Trust, then Beneficial National Bank, and \nultimately Commerce Bank, where he was Delaware market president.\n  While Fred was widely known as a leader in our financial services \nindustry, he found many other ways to serve our community as well. \nEarly in his career, Mayor Tom Maloney asked his friend Fred to take a \nleave of absence from Delaware Trust to serve as the city's director of \nfinance and then later as director of economic development. Fred not \nonly fulfilled those two roles terrifically, but decided afterward to \nrun for an at-large city council seat in\n\n[[Page S8274]]\n\n1976. Fred won and went on to serve two full terms.\n  Many of us in younger generations in politics after Fred's elected \nservice have called on his wisdom, his insight, and his ability to \nbring people together as we had important decisions to make. Fred \nserved on the transition teams of Wilmington Mayor James Sills, \nDelaware Gov. Ruth Ann Minner, and co-chaired my transition team after \nI was elected New Castle county executive in 2004.\n  For many of us, decades of success in finance, business, and politics \nmight be the hallmark of a complete and successful career, but for Fred \nthese experiences were just a few of the ways he fulfilled a lifelong \npassion for service in our State of Neighbors.\n  Just over 13 years ago, while Fred was at Commerce Bank, our mutual \nfriend Jim Gilliam, Jr., called Fred one day and said to him: I have a \njob for you. After some convincing, Fred accepted the job. Since then, \nhe has served admirably at the helm of one of the most important \norganizations in Delaware--the Delaware Community Foundation. The DCF \nplays an integral role in my home State, helping local nonprofits \ndirect philanthropy to Delaware's most worthy causes and encouraging \nlong-term charitable giving to improve our State. Since Fred began as \nCEO in 2002, the DCF has tripled its long-term charitable funds. It \nbuilt its assets to $285 million. Dozens of nonprofits and community \nfunds have flourished under Fred's leadership. He and his team and \ntheir astute financial guidance continues to generate the funding that \nenables them to serve. Fred didn't join the DCF, though, just to raise \nmoney and to be important and recognized; rather, he sought to improve \nthe entire philanthropic community and the quality of community life in \nDelaware. His success in doing so reflects his values and his vision.\n  Fred is a true leader: honest, insightful, thoughtful, creative, \npositive, and confident. Fred possesses that rare quality, the ability \nto inspire others. He has used his passion for service to motivate the \nnext generation of great leaders in our State. Take one of Fred's many \ninitiatives called the Next Generation. It is one he is most proud of \nand justifiably so. Next Gen takes groups of civic-minded young \nprofessionals, with limited or no experience in philanthropy, and with \njust the right amount of guidance and encouragement, helps mold them \ninto nonprofit board leaders. Since 2004, Next Gen's chapters up and \ndown the State have helped direct over $300,000 in grants to community \nneeds all over my home State of Delaware.\n  My good friend Tony Allen, who also calls Fred a mentor and a friend \nand a brother, tells a story of how Fred helped establish the African \nAmerican Empowerment Fund. The fund today is known as the Council on \nUrban Empowerment, and it promotes philanthropy that supports \neducational, social, and economic empowerment of African-American \nDelawareans. As Tony notes, Fred didn't just help establish the fund, \nhe wasn't just one of its first donors, he attended every meeting of \nthe group.\n  In 2010, Tony introduced Fred when Fred Sears was set to receive an \naward for nonprofit leadership. As Tony put it then, while patience is \na virtue, impatience is a weapon--and Fred can be appropriately \nimpatient. Fred doesn't demur to what others would call insurmountable \ntasks or taboo topics of conversation. He takes every opportunity to \nconstructively push the status quo. Tony is absolutely right. Given \nthat legacy of leadership, it is no surprise Fred has been honored by \ncountless organizations for his business and community efforts. He has \nreceived the Lifetime Achievement in Philanthropy Award from the \nAssociation of Fundraising Professionals. He has been given a \nDistinguished Service Award by the Wilmington Rotary Club. He has been \ndeemed a Superstar in Business by the Delaware State Chamber of \nCommerce and was named Citizen of the Year by the Delmarva Council of \nthe Boy Scouts of America.\n  Those awards and merits are certainly a reflection of Fred's values \nand his many successes, but those of us who have had the privilege to \nwork closely with Fred and to know him know that his commitment to \nservice shines most brightly in the hundreds of interactions he has \nwith Delawareans every day, whether he is offering ideas or advice or \nsaying a quick hello.\n  We know that even though Fred is leaving the Delaware Community \nFoundation, he will undoubtedly continue to serve the community he \nloves. In fact, Fred just accepted an appointment from Governor Markell \nto chair Delaware's Expenditure Review Commission, suggesting Fred has \nno intention of taking retirement literally.\n  In a testament to Fred's thoughtfulness, leadership, and sense of \ncompassion, just a day after the passing of our beloved friend Beau \nBiden earlier this year, Fred spoke to the Bidens and offered to help \nthe family establish an organization in Beau's name. That idea became \nthe Beau Biden Foundation for the Protection of Children. Two days \nafter it was launched, they had already raised over $125,000.\n  If this is all there was to Fred's story, it would be a remarkable \none, but there is even more to Fred as a businessman, philanthropist, \nand a person. If you speak to those who have been around him the \nlongest, they will tell you his true passion is his family: his wife \nJoAnn, his son Graham, his daughter-in-law Kathryn, his son Jason, his \ndaughter-in-law Jen, and his treasured grandchildren, Kylie, Paxton, \nand Charlie. I have no doubt Fred's retirement means he will be \nspending a lot more time as Pop Pop to his three treasures, becoming \neven more of a fixture at their frequent school functions and baseball \nand soccer games.\n  Fred's friends and family will also tell you how much he adored his \nmother Marjorie, visiting her daily at Stonegates until her passing, \nand how much he cares for his father-in-law today. They will tell you \nthat Fred loves dancing, snappy suspenders, and vinyl records.\n  Fred's friend Tom Shopa will tell you about Fred's passion for golf \nand how for decades he has kept track of all of his golf scores, the \nnumber of putts he made, the weather that day--recording every single \ndetail just as his father did.\n  Friends and colleagues will tell you that they hear Fred say thank \nyou dozens of times every day. Today I pause for a moment on the floor \nof this great institution to say thank you to Fred. Thank you for \ngiving your time and talents, over decades, to more than 40 community \nnonprofit organizations, for serving on countless boards from \nChristiana Care to Rodel Foundation, from the Wilmington Housing \nPartnership to the United Way. Thank you for your decades of service to \nWilmington and Delaware, for your lifelong commitment to family, \nfriends, and community.\n  Fred, as our friend Tony Allen puts it, everyone in Delaware is \nbetter off because of your efforts. Thank you, Fred Sears, and \ncongratulations on many jobs well done. I eagerly look forward to \nseeing where your so-called retirement will take you next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I am on the floor to speak to the debate \nthat is happening now on reconciliation, specifically, the fact that we \nare here for the 16th time in the Senate debating the repeal of all or \nsignificant parts of the Affordable Care Act, and stack that on top of \nthe 50 to 60 times this has been debated--the repeal of all or major \nparts of the Affordable Care Act--in the House of Representatives. As \nmany of us have said over and over, we think the debate over repeal is \nover and that we should, A, accept the success of the Affordable Care \nAct and, B, to the extent that there need to be changes made, do it on \na bipartisan basis--find the ways we can work together to try to \nperfect a law that is by and large working.\n  The data only tells one story. I want to review it for a moment \nbecause if you hear many of my Republican colleagues talk, they act in \nthe absence and in the denial of the overwhelming evidence that tells \nyou the Affordable Care Act is working. There are 17 million Americans \nwho have insurance\n\n[[Page S8275]]\n\ntoday who didn't have it before the Affordable Care Act. They have \ngotten it either through these exchanges, these private health care \nexchanges with a tax credit from the Federal Government or they have \ngotten it through Medicaid expansion.\n  We have reduced the number of people without health care insurance in \nthis country by 30 percent in the few first few years of \nimplementation. That is with many States doing everything they can to \nundermine the act. That is with many States refusing to accept the \nexpansion of Medicaid coverage that could make that number even greater \nthan 17 million or 30 percent.\n  In my State of Connecticut, where we have been aggressively trying to \nimplement the Affordable Care Act, we have actually reduced the number \nof people without insurance by 50 percent. The total numbers in \nConnecticut are pretty extraordinary, given the short amount of time we \nhave had and given the fact that in Connecticut we had a pretty robust \nMedicaid Program to begin with.\n  Overall costs to the Federal Government are under control for the \nfirst time in many of our lifetimes. The average medical rate of \ninflation to the Federal Government is about 2 or 3 percent. The \noverall rate of medical inflation is the lowest since 1960. That is \nbecause the Affordable Care Act is transitioning payments away from \nvolume-based payments, rewarding you for the more medicine you \npractice, to outcomes-based payments, rewarding you for keeping your \npatients healthy.\n  Quality is getting better. You look at a broad array of metrics. \nThings such as hospital readmission rates or hospital acquired \ninfections are all going down. Let's be clear, the Affordable Care Act \nwas not designed to fix every single problem in the health care system. \nThere are still going to be problems, there are still going to be \nanecdotal failures, but if you are working to undermine the act in your \nState, you are going to have more problems with your health care \nsystem.\n  When I hear my colleagues come down to the floor of the Senate and \ncomplain about hospitals closing in their State, when their State is \nactively rejecting Federal money that would help expand Medicaid and \nprovide more people walking into hospitals with reimbursement attached \nto them, there is more than a hint of irony to that complaint. If you \nwant your health care system to work, then implement the Affordable \nCare Act.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2875\n\n  Senator Johnson is offering an amendment which could be of particular \nharm to the people in my State and in neighboring States. His amendment \nwould allow for plans that don't comport with minimum coverage \nrequirements of the Affordable Care Act to continue to be offered.\n  Before I relinquish the floor, I wish to speak for a moment about \nthis particular amendment. There is a little boy named Kyle from \nSimsbury, CT, whom I have talked about before on the floor. Kyle \nrequires injections that cost about $3,000 per dose, and he has to take \nthem three to four times a week for the treatment of a blood disorder. \nBecause his previous insurance plan had an annual lifetime limit, his \ntreatment threatened to bankrupt his family. That fear is no longer a \nreality for his family because the Affordable Care Act says if you want \nto offer an insurance plan in this country, it has to be a fair plan. \nIt can't have annual or lifetime limits, and it can't charge you more \nbecause you are a woman. It has to cover basic medical necessities, \nsuch as maternity coverage.\n  The requirement of having insurance plans provide actual insurance \nthat doesn't discriminate against a person based on their medical \nhistory or gender not only allows people to have access to health care \nthey didn't have before, but it has given millions of families like \nKyle's family peace of mind.\n  The Johnson amendment would take that peace of mind away from \nmillions of families by allowing for plans to go back on the market \nthroughout the country--plans that would cap coverage on an annual or \nlifetime basis and that could once again discriminate against you based \non your gender or medical history.\n  There may be a lot of parts of the Affordable Care Act that people \nsupport or don't support. But the one thing that the people of all \nparties have generally supported is the idea that we should put \npatients and consumers back in charge of their health care, instead of \nthe old days when the insurance companies were in charge and would tell \nyou that you have insurance, but then halfway through the year, just \nbecause you used a lot of it, yank it away from you.\n  There are a number of reasons why we should reject this specific \namendment, but on behalf of the millions of families like Kyle's out \nthere that don't want to go back to a world in which their insurance \ncompanies could take away their coverage just because they needed it \nmore than other families, their stories alone are example enough to \nreject this amendment.\n  I hope that we can move on from this debate and try to work \ntogether--Republicans and Democrats--to perfect the Affordable Care Act \nand that we can get beyond this perpetual, ongoing, never-ending debate \nabout repeal. Specifically, with respect to the Johnson amendment, \nlet's think about all of those families that have been jerked around by \ninsurance companies for far too long and need relief that the \nAffordable Care Act has given them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I wish to add to the comments of Senator \nMurphy in opposition to that amendment. I wish to also to point out \nthat one of the previous speakers bemoaned the number of hospitals that \nhave closed in his State over the last 10 years. I bemoan them too. I \nalso know that more of those hospitals would have closed if the \nAffordable Care Act hadn't passed. More of those hospitals would have \nclosed if, in States like mine, the Governor didn't expand Medicaid.\n  We know that in States where rural hospitals have closed--\nparticularly if there was a Republican Governor--the hospital \nassociation and many, many, many health care providers of all kinds, \nincluding nurses, physical therapists, and others, asked the Governor \nof that State to expand Medicaid so these hospitals could stay in \nbusiness and keep serving rural people. This issue is not just about \nthe rural poor people in South Carolina, but rural middle-class people \nwho had insurance and were paying, but those hospitals couldn't stay \nopen because they didn't have the revenues coming in. If Governors from \nthose States had actually expanded Medicaid--as was the intent of the \nAffordable Care Act--instead of scoring political points, many of those \nhospitals would not have had to close.\n  I thank Senator Murphy for his efforts.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about an amendment that I \nwill not offer at this time but will probably offer later today about \nMedicaid--again, to help perfect the Affordable Care Act.\n  Since the passage of the health law, Medicaid expansion has helped \n600,000 Ohioans--many for the first time in their lives--in my State \nhave health coverage just because of Medicaid's expansion. That is why \nthe amendment I will offer will permanently extend the Medicaid \nexpansion Federal matching rate at 100 percent. Some Governors--I think \na bit disingenuously, but at least they are saying it--didn't expand \nMedicaid because the States will eventually have to pay up to 10 \npercent, even though the State gets all kinds of economic benefits, not \nto mention the humanitarian concerns that it addresses. Nonetheless, my \namendment will make it 100 percent--no more excuses, first of all, to \nrefuse to expand Medicaid.\n  At a time when some are looking to halt support for Medicaid, we \nshould be increasing that support. Since its enactment in 1965, \nMedicaid served as a lifeline for millions of Americans ranging from \nchildren and pregnant women to seniors who almost certainly would \notherwise not afford nursing home care without it.\n  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act--while my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle are attempting to dismantle it--States now have the \noption to expand Medicaid the way Governor Kasich, the Republican \nGovernor of my State did, including nonelderly adults without children. \nThirty States, including the District of Columbia and, as I said, my \nState of Ohio, have taken up Medicaid expansion, and it has obviously \nmattered to a whole lot of people.\n\n[[Page S8276]]\n\n  Federal Medical Assistance Percentages, which determine how much the \nFederal Government will pay for covered services in the State Medicaid \nprograms, were increased for States that chose to expand their Medicaid \nunder the Affordable Care Act. Under the health law, States that expand \ntheir Medicaid programs receive an enhanced Federal reimbursement for \nthe costs incurred by newly eligible enrollees. That matching rate will \nphase down from 100 percent to 90 percent in 2020.\n  My amendment would make the enhanced FMAP, the Medicaid expansion \nreimbursement, permanent. It is paid for by closing corporate tax \nloopholes. States that have expanded Medicaid have experienced \nsignificant drops in the number of uninsured. They have realized budget \nsavings and cut the cost of uncompensated care for hospitals.\n  The number of hospitals I have visited recently, including the \nhospital in which I was born, Medcentral in Mansfield, are bringing in \nmore patients who are paying because of Medicaid and the Affordable \nCare Act and fewer patients for which they are uncompensated, thereby \nhaving to cut costs a little bit less and making that hospital easier \nto manage. Too often hospitals have to cut patient services when they \nhave to cut their costs.\n  We should continue to support States that have done right and \nexpanded access. We can do this by maintaining their current FMAP \nrates. This policy will provide States with financial security. It will \nfree up State Medicaid budgets to address other Medicaid needs, such as \nincreased access to mental health services or the higher costs of \nprescription drugs. With millions of Americans falling into the \ncoverage gap in nonexpansion States--those couple of dozen States that \nhave refused to expand Medicaid even though the Federal Government pays \nfor almost all of it--this policy is likely to help encourage expansion \nof Medicaid in those States.\n  As I said, Ohio is one of the first States to accept Federal funds. I \nthank Governor Kasich, the Republican Governor of Ohio, for doing that. \nWithout expansion, Ohioans would have fallen through the cracks by \nmaking too much for traditional Medicaid but too little to qualify for \nsubsidies in the insurance marketplace. Now these individuals, \nincluding 600,000 in Ohio, have affordable coverage.\n  I don't understand how people who represent my State in the House or \nSenate can vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act when they have \n600,000 people in Ohio who have insurance--and that is just the \nMedicaid part--let alone the hundreds of thousands of others. How can \nthey vote to take away their insurance? Do they know those people? Do \nthey ever look those people in the eye and say: Sorry; I am scoring a \npolitical point. I will vote against the Affordable Care Act. Sorry; \nyou are going to lose your insurance, but maybe we will do something \ndown the road to help you.\n  Under these new provisions, 24,000 Medicaid enrollees in Ohio are \nbeing treated for cancer. These include Ohioans like Pamela Harris, the \nmother of four children. She had no health insurance before the State \nexpanded Medicaid--again giving credit to Republican Governor Kasich--\nand she found herself having to choose between paying for utility bills \nor medication. After her first stroke, Ms. Harris was unable to afford \nfollowup care and physical therapy, but when she survived her second \nstroke, her recovery was much better. Why? Because she was eligible for \nhealth insurance through Ohio's Medicaid expansion.\n  There are so many reasons to do this. Mr. President, 2015 marks the \n50th anniversary of Medicaid. We should be strengthening the program \nthat provides good quality health insurance to millions of Americans, \nincluding hundreds of thousands of people in Wyoming, Tennessee, South \nCarolina, and my State of Ohio. We should do that and not vote to take \nit away.\n  I will offer the amendment later.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak on \nbehalf of millions of Americans who are very grateful they have health \ncare now under the Affordable Care Act that they didn't have a few \nyears ago.\n  Looking back over the years, I am reminded of the steps forward that \nwe, as Americans, have taken, starting with Medicare and Medicaid, and \nhow we have helped to lift a generation of seniors out of poverty and \nill health because of lack of insurance and not having access to \nprescription drugs. The majority of Medicaid coverage, about 80 \npercent, is for seniors in nursing homes.\n  We are moving forward again and putting in place the ability of \npeople to see a doctor and get the medical care that they need. With \nthe Affordable Care Act, we took the next important step for over 17 \nmillion Americans. Moms and dads don't have to go to bed at night \nanymore and say: Please, God. Don't let the kids get sick. They know \nthey will be able to take their child to a doctor. They know they are \ngoing to be able to get coverage and won't get dropped if they get \nsick, which was happening in too many cases before the Affordable Care \nAct. Women now know that just simply being a woman is not a preexisting \ncondition, where we were paying twice as much for basic insurance or \nblocked from certain kinds of care.\n\n  I will never forget the debate in the Finance Committee when we \nincluded an amendment of mine for comprehensive preventive care, \nincluding maternity care for women, and a colleague asked: Why should \nwe cover maternity care? He didn't need maternity care. I reminded him \nthat his mom did, and I reminded him of the importance of maternity \ncare for women and children and those of us who are now adults. So that \nis now a part of the Affordable Care Act.\n  Young people are now able to stay on their parents' insurance while \nlooking for a full-time job after they graduate from college. Slowing \nthe growth of insurance premiums is what we still need to do. That is \nwhat we should be focusing on today together--to continue to be laser \nfocused in that area as well.\n  Now, 17.6 million Americans have health insurance coverage. Under the \nreconciliation bill--the budget bill in front of us--the rug is going \nto be pulled out from all of them, from millions of Americans. Passing \nthis reconciliation bill will dismantle the framework, the structure \nfor health care for millions of Americans--men and women and children.\n  It also will do something else. Instead of celebrating health care \nservices that we have had for years--nearly 100 years of preventive \nhealth care services--through Planned Parenthood providing essential \nhealth services to men and women, particularly in areas that don't have \nservices, such as in rural parts of my State as well as around the \ncountry--instead of strengthening those services, what we see is an \neffort to actually eliminate preventive health care services for women. \nIt seems one more time women's health care is attacked. It takes on all \nkinds of different forms, but it always ends up with the same thing--\nchallenges to women's health care.\n  So I am urging my colleagues to vote no on this Republican budget \nproposal that guts health care for families, that would strip funding \nfor preventive health care, for family planning, and for other \npreventive health care. Millions will lose their coverage if this \npasses.\n  Instead of focusing on this bill, which is essentially something that \nwe know is going to be vetoed by the President of the United States--he \nis not going to allow that health care coverage to be taken away; he is \nnot going to allow preventive health care services to be taken away. We \nknow what the outcome is really going to be. So this is really a \npolitical exercise. I understand that people want to say that they \nvoted to eliminate the Affordable Care Act, to take away health \ninsurance for people, and to stop funding for Planned Parenthood and \nother preventive health care services. But we all know where it is \ngoing to end. First of all, I can't believe that people think it is a \ngood idea to do that, but maybe other States are different than \nMichigan, where people want to have health care for themselves and \ntheir families.\n\n[[Page S8277]]\n\n  We have in front of us a whole other range of things that are very \nimportant to do right now. There is a major effort on a transportation \nbill that is, in fact--rather than being partisan and divisive as this \nbudget reconciliation is--bipartisan, and we need to move that as soon \nas possible.\n  We are working on budget issues and tax policy and other areas where \nwe can work together. The list is long of things the American people \nwant us to get done.\n  We need to be tackling the affordability of college so that more \npeople have the ability to work hard, get good grades, get accepted to \nschool, and go to college. Instead, here we are debating whether people \nshould have health care in the United States of America.\n  The bottom line is that according to the nonpartisan budget office, \nthis bill on the whole would increase premiums by roughly 20 percent \nabove what would be expected under current law. So on top of \neverything, including over 16 million people losing their health \ninsurance, everybody is going to see their rates go up. Merry \nChristmas, happy Hanukkah, happy New Year--20-percent, on average, \nincrease in premiums.\n  This reconciliation bill makes no sense. It is bad for the American \npeople. It is bad for women. We ought to be focused on things that \nactually improve quality of life and continue to improve health care \nand bring down costs for all Americans.\n  I hope we will reject this bill and move on to things that make a lot \nmore sense, certainly for families in Michigan and across the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I have listened carefully to the Presiding \nOfficer's comments earlier and the comments of others who have talked \nabout the importance of passing this bill and drawing focus again to \nthe health care plan that is just not working. It is not working. The \nState exchanges are failing. They are sort of fleeing to a bigger \nFederal exchange, and the insurance companies are fleeing the Federal \nexchange as well as the State exchanges. They are moving out of the \nfamily market. They are moving out of the individual market.\n  The biggest health insurance company announced recently that they \nwere likely to abandon this particular process next year. The plan \nwhere the insurance companies that had a profit would use some of that \nprofit to offset the loss of other companies isn't working because, as \nothers have well explained, the incentive for young, healthy people to \nbe part of this plan is just not there. The premiums are too high, and \nthe deductibles are too high.\n  There is no reason to be part of this, and there should be nothing \nnew here. The failures of this plan were almost guaranteed when the \nHouse and Senate, under the control of our friends on the other side, \ndecided they were going to pass the bill the Senate passed when there \nwere 60 Democrats here to vote for a bill. It doesn't matter how flawed \nthat bill was. It doesn't matter how many problems were in that bill. \nIt is the only thing we can do, and we are going to do it, and in doing \nit, we are going to interject a government between not only a whole lot \nof the economy but between people and their health care.\n  I have said on this floor before and many other places that somebody \ntold me one time that when everybody in your family is well, you have \nlots of problems; when somebody in your family is sick, you have one \nproblem.\n  When the Federal Government decides they are going to help families \nin ways that families don't want that help, when the Federal Government \ndecides they are going to interject themselves between families and \ntheir doctors, families and their health care, families and their \ninsurance company choices, you can't really expect good things to \nhappen.\n  The anticipation not too long ago was that on the individual \nexchange, where you go get your own insurance for yourself, there would \nbe 20 million people signed up by the end of last year. When that \nprojection was made, I think there were 14 million Americans on the \nexchange. Not too many weeks ago, they were back down to 9 million, and \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services said a better and more \nrealistic goal for the end of 2016 would be 10 million people--exactly \nhalf of the number the administration thought would be there 6 months \nago. What would be wrong that would cause that to happen? How could you \nbe that far off in how you thought Americans and American families were \ngoing to respond to this? You could be that far off by just not \nlistening.\n  For the first year of implementation of this plan, I came to the \nfloor week after week after week, and week after week after week, I had \nletters, calls, and emails from Missourians talking about how this was \nimpacting the lives of their families. I have told those stories on \nthis floor before, so I won't tell them again today, but there are \nhundreds of them multiplied by thousands if you talk to anybody who has \ntalked to anybody about this system.\n  Interestingly, those calls, letters, emails, and contacts appear to \nbe coming back because people have now decided that this is not as bad \nas they thought it was; it is worse than they thought it was. The \nproblems aren't as great as they had feared; they are worse than they \nhad feared.\n  In 2013, Lance called our office. He was very concerned. He liked his \ncoverage. The President said you could keep your coverage, but his \ncoverage didn't conform to the new standards the Federal Government has \nsuddenly decided you needed to have no matter what you thought and the \nFederal Government has decided you needed to pay for no matter whether \nor not you could pay for it. So he was told: You can't keep that \npolicy. Well, like so many other things in this law, he was pretty \nquickly then told: Well, no, we figured out a way that for a year or \nso, you can keep your policy. So Lance was going to keep the policy, \nbut he found out that for any number of reasons related to this big \nchange in health care, the policy he wanted to keep was $150 more a \nmonth than he had been paying for it and the deductible increased by \n$7,500. So, like a lot of other people, he would have loved to have \nkept the policy he had before, but none of it made any sense for him \nanymore.\n  I received a letter just a few days ago from a friend of mine who \nruns a business in Kimberling City. In that letter, she mentioned they \nwere 3 or 4 employees short of 50 employees. As employers, they didn't \nhave to do this, but they had always provided group health and life. \nThey wanted to do that again, but in her letter, she said that the \nprices have skyrocketed and the way companies now feel as though they \nhave to aggregate their employees is much different than it used to be, \nparticularly for older employees, if you are over 47.\n  Here are some numbers she gave me in that letter. If you are over 52, \nthe increase this year over last year was $2,128. That is the annual \nincrease. That is not the annual premium; that is the annual increase, \n$2,128.76. If you are 58, the annual increase was $4,599.60. Again, \nthat is not the cost of the policy; that is the increase this year over \nlast year. And if you were 61, the increase was $5,680.20.\n  This is a company that for years has done everything it could to \nprovide this as a benefit. One, it is clearly a benefit they have a \nhard time affording, and suddenly it is a benefit that creates a huge \nobstacle for older workers. Where everybody used to be rated the same, \nthey would rate your group, now they want to rate the individuals in \nyour group.\n  In our State, in Missouri, the average premium has increased by more \nthan 10 percent. In Kansas City, the increase is 20 percent. The silver \nplan--not the best plan and not the worst plan--is 13 percent higher. \nThe bronze plan, which sort of meets the minimum standards the \nadministration says you have to have or pay the penalty, is 16 percent \nhigher. That is just 1 year, and this is just your insurance. It is not \nyour higher utility bill that is higher because of another government \nregulation; it is not your higher this or your higher that; this is \njust your higher cost of not having to pay the penalty.\n\n[[Page S8278]]\n\n  Just the other day, Health and Human Services said for the first time \never, the average deductible is over $2,000. There is a little merit to \nhaving some of your own money invested in your own health care as you \nmake these decisions, but the average is over $2,000. Many families are \nnow seeing a $5,000 individual deductible with a maximum of two family \nmembers, if you happen to have two people sick in the same year. Those \nsame families may be paying $500, $600, $800 a month or more for \ninsurance, so you have your insurance costs approaching $1,000 a month \nand your deductible of $10,000. For most families, that is just like \nnot having insurance at all. You are writing this check every month \nhoping nobody gets sick. If you get sick, you might have to write \nanother $10,000 check or more. As a matter of fact, I just mentioned \nthat Lance had the policy where his deductible went up $7,500 as his \npremium was going up $150.\n  I spent a lot of time with the hospital community in our State. Over \nand over again, I said: OK, what is your fastest growing column of bad \ndebt? Over and over again, the answer is people with health insurance. \nPeople with health insurance are the fastest growing column of bad debt \nbecause the health insurance has a deductible that family can't pay. If \nthe deductible had been $500, you had that discussion: Well, we can do \n$200 of that, and maybe your mom and dad could help us with half of the \nother $300, and somebody else would help with the other $150, and we \nwill pay it. But if it is a $5,000 deductible, many families just say: \nWe are never going to pay--we can't pay $5,000. And so the health care \nprovider writes that off.\n  They are also taxing health savings accounts and flexible savings \naccounts, which are other tools people were using and using pretty \neffectively to have that money for a deductible, to have that money to \noffset things they didn't want to insure against.\n  This is a system that is simply designed to fail, and there is no \nnews here. There is no news here. Every time I came to this floor to \ntalk about this--and that was many, many times--I explained why the \nsystem would fail. Some of the press in my State--at least I remember \none column that said: Senator Blunt is spending way too much time \ntalking about the weaknesses of ObamaCare. This is everybody's health \nand 60 percent of the economy. It is pretty hard to spend too much time \ntalking about those things.\n  The other thing we constantly hear is that there were no \nalternatives. Let me quickly list those, and I am going to then yield \nthe floor to others.\n  The things that could have been done and still could be done, things \nthat were proposed even though we constantly hear ``Well, there were no \nother ideas out there''--there were lots of ideas out there. Expand \nhealth savings accounts. Let those accounts be used for long-term care \nor long-term care insurance. Let small businesses join as a group. Let \nyoung adults stay on the policy longer. Liability reform, fair tax \ntreatment, and buying across State lines are the kinds of things that \ncould happen. Prohibit policy cancellation. Use what were very strong \nhigh-risk pools--expand those so that people with preexisting \nconditions could never be shut out of the insurance market. All of that \nfell on deaf ears, and now all we hear is that there were no other \nideas, this is the only idea. This is a plan that is not working.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this bill that puts the \nresponsibility right back where it belongs--on the President's desk.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, you just heard my colleague from Missouri \ntalk about many of the things that could be used to replace ObamaCare. \nThere were a lot of ideas that make sense when it comes to health care \nin this country, that put patients and consumers more in charge of \ntheir health care decisions, and that create more competition and allow \nmarket forces out there to work to drive health care prices down, which \nis the exact opposite of what we have with ObamaCare.\n  For those who suggest there aren't other ideas out there, you just \nheard the Senator from Missouri go through a quite lengthy list of \nideas that could be incorporated into a replacement for what has been a \ndisastrous piece of legislation for the American people. The reason for \nthat is because after 5 years now, one thing has become abundantly \nclear; that is, ObamaCare just isn't working. It flat isn't working. It \nis not lowering premiums, it is not reducing health care costs, and it \nis not protecting access to doctors or hospitals.\n  Instead, Americans are paying more for their premiums. The average \ncost of a family health care plan has risen to $17,545 a year up from \n$13,770 in 2010. That is nearly $4,000 a year in additional costs that \nthe typical family in this country is having to contend with.\n  In addition to paying higher premiums, Americans with job-based \ninsurance are also facing increased deductibles. The situation is also \nbad on the ObamaCare exchanges. Premiums on the exchanges will rise \nonce again this year, with many Americans facing rate increases in the \ndouble digits.\n  Then there are the tax increases Americans are facing as a result of \nthe law. While the Obama administration did its best to hide the true \ncosts of the law, the truth is ObamaCare implements almost a dozen new \ntaxes to the tune of $1 trillion. American families are going to face \nan average of $20,000 more in taxes over the next 10 years thanks to \nObamaCare.\n  Now, I could go on. I could talk about the failing co-ops, the failed \nexchanges, the taxpayer dollars the law has wasted and much, much more. \nBut today I would like to take just a few minutes to talk about the \npeople behind those statistics--the individual Americans who are \nstruggling under the tremendous burden ObamaCare has imposed. Over the \npast 5 years I have received numerous letters from constituents sharing \nthe pain ObamaCare has caused them. I want to highlight just a few of \nthe most recent.\n  I had a constituent of mine from Hill City, SD, write to tell me:\n\n       My premium is going from $624.16 a month to $1,054.42 per \n     month, an increase of 68.93 percent. My wife's premium is \n     going from $655.70 to $1,083.41 per month, an increase of \n     65.23 percent. I was under the assumption that the new \n     Affordable Health Care Act was to be just that, affordable. \n     How can a yearly bill of $25,653.96 be affordable to a \n     retired couple?\n\n  That is from a constituent in Hill City, SD. Another constituent in \nAberdeen, SD, wrote to share a similar story:\n\n       We just received our rate increase for our family health \n     insurance. We have been paying $1,283.81 a month and the \n     $557.45 increase will bring it up to $1,841.26. This amount \n     has gone from 26 percent to 37 percent of our income. . . . \n     After having insurance coverage for the past 38 years, we are \n     faced with dropping coverage, which is ironic since that is \n     not the purpose of the Affordable Care Act. We are \n     considering dropping insurance and facing the penalty just so \n     we can continue to live in our house, pay the bills, and buy \n     groceries.\n\n  Another constituent from Redfield, SD, wrote to tell me:\n\n       My current monthly premium is $863.12. The monthly change \n     in my premium is $470.67, making my monthly premium a hefty \n     sum of $1,333.79. I think this is outrageous.\n\n  Again, this is from a constituent in Redfield, SD. She continues to \nsay:\n\n       I know I am not the only one facing such enormous premium \n     increases. My son, who is married and has two small children, \n     received notice that his monthly premium will increase $495, \n     making his monthly premium $1,571.\n\n  Well, unfortunately, she and her son are far from the only ones to \nface such enormous premium increases. A constituent in Sioux Falls, SD, \nis facing a 50-percent premium increase. The premium of a Deadwood \nconstituent is increasing by 47 percent. A constituent in Milbank is \nfacing a 62-percent premium increase. As I mentioned above, a \nconstituent in Hill City is facing an increase of almost 69 percent.\n  More than one constituent has written to tell me that his health \ninsurance costs more than his mortgage payment--more than a mortgage \npayment. One constituent told me she and her husband would have to pay \n60 percent of their income to insure themselves and their four \nchildren--60 percent of their income. Think about that. If any more \nevidence was needed to demonstrate ObamaCare has failed, that should be \nsufficient.\n  The Affordable Care Act may have been a well-intentioned law, but it \nhas failed to achieve its objective. Not only has it failed to make \nhealth care more\n\n[[Page S8279]]\n\naffordable, but it has actually driven up health care prices to \nunthinkable levels for far too many Americans. South Dakota families \ncannot afford 50-percent premium increases or health insurance payments \nthat are double their mortgage payments. No family can afford that--no \nfamily anyplace in the country.\n  It is time for Democrats to stop defending this broken law and to \nwork with Republicans to repeal it and to begin building a bridge to \nreal health care reform for hard-working families across the country. \nThe legislation before us today would do just that. It would give us \nthat opportunity to move away from a health care plan that has failed, \nthat has led to higher premiums and higher deductibles and higher \ncopays and higher out-of-pocket costs and constructed networks where \nyou can't get access to the same providers you perhaps could in the \npast. So the whole idea that if you like your health care, you can keep \nit is just not reflected in reality for most Americans.\n  The promises that were made have been broken. This health care law is \na failed law. We can do much better by the American people, if we have \nthat opportunity, but it starts with repealing this bad law and \nstarting over and putting in place a health care system for this \ncountry that creates more affordable, more accessible health care for \nmore Americans. I hope our colleagues here in the Senate will join \ntogether on both sides of the aisle and repeal this bad law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the ObamaCare \nlegislation we are dealing with today and in an effort to repeal. I \njoin my colleagues in calling on the President to work with us to \nreform this very badly written law.\n  By any objective measure, the President's health care law is a \ndisaster. Six years ago, at Christmas time, I was here on this floor as \nwe held the final debate and held the final vote, after nearly a year \nof trying to stop this legislation from being forced into law. \nUnfortunately, it was passed in the most partisan and misguided way on \na straight party-line vote after virtually every serious effort to \namend it and repair it had been rejected outright.\n  Since that time, the American people have felt the impact of the law. \nThirty of the Senators who forced it through this Chamber no longer \nserve in the Senate any more. I don't believe this legislation could \npass again were it brought before us. Those of us who fought over it at \nthat time raised a number of concerns and warned the American people \nthat this proposal would result in widespread dislocation of the \nAmerican health care economy, that it would increase taxes on nearly \neveryone, force people from health insurance plans and doctors whom \nthey have and whom they like, push up premiums and out-of-pocket \nexpenses, cut Medicare services, and, finally, undermine the employer-\nbased health insurance program and market that so many people and \nfamilies rely upon.\n  Unfortunately, time and again, we have been proven right. In truth, \ntoday we see that the situation is much worse than even we said it \nwould be. The President not only managed to mangle the 2013 rollout of \nthe ObamaCare exchanges, but he repeatedly has delayed key parts of the \nlaw because of the entirely predictable problems that have arisen and \nmade selective interpretations of the law necessary to advance the \nadministration's political interests.\n  The President, or a top administrative official, stated 37 times: \n``If you like your health care plan, you can keep it.'' These included \nnumerous national townhalls and weekly Presidential addresses. This \nstatement proved to be PolitiFact's 2013 ``Lie of the Year.''\n  Since those statements, millions of cancellation notices have been \nsent out to Americans across this country, including over 100,000 in \nIdaho alone in 2013, rendering meaningless the President's oft- \nrepeated pledge.\n  In January, CBO updated its estimate of the effects of the health \ncare law, indicating that over 10 million individuals will lose their \nemployer-based health care coverage by 2021. Further, CBO estimates the \nlaw will leave 31 million people uninsured, up from its original 2011 \nforecast of 23 million people.\n  We are also learning that the health care Consumer Operated and \nOriented Plan Program--the CO-OP program--is failing nationally, \ndespite receiving over $2 billion in taxpayer bailouts. Today, over \nhalf--12 of the original 23 public co-ops--have failed. Between October \n9 and October 16, 4 co-ops announced they would not offer health \ninsurance in 2016, leaving 176,000 patients scrambling to find a new \nplan.\n  The President is also annually faced with the reality of rising \npremiums and out-of-pocket expenses for health insurance plans. What is \nhis line of argument? He again tries to lower expectations, saying that \nthese costs are not as bad as they initially were projected to be, even \nthough they are still going up.\n  Throughout the 2008 Presidential campaign, then-Senator Barack Obama \nrepeatedly promised that his health care plan would bring down premiums \nby as much as $2,500 for the typical family. As President, he continued \nto make this claim, even after studies demonstrated that the opposite \nwould occur. The truth was that the opposite did occur. Health care \npremiums have skyrocketed.\n  For the most recent open enrollment period, the average premium \nincrease for the midlevel silver plans on the Federal exchange is 7.5 \npercent, more than triple last year's increase. In Idaho, which \noperates a State exchange, the average premium increase for a Blue \nCross of Idaho plan is 23 percent. The average premium for a Regence \nBlueShield of Idaho plan is 10 percent. And the average premium \nincrease for a SelectHealth plan is 14 percent. This is after year \nafter year of increasing health care premiums.\n  What is the justification from the insurers? This is the first year \nprices are based on post-ObamaCare patients, enrollments costs, and \nmandates. Premiums are skyrocketing.\n  There are better solutions. To address the increasing costs and \ndecreasing choices, the bill we have before us today eliminates the \nindividual and employer mandates so Americans can once again choose the \nplan that fits their health care and budget needs.\n  It also repeals the taxes on employer contributions to flexible \nspending accounts and expands the availability of health savings \naccounts, FSAs, and health reimbursement accounts. These accounts are \ncentral to a consumer-driven health care system.\n  But it is not just premiums that are increasing. People are facing \nhigher deductibles and copays as well, sometimes thousands of dollars \nhigher than before. For the lowest cost ObamaCare plans in 2016, \ndeductibles have increased by 10.6 percent for individuals and 10 \npercent for families.\n  Let me give just a couple of examples from constituents in Idaho. \nDaniel from Meridian, ID, recently contacted my office to explain why \nhe and his family are uninsured for the first time in their lives. \nDaniel is employed and the sole provider for his family. His employer \noffers health coverage, but the estimated cost of premiums for his \nfamily would be over $900 per month. He chose to purchase insurance \nfrom the exchange but decided the coverage was not worth a $500-per-\nmonth premium and an $8,000 deductible. That is right, an $8,000 \ndeductible.\n  Daniel is not the only constituent who has contacted my office about \nthe so-called family glitch--an unfortunate but not uncommon flaw in \nObamaCare that has left millions of Americans families uninsured.\n  Bill from Boise, ID, is a small business owner. He purchases his own \nhealth insurance and provides coverage to his 45 employees. He saw his \npremiums increase by 7 percent in 2014, by 12 percent in 2015, and was \nrecently notified by his insurance company that premiums will increase \nby 25.6 percent in 2016. Bill says these increases, in addition to \nother regulations and mandates coming from the government, will likely \ncause small businesses to close their doors.\n  Lane from Melba, ID, experienced his premiums increase to over $900 \nper month for his family. Even without preexisting conditions, his plan \nincludes a $3,500 deductible. These cost increases come as individuals \nare paying more in taxes also as a result of ObamaCare.\n\n[[Page S8280]]\n\n  People may recall that at the time of the debate, the President \nstated again and again:\n\n       I can make a firm pledge . . . no family making less than \n     $250,000 will see their taxes increase . . . not your income \n     taxes, not your payroll taxes, not your capital gains taxes, \n     not any of your taxes. . . . You will not see any of your \n     taxes increase one single dime.\n\n  Well, when we debated the bill we pointed out that there was over $1 \ntrillion--maybe close to $1.5 trillion--of new taxes, most of which \nwere going to fall squarely on the middle class. Yet, during \nconsideration of ObamaCare, the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation \nsent me a letter confirming that there were at least seven specific tax \nincreases in the bill which would raise taxes on middle-income American \nfamilies.\n  According to CBO, ObamaCare will cost taxpayers more than $116 \nbillion a year in taxes. The average American household can expect to \npay more than $20,000 in new taxes over the next 10 years. In Idaho, my \nconstituents will pay $360 million more in taxes over the next decade, \nor $6,055 per household.\n  The legislation we are considering today will solve this problem as \nwell. It will eliminate more than $1 trillion in tax increases and save \nmore than $500 billion in spending. And for all of the additional \nburdens, mandates, and costs, consumers are finding narrower insurance \nnetworks and limited plan offerings. In its recent Notice of Benefit \nand Payment Parameters for 2017, CMS actually stated that an excessive \nnumber of health plan options makes consumers less likely to make any \nplan selection and that standardized options are needed to provide \nconsumers the opportunity to make simpler comparisons. This means these \nstandardizations will once again mandate that insurers offer consumers \nfewer options.\n  To sum up, millions of Americans are being forced from plans they \nlike and the doctors and hospitals they know. They face higher premiums \nand higher deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses, they navigate one of \nthe least customer-friendly Web sites ever designed, they are obligated \nto share personal and sensitive financial information through a network \nthat hackers have called a gold mine for thieves--and, which is managed \nby the IRS--and, in return, they are paying higher taxes and seeing \nMedicare benefits cut.\n  It is time that we in Congress place on the President's desk a \nsolution, a repeal of these onerous and misguided health care policies \nand a reform of our health care system that will help move us to \nachieve the true objectives that Americans are asking for--helping to \nget a proper health care delivery system with a market-based delivery \nfoundation that will help to reduce costs, increase the quality of \ncare, and expand access to care across this country. We know we can do \nit. But we know now very clearly that ObamaCare is not the solution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto finish my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this week marks another milestone in the \nlong, sordid history of the so-called Affordable Care Act.\n  It has been roughly 5\\1/2\\ years since this law, cobbled together \nwith spit and baling wire, went into effect. In a few weeks, we will \nreach the 6-year anniversary of the initial Senate passage of the \nlegislation that would eventually become ObamaCare. Many of us remember \nthose days well because we were here when it happened. Others who were \nhere back then are no longer serving in Congress, and, in many cases, \nas a direct result of how they voted at the time. Still, for those of \nus who remain, I expect that this week--as we debate and hope to pass \nlegislation to repeal the most harmful elements of ObamaCare--will \nbring back a flood of memories. It already has for me.\n  We all remember the absurd promises that were made by the President \nand his allies to try to win over the American public: If you like your \nhealth insurance, you can keep it; the bill will bring health care \ncosts down; only rich people and evil corporations will see their taxes \ngo up--and so on and so forth.\n  We all remember the deals cut behind closed doors to bring reluctant \nDemocratic Senators on board. A number of those deals ended being so \nnotorious that they even got nicknames: the ``Cornhusker kickback,'' \nthe ``Louisiana purchase,'' the ``Bay State boondoggle,'' and \n``Gatorade.'' We all remember a sitting Speaker of the House arguing \nwith a straight face that Congress would have to pass the health care \nlaw before the American people could know what was in it.\n  More than anything, we all remember a Senate majority--a super \nmajority, as some called it at the time--that was so committed to \ngiving their President a political win that they forced a massive, \npoorly drafted bill through the Senate without a single Republican \nvote. They didn't need any Republican votes to pass it, and they sure \nweren't looking for any. Instead, they threw together a massive \noverhaul of a huge portion of the U.S. economy and forced it on the \nAmerican people on a strictly partisan basis--not only here but also in \nthe House.\n  I will tell you something else that I personally remember from that \ntime. I remember sitting here on the floor shortly before the final \ncloture vote during the Senate's consideration of the bill and \nlistening to our distinguished majority leader, who was at the time the \nminority leader. It was December 21, 2009. It was late, nearly 1 \no'clock in the morning, and the good Senator stood up and offered some \ndire warnings for those who supported the bill. After detailing many of \nthe problems the bill would cause--predictions that have all come true, \nby the way--Senator McConnell said:\n\n       I understand the pressure our friends on the other side are \n     feeling, and I don't doubt for a moment their sincerity. But \n     my message tonight is this: The impact of this vote will long \n     outlive this one frantic snowy weekend in Washington. Mark my \n     words: This legislation will reshape our Nation. . . .\n\n  And he was right. That legislation--now a law--has in many ways \nreshaped our Nation, including some ways that I am not even sure \nSenator McConnell could have predicted that night.\n  Yes, it has had a disastrous impact on our health care system. I will \nhave more to say about that in a moment. But, in my view, it has also \neroded the public's confidence in our institutions and undermined the \nability of our government to function well. By passing this law--\nforcing it through Congress on a purely partisan basis--its proponents \nsent a clear message that partisanship trumped good judgment and the \nwill of the voters.\n  After running a masterful election campaign, President Obama came \ninto office in 2009 riding a wave of goodwill and promises to usher in \nan era of ``post-partisanship''--whatever that was supposed to mean--\nand allow us to transcend ideology to focus on good government and \npragmatic solutions. Yet his biggest campaign promise, the top priority \nof his first term and his signature domestic achievement, ObamaCare, \nwas the result of the largest exercise in naked partisanship in our \nNation's history.\n  By any estimation, the debate and passage of ObamaCare deepened our \nNation's partisan divide and drove more voters--on both ends of the \nspectrum--into deeper and more entrenched partisan and ideological \npositions. It made people more cynical and less trusting of our \ngovernment and its leaders. It gave additional credence to the \nperception that politics and governing in America are more about \ntribalism and conflict than about providing real solutions to the \nproblems plaguing our citizens.\n  Can anyone seriously argue that our Nation is less partisan or less \ndivided now than it was prior to the passage of ObamaCare? I would like \nto see anyone try to make that claim with a straight face.\n  Sadly, that is not all. The damage wrought by ObamaCare extends well \nbeyond our Nation's political discourse and into our governing \ninstitutions themselves. Most notably, we have had an administration so \ncommitted to ObamaCare that it has, on numerous occasions, exceeded its \nconstitutional authority in order to preserve it.\n  The examples of overreach and abuse of power have been well \ndocumented. The Obama administration has unilaterally moved deadlines \nset by the statute that they found to be inconvenient. They have \nrewritten provisions in the\n\n[[Page S8281]]\n\nlaw to give favors and carve-outs to political supporters. They have \nselectively enforced other provisions in order to give more teeth to \ntheir regulations. And that is just the tip of the iceberg.\n  Make no mistake. President Obama's penchant for Executive overreach \nextends well beyond the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. But \nclearly, many of the most egregious examples of abuse on the part of \nthis administration were undertaken to preserve a poorly constructed \nhealth system that simply could not work the way the law was drafted. \nSimply put, ObamaCare has led directly to a weakening of our \nconstitutional order and an erosion of the separation of powers. Given \nall of these negative consequences, the question ultimately becomes \nthis: Has it been worth it?\n  Don't get me wrong. In my opinion, all these terrible aftereffects \nwould, by themselves, be enough justification to undo what was done in \nthis Chamber nearly 6 years ago. Still, if the law was working--if it \nwas having a positive overall impact on our health care system--\nproponents might have something to hang their hat on when it comes to \nthis law. Indeed, if the American people now had better, more \naffordable health care, supporters of ObamaCare could at least try to \nargue that all of these other problems have been in service of some \nnoble cause. Of course, we know the law is not working. The American \npeople do not have better, more affordable health care under ObamaCare. \nInstead, the parade of horribles that began the day the law was enacted \nhas extended beyond our politics, beyond our institutions, and into the \nlives and livelihoods of everyday Americans.\n  The system created by the Affordable Care Act--so-called Affordable \nCare Act--was based largely on the premise that the government could \nimpose drastic new regulations on the individual health insurance \nmarket without dramatically increasing the cost of insurance because \nyounger, healthier consumers would be drawn into the market, bringing \ndown costs for everyone else. This claim was obviously fiction. \nRepublicans argued at the time that without serious effort to reduce \ncosts overall, this prized demographic group would stay out of the \nmarket, and premiums would skyrocket due to the various mandates and \nregulations. We now know that we were right. Younger and healthier \npatients are, by the millions, choosing to forego health insurance and \npay fines rather than enter into the individual insurance market. \nAccording to most surveys, many of these individuals are choosing to go \nuninsured because, even with the benefit of ObamaCare premium \nsubsidies, they cannot afford the cost of insurance.\n  As a result, premiums are going up all over the country. Premium \nspikes in the double digits have been increasingly common in the \ncurrent enrollment period. My own home State of Utah has seen premiums \ngo up in this enrollment period by an average 22 percent, which will \nundoubtedly wreak havoc on family budgets and local businesses. Other \nStates have it even worse, with premiums spiking as much as 25 percent, \n30 percent or, in the case of a State such as South Dakota, 63 percent.\n  Even with increased premiums, insurers are having a harder time doing \nbusiness in a number of markets, leading providers to exit the various \nexchanges where patients buy insurance with the aid of ObamaCare \nsubsidies. Just a few weeks ago, in fact, we saw reports that the \nlargest health insurance company in the Nation--UnitedHealth Group--was \nconsidering withdrawing from the exchanges entirely. The result will \ninevitably mean fewer insurers, which means fewer choices and even \nhigher premiums for consumers. It is no wonder, therefore, that next \nyear's enrollment estimates for the exchanges are down dramatically. \nAnd, as enrollment drops, all of this--the costs, the reduced options, \nand the overall state of care--will get even worse in the individual \nhealth insurance market.\n  This downward spiral is all the more maddening when we consider that \nthe President promised the American people that his law would actually \nreduce the cost of health insurance in the United States.\n  I am not done yet. There are other problems worth discussing here \ntoday. There is, for example, ObamaCare's massive Medicaid expansion. \nIn virtually every case, when the proponents of ObamaCare cite numbers \nof newly insured individuals under the law, most of the increase can be \nattributed to the Medicaid expansion. Let's be clear. Medicaid is one \nof the most poorly constructed programs in all of government. It is \nextremely costly at the Federal level and even more so at the State \nlevel, where it is not uncommon for the program to take up as much as \none-fourth to one-third of a State's financial resources. Even with all \nthat cost, it is, in terms of available providers and services, one of \nthe worst, if not the worst health insurance options in the country.\n\n  Some of us in Congress have been working for years to reform the \nstructure of the Medicaid Program in order to reduce costs, improve the \nprogram, and preserve it for those who are in need. The Affordable Care \nAct did not fix these problems; it made them worse. Under ObamaCare, \nMedicaid is more expensive to taxpayers and an even larger burden on \nthe States. With dramatically increased enrollment, Medicaid reform is \nlikely to be even more difficult in the future.\n  Why anyone would brag about adding enrollees to an insolvent \ngovernment health program that provides the lowest standard of service \nin the country with the fewest provider options is beyond me. I suppose \nthose tasked with claiming ObamaCare is a success have to cite positive \nfigures wherever they can dig them up.\n  The Affordable Care Act also increased taxes dramatically. It raised \ntaxes on drug companies and medical device manufacturers, which have \nbeen passed directly to middle-income and lower income consumers \nbecause that is what happens when you increase taxes on businesses that \nproduce goods and services. It includes a tax on the so-called Cadillac \ninsurance plans, which proponents claim would only impact rich \nemployees of very large corporations. Of course, the tax was structured \nin a way that guarantees that in the not too distant future, millions \nof middle-class Americans will be hit by the tax and see their \ninsurance costs go up even further.\n  All told, there have been about $1 trillion in new taxes under \nObamaCare. While the President and his allies may claim these taxes \nhold the middle class harmless, the facts tell a different story. That \nstory, of course, isn't just now coming to light. Many of us on the \nRepublican side have been talking about these issues from the very \nbeginning.\n  I can go on and on. For example, the Affordable Care Act, with its \nvarious mandates, also increased costs to employers around the country, \nresulting in fewer new hires and reduced opportunities for many \nexisting employees. Many small businesses now choose not to expand in \norder to avoid reaching the number of employees that will trigger new \nrequirements. At the same time, because the law perversely defines a \nfull-time employee as one working a minimum of 30 hours, other \ncompanies are avoiding the triggers by cutting back on workers' hours.\n  All of these developments--every single one of them--were predicted \nway back in 2009 when the law was being debated. The President told us \nwe were wrong. His supporters in Congress did the same. They ignored \nthe obvious warnings, and now the American people, as well as small \nbusinesses and job creators, are paying the price.\n  These issues and many others are why Republicans have spent more than \n5 years fighting against ObamaCare. We have introduced bills to repeal \nthe whole law, others to repeal just the most harmful elements. I \npersonally have introduced bills to repeal the individual mandate, the \nemployer mandate, and the medical device tax. On the Senate Finance \nCommittee, we have conducted rigorous oversight on numerous aspects of \nthe law and the implementation of various programs. Other committees \nhave done the same within their jurisdictions. Virtually all of us have \nsupported efforts to challenge elements of the law in court.\n  While we have differed on tactics from time to time, Republicans have \nbeen united in our desire to repeal and replace this misguided attempt \nat health care reform. Some of us have even come up with specific ideas \non\n\n[[Page S8282]]\n\nhow to replace ObamaCare. For example, earlier this year, Senator Burr, \nChairman Fred Upton from the House, and I released the latest draft of \nthe Patient CARE Act, a legislative proposal that would fix many of the \nthings the authors of ObamaCare got horribly wrong.\n  Most notably, as a number of health care experts have concluded, our \nproposal would actually reduce health care costs. As we all know, \nrising costs are the single biggest problem plaguing our health care \nsystem. Yet the President's health law did virtually nothing to address \nthis issue. Unlike the poorly named Affordable Care Act, the Patient \nCARE Act would actually make health care more affordable throughout the \nUnited States.\n  At the beginning of this year, Republicans assumed the majority in \nthe Senate, having committed--even promised in some cases--to work to \nrepeal this so-called Affordable Care Act. This week, with the bill now \nbefore us, we will take a major step toward delivering on those \npromises. The legislation we are now debating would send the broadest \npossible ObamaCare repeal to the President's desk.\n  As the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, I am pleased to have \njoined with my colleagues--the distinguished chairman of the Budget and \nHELP Committees, as well as the Senate Republican leadership--to lead \nthis latest fight against ObamaCare. This bill would repeal many of the \nworst parts of ObamaCare. Among other things, it would repeal the \nindividual mandate, the employer mandate, the medical device tax, and \nthe Cadillac tax. All of these different parts of ObamaCare have \ncontributed in one way or another to the long, slow death march we have \nwitnessed over the past 5 years. All of them would be dealt with under \nthis legislation.\n  The legislation would address another contentious debate: the one \ndealing with Planned Parenthood. The debate over Planned Parenthood has \nperplexed Congress and divided our country for years as many people \nhave expressed ever more opposition to providing such a controversial \norganization--and I am being generous with that label--with taxpayer \nfunds. As we all know, this debate reached a boiling point earlier this \nyear.\n  The reconciliation package before us would prohibit Federal payments \nto Planned Parenthood and direct more funds to the Federal community \nhealth center program, putting an end to the Federal Government's \nentanglements with Planned Parenthood while alleviating legitimate \nconcerns about funding for women's health. This is yet another reason \nto support this legislation.\n  As I said, the debate we are having this week is an important \nmilestone in the history of ObamaCare, maybe even the most important \nmilestone yet. But we need to be realistic. While this bill is an \nimportant step, it stands no real chance of becoming law. For that to \nhappen, we are going to have to see even more changes. But that doesn't \nmean our efforts here are for nothing. This bill may not result in new \nlaw, but it will give the American people a fresh accounting of where \neach of us stands when it comes to ObamaCare.\n  It is funny, Republicans have taken some flack--not a lot but some--\nfor referring to the Affordable Care Act as ``ObamaCare'' or ``the \nPresident's health care law.'' The President, for his part, hasn't \nshied away from these labels, but I have read a few pundits who think \nthese terms are specifically intended to undermine the legitimacy of a \nstatute duly passed by Congress. In some respects, I suppose that might \nbe true. After all, even though we constantly refer to the law as \n``ObamaCare,'' it is not as though President Obama passed it himself. \nHe was aided and abetted by his allies in Congress.\n  While it may be useful shorthand to attach the President's name to \nit, I don't think the American people have forgotten the others who \nhelped bring this terrible law to pass. President Obama will forever \nown the Affordable Care Act, that is for sure. People will likely \nalways refer to it as ``ObamaCare.'' But those in Congress who drafted \nand voted for the law will own it too.\n  When President Obama vetoes this legislation, as we all expect he \nwill, he will take ownership of the Affordable Care Act--not that he \nhasn't in the past--along with its many failures and gross inadequacies \nall over again. I think the same can be said for any of our colleagues \nwho vote against repealing the worst elements of the law this week.\n  I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will think about \nthat as this debate moves forward and that they will consider voting \nwith us to send this repeal to the President's desk. I think it would \nbe a very wise move on their part.\n  This isn't going away even if the President does veto this bill. I \nhope he doesn't, but if he intends to do it, it would be a breath of \nfresh air for our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to help us \nto have a veto-proof majority to tell the President once and for all \nthat this bill is not what we want in America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today to talk \nabout the broken promises of ObamaCare and the negative impacts this \npoorly written law have had on my State of Colorado. While there have \nbeen many broken promises of ObamaCare, there have been three major \nbroken promises that are the center of focus for hundreds of thousands \nof Coloradans.\n  I want to start with broken promise No. 1. If you like your plan, you \ncan keep it. The President said over 35 times that Americans shouldn't \nworry about ObamaCare because if you like your plan, then you can keep \nit. And it wasn't just the President; time after time, supporters of \nObamaCare came to the floor of the House or the Senate or before \ntownhalls in their States or districts and repeated those words: If you \nlike your plan, you can keep it. In fact, these words were used to \njustify the reason they supported ObamaCare in the first place.\n  Coloradans quickly learned this promise was far from the truth. In \nlate 2013, roughly 335,000 insurance policies in Colorado were canceled \nbecause of ObamaCare. These cancellations also affected my family \nhealth care plan. Unfortunately, the cancellations in 2013 were the \nvery beginning. In January of 2014, the Colorado Division of Insurance \ncanceled an additional 249,000 plans because those plans didn't meet \nthe requirements of ObamaCare.\n  The President said: If you like your plan, you can keep it. \nSupporters in Congress said: If you like your plan, you can keep it. \nBut what he meant was, as long as the government approves of your plan, \nyou can keep it.\n  In 2015, an additional 190,000 plans were canceled. In total, \naccording to the Congressional Research Service, over 750,000 health \ninsurance perhaps plans in Colorado were canceled between 2013 and \n2015.\n  The fact-checking organization PolitiFact said this promise was \n``impossible to keep'' and went on to deem President Obama's promise \nthat if you like your health care plan, you can keep it the ``Lie of \nthe Year'' for 2013.\n  Supporters of ObamaCare will tell you that it is OK that this \nhappened because these 750,000 individuals must have had inferior \nhealth insurance and that the government knows best. You see, that is \nthe exact problem with government. That is the arrogance of government \nand the arrogance of ObamaCare--that people in the government, \nbureaucrats and others, believe they know better than the American \nconsumers what is best for them. They believe it is OK to cancel \n750,000 policies because they must have been bad, so go ahead and \ncancel them. They will also say that it is all right because there are \nadditional plans they can choose from. But that wasn't the promise of \nObamaCare.\n  Broken promise No. 1: If you like your health care plan, you can keep \nit.\n  Broken promise No. 2: ObamaCare will reduce the costs for families, \nbusinesses, and our government.\n  Remember, when ObamaCare was passed, they said the family would save \n$2,500 a year relatively soon after its passage. Unfortunately, \nColoradans have felt that broken promise as well. It is a broken \npromise that hit their pocketbooks and has broken the bank as well. For \nexample, take the Western Slope of Colorado. I have a chart here. \nAccording to the Colorado Division of Insurance, individual insurance \npremiums for 2016 on the Western Slope of\n\n[[Page S8283]]\n\nColorado will rise by an additional average of 25.8 percent.\n  There are people across America who are familiar with Colorado's \nWestern Slope. These are the incredible mountain vistas, our forests, \nour national parks, our ski resorts.\n  They received a 25.8-percent increase in their health care costs this \nyear. That is far from the promise of lowering the health care costs \nthat ObamaCare was passed with. No one can afford these high prices. In \nfact, in 2013 one of my Democratic colleagues in the Colorado \ndelegation even tried to exempt one of the wealthiest counties in \nColorado from ObamaCare, citing that health insurance premiums would be \ntoo expensive. Let me say that again. A Member of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, a Democrat, tried to exempt portions of his district \nfrom ObamaCare because it was making his constituents pay too much for \ntheir insurance. Here is a quote:\n\n       We will be encouraging a waiver. It will be difficult for \n     Summit County residents to become insured. For the vast \n     majority, it's too high a price to pay.\n  It doesn't matter whether you live in the Eastern Plains, Fort \nCollins, or the Western Slope, ObamaCare has simply made it more \ncostly. Plans are getting more expensive, and promises are being \nbroken.\n  Broken promise No. 3: President Obama promised greater competition in \nthe marketplace through consumer-run co-ops. Yet over 80,000 Coloradans \nare feeling the impacts of this broken promise. To date, 12 out of 23 \nco-ops created by ObamaCare have been shut down across the United \nStates, including the co-op in Colorado, which failed in October of \nthis year.\n  Nationwide, the failed co-ops were loaned over $1 billion, which came \nfrom the hard-working taxpayers of this country. That taxpayer money \nwas supposed to help get these co-ops off the ground, but now with \nthese failures, that taxpayer money is at risk of never being paid back \nto the people of this country, and the health care of nearly 700,000 \nindividuals across the United States is in jeopardy.\n  ObamaCare allowed policies to be offered that were never actuarially \nsound because they assumed there would be a bailout by the government \nto help make them actuarially sound. By banking on a bailout, they sold \nthe American people a bill of goods.\n  Today we have a path forward that is turning away from the failed \nhealth care law that has been built on broken promises. The first step \nof this path forward is to repeal ObamaCare, and I urge my colleagues \nto support the repeal of ObamaCare that we will be voting on this week. \nRepealing ObamaCare will clear the way for a replacement plan and will \nput our country's health care on the right track.\n  First, we have to restore the ability of individuals to choose what \nis best for themselves instead of having Big Government choose for \nthem. Coloradans don't want Dr. Congress. They want to keep the doctor \nthey were promised they could keep in the first place. The best way to \ndo this is to ensure that people get to keep the health plans that they \nwant, and that is why I am working with Senator Ron Johnson from \nWisconsin on his amendment that simply says that if you like your \nhealth care plan, you can keep it.\n  I heard from countless individuals in Colorado who lost the plans \nthey liked and wanted to keep. They were certainly promised they could \nkeep them, and just because ObamaCare can't fulfill the promise that it \nwas sold under doesn't mean we shouldn't do our jobs to make that \npromise a reality. The amendment Senator Johnson and I have offered \nwould allow individuals to continue receiving health coverage on plans \nthat would otherwise be canceled because of ObamaCare.\n  Second, we must ensure that taxpayer dollars are used responsibly. I \nfiled an amendment that will help recover taxpayer money that was \nloaned to the failed co-ops. More than $1 billion in Federal loans were \nawarded to these failed co-ops. Congress has a duty to spend taxpayer \ndollars responsibly, and this amendment will ensure just that.\n  Lastly, we must make sure individuals have certainty in the health \ncoverage they choose. My final amendment will make certain that co-ops \ncan't rely on bailouts when they are calculating insurance premiums, \nsetting false expectations for consumers. Several co-ops counted on \nthese bailout provisions to keep premiums artificially low. Because \nthese premiums were artificially low and since many co-ops were \nplanning on receiving the bailout, many could no longer cover their \nexpenses. Allowing co-ops to rely on a bailout was irresponsible and \nhas resulted in nearly 700,000 individuals nationwide whose health \ncoverage is now uncertain.\n  It is time to act. It is time to take the path forward. It is time to \nrepeal ObamaCare, which is simply one big broken promise after another. \nThis path to repeal ObamaCare will allow us to replace ObamaCare and \nwill have fewer health care regulations for businesses and individuals. \nIt will put us on a path forward for individual freedoms and a more \nprosperous America.\n  I yield back my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n             Omnibus Appropriations Bill and Policy Riders\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, we are about to consider a big \nappropriations bill all wrapped up into one called an Omnibus \nappropriations bill. I think it will be a good bill. But here we go \nagain, trying to attach all kinds of goodies to it.\n  Now, with just a few days left of funding before the U.S. Government \nspending authority and appropriations expire--to the best of my \nrecollection that is about 9\\1/2\\ days away--we have to get something \ndone. But what is happening is that the special interests are coming \nout of the woodwork, and they are hard at work to sneak sweetheart \ndeals into what is a must-pass piece of legislation--the funding to \nkeep the Government of the United States functioning. So these special \ninterests that are suddenly popping up and sneaking around the corner \ndon't have to get the votes to get it passed through their regular \norder for whatever their particular interest is. They want it so their \ninterests are riders on the appropriations bill, and everybody has to \nvote for it with their special interests because if we don't, the \ngovernment shuts down, which is obviously an unacceptable alternative.\n  These handouts to special interests are known as appropriations \nriders. Most ordinary Americans don't know that this stuff is going on.\n  Well, based on the appropriations bill that we saw earlier this year, \nwe know that many of these riders could work their way in. For example, \nsome people, particularly in the banking community, don't like some of \nthe restrictions. In September of 2008, when we nearly had a financial \nmeltdown as a result of Lehman Brothers going down, there was a big \nfinancial death spiral going on. A lot of excesses happened during that \ntime in the bailout so that Wall Street would not go under, and there \nwas legislation to correct some of those excesses. It is known by the \nname of the two authors, Senator Dodd and Congressman Frank. There are \ngoing to be people trying to put in a rollback of some of those \nprovisions, but I hope some of our colleagues will remember what those \nwere put in for, so that we don't have the likelihood of having another \nfinancial death spiral like that which almost occurred.\n  I hope we remember the picture in our minds of the Republican \nSecretary of the Treasury at the end of the George Bush administration, \nbegging the leadership of Congress to pass the troubled assets relief \nbill to keep the financial integrity of the U.S. Government. There were \na lot of excesses, including excessive executive salaries that came \nfrom that.\n  We know all about what happened to that supersized insurance company \ncalled AIG. I don't think Americans would want these kinds of things \nput on a necessary funding bill for the United States Government.\n  I will give another example. Another policy rider is to prohibit the \nUnited States from working with other countries to address climate \nchange. This Senator has been in the middle of it because Miami Beach \nis ground zero on\n\n[[Page S8284]]\n\nclimate change. The measurements over the last 40 years are an \nadditional 5 to 8 inches that the sea level has risen at the seasonal \nhigh tide. The streets of Miami Beach are flooded. It is a real \nproblem.\n  There are some, such as Senator Inhofe, who don't believe it. So we \ncan have that debate. I am respectful of Senator Inhofe and of his \nposition, although I think we can easily refute it with scientific \nevidence, but we ought to have that debate. Don't sneak it in on a \nrider on a must-pass, gargantuan appropriations bill in order to keep \nthe government functioning.\n  There are other riders that are being discussed that are bad for the \nsafety of families and making our highways more dangerous. For example, \nwe picked up that some of the appropriators have suggested to continue \nthe delay of the important implementation of safety laws, such as how \nlong does it take for a trucker to become tired if they have to work \nlonger and longer hours, and is that a safety concern. As the ranking \nmember of the Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction, we work on \nthese issues. We debate them. Don't go trying to sneak something in \nunder the rug in an appropriations bill regarding safety for surface \ntransportation. We just hammered that out in a conference committee on \nthe highway bill. The highway bill is a lot more than just highways and \nbridges; it is surface transportation. It includes safety measures as \nwell for all modes of surface transportation.\n  Let me give an example of another rider that is out there lurking. \nThere are some who want to take all of the additional fees--when \nsomeone buys a ticket to fly on an airline, a person ought to have the \nopportunity of knowing what all those fees are, and on a person's \nairline ticket that one buys from the airline, one usually does. But \nthere are others who want to sell those airline tickets--not the \nairlines--and not disclose all of those fees. Yet the consumers are the \nones who are paying for it. They are trying to sneak in under the rug \nanother provision that would become law on an unrelated appropriations \nbill.\n  So I just wanted to add my voice to the others who are speaking this \nafternoon. Let's put the American people first, and let's use what we \nhear about all the time: Regular order. Let the committee system work \nto hammer out what ought to be in the bills instead of, at the eleventh \nhour of the 59th minute as we have to fund the government, trying to \nsneak something in, in the dead of night, in order to scratch the itch \nof someone's special interest.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lead a \ncolloquy with Senators Burr, Isakson, Cassidy, and Scott for up to 20 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, today we are talking about repealing \nObamacare and moving in a completely different direction toward more \nchoices and lower costs for Americans as they search for their health \ncare plans.\n  I came to the floor yesterday and brought back a memory from 5\\1/2\\ \nyears ago of the President's health care summit, nationally televised \nall day long at the Blair House, with 36 Members of Congress and the \nPresident of the United States. I had a chance, leading off for the \nRepublican speakers that day, to say respectfully to President Obama: \nMr. President, this health care plan of yours is going to impose a huge \nMedicaid unfunded mandate on State budgets, which will raise tuitions \nand take money from other State programs. It will take money out of \nMedicare and spend it on something else. It will increase taxes, it \nwill raise premiums, and it will cost jobs. Unfortunately, that all \nturned out to be true.\n  The Senator from Georgia, Mr. Isakson, was there, as I was, on that \nChristmas Eve. It was a cold night when the Democrats had, for a few \nmonths, 60 votes, and they rammed through Obamacare in the middle of \nthe night with all Democratic votes, no Republican votes, with us \nwarning what would happen.\n  Now, I say to Senator Isakson, the premiums in Georgia, I believe \nwill go up 29 percent for some plans.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. That is correct.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. And I wonder if the Senator has been hearing from some \nof his constituents about their premium increases.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, let me confirm what the Senator from \nTennessee just said about that cold night on Christmas Eve 6 years ago \nwhen the administration was promising lower premiums, better benefits, \nand that ObamaCare was going to be the solution for the problems of \nAmerican families.\n  As the Senator from Tennessee said, I have gotten letters, as has he. \nEvery Member has gotten letters from people who are having higher \npremiums, bigger deductibles, and fewer benefits. Let me give an \nexample. A family in Roswell, GA, wrote me, a family of five. They had \njust been notified that their premium was going from $849 a month to \n$1,075 a month, a $300 increase, with a deductible of $11,900, an \nincrease of $6,900 in their deductible. The mother, who had a family \nhistory of breast cancer, was denied mammograms because of her age, and \na young daughter who had a precancerous mole removed was refused \nreimbursement.\n  So here is an increase in premiums, a reduction in benefits, and an \nincrease in their deductible. It doesn't make any sense, but it is all \nbecause of the mandates of the ObamaCare law.\n  Secondly, a young couple in Smyrna, GA, wanted to plan for their \nretirement and start saving early in their early years of productivity. \nThey recently received a notice from their insurance company that their \npremium was going from $607 a month to $1,379 a month--over a 100-\npercent increase. Where is that money coming from? They are having to \nreduce their savings for retirement just to pay the ObamaCare premium \nand get less of a benefit because their deductible is going from $2,000 \nto $4,000.\n  The promise of lower cost health care and better benefits was exactly \nwrong and what the American people were promised was wrong. I am proud \nthat Mr. Enzi, the Senator from Tennessee, and others who have led this \nreconciliation vote to repeal ObamaCare have done so. It is time the \nAmerican people got the truth--better coverage, lower costs, but do it \nthe old-fashioned way with a private competitive system.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Georgia for his leadership on \nthe HELP Committee on which all of us serve.\n  One of the newer members of the HELP Committee brings a lot of \nexpertise: Senator Cassidy from Louisiana. He wasn't there, at least \nnot in the Senate, on the night Obamacare passed, but he has written \nforcefully about the fact that while premiums have been going up, \nsomething else was going down, and that is family incomes because of \nthe 30-hour work week. Senator Cassidy had an article in Forbes \nmagazine in 2014 that pointed out the impact of the 30-hour work week \nin Obamacare and how that was hurting working families.\n  Mr. CASSIDY. I say to Senator Alexander, one of the ironies of this \nis that it was promoted as a way to help lower income families make \nends meet better. But if you require employers to provide insurance to \nlow-wage workers, the predictable response of an employer who has thin \nmargins is to actually convert those full-time workers to part-time \nworkers. This doesn't happen for the CEO or for the CEO's lieutenants, \nand it doesn't happen for middle management. The folks it happens most \nto are those lower paid workers.\n  I once went grocery shopping in Baton Rouge, and a woman rung me up. \nThe next day my wife sent me to another store to get something else at \nanother store. The same woman was ringing me up. I said: I just saw you \nat that store, but now I see you at this store. She said--I am \nparaphrasing--my first employer reduced my hours, so now I have had to \ntake a second job to make ends meet.\n  Now, that is the personal story. But what the labor statistics show \nis that since the recession has technically ended, the hours worked per \nweek have recovered for higher income workers, but as for the lower \nincome workers, they have continued to suffer. The most vulnerable have \nbeen the most affected in terms of hours worked, but it is not just the \nmost vulnerable, it is also the middle class.\n  The New York Times wrote an article 2 weeks ago. The headline says it \nall:\n\n[[Page S8285]]\n\n``Many Say High Deductibles Make Their Health Law Insurance All But \nUseless.'' They quote a gentleman, David Reines from New Jersey. He is \n60 years old. He said:\n\n       The deductible, $3,000 a year, makes it impossible to \n     actually go to the doctor. . . . We have insurance, but can't \n     afford to use it.\n\n  So it is the middle-income worker who also has a policy which \npreviously would have allowed him or her to go to the doctor. Now they \ncan't because the way ObamaCare is so structured is that it is too \nexpensive for that out-of-pocket first exposure.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. What the Senator is saying, if I hear him right, is \nthat in the worst of circumstances, the effect of Obamacare on some of \nthe people he is talking with means they are working less hours, so \nthey have less money. Their insurance premium is higher, and so is \ntheir deductible. That is the effect.\n  Mr. CASSIDY. When it comes to insurance premiums, you can't make this \nup.\n  This is a fellow from Homewood, LA. His first name is Mark; we \nscratched out his last name. This is his letter from Blue Cross and \nBlue Shield of Louisiana informing him that his policy, which had \npreviously been $207 per month, was going up in 2016 to $961 per month. \nHis policy, which had been roughly $2,400 a year, is going up to \n$11,500 a year. And this is because of the Affordable Care Act--the \nUnaffordable Care Act.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The essential problem with Obamacare for people who \nbuy individual insurance, it seems to me, I say to Senator Isakson, is \nthat Washington tells you what insurance to buy.\n  I think of a woman named Emilie in Middle Tennessee who has lupus and \nwho had a policy she could afford. It had modest benefits and it didn't \ncost very much, but it fit her needs, but Obamacare canceled that \npolicy. When she went online to find another policy under Obamacare, \nher costs went up from $100 to $400 a month. I guess the Senator has \nheard stories like that as well in Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. All the time, because what happened with ObamaCare is \nthe following: People who had insurance they could afford and who had \nbought coverage they needed were forced to buy coverage they didn't \nneed because of the mandates in ObamaCare in terms of what had to be \nincluded. So it forced more coverage that you didn't need, which raised \nthe premiums you paid. So you end up paying more and getting less, and \nit was the mandates of ObamaCare that did it.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Senator Cassidy, of course, has a unique perspective \non this as a practicing physician. I think he still practices some--as \nmuch as he can within the Senate rules--but he sees patients regularly. \nI ask Senator Cassidy, what was the effect of this new health care law \n5\\1/2\\ years ago on the ability of patients to choose their own \nphysicians?\n  Mr. CASSIDY. The way the market has responded, in order to make \ninsurance affordable despite the mandates, is there are so-called \nnarrow networks. So someone signs up for the most affordable policy \nthey can get. It turns out that the doctor they previously saw is not \non this plan. So the narrow network is going to be just a small set of \ndoctors. The specialists may be in another town; one hospital, not all \nhospitals. And patients are unfamiliar with this. They did not expect \nit. But that was their only affordable option. The mandates have driven \nup the costs so much.\n  By the way, going back to the letter you got about the mandated \nbenefits, in my recent campaign, I had a woman walk up to me, and she \nsaid: My name is Tina, and I am angry. I had a hysterectomy. I am 56 \nyears old and I have no children. My husband and I are paying $500 more \nper month for insurance, which we cannot afford, and I am paying for \npediatric dentistry, and I am paying for obstetrical services.\n  She had had a hysterectomy, was 56 years old, and had no children.\n  Another woman--she was 58 and her husband was 57--told me: The only \nreason I would need obstetrical services, which I am forced to buy, is \nif my name is Sarah and my husband is Abraham, but that is not the \ncase.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Senator Isakson, before he came to the Senate, was a \nsmall businessman in Georgia.\n  Probably the largest employer in our country is the hospitality \nindustry--restaurants, hotels, that sort of thing, employing many young \npeople, many minority people. I met with a number of restaurant owners, \nwho told me after Obamacare passed that because of the costs of that \ninsurance to the company, their goal would be to reduce the number of \nemployees from 90 to 70. So Obamacare costs jobs. Did the Senator have \nthat kind of experience in Georgia as well?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Not only did it cost jobs, but it forced many people who \nhad full-time jobs into part-time jobs because of the mandates. Small \nbusiness got hurt and their employees got hurt.\n  The mandates of ObamaCare for coverage, the mandates for taxation, \nand the mandates for deductibles all contributed to the increasing \ncosts of ObamaCare and made health care more out of reach than more \naccessible.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Memphis is proud of the fact that it is a center for \nmedical device innovation. Some of the leading medical device companies \nin the world are located in Memphis, TN. The Obamacare bill--part of \nits trillion dollars in new taxes included a medical device tax which \nput an especially onerous tax on the gross income of medical devices \ncompanies, causing the President in Costa Rica to put up signs saying \n``Welcome to Costa Rica'' to medical device companies.\n  I wonder if in Louisiana or Georgia you had any experience with the \nimpact of the medical device tax on your constituents?\n  Mr. CASSIDY. There is a fellow who started a medical device startup \nin New Orleans, and he was saying that he had an offer to move his \nbusiness to Panama because a major portion of his market is overseas.\n  So the medical device tax is, of course, a tax upon the gross of a \nbusiness. If he moves overseas to Panama, taking those jobs with him, \nand continues to sell internationally and not pay tax on that but is \ntaxed only on that which he brings back to the United States, then he \nis obviously reducing his tax burden. Those are high-paying, white-\ncollar jobs in New Orleans, a city recovering from Katrina. If the \npower to tax is the power to destroy, this tax has the power to destroy \nthe ability of this gentleman to continue to expand in New Orleans.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I say to Senator Isakson, I recall one of the most \nvigorous debates we had 5\\1/2\\ years ago was first the President \nsaying: We won't touch Medicare. Next thing you know, they took $700 \nbillion out of Medicare to spend on new programs, at a time when the \nMedicare trustees, whose job it is to tell us things like this, said: \nThe program is going to go broke unless we do something about it. We \nwere saying: If you are going to take money away from grandma's \nMedicare, you better spend it on grandma. But they didn't. It impacted \nMedicare recipients in Georgia, Tennessee, and Louisiana.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Well, the President basically robbed Peter to pay Paul. \nHe robbed the beneficiaries of Medicare benefits and then took the \nmoney and spent it on somebody else. So the person who had the benefits \ndidn't have the benefits any longer.\n  The problem with this entire deal is it was a charade. Promises were \nmade that if you like your policy, you can keep it. That turned out to \nbe wrong. Premiums were going to go down. That turned out to be wrong. \nIf you couldn't get insurance, you would be able to get insurance. \nWell, that ended up being true in part, but it became something known \nas a bronze policy. Do you know what a bronze policy is? It was a \npolicy that gave you coverage, but the deductible was so big, you \ncouldn't get to the coverage. So every time there was a promise, it was \na broken promise, an increased cost, and less accessibility to \ncoverage.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, how much time remains in our colloquy?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 6 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Six minutes remaining.\n  We have heard a lot in the news about co-ops. Co-ops were an \ninvention of Obamacare that were designed to provide health care to \nmany Americans. I know that in South Carolina, for example--closure of \nthese co-ops for 67,000 South Carolinians and 27,000 Tennesseans--means \nthat suddenly they\n\n[[Page S8286]]\n\nhave to find new coverage. I wonder if either in Louisiana or Georgia, \nyou have had any experience with the new co-ops in Obamacare?\n  Mr. CASSIDY. Louisiana's co-op failed. It attempted to lower costs \nwith a skinny network, but ultimately it still could not compete.\n  If I may point out, we have talked about how the low-wage worker has \nhad her opportunity diminished by the law. We discussed how the middle-\nclass family, who oftentimes had insurance they were told they could \nkeep, lost it, and now they have a deductible of $3,000, which they say \nmakes the insurance something they cannot afford. We are speaking about \nthe U.S. taxpayer. The U.S. taxpayer has put billions of dollars toward \nthese co-ops. There is some evidence that the administration continued \nto put money into them even when they knew they were going to fail, and \nyet now they are failing--over half and supposedly more slated to do \nso. It isn't just the low-wage worker and the middle-class family; it \nis all the taxpayers who have taken a hit for promises made but \npromises broken.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. During the debate 5\\1/2\\ years ago at the health care \nsummit at the Blair House, our Democratic friends said: Well, when are \nyou Republicans going to come up with a big, comprehensive plan? My \nanswer to them was: If you are waiting for Senator McConnell to roll a \nwheelbarrow onto the Senate floor with a 2,700 page McConnell-care \nbill, you are going to be waiting until the sky turns purple because we \ndon't believe in that. We don't think we are wise enough in Washington, \nDC, to write a comprehensive plan for everything about the American \nhealth care for all the people in this country.\n  Instead, what we proposed to do--and we proposed it over and over \nagain--was to move step by step in a different direction toward more \nchoices, more freedom, and lower costs. In fact, I counted it up, and \n173 times in the Congressional Record in the year 2009, we Republicans \nlaid out our plans step by step toward those causes, steps like the \nstep Senator Scott from South Carolina took in a bipartisan way just \nthis year to give States the ability to set the rates for the kind of \ninsurance small businesses could buy and avoid an 18-percent increase \nin premiums. Those are the kinds of steps we would take in a different \ndirection to give the American people those options.\n  Our time for the colloquy has expired. I thank the Senator from \nGeorgia, Mr. Isakson, and the Senator from Louisiana, Mr. Cassidy. We \nRepublicans said 5\\1/2\\ years ago that premiums would go up, taxes \nwould go up, jobs would be lost, and that State budgets would be \nburdened by Medicaid, and all that turned out to be true, \nunfortunately.\n  The President said: If you like your plan, you can keep it. That \nturned out to be untrue, unfortunately.\n  We are prepared to go in a different direction--more choices, more \nfreedom, lower costs--but first, this week we are going to repeal \nObamacare, which has caused such problems for the American people, and \nthen we will head in a different direction.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold that request?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I will withdraw the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I ask unanimous consent to conduct a colloquy with my colleagues from \nMassachusetts and Florida for roughly the next 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Appropriations Bills and Policy Riders\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, 7 years ago Wall Street imploded, sending \nus into a recession that we hadn't seen since the Great Depression. \nWhile our economy has slowly bounced back, the memory of that crisis is \nstill fresh in the minds of many Americans, millions of whom lost their \njobs, millions of whom lost their homes, and millions of whom lost \ntheir retirement savings.\n  Nobody wants to repeat the financial collapse, the bailouts, the \nrecession. Indeed, we have spent the last 6 years digging out of a \nhole. Despite this, Republican colleagues at this very moment are \nholding meetings and preparing policy riders to gut the reforms that \nshut down the Wall Street casino. They are working to open up that \ncasino again, to the great detriment of families across this country. \nTheir goal is to add poison pill policy riders to the fiscal year 2016 \nappropriation bills that may well be consolidated into an omnibus.\n  That is why I am here on the floor with my colleagues from Rhode \nIsland and Massachusetts. Our colleague, Senator Bill Nelson from \nFlorida, spoke earlier about these issues. We are here to say no to \nthese policy riders that are seeking to reopen the Wall Street casino \nand put American families at peril.\n  To start things off, I turn to my colleague from Rhode Island, who \nhas brought great expertise and diligence to this conversation over the \nresponsible regulations, the ones that serve like the traffic signals \nthat enable traffic to move slowly so they don't end up in auto wrecks, \nbut they don't shut it down--the responsible regulations that will keep \nus from having another crash doing great damage to American families.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oregon for his \nleadership on this issue, and I thank my colleagues who are going to \njoin us later.\n  I am joining them in urging all of our colleagues in the Senate not \nto roll back the protections that are in place due to the Dodd-Frank \nWall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.\n  Let me remind everyone where we have come from. When we passed the \nWall Street reform act, the Dodd-Frank act, we were in the most painful \nfinancial crisis since the Great Depression. The Dow Jones dropped from \nroughly 13,700 points in July of 2007 to 7,235 points by March of 2009, \nabout a 47 percent drop in wealth as indicated by the stock market. It \nwas a huge, huge hit. The line at that time was: What is happening to \nyour 401(k) plan?\n  Well, we have come back, and one of the reasons we have come back is \nbecause Dodd-Frank has now provided safer rules of the road for \nfinancial institutions.\n  Back then and going forward, we lost 8.6 million jobs from January of \n2008 until January of 2010. There were 8 million jobs lost primarily \nbecause Wall Street lost its way, frankly. The unemployment rate \ndoubled from 5 percent in January of 2008 to 10 percent in October of \n2009. In that period of time, roughly from July 2007 to November of \n2014, nearly 7.5 million families lost their homes.\n  These are sobering numbers. Behind each of these numbers is an \nindividual or family--our constituents, who suffered real and serious \ndamages. Again, this was traceable almost directly back to excesses on \nWall Street, which we consciously tried to correct in the Dodd-Frank \nact, and it has provided a solid foundation for economic recovery. Slow \nas it has been, we are coming back.\n  What happened was that these families lost their retirements--wiped \nout. It was not only the financial loss but the sheer psychological \ntrauma of being either retired or on the edge of retirement and \nsuddenly it was all gone. It has left a lasting impression.\n  People have lost jobs, as I have indicated. It was a huge loss of \njobs. Some have never gotten back into the market or gotten a job at \nthe level they had before.\n  Then, of course, there were the foreclosures, thousands and thousands \nof Americans losing their homes. Without their homes, some of our \nconstituents lost their whole sense of belonging to the community and \ntheir ability to find a new job because they were just battling a day \nat a time for shelter and for subsistence. These were real issues, and \nwe seem to have forgotten all of that. We seem to have forgotten that \nWall Street--without sound regulations, strong regulation--will find \nits way off the path and into this type of difficulty.\n  We all know people who suffered these losses, and we all are \ncommitted that they won't suffer them again. But that commitment \nrequires us to follow through on the Dodd-Frank act, the Wall Street \nreform act.\n  In that legislation, I worked very closely with Senator Warren to \ncreate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It is just one of the \nexamples of\n\n[[Page S8287]]\n\nthe efforts in that bill that actually protected our constituents, not \ntheoretically but practically. They have been protected from tricky \npeople who were giving them mortgages they couldn't afford, engaging in \nillegal servicing and foreclosure practices in the mortgage industry, \nsteering consumers into excessive loans they couldn't afford--and the \nperson doing the steering knew they couldn't afford them--but those \ntricky people took the money and literally ran, and we have tried to \nstop them.\n  Because of the efforts of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, \n$11.2 billion in relief has been given to families throughout this \ncountry; $11 billion has been given to individuals and families all \nacross this country. This is an example not of theoretical legalistic \nprocedures but of practical help for people. That is the direct result \nof Dodd-Frank, and some of the proposals that we are hearing about \nwould undo that.\n  In the process of creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, \nI am particularly proud of working with colleagues to create the Office \nof Servicemember Affairs within the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau to serve as a watchdog for our military personnel. Under the \nleadership of Holly Petraeus, it has done a remarkable job. More than \n$90 million has been returned to servicemembers and their families from \nunscrupulous companies that preyed upon our military families \ndeliberately--understanding the vulnerability of families that are in \ntransit because of deployments and other things. Another example, the \nMilitary Lending Act, which has capped annual interest rates for \nmilitary personnel, has been enforced through the efforts of the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n  This has not only helped these families, but it has helped this \nNation. It has helped our military readiness. I can tell you that \nbasically a long time ago, I had the privilege of commanding soldiers, \nparatroopers in the 82nd, and it is hard to be a good soldier when you \nworry about whether your family is going to be able to make it through \nthe week or the month to get your next paycheck. This is real help, and \nit is the result of Dodd-Frank. No, many things are the result of Dodd-\nFrank.\n  So why do we want to roll back these reforms? You ask people, and \nthey will say: Well, it is burdensome, and they are hurting these \nfinancial institutions; you know, it is just so hard to operate a \nfinancial institution today.\n  Then you take a look at the stock performance of these institutions, \nthe American global systemically important banks and even our regional \nbanks. These institutions have seen their stock prices increase from \nJuly 2010 at least by 31 percent and in some cases as high as 114 \npercent. That is the market saying to these institutions and to all of \nus that they are in good shape. They are in great shape. They are not \nbeing burdened by financial regulations. They are not being \noverwhelmed. They are profit centers. They are doing great. Name other \ncompanies that have increased their value so much. One reason is \nbecause everyone is confident there is a stable, sound, rigorous \nregulatory structure that is ensuring that banks will not go off the \ncliff as they did in 2007 and 2008 when their stock prices collapsed.\n  So if you look at that, if you look at the markets, they are not \ncomplaining about Dodd-Frank. The markets are looking to say: That is \nwhere the money should go. That is what you should invest in.\n  So if you look at that growth and then draw a contrast between what \nhas happened to average American families--they haven't seen that kind \nof wage growth. I don't know many working families who have seen a 31 \npercent increase in their income or a 114 percent increase in their \nincome, but we have to do better with respect to our working families.\n  One thing we have to do is make sure that we keep in place \nprotections that were built into the Dodd-Frank act.\n  There are always ways you can improve legislation, and there are a \nmyriad of technical corrections that could be done, but to disguise \nsome of these proposals as technical corrections is not appropriate.\n  I think also, frankly, if we are going to be sensible, sound, and \nthoughtful about technical corrections, let's go ahead and do it the \nway it should be done, the way Dodd-Frank was done. I was on the \nbanking committee. We had hearings. We had a markup. We had, in fact, \nseveral markups until we got it right. Then we brought it to the floor, \nwe had a vigorous debate, and we amended the bill. Then we took that \nbill to conference, then we had it changed in conference, and then we \nsent it to the President for his signature.\n  So if we are going to do corrections to improve the Dodd-Frank bill, \nlet's do it the way we did it originally, not finding a convenient \nvehicle--a highway bill, an appropriations bill, any other bill--and \nsticking them in as sort of ``take it or leave it''--you have to do \nthis or you lose highway funding or you lose funding for our schools, \nfor education, for national defense.\n  I would hope that we can move forward in regular order and make \ncorrections where necessary, but certainly let's not use these waning \ndays of this session to undermine the Dodd-Frank Act with some of the \nproposals I have heard.\n  With that, I yield back to my colleague, the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I thank my colleague from Rhode Island for his comments \nand insights.\n  Now we are going to turn to the Senator from Massachusetts. We will \nbe delighted to hear her thoughts on this challenge of taking serious \nissues related to the Wall Street casino, a system that brought down \nthe prospects for so many American families, and how there is the \nconsideration of restoring the Wall Street casino in the dark of night \nby policy riders being attached to other bills.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Merkley, \nSenator Nelson, and Senator Reed on the floor today. I thank Senator \nMerkley for pulling us together.\n  We are here to say no--no to the industry lobbyists, no to their \nfriends in Congress who are threatening a government shutdown if we \nwon't roll back rules that protect consumers and protect the safety of \nour financial system.\n  It is a pretty neat trick. The lobbyists probably know they can't get \na rollback of financial regulations passed out in the open where the \nAmerican people can actually see what is happening and see which \nSenators and which Representatives voted to gut the rules that protect \nworking families. So instead they tack rollbacks onto must-pass \nlegislation, such as the upcoming government funding bill, to give \ntheir friends in Congress a lot of cover for voting yes.\n  It is cynical. It is cynical and it is corrupt, but it usually works. \nJust last year, Citigroup lobbyists wrote a provision to blast a hole \nin Dodd-Frank. The part of the law that was blown up was called--and I \nam quoting the title--``Prohibition Against Federal Government Bailouts \nof Swaps Entities.'' The idea behind the rule was pretty simple. If a \nbig bank wanted to engage in certain kinds of risky deals, such as the \ncredit default swaps that had been at the heart of the 2008 crisis, \nthey had to bear all of that risk themselves instead of passing it \nalong to taxpayers.\n  Now the big banks wanted that rule repealed, and the only way to do \nit was to put it on a bill that had to pass or the government would \nshut down, and that is exactly what they did.\n  For 1 year, Congressman Elijah Cummings and I worked to document the \nimpact of that Citigroup amendment, and we finally got what we needed. \nThe FDIC estimates that the provision written by Citigroup lobbyists \nlast year that allows a few big banks to put taxpayers on the hook for \nrisky swaps has an estimated value of almost $10 trillion. And who is \ngobbling up that $10 trillion of risk? It is three huge banks: \nCitigroup, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America. It is three banks, \nnearly $10 billion, and $10 trillion is a lot of risky business. These \nbanks will happily suck down the profits when their high-stakes bets \nwork out, and they will just as happily turn to the taxpayers to bail \nthem out if there is a problem. All of this is because the lobbyists \npersuaded Congress to do just one little favor in a must-pass bill.\n  Now, a year after the Citigroup amendment, there are rumors of new \ngiveaways in the upcoming funding bill: rollbacks that would make it \nharder for the government to stop the next AIG from taking down the \nentire\n\n[[Page S8288]]\n\neconomy, rollbacks that would exempt many of the 40 largest banks in \nthe country from tougher oversight, rollbacks that would undermine the \nconsumer agency's rules to clean up mortgage- and auto-lending markets, \nrollbacks that would stop the agency from protecting consumers rights \nif they are cheated on credit cards or checking accounts, rollbacks \nthat would allow financial advisers to continue lining their own \npockets while robbing retirees of billions of dollars.\n  Why are these rollbacks at the top of Congress's agenda? Are \nconstituents flooding the phone lines begging their Senators to weaken \nthe rules for financial institutions? Are they writing in by the \nthousands insisting that their Senators make it easier for people to \nget cheated?\n  Of course not--survey after survey has shown that hardworking \nAmericans want stronger regulation of Wall Street and more \naccountability for CEOs who break the law.\n  But like so many things around here, this process isn't about doing \nwhat hard-working Americans want. It is about pleasing the rich and \npowerful who are lined up for special favors.\n  I know some of my Democratic colleagues are frustrated by all of the \ngridlock in Washington. They say: Wall Street accountability is \nimportant, but I just want to get something done around here for a \nchange; so let's go along with the Republicans and the special \ninterests. Well, yes, I want to get something done too. Who doesn't? \nBut I didn't come here to carry water for Wall Street and a bunch of \nspecial interests.\n\n  If Republicans think it is time to talk about financial reform, then \nlet's put it on the table. If the industry wants to push rollbacks, \nthen I want to make it easier to send bankers to jail when they launder \nmoney or cheat consumers. If the industry wants to chip away at \nfinancial oversight, then I want to have a serious conversation on the \nrecord about breaking up the biggest banks. If they are too scared to \nhave that conversation out in the open, then Senators shouldn't be \nhanding out special favors behind closed doors.\n  The upcoming debate about a government funding bill is going to boil \ndown to one question: Whose side are you on? Are you on the side of \nworking families who got punched in the gut and want stronger rules for \nWall Street or are you on the side of the giant financial institutions \nthat broke the economy, got bailed out, and are once again trying to \ncall the shots on Capitol Hill? Well, me, I am with the families, and I \nam ready to say no to the bank CEOs, no to the industry lobbyists, and \nno to all of their buddies here in Congress.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Merkley.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the senior \nSenator from Massachusetts, who has brought so much personal research \nin the course of her career and passion and insight to this battle and \nwho put forward the idea of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to \nprovide oversight of these predatory practices and who has been such a \nwatchdog about these practices.\n  I would just ask her before she leaves the floor, why is it that this \ndiscussion is happening right now, in terms of policy riders on must-\npass spending bills, rather than happening in the light of day with a \ncommittee hearing--a banking committee hearing--where this can be fully \ndiscussed and debated?\n  Ms. WARREN. Well, the Senator raises the right question, but I think \nit is pretty obvious. If these proposals were debated out in public, \nwhere everyone in America could see and hear them, they wouldn't pass. \nPeople don't want to line up to vote for fewer restrictions on Wall \nStreet. They do not want to line up to vote for more opportunities to \ncheat American families. So, instead, the idea is just tack it on \nsomething else that is going to move through. Then the question is, \nWill people vote to keep the government open? And that gives a lot of \npeople in Congress who want to help the big financial institutions a \nlot of cover, and that is fundamentally wrong.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. One of the things we have a lot of concern about is \nmaking sure that predatory mortgages don't return. They were a key \nproduct in helping drive the collapse in 2007-2008. We are concerned \nthose could return if the ability of the CFPB to regulate them is \ndiminished by changing the government structure of the CFPB or shutting \ndown the funds that enable it to operate. Would that be a good idea or \na bad idea?\n  Ms. WARREN. You know, the CFPB works. It works to help protect \nAmerica's families. It works to help level the playing field. Already \nthat agency has been up and operational for just a little over 4 years, \nand it has forced the biggest financial institutions in this country to \nreturn more than $11 billion directly to families they cheated. It has \nhandled more than 750,000 complaints against big financial \ninstitutions, against payday lenders, and against college loan services \nthat are cheating people and that are tricking people.\n  So what is the response? Well, it is helping the American people, but \nit is costing a handful of the biggest financial institutions in this \ncountry real money, and they are trying to find a way to make sure the \nconsumer agency doesn't do its job. They want to find a way to weaken \nthat agency, to tie that agency down, and to keep that agency from \nleveling the playing field for American families.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I know my colleague and I have talked about this--the \nnumber increases. I will say something like the CFPB has returned $3 \nbillion, and my colleague will say: Oh, Senator, it is now $5 billion. \nAnd when I say it is $5 billion, my colleague will remind me it is now \n$8 billion. And here we are at $12 billion?\n  Ms. WARREN. I think it is $11 billion.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. So $11 billion in returns. I believe that number \nincludes real cash returned to individuals but does not include the \nvast savings that have come from families who were never cheated in the \nfirst place.\n  Ms. WARREN. I think one of the most important parts of this is the \nconsumer agency said--when credit card companies, for example, got \ncaught cheating people, it said to those credit card companies: Look, \nyou have people's addresses to be able to cheat them. Now you have \npeople's addresses to send them checks to pay them back.\n  It is as the Senator said. It was like a warning shot to everyone \nelse out there cheating consumers. It said that this agency is on the \nlevel. This agency is tough. So I think there are millions of Americans \nwho don't get cheated, who don't get tricked in one scam or another \nbecause we have a real watchdog out there--someone who is on the side \nof the American family.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I thank my colleague so much for presenting this idea \nbefore she came to the U.S. Senate and for helping--well, stepping in \nto be the initial Director, getting it up and running, and now being \nhere to make sure we defend its ability to provide fairer financial \nproducts for America's families--products that enable families to build \ntheir wealth rather than having wealth-stripping scams hurt and destroy \nthe finances of American families.\n  Ms. WARREN. I only want to add that I am grateful for all the work my \ncolleague has done on behalf of American consumers and all the work he \ndid to get the consumer agency through Congress and now to protect it \nwhen the big banks were coming after it.\n  So I thank my colleague Senator Merkley for all he did.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. President, as we have heard from this colloquy--and I appreciate \nthat Bill Nelson was here earlier, the Senator from Florida, to discuss \nhis insights on these dark-of-night policy riders designed to restore \nthe Wall Street casino and cheat American families. I appreciate the \ncomments he brought to this and that Jack Reed, the senior Senator from \nRhode Island, has brought forward and Elizabeth Warren, the senior \nSenator from Massachusetts, each of whom made important points. So I \nwill be brief because they have laid out most of the issues I will try \nto echo.\n  The key point is the debate over changing the rules for these \npowerful financial institutions should be debated in the open, in front \nof the TV cameras, in front of the American people, not in secret \nnegotiation rooms and not in the dark of night, which is happening at \nthis very moment, because a lot is at stake.\n  We found from before that when regulations were stripped away and the\n\n[[Page S8289]]\n\nWall Street casino went wild, we ended up with a crash that destroyed \nthe finances of millions of families, many of whom will never recover. \nThey lost their homes, their dreams of homeownership. That has been \nshattered, and they are not going to get it back. They lost their job \nand have been derailed and will never get back on track. They lost \ntheir retirement savings, and they will never be able to rebuild them. \nIn fact, that golden vision of retirement may be something they feel \nthey will never be able to be a part of--that chapter of their life \nwill never come.\n  So a tremendous amount is at stake, and these dark-of-night \nnegotiations to repeal, to undermine, to delay the shutdown of the Wall \nStreet casinos are just wrong. Let us have the debate in the committee \nwhere it belongs. This is critical for working families everywhere in \nthe country and certainly in my home State.\n  Let me mention one of the riders, which is to take and allow the \nVolcker rule to be voided for some of the financial institutions. What \nis the Volcker rule? The Volcker rule shut down the Wall Street casino. \nIt said banks cannot bet with taxpayer-insured deposits. If a group \nwants to make big bets on the future of interest rates or monetary \nexchanges or the quality of mortgages and so forth, they must do so \nwith private wealth funds, where the only persons at stake are those \nwho have invested in the fund. Don't do it with taxpayer-insured banks. \nThat is one example.\n  A second example is that we need to keep the quality mortgages we \nhave now so they do not return to being a predatory instrument. We had \na legalized kickback scheme, and that structure meant mortgage \noriginators were paid for steering families from a prime mortgage that \nwould build their wealth into a subprime mortgage with an exploding \ninterest rate which would destroy their wealth. We ended those \nkickbacks. Let us not let that happen again.\n  Let us not undermine the role of the Financial Stability Oversight \nCouncil. When we had this dramatic massive increase in subprime loans, \nstarting in 2003 and going through 2007, nobody was watching. We need \nto have someone say: Look at that surge in subprimes. And because of \nthat surge, what is going on? Is this creating a bubble? Is this a big \nbet that is going to go bust? Is this going to destroy families?\n  We actually had an agency that was responsible for controlling these \npredatory practices. It was the Federal Reserve, but the Federal \nReserve, full of sophisticated economists, said: Well, we want to talk \nmonetary policy. That is what we do up in the penthouse of the Federal \nReserve building. So they put consumer protection down in the basement \nand they locked the door and threw away the key and said: You know, we \nhave that responsibility, but we just aren't going to do anything about \nit, and they let predatory schemes run wild and destroy millions of \nAmerican families.\n  Now we have an organization--the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau--that is the watchdog making sure the disclosures and the \nstructures are fair and square for American families so we can build \nthe success of those families. You cannot be for the success of \nAmerican families and be for these secret, dark-of-night measures \ndesigned to destroy the effort to rein in this Wall Street casino.\n  I hope we will see a return to regular order, the type of regular \norder my colleague from Rhode Island talked about, the type of light-\nof-day committee discussions my colleague from Massachusetts talked \nabout because this is so important to our future and the success of \nAmerican families. Let's make sure we work together to build the wealth \nand success through fair financial practices, not special favors done \nfor very powerful institutions that are designed to exploit and operate \nas predatory measures to strip the wealth of American families.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of repealing \nObamaCare and replacing it with a step-by-step approach that restores \nchoice and competition to consumers. The problems with ObamaCare are \nlegion and have often been reported in the media and identified on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  I know we have all heard from our constituents. Hundreds of thousands \nhave written and called all of our offices and, as a matter of fact, I \nwill read one of the letters that came into my office--or at least part \nof it. It is addressed to me and starts out saying:\n\n       I'm sure I'm not the first one to contact you about rising \n     health insurance deductibles. I have had this job for 3 \n     years. The first 2 years my company plan had a $3,000 yearly \n     deductible with no copay.\n\n  So he had a $3,000 yearly deductible with no copay. He continues:\n\n       Last year, it went to $4,000 with a 20 percent copay.\n\n  Again, it goes from $3,000 to $4,000 in annual deductible and it goes \nfrom no copay to a 20-percent copay.\n\n       This coming year, 2016, it will go to $6,700 with a 20-\n     percent copay.\n\n  So in just 3 years it goes from a $3,000 yearly deductible with no \ncopay to $6,700--more than double--with a 20-percent copay.\n  He goes on:\n\n       Even before my current job, I had a Blue Cross North Dakota \n     policy that had a $2,000 deductible and a very fair monthly \n     premium. I have always had good health insurance. Now I have \n     an essentially worthless policy.\n       I had bone cancer in my pelvis 1\\1/2\\ years ago. Had to go \n     to Mayo and have my left pelvis removed. I have spent the \n     last 18 months learning to walk again. Doctors weren't able \n     to reconstruct it.\n       I will have twice yearly follow up cancer screenings for \n     the next several years. These follow ups cost about $3500.00 \n     each. So I spend $7000.00 a year, which is all of my \n     deductible.\n\n  He goes on:\n\n       What are you doing to make changes to this health care act?\n\n  He clearly identified what consumers across the country are \nexperiencing. This is just one example. I have many more, as do all of \nthe Members of this body.\n  As bad as ObamaCare is for them, it is going to get worse. In 2016, \nconsumers will see significantly higher premiums yet again. Premiums \nfor the lowest cost silver plan will increase by 13 percent, and the \nlowest cost bronze plan will rise by 16 percent on average.\n  That is not all. The inaptly named Affordable Care Act has led to \nhigher out-of-pocket costs for older, middle, and lower income \nAmericans as well. Today, the average deductible is more than $2,000 \nand for some it exceeds $6,000, discouraging people from seeking \nnecessary care.\n  The law is also resulting in fewer choices. Employers are already \nreducing benefits for many family members. By 2018, more than half of \nemployers plan to significantly reduce benefits for employees' children \nand spouses.\n  While many are seeing higher premiums and deductibles with fewer \nchoices, ObamaCare has created dozens of new taxes that ultimately are \npassed down to small businesses and consumers. The Congressional Budget \nOffice has estimated that ObamaCare will increase taxes by $1.2 \ntrillion over the next decade.\n  The result is fewer jobs. Simply put, employers are already cutting \njobs or reducing hours to part time to avoid the higher costs of \nObamaCare.\n  I do believe there is a consensus across the Nation that we need \nhealth care reform, but ObamaCare is not the answer. Americans want \ncommonsense reforms--reforms that truly are affordable and that truly \ndo empower patients to make their own choices. In the short run, we \nneed to pass budget reconciliation legislation that repeals ObamaCare, \nand, in particular, the individual and employer mandates. In the long \nrun, we need to take a step-by-step approach to put individuals, \nfamilies, and businesses on a path to better reforms. The right \napproach to health care reform empowers people to make their own \nchoices in selecting health care providers and insurers that is patient \ncentered and respects the relationship between doctor and patient. The \nway to accomplish that is with a market-based plan that creates more \ncompetition and reduces health care costs.\n  Here is what we could do: To foster competition and reduce health \ncare costs, we can do things like expand tax-free health savings \naccounts, flexible savings accounts, and Archer medical savings \naccounts to encourage individuals to save for future health care needs. \nCombined with high-deductible, low-premium policies, people will be\n\n[[Page S8290]]\n\nable to meet their immediate health care needs and still be protected \nin the event of costly, serious illness.\n  We should provide portable health care plans so that individuals and \nfamilies don't experience gaps in coverage when they change jobs. These \nplans could be given favorable tax treatment. For example, they could \nbe treated as tax-preferred accounts so that dollars towards premiums \ncould receive tax-exempt treatment. We should allow health care \npolicies to be sold across State lines. This would result in more \nchoices, more competition, and reduced costs for customers. We should \ngive States more flexibility to manage Medicaid for low-income \nindividuals and families. We should ensure affordable health care \noptions are available to those in need and certainly those patients \nwith preexisting conditions. That means bolstering State high-risk \npools to make sure everyone has an opportunity to be covered.\n  ObamaCare is far from being the panacea it was promoted to be. The \nsticker shock hasn't faded. On the budget reconciliation we now have a \nreal opportunity to turn the page on a failed experiment so that we can \ntake steps toward replacing it with something the American people want.\n  I urge my colleagues to get behind the effort so we can start that \nprocess.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                              GMO Labeling\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I want to talk a little bit today about \nfood, transparency, and consumers' rights to know what is in their \nfood.\n  As many folks in this body know, in my real life I am a farmer. I get \nto see exactly where my food comes from. Last month, I spent some time \nbutchering and processing beef, knowing exactly where that came from. I \nlike that. But not all Americans have the ability to know where their \nfood comes from.\n  A few months ago, in July, the House passed a bill called the Safe \nand Accurate Food Labeling Act. It couldn't be anything more different \nfrom that, by the way. It basically denies Americans the right to know \nwhat is in their food by prohibiting the Federal Government, States, \nand municipalities from imposing any labeling standards that deal with \ngenetically modified food.\n  I come from a State where transparency is very important. It makes \nour government work better. For the Federal Government in this case to \nundermine States and municipalities and not allow the consumer to know \nwhat is in their food--it is exactly the wrong step to take.\n  So why am I bringing this subject up today? I am bringing it up today \nbecause, quite frankly, there is some talk about air dropping an \namendment that would allow the DARK Act to go into effect. It is not a \nbill we have debated on the floor to my knowledge. I don't know that it \nhas even been heard in committee. But the bottom line is that this is \nbad policy.\n  The arguments would be that it is confusing; it is going to be \nexpensive. That is bunk. Consumers are smart. They pay attention to \nwhat they eat. If you give them the ability to choose and the ability \nto know what is in their food, they will make the decision--which is \ntheir decision to make--on what they are going to feed their family and \nwhat mothers are going to feed their children.\n  It goes against everything this country stands for about letting \npeople know we do have a great food system in this country. So let's be \nproud of it. Let's label it. Let's talk about what is in it. Let's let \nconsumers have the choice. Consumers are smart, and they will \nabsolutely make a choice that is best for their family.\n  Food is very important. Food, in my opinion, is medicine. If you know \nwhat you are eating, you will have a healthier family. If you pay \nattention to these kinds of things, your health care costs will go \ndown.\n  The truth is that other countries require GMO labeling--countries \nlike Russia, China, Saudi Arabia--not exactly countries that we would \nthink would be very helpful to their consumers or transparent. But they \nthink it is important to label it. We ought to here in this country \ntoo.\n  Big Money is coming in here saying: We don't want the consumers to \nknow if they have GMO products in food; we want consumers to be \nignorant. That is not something this body should do. Let's give \nconsumers the information they deserve. Let's allow this labeling to \nmove forward, as Vermont has already done. Other States like Maine and \nConnecticut also are taking steps in that direction.\n  The bottom line is, to put in an amendment that stops States or \nmunicipalities from requiring labeling is a step in the wrong \ndirection. It is not fair to consumers, and, quite frankly, it is not \nfair to the folks who produce food in this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I want to talk a little about the \nlegislation before us to repeal and replace ObamaCare, otherwise known \nas the Affordable Care Act.\n  When I travel around my home State of Ohio, I hear about a couple \nthings a lot. One is the tough job market and flat wages, which makes \nit difficult to get ahead. The other is--and it is related--escalated \nhealth care costs. People are seeing in their lives that it is tough to \nfind that job, and if they do have a job, they are finding their wages \naren't going up as they would normally expect. Unfortunately, when we \nlook nationally this is true. Wages on average are not just flat; they \nare slightly down. In other words, they have declined, which is not \ntypical. On the other hand, expenses are up, and the biggest expense: \nhealth care.\n  So the middle-class squeeze is very real. It is affecting the people \nI represent as they see, again, unusually low wages, not the growth \nthat we normally expect on the one hand, and on the other hand higher \nexpenses, with health care taking the lead in those expenses.\n  Today in the Senate and tomorrow, as we debate this and vote on it, \nwe have a chance to move the ball forward and show people that at least \na majority in the Congress agree we ought to address this issue--the \nhealth care issue, of course--and try to stop the incredibly fast \nincrease in premiums, deductibles, copays. Families, small businesses \nare getting hit hard. Also, we can help give the economy a shot in the \narm by coming up with smarter ways to deal with health care.\n  This vote will show there are some in Congress who are listening and \nhave some answers. Our job is to do what is right, and that is to pass \nthis legislation to repeal and replace ObamaCare, to give us a chance \nto get rid of some of the most detrimental aspects of it that are \neliminating jobs, that are pushing health care costs higher and higher.\n  The legislation--the Affordable Care Act--was sold as actually \nreducing costs. It was sold under false pretenses.\n  Specifically, the President said it would bring down premiums. He \ntalked about it going down $2,500 on average per family. No; in fact, \npremiums are going up.\n  We were told Americans would be able to keep their insurance. Of \ncourse, millions have lost their health care insurance.\n  We were told that if you have a doctor whom you like, you can keep \nyour doctor. Of course, a lot of people are now being told that under \ntheir new plan, they can't keep the doctor they have had.\n  We were told the Affordable Care Act could keep our economy strong, \nthat it would grow jobs, create jobs. Instead, again, it has made \nthings worse. If we look at the economy and what has happened, a lot of \nthe issue is that people have given up looking for work. The so-called \nlabor force participation rate is the lowest it has been since the \n1970s--over 30 years. Some of that, again, is because we have this weak \neconomy. Some of that is because a lot of the jobs that are available \nare part-time jobs, and the Affordable Care Act encourages part-time \nwork, as we will talk about in a second.\n  So the results are in. We have seen it. We have seen that ObamaCare, \nwith its mandates and centralized control, its top-down approach, has \nmade it more difficult to get a job and has increased health care costs \nfor families and small businesses--not the right way to provide quality \nhealth care for the people I represent in Ohio.\n  I hear stories every day. Sometimes they come in through our Web \nsite, sometimes people call, sometimes I just run into people, and they \ntell me\n\n[[Page S8291]]\n\ntheir stories. I got one this morning. We have our weekly Buckeye \ncoffee, where we bring in people who are here in Washington from around \nOhio to talk to us about their issues. I ran into a small business \nowner, very typical--a manufacturer in this case. He said: Rob, my \nmargins are between 2 and 3 percent. In other words, that is what my \nprofit is, and yet I am seeing my health care costs go up by double \ndigits every year. It just doesn't work. I can't make ends meet. I am \nhaving to pass this along, either to my employees with higher premiums, \nhigher deductibles, higher copays, or to try to pass them on to my \ncustomers. But I am in a very competitive market and I can't really do \nthat. That could mean having to lay some people off, downsize the \nbusiness.\n  Take another small business owner who wrote to me recently who said \nthis is going to hurt his business. He said he is going to have to tell \nhis 35 employees their insurance will be canceled and that the cheapest \nreplacement policies would include a 35-percent increase in premiums as \nwell as a 33-percent increase in deductibles. This is another small \nbusiness in Ohio.\n  Take the father of five who saw the cost of his family's insurance \ndouble under the Affordable Care Act or the man who saw his $100 \ndeductible go to $4,000. Does that sound familiar? There are probably \nsome people listening tonight who had that same experience where their \ndeductible goes up so high, it is almost like you don't have insurance. \nThis guy said he saw his deductible soar to $4,000 while his premiums \nwent up to $1,000 a month.\n\n  Batavia is in Clermont County, OH, right near my home. Recently, a \nwoman from Batavia wrote to me and said:\n\n       I am a single mother. I pay for my own health insurance. I \n     am active and fit. I have cycled over 4000 miles this year. I \n     am seldom sick. In the three years that I've paid for my own \n     insurance, I went to the doctor once for illness. My rate was \n     $146 [a] month. In September, I received a letter from Anthem \n     saying my plan does not meet the requirements of the \n     Affordable Care Act and will be discontinued. I was offered \n     the same coverage for $350 per month.\n\n  This is a real problem for this single mom, but it is for families \nall over Ohio. I am concerned about the impact on those families, \nconcerned about the impact on our small businesses. I am also concerned \nabout the indirect impact on employees who work for those small \nbusinesses.\n  We talked earlier about the fact that there is more and more part-\ntime work and that jobs are hard to come by in Ohio. More and more \nsmall businesses in Ohio are becoming what they call 49ers or 29ers. \nForty-niner refers to the fact that employers sometimes feel they have \nno choice but to freeze their growth, and they are hiring at 49 \nemployees rather than 50 employees because when you hit 50, you come up \nwith new requirements and mandates under ObamaCare.\n  Others have tried to reduce the hours their employees work. If you \nwork less than 30 hours a week, you are not covered by the mandates \nunder ObamaCare. So some employers have reduced hours from 40 hours to \n29 hours. Those are the 29ers. That is one reason full-time work is \nharder to come by.\n  It is no surprise to me that the underemployment figure--those \nworking part time but wanting to return to work full time--has been on \nthe rise. When you see the jobs numbers coming out every month, look at \nthe number of people who are part time rather than full time. It is \nconcerning. Some of this has to be driven by what is happening with the \nAffordable Care Act. I am certainly hearing about it. I am certainly \nhearing about it from people on the ground, real-world situations. It \nis sad.\n  This morning I talked to Todd, the president of a small manufacturing \ncompany, and he talked about a double-digit increase in his health care \nexpenses. Mike from Westlake wrote to me and said:\n\n       I own a small business. Our health insurance rates for \n     single employees under 30 went from $198 per month last year \n     to $560 per month this year. That's a 260% increase thanks to \n     ObamaCare! This bill is going to put small businesses out of \n     business.\n\n  This one is from Tim in Canton. He said:\n\n       The ACA fees being charged to us are $3,250 per year for 11 \n     covered employees, which will be passed on to them. We are \n     paying for the insurance premium increase of $15,186 by \n     reducing our year-end bonus program. We also are offering an \n     even higher deductible plan than we have now. (I will take \n     the higher plan to lower the overall cost to soften the blow \n     for my staff).\n\n  This is an interesting one because it is what I hear around Ohio. \nThey are discontinuing their bonus program because of this. Other \ncompanies say we are discontinuing a research project. Others say we \nare discontinuing our match on our 401(k). Others say we are just plain \ncutting back; in other words, not hiring as many people as they would \nhave.\n  It is happening out there. I know some economists have debates on \nthis issue, but I hope they are talking to people in the real world who \nare being affected by this Affordable Care Act, the top-down approach, \nthe mandates, and the inflexibility.\n  Not only are these small businesses affected by these new mandates, \nbut a lot of them are now subject to one of the new taxes included in \nthe Affordable Care Act. I think there are 21 new taxes in the \nAffordable Care Act. One of them is a tax on medical devices. This is \nan industry that is very important to Ohio and to our country. We have \nhad a competitive edge in medical devices. We have a lot of great \ninnovators in this country, including my home State of Ohio. We have \nbeen able to not only create some great opportunities in this country \nbut we are exporting medical devices around the world. It is hard to \noverstate the impact the industry has on our State of Ohio and the \nripple effect through our communities.\n  Over the past decade, we have added about 370 new bioscience and \nmedical device companies in Ohio alone. It has been a growth area. \nThese companies have brought high-paying jobs. I am told that for every \none job, they create another 2.3 additional jobs. I visited a lot of \nthese companies around the State of Ohio. I have been to companies in \nCleveland, Cincinnati, and Columbus. Recently, I visited Zimmer \nSurgical, which is a company that employs about 300 workers in Dover, \nOH. They expressed the same concern I have heard at all these other \ncompanies I talk about, which is that this new tax under the Affordable \nCare Act makes it hard for them to be able to compete.\n\n  It is a very interesting tax. Normally you would have a tax on \nprofits. If a company makes money, it pays taxes on those earnings and \nthose profits. This is a tax on revenue, whether there is profit or \nnot. It is an excise tax. Since this tax has taken effect, the \ncompanies I am talking about have seen a decrease in their operating \nmargins. They are resulting in fewer jobs, they tell me, and less \ninvestment in the United States. Again, a lot of them say they are \ncutting back on research because they cannot afford to do the research \nthey used to do because of the excise tax on their revenue--again, not \non their profits, the money they are making, but just their revenue. \nThat means their seed corn, as they call it, is being cut back.\n  I talked about the great innovation and the fact that this has been a \ncutting-edge industry for us in Ohio and around the country. The seed \ncorn is research. That is what makes America a cutting-edge country in \nterms of these great medical device companies. A bunch of them are \ncutting back on research and that concerns me. Some have gone overseas. \nSome have moved their research overseas, even though they stayed \nheadquartered in the United States.\n  If this tax continues, some have told me that they will be forced to \nclose down manufacturing facilities. At a time when we need, more than \never, more made-in-America products in innovation, the medical \ntechnology industry is one where we are a leader on the world stage, \nand we should not be coming up with this kind of burdensome tax. That \nis why I am so glad that on this legislation that we will vote on \ntomorrow or the next day, that we will have the opportunity to repeal \nthe medical device tax. By the way, there is a bipartisan consensus \naround that, I think. I know a lot of my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle have talked about the need for us to do that as well.\n  If we do not do that, we are going to find out we have lost ground. \nAgain, this goes to our economy. One thing that concerned me was that \nthe founder of Zimmer Surgical in Dover, OH,\n\n[[Page S8292]]\n\ntold me that had this tax been in place when he started his company, he \ndoesn't think he ever would have made it off the ground. I talked \nearlier about the number of new startups. This is going to keep some of \nthose startups from taking root in the first place and creating those \njobs and opportunities.\n  Repealing a job-killing medical device tax, therefore, is a great \nstep forward to promote policies to get Americans back to work. Even \nthough we need to repeal these top-down mandates we talked about and \nget rid of some of these taxes that are so onerous on workers and hurt \nour economy, I don't think we should go back to the pre-Affordable Care \nAct status quo. I don't think it is enough to say we should repeal this \nbad law. I think we also should say: Let's come up with a better way to \ndeal with health care costs. Health care costs are going to be a big \nproblem unless we deal with them in a much more sensible way than the \nAffordable Care Act does. I think real reform is needed. It must be \npatient-centered. In other words, it must be about the patient giving \nthem the incentive to be able to save costs by focusing on prevention \nand wellness, focused on their families, focused on what they need for \nthemselves and family rather than these mandates that say you can't \nhave this insurance policy you had for years, as this young woman in \nClermont County told me who has seen her premiums go up so \ndramatically. She had a policy she was very happy with. Let people have \nthe policies they want for themselves and their families.\n  Let's have less government and bureaucracy and more focus on \npatients. Let's be sure it is responsible in terms of keeping the tax \nburden down and does not kill jobs as the medical device tax does. \nObamaCare should be repealed. It should be repealed and replaced with a \nsystem that actually works. The failures to ObamaCare actually point \nthe way as to how we can do that. As I said, patient-centered, costs \nshould be the focus. There are steps we can take--and take them today--\nto remove some of the shackles of government regulations from the \nmarket and help make health insurance and health care less expensive. \nWe should start by allowing health care to be sold across State lines. \nLet's be sure we can compete, and the people who live in Cincinnati, \nOH, can get health care across the river in Kentucky or across the \nborder in Indiana. It makes no sense. Some people live in Indiana and \nwork in Ohio and vice versa or work in Kentucky and live in Ohio and \nthey only get health care in the place where they live.\n  We should be able to look for our health care in New York or \nCalifornia. Whatever works best for our family. Make these companies \ncompete for our business. We should take commonsense steps to rein in \nthe staggering costs of frivolous lawsuits. This could save billions \nand billions of dollars in our health care system. There is a CBO \nestimate of the cost to the Federal Government that could be saved \nalone. It is tens of billions of dollars, but the medical profession \nwill tell you it is more like hundreds of billions of dollars as it \napplies to all of us. That will help to make health care more \naffordable.\n  We should cover more Americans by creating a healthy, vibrant \nindividual health care market, giving people a tax incentive to \npurchase health care insurance comparable by the incentives they \nreceive at their employer-provided plan. Why shouldn't they have that \nsame opportunity in the individual market that is part of the way you \ncover more people?\n  The sad truth about ObamaCare is that the coverage numbers are very \ndisappointing, even to those who strongly supported the bill. Why? \nBecause what has happened is that some people have gotten coverage, but \nothers have lost coverage. The estimates by the Congressional Budget \nOffice are that still 10 years after this legislation is in place there \nwill be something like 30 million Americans without coverage.\n  We can do it and do it in a more cost-effective way and be sure \npeople do have the opportunity to have access to quality health care. \nThe bill we have before us this week will take that first step at \nremoving the shackles of government regulation and put the country on \nthe path forward to real health care reform. Not only does the \nlegislation remove the mandates ObamaCare placed on individuals and \nbusinesses to purchase insurance, but it also rolls back some of the \nnew programs, while giving the new President, the next President, and \nthe new Congress, the next Congress, the time to be able to enact \nalternative reforms that will ensure all families have access to \nquality, affordable health care. It has to be a top priority to \nactually come up with not just repealing what is there but replacing it \nwith something that makes more sense for families in Ohio and around \nthe country.\n  I look forward to this vote and this debate because it gives us an \nopportunity to send to the President sensible legislation that gets rid \nof so many of the detrimental impacts of ObamaCare and sets us down the \npath of debating about what that future ought to be.\n  Some Democrats have said: Why are you doing this--because the \nPresident said he will veto it. I would ask them to look at what the \nmajority of the American people are saying, which is that they do not \nbelieve the Affordable Care Act is the right way to go. I guess I would \nlook at the fact that the majority in the Senate may feel that way as \nwell. We should represent those folks back home. Because the President \ndoesn't support it doesn't mean we shouldn't act and do what is right. \nEvery President who served in this great country has had the \nopportunity to veto legislation coming from Congress. It doesn't mean \nCongress shouldn't send them legislation. I hope the President will not \nveto it. He probably will. It doesn't mean the Senate shouldn't act. I \nam glad we are acting.\n  I stand ready to work with my colleagues going forward on both sides \nof the aisle to enact real reforms that do provide the people I \nrepresent and people all around this great country the access to the \nquality care they deserve.\n  Mr. President, I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, for those who are keeping score, this is \nthe 17th time that the Senate will be asked by the Republicans to vote \nto end ObamaCare, and they have added to this to defund Planned \nParenthood. As one individual said the other day, here is a \nbreakthrough press release: President Barack Obama is not going to end \nObamaCare. That seems pretty obvious. So this is a political exercise. \nIt doesn't solve the problems of America. It doesn't even address the \nproblems of America.\n  The Affordable Care Act finds health insurance for 17 million \nAmericans. We have reduced the number of uninsured Americans by 45 \npercent with this bill. The Republicans have opposed it from the start, \nnever providing a single vote in support, never willing to sit down \nafter it was passed to talk about changes that would make it even \nstronger or better. They want to end it. It is ObamaCare. It has the \nPresident's name on it--enough said for many of them. They want it to \ngo away.\n  The reality is if it goes away, so does health insurance protection \nfor millions of Americans. So you would expect that the Grand Old \nParty, the Republican Party, would have an alternative for us, right? \nWrong. They have never come forward with any alternative that would \nprovide coverage for these millions of Americans and the others who \nshould have health insurance coverage as well. It just tells you that \nthey are prepared to go back to the bad old days before ObamaCare and \nthe Affordable Care Act.\n  Remember those days? Remember when a health insurance company could \nsay to you: Sorry, you happen to have a sick child in your family, and \nwe are not going to give you health insurance. Preexisting conditions \nwere enough to say no, and if they said yes, it was at a premium that \nan average family couldn't even consider. We ended that discrimination \nagainst families and sick children. We ended it.\n  The Republicans today want to go back to those good old days when \nhealth insurance companies could turn you down in a New York minute and \nsay: There will be no health insurance for you or your kids. They want \nto go back to those good old days. They are wrong.\n  They want to go back to the days when a family's health insurance \nplan wouldn't cover the graduate from college until he reached the age \nof 26. That is what the Affordable Care Act\n\n[[Page S8293]]\n\ndoes. It says that a family can keep that youngster--young man or \nwoman--on their health insurance plan for their family while they are \nlooking for a job, serving an internship or have a part-time \nopportunity.\n  I will tell you, as a father who has raised three children, I can \nremember those days after college when those kids didn't have coverage, \nand I used to ask them about that. I asked my daughter, Jennifer: Do \nyou have health insurance now? She said: Dad, I don't need it; I feel \njust fine. That is not what a father wants to hear. The Republicans \nwant to return to those good old days when those young men and women, \nafter just having graduated from college, had to buy their own health \ninsurance and couldn't stay on the family plan.\n  What about senior citizens with prescription drugs? The Affordable \nCare Act, which they want to repeal, helped seniors pay for their \nprescription drugs. They want to go back to the bad old days when \nseniors had a gap in coverage and had to go to their lifesavings to buy \nlifesaving prescription drugs. Those are the good old days that the \nRepublicans want to return to. Well, those days weren't so good, and \nthey certainly shouldn't return.\n  We have seen for the last 5 years the slowest rate of increase in \nhealth care costs in the last several decades. We have slowed down that \nrate of growth. We can do better. We should work together to do better \non a bipartisan basis.\n  But instead, we are faced with a 17th vote by Republicans in the \nSenate to eliminate ObamaCare, to return to the old days of \ndiscrimination because of preexisting conditions and to take your kids \nwho have graduated from college off your family health insurance plan. \nThat is what they want to go back to.\n  America is not going to let that happen. Thank goodness this \nPresident won't let that happen. But we are going to waste several days \non the floor of the Senate while they go through speeches that have \nbeen carefully rehearsed and delivered 17 different times with the same \nultimate result, and nothing is going to happen. Instead, they should \njoin us in a bipartisan effort to make the Affordable Care Act even \nstronger, fairer, and to help people have affordability and access to \nhealth insurance.\n\n\n                       Shooting in San Bernardino\n\n  Mr. President, earlier today there was a mass shooting in San \nBernardino, CA. News reports are saying that up to three heavily armed \ngunmen attacked a social services center that helps developmentally \ndisabled people and their families in the community.\n  Preliminary reports say that there have been 14 people killed and 14 \nwounded, although we don't know the exact number yet. There are videos \nof wounded people actually lying in the streets. The suspects \napparently fled the scene in a black SUV, and a manhunt is underway.\n  This story is horrific, but it is also horribly familiar. There have \nbeen over 350 mass shootings in America this year. On average, 297 \nAmericans are shot every single day, 89 fatally. Listen to this grim \nand sad statistic: There have been over 50 school shootings this year \nin America.\n  Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and first responders in \nSan Bernardino. But they and all the victims across our country deserve \nmore than our thoughts and prayers. They deserve action. It is time for \nCongress--in a level-headed, commonsense moment--to vote on and pass \nlegislation to protect innocent people across America from this \nhorrific gun violence.\n\n\n                            Syrian Refugees\n\n  Mr. President, I don't know if it was George Washington who said--\nalthough I think he is given the credit--when describing this \ninstitution of the Senate: It is the saucer that cools the tea.\n  I served in the House for 14 years and was proud to do it. We were \nelected every 2 years. It was a more volatile atmosphere because we \nwere constantly running for reelection. The Senate is a different \ninstitution, with 6-year terms and a little more reflection, I hope, in \nwhat we do. I hope that we take the time that is necessary to exercise \nour constitutional opportunity here and think things over clearly and \nnot react emotionally.\n  Well, it was about 2 weeks ago when the House of Representatives took \naction on the Syrian refugees and passed a measure that would give what \nthey called a pause to receiving Syrian refugees in the United States. \nIt was a heated moment. It was after the terrible tragedies that \noccurred in Paris and Beirut, and there were concerns about ISIL and \nthe spread of their terrorist ways around the world. It was an \nemotional moment that really needs some reflection.\n  The simple fact of the matter is this. Over the last 4 years, during \nthe course of the Syrian war, the United States has received about \n2,000 refugees from Syria into our country. It is an elaborate, lengthy \nprocess.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have an article from last \nweekend's New York Times, which outlines all of the steps that need to \nbe taken in order for a Syrian refugee to enter the United States, \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 20, 2015]\n\n      Why It Takes Two Years for Syrian Refugees To Enter the U.S.\n\n                  (By Haeyoun Park and Larry Buchanan)\n\n       Syrians must pass many layers of security checks before \n     being admitted to the United States, a process that can take \n     two years or longer. In most cases, the refugees do not enter \n     the United States until the very end. They are also subject \n     to an additional layer of checks beyond those for refugees of \n     other nationalities; after the Paris attacks, the House voted \n     to further tighten screening procedures. Since 2011, the \n     United States has admitted fewer than 2,000 Syrian refugees.\n       1. Registration with the United Nations.\n       2. Interview with the United Nations.\n       3. Refugee status granted by the United Nations.\n       4. Referral for resettlement in the United States. The \n     United Nations decides if the person fits the definition of a \n     refugee and whether to refer the person to a country for \n     resettlement. Only the most vulnerable are referred, \n     accounting for fewer than 1 percent of refugees worldwide. \n     Some people spend years waiting in refugee camps.\n       5. Interview with State Department contractors.\n       6. First background check.\n       7. Higher-level background check for some.\n       8. Another background check. The refugee's name is run \n     through law enforcement and intelligence databases for \n     terrorist or criminal history. Some go through a higher-level \n     clearance before they can continue. A third background check \n     was introduced in 2008 for Iraqis but has since been expanded \n     to all refugees ages 14 to 65.\n       9. First fingerprint screening; photo taken.\n       10. Second fingerprint screening.\n       11. Third fingerprint screening. The refugee's fingerprints \n     are screened against F.B.I. and Homeland Security databases, \n     which contain watch list information and past immigration \n     encounters, including if the refugee previously applied for a \n     visa at a United States embassy. Fingerprints are also \n     checked against those collected by the Defense Department \n     during operations in Iraq.\n       12. Case reviewed at United States immigration \n     headquarters.\n       13. Some cases referred for additional review. Syrian \n     applicants must undergo these two additional steps. Each is \n     reviewed by a United States Citizenship and Immigration \n     Services refugee specialist. Cases with ``national security \n     indicators'' are given to the Homeland Security Department's \n     fraud detection unit.\n       14. Extensive, in-person interview with Homeland Security \n     officer. Most of the interviews with Syrian refugees have \n     been done in Amman, Jordan and in Istanbul.\n       15. Homeland Security approval is required. If the House \n     bill becomes law, the director of the F.B.I., the Homeland \n     Security secretary and the director of national intelligence \n     would be required to confirm that the applicant poses no \n     threat.\n       16. Screening for contagious diseases.\n       17. Cultural orientation class.\n       18. Matched with an American resettlement agency.\n       19. Multi-agency security check before leaving for the \n     United States. Because of the long amount of time between the \n     initial screening and departure, officials conduct a final \n     check before the refugee leaves for the United States.\n       20. Final security check at an American airport.\n       Sources: State Department; Department of Homeland Security; \n     Center for American Progress; U.S. Committee for Refugees and \n     Immigrants.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. It starts with registration with the United Nations, \ninterview with the United Nations, refugee status granted by the United \nNations, referral for resettlement in the United States, interview with \nState Department contractors, the first background check, higher level \nbackground checks, another background check, fingerprint screening with \na photo taken, the second fingerprint screening, the third fingerprint \nscreening, the case reviewed by U.S. immigration headquarters and\n\n[[Page S8294]]\n\nthen in some cases referred for additional review, extensive in-person \ninterviews with Homeland Security officers, and then--and only then--\ncould Homeland Security approval be required. At that point the \npotential refugee is screened for contagious diseases, goes through a \ncultural orientation class, matched with an American resettlement \nagency, goes through a multiagency security check before leaving to \nenter the United States, and then faces a final security check when \nthey arrive at an American airport.\n  I am entering this into the Record because those who are suggesting \nthat we are taking Syrian refugees without appropriate screening are \nnot aware of the reality. It is a process that takes 18 to 24 months, \nand in the 4 years we have accepted about 2,000 Syrian refugees, not a \nsingle one has been found to be involved in a terrorist activity.\n  We accept about 70,000 refugees in the United States each year, and I \nam glad that we do because for some people in some parts of the world, \nit is the only place they can turn to.\n  The public reaction against the House action that bars Syrian \nrefugees is interesting. There was a Congressman, and I don't know him \npersonally, but his name is Congressman Steve Russell of Oklahoma.\n  This is according to the POLITICO article:\n\n       He voted for the bill with serious reservations but in the \n     hopes of affecting the debate as it moved ahead. If the \n     existing bill were to come before the House again, ``I would \n     vote against it,'' Russell said. ``I think it creates \n     impossible barriers to refugees.''\n\n  Just 2 weeks ago, he voted for it, but he has thought it over. Why? \nThis article says:\n\n       For Russell, the issue is personal. One of his close \n     friends is an American citizen who was trying to get his \n     mother out of Syria. The mother died this past summer before \n     she could leave that war-torn country. Out of respect for his \n     friend's privacy, [Congressman] Russell [of Oklahoma], a \n     retired Army lieutenant colonel, declined to offer specifics, \n     including exactly what happened to the woman. But he said: \n     ``I'm certain had he been able to get her to the United \n     States, she would still be alive.''\n       [Congressman] Russell urged [his fellow] Republicans in the \n     Senate to think carefully before supporting the House bill, \n     saying they should not get refugees confused with the broader \n     issue of immigration. He pointed out that in the past the \n     U.S. has denied entry to people in need of help, including \n     Jews [who were] fleeing the Nazis [in Europe during World War \n     II].\n       ``We have had dark periods when we have done this in the \n     past,'' he said. ``History never judges it kindly--never.''\n\n  That was a quote by Congressman Russell, a Republican from the State \nof Oklahoma.\n  I think it is important to note, too, that ``in a letter to lawmakers \nreleased [yesterday], a group of national security experts, including \nfigures prominent in Republican circles such as former Secretary of \nState [Henry] Kissinger, retired Gen. David Petraeus and former \nHomeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, urged [us] to stop the \nHouse bill.''\n\n       ``Refugees are victims, not perpetrators of terrorism,'' \n     the signatories wrote. ``Categorically refusing to take them \n     only feeds the narrative of [the Islamic State] that there is \n     a war between Islam and the West, that Muslims are not \n     welcome in the United States and Europe, and that the \n     [Islamic State] caliphate is their true home.''\n\n  Perhaps the saucer is cooling the tea, and perhaps the Senate will \nhave the good sense not to follow the action of the House of \nRepresentatives in passing this provision.\n  I have two other items to add to the Record before I yield the floor \nto my colleagues who have gathered here today.\n  The first is an article that comes out of the city of Chicago, which \nI am honored to represent. I ask unanimous consent that the article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Chicagoist.com, Dec. 1, 2015]\n\nMeet the Nuns Who Are Preparing Their West Ridge Home To Take in Syrian \n                                Refugees\n\n                            (By Tony Boylan)\n\n       Three nuns living in West Ridge plan to take in a Syrian \n     refugee family not just with the blessing of their local \n     community, but at its urging.\n       Despite Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner's decision last month to \n     join a number of other state governors in vowing to make it \n     tougher for Syrian refugees to resettle in the U.S. in the \n     wake of a recent terrorist attack on Paris, these women are \n     preparing their home to make life a little easier for a \n     refugee family.\n       The sisters, part of the Society of Helpers, live in a \n     historic home once owned by the Dr. Scholl's Family with a \n     finished basement they in the process of turning into a \n     family apartment. The Society is an international order with \n     progressive values based on the teachings of St. Ignatius. In \n     other words, they get their hands dirty working with lots of \n     issues other people of faith aren't always quick to embrace; \n     the homeless, addicts, teenage mothers, domestic violence and \n     those most in need of support and assistance.\n       From their mission statement: ``As contemplatives in \n     action, we don't just pray for social justice and for peace--\n     we make it our life's work.''\n       Putting their faith in action, the sisters moved swiftly to \n     ready themselves to provide shelter to a refugee family they \n     think could be with them as soon as January. Political \n     leaders can debate and demagogue on the issue all they'd \n     like, but the sisters don't care about that. Their faith \n     declares what it declares, they say, and offering help is \n     their faith.\n       ``We would rather not make our decision on fear, we would \n     rather make our decision on compassion,'' said Sister Mary \n     Ellen Moore, a registered psychologist and one of three nuns \n     who lives in the house. ``We were certainly disappointed in \n     Gov. Rauner's statement on this issue. That kind of mentality \n     if frightening and we know what it's led to in Europe and in \n     other places in the past. It's really very sad.''\n       The plan predates the attacks in Paris, which have somehow \n     been blamed on refugees--the same people trying to flee the \n     horrific powers behind the carnage. The nuns and the members \n     of St. Gertrude's parish in Edgewater took to heart the \n     Pope's call for every congregation in America to help ease \n     the international crisis and find a way to accommodate \n     refugees.\n       The sisters do find it important to note that this isn't an \n     entirely free ride. Refugee families from Syria, or anywhere \n     else, are required as part of their status to obtain work \n     almost immediately after getting settled. Catholic Charities \n     will assist them with that. The family will also be asked to \n     contribute something for electricity and other utilities in \n     due time, and after a store of donated food is exhausted, the \n     family will rely on its own income and some help from charity \n     for food.\n       In this case, though, a family couldn't ask for hosts more \n     qualified and prepared to help them assimilate. And the \n     sisters think the multicultural nature of their \n     neighborhood--near Devon Avenue and Loyola University--will \n     be helpful.\n       Members of the parish, where the sisters attend church, but \n     have no official attachment, almost immediately began \n     collecting donations of money, furniture, bedding, kitchen \n     supplies, and all the mundane things a family starting over \n     with nothing might need to get by. (There still is a need for \n     everything except clothing, which will wait until they know \n     who is coming and can collect items appropriate to ages and \n     size. Any help is appreciated and can be donated through \n     either the Society of Helpers Facebook Page or website.\n       It's not as if the parishioners or sisters are entering \n     into this without thinking through any potential risks. It's \n     just that they know the risks are being wildly overstated and \n     their mission is clear.\n       A letter written by parishioner John Neafsey was circulated \n     among church members recently read, in part:\n       ``Security concerns are understandable in the aftermath of \n     the Paris attacks. But our understanding is that there is \n     already a thorough and lengthy screening process in place for \n     checking the backgrounds of refugees (agreed upon between the \n     UNHCR and host countries, including the U.S.) prior to \n     approving them for resettlement to the United States. We \n     believe that an arbitrary refusal to allow Syrian refugees to \n     come to our state is unnecessary, unfair, and un-Christian. \n     This would needlessly scapegoat and penalize innocent men, \n     women, and children who are fleeing violence and persecution. \n     It deprives them of the chance to get a new start in a safe \n     place where they are welcome. The motto of our parish is `All \n     Are Welcome.' For us, ``all'' includes Syrian refugees, \n     whether they are Christian or Muslim.''\n       While neither the church members nor the sisters want this \n     matter to be political, they understand the climate that has \n     been created.\n       ``It's very sad people just jump to judgement because \n     people are different,'' said Sr. Jean Kielty, Director of the \n     House of Good Shepherd and a social worker who has aided the \n     homeless for a quarter century. She shares the house with \n     Sister Mary Ellen, Sister Anna Maria Baldauf, and their dogs, \n     Mocha and Snowball.\n       ``This is just a different kind of homelessness--a more \n     tragic one.''\n       There is a one ramification Sister Jean is concerned about, \n     though: ``I'm not sure if my family will come visit me \n     anymore.''\n       Here's a little more information about the nuns behind this \n     initiative and the residence where they are providing a \n     basement apartment to a refugee family next year:\n\n\n                            Jean Kielty, SH\n\n       As a social worker, Jean's ministry has focused on \n     addressing homelessness in the Chicagoland area for more than \n     25 years. She\n\n[[Page S8295]]\n\n     has served as Director of Interim Housing with Catholic \n     Charities of the Archdiocese of Chicago and is currently the \n     Executive Program Director of the House of Good Shepherd. \n     Jean is the founder and current chairperson of the board for \n     Casa Esperanza, a transitional housing program for women and \n     their children located in South Chicago. Jean is one of three \n     leaders of the U.S. Province of the Society of Helpers and \n     resides in her West Ridge home with two other Helpers and \n     their dogs.\n\n\n                      Mary Ellen Moore, SH, Ph.D.\n\n       Mary Ellen is a registered psychologist and co-founder of \n     Claret Center in Hyde Park that offers psychotherapy, \n     workshops, and professional development that support \n     wholeness in mind, body, and spirit. In addition to her \n     advisory role at Claret Center, Mary Ellen provides \n     psychotherapy and supervision to clients and students and is \n     the director of training for the practicum at ``The Circle,'' \n     a Helpers-sponsored resource center for Latina immigrant \n     women in Brighton Park. Mary Ellen served served two previous \n     terms as the Helpers' U.S. Provincial from 1985-1995 and \n     another term from 2008-2014.\n\n\n                            The Miller House\n\n       This West Ridge modified Georgian Colonial Revival was \n     built by the Hutchins Brothers in 1911. In 1923, the Hutchins \n     family sold the home to Frank Scholl, brother of Dr. William \n     M. Scholl who founded the company Dr. Scholl's. Frank joined \n     the business in 1910 and oversaw European operations. \n     Featured on the 1996 Annual Fall House Tour and the 2013 \n     Annual House Tour, this historical home boasts 5000 square \n     feet with 5 bedrooms, 5.5 bathrooms and related living \n     quarters.\n       Although this ``large home'' has undergone changes with \n     each of the five previous owners, it maintains many qualities \n     of its original historic charm. The Society of Helpers \n     purchased the home in 2014, planning to utilize its space to \n     welcome other Helpers visiting from around the world. They \n     were thrilled to be able to offer the related living quarters \n     to a Syrian refugee family when their parish, St. Gertrude, \n     and Catholic Charities provided an opportunity to present a \n     family in need of a safe home.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. The article talks about a house in West Ridge, Chicago. \nIt is a place where an order of Catholic nuns called the Society of \nHelpers has a house that they have turned into a refuge for homeless \npeople. They have announced that they are going to accept Syrian \nrefugees into their home so that the refugees know they will have a \nsafe place to stay in the United States.\n  Sister Mary Ellen Moore, a registered psychologist and one of the \nnuns who lives in the house, said:\n\n       We would rather not make our decision on fear, we would \n     rather make it on compassion . . . We were certainly \n     disappointed in Gov. Rauner's statement on this issue. That \n     kind of mentality is frightening and we know what it's led to \n     in Europe and other places in the past. It's really very sad.\n\n  The people of France, after these horrific terrorist incidents, \nannounced that they are going to accept 30,000 Syrian refugees. The \npeople of Canada, after the terrible incident in Paris, announced \nvirtually the same thing. And what has been the response of the United \nStates and the House of Representatives? It has been an irrational \nresponse of fear.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter, which comes \nfrom a group called HIAS, and has the headline ``1000 Rabbis in Support \nof Welcoming Refugees'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From hias.org, Dec. 1, 2015]\n\n             1,000 Rabbis in Support of Welcoming Refugees\n\n       We, Rabbis from across the country, call on our elected \n     officials to exercise moral leadership for the protection of \n     the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program.\n       Since its founding, the United States has offered refuge \n     and protection to the world's most vulnerable. Time and time \n     again, those refugees were Jews. Whether they were fleeing \n     pogroms in Tzarist Russia, the horrors of the Holocaust or \n     persecution in Soviet Russia or Iran, our relatives and \n     friends found safety on these shores.\n       We are therefore alarmed to see so many politicians \n     declaring their opposition to welcoming refugees.\n       Last month's heartbreaking attacks in Paris and Beirut are \n     being cited as reasons to deny entry to people who are \n     themselves victims of terror. And in those comments, we, as \n     Jewish leaders, see one of the darker moments of our history \n     repeating itself.\n       In 1939, the United States refused to let the S.S. St. \n     Louis dock in our country, sending over 900 Jewish refugees \n     back to Europe, where many died in concentration camps. That \n     moment was a stain on the history of our country--a tragic \n     decision made in a political climate of deep fear, suspicion \n     and antisemitism. The Washington Post released public opinion \n     polling from the early 1940's, showing that the majority of \n     U.S. citizens did not want to welcome Jewish refugees to this \n     country in those years.\n       In 1939, our country could not tell the difference between \n     an actual enemy and the victims of an enemy. In 2015, let us \n     not make the same mistake.\n       We therefore urge our elected officials to support refugee \n     resettlement and to oppose any measures that would actually \n     or effectively halt resettlement or prohibit or restrict \n     funding for any groups of refugees.\n       As Rabbis, we take seriously the biblical mandate to \n     ``welcome the stranger.'' We call on our elected officials to \n     uphold the great legacy of a country that welcomes refugees.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will close by reading just a portion of this letter \nthat was handed to me this morning by this group that represents these \nJewish rabbis all across the United States, from virtually every State \nin the Union.\n  It says:\n\n       We, Rabbis from across the country, call on our elected \n     officials to exercise moral leadership for the protection of \n     the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program.\n       Since its founding, the United States has offered refuge \n     and protection to the world's most vulnerable. Time and time \n     again, those refugees were Jews. Whether fleeing the pogroms \n     in Tzarist Russia, the horrors of the Holocaust or \n     persecution in Soviet Russia or Iran, our relatives and \n     friends found safety on these shores.\n       We are therefore alarmed to see so many politicians \n     declaring their opposition to welcoming refugees.\n       Last month's heartbreaking attacks in Paris and Beirut are \n     being cited as reasons to deny entry to people who are \n     themselves victims of terror. And in those comments, we, as \n     Jewish leaders, see one of the darker moments of our history \n     repeating itself.\n\n  They go on to talk about the United States turning away the SS St. \nLouis in 1939, and 900 Jews were sent back to Europe. The Holocaust \nMuseum tells us that 200 of them perished in the Holocaust because the \nUnited States refused to accept them as refugees.\n  They end by saying:\n\n       As Rabbis, we take seriously the biblical mandate to \n     ``welcome the stranger.'' We call on our elected officials to \n     uphold the great legacy of a country that welcomes refugees.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, before we get too wrapped up with our \nconcern for the Syrian refugees, let's keep in mind that this \nadministration doesn't have a policy in the Middle East today and \nhasn't had one since it came into office. It doesn't have a policy in \nSyria. They don't know where we are. He has drawn a line in the sand \nand just ignored his commitments. We wouldn't have all of these Syrian \nrefugees if we had a policy in the first place.\n\n  Secondly, it was this administration's own Director of National \nIntelligence, James Clapper, who said that it is a fact that the \nrefugees who come in from Syria could very well be bringing terrorists \ninto the United States, and I think we need to consider that and \nconsider our citizens before we consider some of the others. There are \nother options. We could have no-fly zones and have refugees settled in \ntheir own country, and that would be a lot safer for America and a lot \ncheaper.\n  Anyway, that is not why I am here.\n  President Obama made a lot of points to the American people in 2010 \nabout how ObamaCare would improve health care for everyone. He said it \nwould lower costs, it would expand access, and it would make health \ncare more affordable for everyone. Yet, 5 years after this law's \npassage, ObamaCare has only increased premiums and increased \ndeductibles, cut down employee work hours, and threatened the religious \nliberty of many employers who are providing needed jobs in a slow \neconomy.\n  Since Obama's disastrous rollout, I have listened to heartbreaking \naccounts of how ObamaCare has negatively impacted middle-class Oklahoma \nfamilies. I go back every weekend and I talk to these people. Their \nbudgets are taking the hardest hits. The longer this law has been on \nthe books, the worse the stories have become.\n  Oklahoman Fred Imel's premium is going from $1,100 a month to $1,700 \na month. In fact, it was just announced that next year Oklahomans will \nsee an average increase of 35.7 percent in premium prices, which is the \nhighest in the Nation. That is why I am concerned about this. We have \nan opportunity, actually, tomorrow to act on something that can change \nall of this.\n  In addition, BlueCross BlueShield notified 40,000 Oklahomans earlier \nthis\n\n[[Page S8296]]\n\nyear that they will no longer offer their current plans and that \npolicyholders would be forced to move to other plans in the two other \nnetworks in the State. Both plan options have fewer participating \ndoctors, hospitals, and other providers. In other words, access to care \nis going down for these people, all the while costs are going up.\n  At the same time, many other insurance companies are dropping out of \nthe Affordable Care Act market altogether, leaving Oklahomans with even \nfewer choices, not more, as President Obama promised back in 2010. In \nfact, nationwide, ObamaCare offers, on average, 34 percent fewer \nproviders than health care networks outside the exchanges.\n  But ObamaCare isn't delivering bad news just to Oklahoma. Across the \nNation, federally backed co-ops are going under due to ObamaCare. On \nOctober 16, the Wall Street Journal had an article that said that these \ncooperatives are ``collapsing at such a rapid clip that some co-ops and \nsmall insurers are forming a coalition to consider legal action to try \nto change health-law provisions they blame for their financial \ndistress.''\n  Twelve out of the 23 ObamaCare established co-ops have gone under. \nMore than half of them have gone under, leaving more than 500,000 \ncurrently insured Americans to find new insurance once again or face a \nsteep penalty from the Federal Government. These co-ops also received \nover $1 billion in taxpayer loans from the Federal Government, most of \nwhich will never get repaid. So it is really worse economically for \nthis country.\n  Since the beginning of this Congress, I have sponsored 12 bills to \ndismantle and fully repeal ObamaCare, and my colleagues and I are \ncommitted to maintaining our promise to repeal and replace ObamaCare. \nThis reconciliation bill is a step in that direction. The House passed \nreconciliation on October 23 with a vote of 240 to 189.\n  This bill repeals the major components of ObamaCare, including the \nindividual and employer mandate. It also repeals the medical device tax \nand the Cadillac tax, which is a tax placed on certain high-value, \nemployer-sponsored insurance plans.\n  The Senate reconciliation bill also takes repeal of ObamaCare a lot \nfurther by repealing $1 trillion in ObamaCare taxes and fully repealing \nthe Medicare expansion and all ObamaCare subsidies by 2018.\n  Importantly, the reconciliation bill also prohibits Federal funding \nfor Planned Parenthood and instead uses that money that is saved by \nthat repeal to increase funding for community health care centers. We \nhear people talk about health care for woman who are going to be hurt \nif we get rid of Planned Parenthood, yet we have more than 9,000--\n9,000--community health centers. These facilities are better equipped \nto provide women with the health care they need when compared to only \n700 Planned Parenthood facilities. So keep in mind that there are 700 \nPlanned Parenthood facilities and 9,000 community health centers, so \nthey actually have the opportunity to get better care.\n  This issue is of particular importance given the sting videos that \nwere released over the last few months showing the lengths Planned \nParenthood affiliates have gone to profit from the sale of fetal tissue \nfollowing abortions.\n  Planned Parenthood is a private institution that largely serves urban \nareas. While abortion may not be the only service they provide, it is \nwhat they are primarily known for. Everybody knows that. Whether they \nhave broken the law or not, the taxpayer money they currently receive \nwould be better directed toward the community health centers, which, on \na ratio of 12 to 1, would be able to help with women's services.\n  Life is one of the single most important issues we consider here in \nthe Senate, and I am proud of what we have already done this year. A \nfew months ago, a majority of Senators voted to defund Planned \nParenthood. That vote has already taken place. A majority of us here--\nalthough the tally did not pass the 60-vote threshold that was \nnecessary to break a filibuster, it did show that more than a majority \nof Senators support ending subsidies to the largest abortion provider \nin America.\n  More important than the Senate's views of this, a majority of the \nAmerican people support protecting life of the unborn. Every survey \ndemonstrates that very clearly. When I go back home, people say: Why is \nit that if this is something the American people want, this taking of \nlife continues?\n  The American people support it, and it is very important to me and my \nconstituents that we do everything possible to protect the sanctity of \nlife. That is among the top reasons why it is necessary to vote for \nthis reconciliation bill. We have the chance to end the Federal \nfinancing of the institution that has chopped up babies and negotiated \nthe most profitable price for their organs. There is no moral gray area \nhere.\n  Let me tell my colleagues something about Oklahoma. I am going to \ntell my colleagues about how immoral and abrasive ObamaCare has been. \nIn my State of Oklahoma--I was in the State senate back in 1970. I had \na good friend then whose name is David Green. He developed a business \nin his garage--this was in 1970--where he made picture frames. He had \nonly one employee, and then he started growing. Over a period of time, \nhe has grown to where he now has Hobby Lobby. Hobby Lobby has 600 \nstores, 23,000 employees, and it started in a garage in 1970.\n  David Green is a real Jesus guy. He loves the Lord. He has his own \nprinciples, his own morality, and his employees do too. So ObamaCare \ncame along and required a contraceptive type of pill taken after \nfertilization that is very similar--it is a type of abortion, in the \neyes of this man. Well, he refused to force his employees to do that.\n  ObamaCare--the Federal Government--came along and they sued him and \nthey--no, they were fining him $1 million a day--$1 million a day for \nrefusing to take human life. He filed a suit. Now, keep in mind, $1 \nmillion a day. He went to district court, and he won the case by a \nclose decision over ObamaCare. Then they appealed the case to the \ncircuit court. He won there, and he won ultimately in the U.S. Supreme \nCourt by a split vote of 5 to 4. Here is a guy who is willing to risk \n$1 million a day because he knew what was morally right. This is \nsomething that actually happened.\n  I will tell my colleagues, we have to get rid of ObamaCare and get \nout of the abortion business. We will have that chance tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, nearly 6 years ago this body was on the \nverge of passing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Today \nthe Senate is poised to repeal that insultingly misnamed law.\n  Back in the winter of 2009, of course, we still had yet to pass the \nbill to see what was in it, although one didn't need a Ph.D. in \neconomics to foresee that the Affordable Care Act would be a mess. It \nwasn't just conservatives and Republicans raising concerns; every \nsensible observer saw the obvious flaws and the inevitable disasters \nembedded in the rickety, ideological scheme congressional Democrats \nwere foisting on the American people in an exercise of unprecedented \npartisanship.\n  Six years later, the Democratic Party's dream of ObamaCare has become \nthe American people's nightmare. For the past 5 years, the American \npeople have lived with and have suffered through the chaos and \ndysfunction wrought by ObamaCare's assault on American health care. At \nevery step along the way, opposition to the law has grown stronger and \ncalls for its repeal by the American people have grown louder, which \nbrings us here today.\n  Last year Republicans running for Congress promised to repeal \nObamaCare as a first step toward replacing it with real health care and \nreal insurance reform. It was largely on the basis of this pledge that \nthe American people elected to put the GOP in charge of both the House \nof Representatives and the U.S. Senate. The bill we are scheduled to \nvote on later this week brings us as close to fulfilling that promise \nas is possible under the Senate rules, pursuant to the instructions \nfrom the budget resolution that Congress passed just a few months ago.\n  I applaud the majority leader for his steadfast leadership over the \npast several days and weeks, and I commend\n\n[[Page S8297]]\n\nthe Senate Budget Committee for its tireless efforts, as Republicans \nhave worked together to craft a reconciliation package that doesn't \njust tinker around the edges of ObamaCare but lays the groundwork for \nObamaCare to be erased from the books altogether. This is the only \nresponsible step for Congress to take because by the law's own \nstandards, according to the promises of the ideologues who imposed it \non an unwilling country, ObamaCare has been a failure.\n  As its name suggests, the overriding objective and promise of the \nAffordable Care Act was to make health care more affordable for \nAmericans. Yet, nearly 5 years after its passage, no one seriously \nclaims the law has made it easier or more affordable for the American \npeople to access the health care services they need. Facts are not \noptional, and the facts prove that quality, affordable health care is \nharder to find in America today than it was 6 years ago, especially for \nlow- and middle-income Americans.\n  With so much political and ideological capital invested in propping \nup and defending ObamaCare, President Obama and his allies here in \nCongress are forced to simply try to skirt the facts. Take, for \ninstance, the left's favorite half-truth--the notion that ObamaCare has \nsucceeded because there are fewer uninsured Americans today than before \nthe Affordable Care Act was signed in the law. But the other salient \nfact routinely omitted by the President and congressional Democrats is \nthat the vast majority of the newly insured receive their coverage \nthrough Medicaid. The reason ObamaCare supporters have made a habit of \nignoring this fact is obvious: For 50 years, Medicaid has served as the \npreeminent case study of how not to run a health insurance program. \nMedicaid's abysmal track record of failing our most vulnerable \npopulations will only get worse as millions of new, able-bodied adults \njoin the program.\n  Then there is the fact that in 2016, insurance premiums are set to \ncontinue their steep assent toward unaffordability. That goes for \ninsurance plans on the ObamaCare exchanges as well as commercial plans \npurchased in the private market.\n\n  ObamaCare supporters have long promised that rising premiums would be \nat worst a brief detour on the centrally planned road to affordable \nhealth care, but as it turns out the iron laws of economics have once \nagain triumphed over ideological wishful thinking. According to a \nsurvey of commercial insurance brokers conducted by Morgan Stanley, the \naverage rate hike in 2016 for individual insurance plans will be 12.6 \npercent--slightly higher than the 11.2-percent increase last year--and \nthe increase in small group rates will be 13.5 percent, up from a hike \nof 11.7 percent last year. So this creep continues. It keeps getting \nworse for the American people.\n  The outlook for insurance plans on the ObamaCare exchanges is just as \nbleak. Last month the Department of Health and Human Services announced \nthat insurance premiums will rise an additional 7.5 percent next year \nin the 37 States using the notoriously defective and flawed \nhealthcare.gov, and that is just the average, which obscures the more \ndramatic premium increases for residents in several States in \nparticular, such as Oklahoma and Alaska, both of which are projected to \nsee their ObamaCare premiums spike more than 30 percent next year.\n  Compounding the continued acceleration of premium hikes is the \nsimultaneous increase in deductibles and the narrowing of choices that \npatients face in the health care market. In my home State of Utah, for \ninstance, the residents of 20 out of my State's 29 counties are limited \nto only one health insurance plan option.\n  This toxic combination of rising health care costs and limited health \ncare choices has already had serious consequences, especially for low- \nand middle-income Americans who are most severely affected by the law \nand who are the least capable of dealing with adverse consequences. \nAccording to a recent Gallup poll, nearly one in three Americans report \nthat they or a family member have postponed or delayed medical \ntreatment within the past year because of the cost, and they are more \nlikely to have done so for a serious medical condition than for a \nmedical condition deemed nonserious. What is even more remarkable is \nthat the proportion of Americans who delay medical treatment because of \nthe cost has remained basically unchanged for the last decade, even as \nthe number of Americans with insurance coverage has increased. It is \nnot just patients who have found ObamaCare to be too expensive. \nInsurance providers are coming to the same conclusion. To date, half of \nthe 23 cooperatives created by ObamaCare collapsed despite receiving \nbillions of dollars of taxpayer subsidies. The shuttering of the once-\ncelebrated ObamaCare co-ops is not just a sign of the law's \nunsustainability, it is also a major source of the stress and anxiety \nthat millions of Americans are experiencing as a result of this \nunfortunate law.\n  Just ask the hundreds of thousands of Utahans who recently found out \nthat Arches Health Plan, a co-op that served roughly one-quarter of the \nState's exchange enrollees could not afford to stay in business next \nyear. The announcement came only 5 days before open enrollment began \nthis fall, leaving families across Utah scrambling to find a new plan \nand hoping they can afford it--like so many before them, the collateral \ndamage of the President's repeated broken promise that if you like your \nhealth care plan, you can keep it.\n  Then there was the recent warning from United Healthcare. United is \nthe Nation's largest health insurance provider. It was supposed to be \nbig enough and with enough efficiencies built into its operations to \nabsorb the new costs associated with doing business within the \nObamaCare regulatory framework. Yet just a few weeks ago, United \nannounced that the financial realities of its ObamaCare plans may soon \nforce the insurance giant to stop offering insurance plans through the \npublic exchanges.\n  The Affordable Care Act has been described by some of its supporters \nas a train wreck. It certainly looks that way as we watch hard truths \nand economic realities unravel the coalition of insurers that were once \ngreat champions of ObamaCare, but when you think about it, the term \n``train wreck'' isn't quite the right metaphor to describe the calamity \nthat is the Affordable Care Act. It misses the crucial point. Train \nwrecks are accidents, aberrations, anomalies. The failures of ObamaCare \nwere no such thing. They were entirely predictable. We knew they were \ncoming, despite the President's repeated assurances to the contrary.\n  There was nothing unexpected about the collapse of a national health \ncare pseudo market, governed by a perverse set of incentives and \nexemptions that encouraged young and healthy individuals to stay out of \nthe health insurance market. Now, nearly 5 years after its passage, \nthere is no denying the manifest failures of ObamaCare. The only \nquestion left is, What are we going to do about it?\n  For the Democratic Party, the answer is--as we have come to expect--\nmore of the same. Shield the ramshackle architecture and bloated \nbureaucracy of ObamaCare from any meaningful reform, and whenever \npossible double down--more ill-conceived and costly regulations, more \nFederal micromanagement of the health decisions of individuals, \nfamilies, doctors, hospitals, and insurance companies, more price \ncontrols, all peddled using the same hackneyed promises and \nproclamations of compassion and fairness that have nearly drowned out \nany honest discourse during the past 6 years regarding health care.\n  ObamaCare has given the American people a preview of this approach to \nhealth care policy, and they have emphatically rejected it, which is \nwhy the Senate will soon vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but \njust saying no is not by itself enough.\n  Conservatives and Republicans must also offer the country a health \ncare reform agenda to be for, something they can support affirmatively, \nproactively. Already there are a number of conservative leaders in \nCongress who have developed reform plans that would replace ObamaCare's \ncumbersome, bureaucratic, and expensive health care system with one \nthat is flexible, decentralized, and affordable. We must build on these \nplans and advance legislation that empowers patients and families--not \ndistant, coercive, powerful bureaucracies--to decide how they want to \nspend their health care dollars, and\n\n[[Page S8298]]\n\nthat encourages innovation and investment across all health care \nsectors. Repealing the Affordable Care Act is the first step in that \nprocess--the beginning, not the end of our road to building a market-\nbased, patient-centered health care system in America.\n  I look forward to joining my colleagues in voting to repeal ObamaCare \nand entering this new phase of health care reform. I thank my \ncolleagues who cooperated and worked together in developing this bill \nthat I wholeheartedly support.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. DAINES. Madam President, last year when I decided to run for \nMontana's open Senate seat, I promised the people of Montana I would \nwork tirelessly to repeal ObamaCare. I am upholding that promise. \nTomorrow the Senate will vote to repeal President Obama's broken health \ncare law because for many Montana families the President's health care \nlaw hasn't been what it was promised to be.\n  Too many Montanans have seen their work hours cut, have been forced \noff the plans they liked, and were told they couldn't see the doctors \nthey trusted. Health care premiums are not as affordable for Americans \nas President Obama claimed they would be. We are seeing premiums rising \nonce again. In Montana, folks who are purchasing plans from the \nObamaCare exchanges are getting hit with double-digit rate increases. \nMore than 40,000 Montanans are expected to receive notices that their \ninsurance rates have increased by double digits--an average of 34 \npercent for some plans. To put that into perspective, that is another \n$1,000 a year for a 40-year-old on one of Montana's silver plans.\n  Some Montanans have been hit with even higher rate increases. Take \nCindy from Missoula, MT, who received a letter from her health \ninsurance company that her premiums were increasing by 40 percent. \nUnfortunately, these rate hikes are the predictable result of forcing a \npartisan piece of legislation through Congress without transparent \nconsideration or bipartisan input. Sadly, those impacted the hardest by \nthese steep rate increases are often those who can least afford it.\n  Americans need access to affordable care, but ObamaCare not only \ntakes uninsured Americans in the wrong direction, it is failing to \nreliably provide the basic coverage Americans deserve. Look no further \nthan the health co-op system established under ObamaCare. All but one \nlost money in the last year--all but one. More than half have \ncollapsed, forcing more than 700,000 Americans to find new health \ninsurance options.\n  In 2007, President Obama said himself that by the end of his first \nterm ObamaCare would ``cover every American and cut the cost of a \ntypical family's premium by up to $2,500 a year.''\n  Montanans haven't seen their premiums decreased by $2,500 a year. It \nis not even close. Montanans are forced once again off the health care \nplans they liked and away from the doctors they trusted because when \nWashington, DC, bureaucrats take over a health care system, inevitably \nprices go up and the quality of care goes down. That is exactly what we \nhave seen happen with ObamaCare. After more than 5 years of this Obama \nexperiment, it is clear ObamaCare isn't working.\n  I grew up in Montana. Spending time outdoors is an important way of \nlife for us back home. I was fly fishing before Brad Pitt made it cool \nin the movie ``A River Runs Through It.'' When you are in one of \nMontana's blue-ribbon streams and your fishing line gets tangled up, \nyou have a couple different options. Sometimes you can take some time \nto untangle it and make another cast, but other times, your line gets \nso tangled up and knotted up that the best option is to cut the line \nand start over. It is time to cut the line on President Obama's failed \nhealth care law and tie on a new fly. That is what the Senate is going \nto do this week.\n  This bill dismantles President Obama's bungled health care law. It \nalso puts our States on a glide path away from ObamaCare. It will build \na bridge to replace this broken law with State-led solutions that put \npatients back in the center of the health care equation and return the \nhealth care decisions to Americans, to families, to their doctors and \naway from a bunch of DC bureaucrats. When we pass this historic \nlegislation tomorrow, it will be the first time an ObamaCare repeal \nbill will be on President Obama's desk for his signature. He is going \nto have to decide whether to put the American people first or if he \nwill continue imposing fines and substandard care on the hard-working \npeople of this country.\n  Even if the President rejects the will of the American people and \nvetoes this bill, I will continue working to protect Montanans from \nrising health care costs, and I will keep working to ensure that all \nAmericans receive the quality health care they deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, section 4305 of S. Con.

The authority to adjust is contingent on the \nlegislation not increasing the deficit over either the period of the \ntotal of fiscal years 2016-2020 or the period of the total of fiscal \nyears 2016-2025.\n  I find that Senate amendment 2874 fulfills the conditions of deficit \nneutrality found in sec. 4305 of S.

Madam President, I wish to submit to the Senate the budget \nscorekeeping report for December 2015. The report compares current law \nlevels of spending and revenues with the amounts provided in the \nconference report to accompany S. Con. Res. 11, the budget resolution \nfor fiscal year 2016. This information is necessary to determine \nwhether budget points of order lie against pending legislation. It has \nbeen prepared by the Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee \nand the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, pursuant to section 308(b) of \nthe Congressional Budget Act.\n  This is the fourth report I have made since adoption of the fiscal \nyear 2016 budget resolution on May 5, 2015. My last filing can be found \nin the Congressional Record on October 27, 2015. The information \ncontained in this report is current through November 30, 2015. This \nwill be the final scorekeeping report for calendar year 2015.\n  Table 1 gives the amount by which each Senate authorizing committee \nis below or exceeds its allocation under the budget resolution. This \ninformation is used for enforcing committee allocation pursuant to \nsection 302 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, CBA. Over the \nfiscal year 2016-2025 period, which is the entire period covered by S. \nCon. Res. 11, Senate authorizing committees have spent $3.3 billion \nless than the budget resolution calls for.\n  Table 2 gives the amount by which the Senate Committee on \nAppropriations is below or exceeds the statutory spending limits. This \ninformation is used to determine points of order related to the \nspending caps found in section 312 and section 314 of the CBA. While no \nfull-year appropriations bills have been enacted for fiscal year 2016, \nsubcommittees are charged with permanent and advanced appropriations \nthat first become available in that year.\n  Table 3 gives the amount by which the Senate Committee on \nAppropriations is below or exceeds its allocation for overseas \ncontingency operations/globaI war on terrorism, OCO/GWOT, spending. \nThis separate allocation for OCO/GWOT was established in section 3102 \nof S. Con. Res. 11 and is enforced using section 302 of the CBA. No \nbills providing funds with the OCO/GWOT designation on a full-year \nbasis have been enacted thus far for fiscal year 2016.\n  The budget resolution established two new points of order limiting \nthe use of changes in mandatory programs in appropriations bills, \nCHIMPS. Tables 4 and 5 show compliance with fiscal year 2016 limits for \noverall CHIMPS and the Crime Victims Fund CHIMP, respectively. This \ninformation is used for determining points of order under section 3103 \nand section 3104, respectively. No full-year bills have been enacted \nthus far for fiscal year 2016 that include CHIMPS.\n  In addition to the tables provided by the Senate Budget Committee \nRepublican staff, I am submitting additional tables from CBO that I \nwill use for enforcement of budget levels agreed to by the Congress.\n  For fiscal year 2016, CBO annualizes the effects of the Continuing \nAppropriations Act, P.L. 114-53, which provides funding through \nDecember 11, 2015. For the enforcement of budgetary aggregates, the \nSenate Budget Committee historically excludes this temporary funding. \nAs such, the current law levels are $882.6 billion and $521.6 billion \nbelow budget resolution levels for budget authority and outlays, \nrespectively. Revenues are $413 million above the level assumed in the \nbudget resolution. Finally, Social Security outlays are at the levels \nassumed in the budget resolution for fiscal year 2016, while Social \nSecurity revenues are $18 million above assumed levels for the budget \nyear.\n  CBO's report also provide information needed to enforce the Senate's \npay-as-you-go rule. The Senate's pay-as-you-go scorecard currently \nshows deficit reduction of $16.7 billion over the fiscal year 2015-2020 \nperiod and $77.5 billion over the fiscal year 2015-2025 period. Over \nthe initial 6-year period, Congress has enacted legislation that would \nincrease revenues by $12 billion and decrease outlays by $4.6 billion. \nOver the 11-year period, Congress has enacted legislation that would \nincrease revenues by $24.2 billion and decrease outlays by $53.3 \nbillion. The Senate's pay-as-you-go rule is enforced by section 201 of \nS. Con. Res. 21, the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution.\n  All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  TABLE 1.

Madam President, today I wish to honor a fellow veteran \nand colleague, Senator Joni Ernst, on her retirement from the Iowa \nNational Guard as a lieutenant colonel after 23 years of distinguished \nservice to our Nation.\n  Senator Ernst joined the U.S. Army Reserves as a second lieutenant \nupon her graduation from Iowa State University. After 9 years in the \nArmy Reserves, she transitioned to the Iowa National Guard to continue \nher dedicated service to this Nation. As a logistics specialist, \nSenator Ernst has held numerous positions of authority throughout her \ncareer, culminating in command of the 185th Combat Sustainment Support \nBattalion, the largest in the Iowa National Guard.\n  On February 10, 2003, while serving as commander of the Iowa National \nGuard's 1168th Transportation Company, Senator Ernst was called to \nActive Duty and deployed to Kuwait and Iraq in support of Operation \nIraqi Freedom. For 14 months, Senator Ernst and her fellow Guard \nmembers delivered vital supplies to coalition forces in support of the \nwar effort. Her combat service was a key element in enabling a highly \nmobile allied force to sustain combat operations.\n  While this chapter of her career has come to a close, Senator Ernst \ncontinues her dedication to service. As the first woman elected to \nCongress from Iowa and the first female combat veteran in the Senate, \nSenator Ernst has fought tenaciously for our military and veterans \nthrough her work on the Senate Armed Services Committee and on\n\n[[Page S8302]]\n\nlegislation she has authored and sponsored over this past year. I have \nno doubt that she will continue to be a strong voice for \nservicemembers, veterans, and their families in the years ahead.\n  Today I honor Lieutenant Colonel Ernst for her 23 years of dedicated \nservice to the U.S. Army Reserve and the Iowa National Guard. Her \nservice in support of this Nation has been exemplary--and her mission \ncontinues. I look forward to working with Senator Ernst for years to \ncome as we tackle the many challenges ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/senate-section/article/S8302-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SUPPORT FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I wish to speak today in support of \nPlanned Parenthood and express how heartbroken I am over last week's \nshooting in Colorado Springs. My thoughts are with the victims and \ntheir families. To experience such violence in a place dedicated to \nsaving lives is unthinkable.\n  I would also like to thank the staff of the clinic in Colorado \nSprings--and all Planned Parenthood clinics across the country. The \nhealth care services you provide are invaluable. You help so many \npeople, and you do it in the face of so many challenges. I am grateful \nfor your bravery and your compassion.\n  Following last week's attack, the media reported that staff rushed to \nthe clinic's safe room with their patients. Let me repeat: a health \nclinic with a safe room. That a clinic dedicated to helping women--many \nof whom have no other option for health care--needs a safe room is \nunbelievable.\n  I have been deeply troubled over the years by the toxic rhetoric \ntargeted at Planned Parenthood--and this dangerous rhetoric has only \nincreased in recent months. It sends a signal that using violence to \nintimidate health care professionals and shut down clinics is somehow \nacceptable.\n  Let me be clear: these actions are not acceptable. It is shameful and \ndisgusting and should be universally condemned. I do believe there is a \nlink between the poisonous rhetoric directed at these health care \nproviders and the violence used against them.\n  And I hope all of my colleagues in Congress--and every public \nofficial around the country--thinks carefully about the effects their \nwords can have.\n  An FBI intelligence assessment from September said, ``It is likely \ncriminal or suspicious incidents will continue to be directed against \nreproductive health care providers, their staff and facilities.'' These \nincidents aren't new.\n  Over the last 40 years, there have been more than 200 arsons and \nbombings at women's health care clinics. Doctors and health care staff \nhave been murdered. Since July, four Planned Parenthood facilities have \nbeen set on fire, including one in my home State of California. This \ntype of violence is simply abhorrent.\n  And I strongly believe these aren't just attacks on Planned \nParenthood and women's health; they are attacks on our way of life. \nThis isn't what our country stands for.\n  The individuals who carry out these crimes have one goal: to \nterrorize doctors, nurses, and clinic staff; to make them quit their \njobs; to force these health care clinics to close. They want to make it \nharder and harder for women to access reproductive health care and make \ntheir own health care choices.\n  In the wake of the Colorado Springs shooting, a former Planned \nParenthood worker from Kansas shared some of her experiences. In the 3 \nyears she worked at Planned Parenthood, there were four attempts to \nburn her clinic to the ground. Two cherry bombs were left at the door \nafter hours. They exploded and forced the clinic to close temporarily. \nWindows were shot out on three occasions. And butyric acid--essentially \na stink bomb--was put in the clinic's ventilation system numerous \ntimes. These aren't acts of political protest. These are serious \ncrimes, and the perpetrators must be prosecuted to the full extent of \nthe law.\n  Before I close, I would like to reiterate just how important Planned \nParenthood is for our country. Planned Parenthood serves some of the \nmost vulnerable women in our society. It cares for 2.7 million patients \nin the United States. Ninety-seven percent of Planned Parenthood \nservices carried out by its 700 clinics involve basic health care.\n  This includes breast exams, cervical cancer screenings, testing for \nsexually transmitted diseases, and contraception. One in five women \nwill use Planned Parenthood as their primary health care provider at \nsome point in their lives. Nationwide, 80 percent of Planned Parenthood \npatients make less than $18,000 per year. And Planned Parenthood is \noften the only health care option for low-income women and women in \nrural communities.\n  Simply put, Planned Parenthood is vital for the women of this \ncountry. It is bad enough that some politicians want to limit women's \nhealth care options by defunding Planned Parenthood. It is even more \ninexcusable that violence is being used to achieve what my Republican \ncolleagues have failed to do.\n  I stand with Planned Parenthood now more than ever. And I call for an \nend to the sickening campaign of violence against clinics nationwide. \nThank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/senate-section/article/S8302-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CHURCH PLAN CLARIFICATION ACT\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I am very pleased that the Senate may \nsoon consider bipartisan legislation which I recently introduced with \nSenators Portman and Klobuchar: the Church Plan Clarification Act of \n2015, S. 2308. By introducing this bill and asking for a unanimous \nconsent agreement regarding its passage, our goal is to ensure the \nretirement security of clergy, church lay workers, and their families \nacross the country.\n  The Church Plan Clarification Act addresses several unintended \nconsequences resulting from the application of general tax and pension \nregulations to the unique structures of church pension plans. Churches \nand synagogues established some of the first pension plans in the \ncountry, several dating back to the 18th century, and they are designed \nto ensure that our clergy and lay staff have adequate resources during \ntheir retirement years.\n  Church pensions are critically important compensation plans that help \nsupport over 1 million clergy members across the country in their \nretirement--particularly those who dedicated their careers to serving \nin economically disadvantaged congregations.\n  Church plans are often structured to reflect the ecclesiastical \nteachings of their denomination. The resulting diversity of plan \nstructures, coupled with the complexity of the legal and regulatory \nframework that applies to church plans, has led to the need for this \nlegislation. The bill would correct several technical issues that, \nwhile small, are critical to the functioning and operation of church \nplans and the retirement benefits they provide.\n  While the corrections contained in S. 2308 would be of tremendous \nhelp to church plans, I want to make clear that the bill does not \naffect the definition of ``church plan'' under the Internal Revenue \nCode or Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, ERISA. In \nparticular, no inference is intended by this legislation regarding the \nstatutory requirements a pension plan must meet to be considered or \ntreated as a ``church plan'' under IRC section 414(e) of the Internal \nRevenue Code and section 3(33) of ERISA, and the bill has no bearing on \nthe interpretation of those sections. Rather, the Church Plan \nClarification Act is simply about fixing the rules that govern how \nchurch plans operate and serve their participants.\n  Again, the Church Plan Clarification Act is targeted, \nnoncontroversial, and has broad bipartisan and bicameral support. I \nhope we can work quickly to provide clarity for these plans by enacting \nthis legislation and thereby ensuring that those who dedicate their \nlives to religious service are not inappropriately and unfairly \ndisadvantaged.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/senate-section/article/S8302-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8302-S8303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                    PRIVATE CHRISTOPHER J.

Madam President, I wish to honor the life of Anita Ashok \nDatar--a loving mother, beloved daughter and sister, and dedicated \nhumanitarian from Takoma Park in my home State of Maryland. She was one \nof 19 victims killed on November 20 in a terrorist attack in Mali.\n  Anita's life was one of service to others, both at home and abroad. \nShe was born in Massachusetts and raised in Flanders, NJ. Her friends \nand classmates remember her as kind and smart, ``one of the good \nones.'' After she graduated from Rutgers University, she served as a \nPeace Corps volunteer in Senegal--the beginning of her career helping \nthe world's most disadvantaged.\n  From there, she went back to school to obtain master's degrees in \npublic health and public administration and began her work improving \nthe lives of the poorest as a global health professional with expertise \nin reproductive health, family planning, and HIV prevention and \ntreatment. Ms. Datar spent over a decade working on critical \ndevelopment projects in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia.\n  As my colleagues know, Mali has been in turmoil for several years. It \nis the location of the world's most dangerous peacekeeping mission. \nDespite the presence of a United Nations peacekeeping mission and a \nFrench-led military operation, terrorists have continued to carry out \nperiodic attacks on Malians and foreigners.\n  Despite these dangers, Ms. Datar, who was serving as a senior \ndirector for field programs at Palladium, went to Mali as a U.S. Agency \nfor International Development contractor to help those in need. Her \ndedication to seeing that vulnerable populations are not forgotten, \noverlooked, or marginalized epitomizes public service, and it \nexemplifies the best of American values and ideals. For that, she will \nalways be remembered.\n  The attack on the Radisson Blu Hotel in Bamako was nothing more than \na senseless act undertaken by people who have no compassion and clearly \nno regard for human life. We cannot and will not let actions like this \nstop us from pursuing the mission that people like Anita Datar are so \npassionate about: improving the lives of the poorest of the poor.\n  There is no better way to honor her legacy than to continue to help \nthe needy, the disenfranchised, and those at risk both here at home and \naround the world.\n  Anita is survived by her 7-year-old son, a brother, her parents, and \ncountless friends and colleagues. In addition to offering our \ncondolences, we must commit to continuing her work and remembering the \nsacrifices that she and countless other development workers make each \nand every day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/senate-section/article/S8303-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING KATE ROGERS McCARTHY\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I rise today to honor a distinguished \nOregonian who made it her life's work to protect many of Oregon's and \nthe Nation's most beautiful and majestic natural places. On November 3, \nKate Rogers McCarthy, a lifelong conservationist, activist, and friend, \npassed away in her hometown of Parkdale, OR. Born in 1917 adjacent to \nthe snow-capped peaks of Mount Hood in Parkdale, Kate spent most of her \nlife in awe of the natural beauty that surrounded her. Kate drew from \nthat passion as she worked to preserve many of Oregon's most iconic \noutdoor spaces, eventually taking on many leadership roles in \nconservation groups at the State and national levels.\n  Growing up with the wilderness of Mount Hood as her backyard, Kate \nlearned the value of nature and the importance of protecting our \nnatural treasures. By the time she was in high school, Kate and her \nyounger sister Betty ran an outdoor recreation camp for girls on the \nfamily property that introduced those girls to the beauty of Mount \nHood. Kate attended Reed College, Yale Nursing School, and the \nUniversity of Oregon Medical School. After earning her degrees and with \nnew commercial development threatening the preservation of the Mount \nHood wilderness, Kate began her lifelong campaign to preserve the lands \nshe loved.\n  In the mid-1970s, with development rapidly expanding into wild areas \nnear Mount Hood, Kate and a group of Parkdale residents began a \ncampaign to encourage county representatives to vote on zoning options. \nThanks to her diligence and that of the other residents, the county \nvoted to protect agricultural zones. Agricultural zoning still protects \nfarmland in the upper valley today. In 1977, Kate gathered a few \nfriends and founded the Hood River Valley Residents Committee. The \ncommittee grew to 1,200 members under Kate's leadership and continues \nto protect the natural spaces that are so unique to Oregon.\n  A tireless advocate and conservationist, Kate was involved in a \nmultitude of other conservation groups as well. She served as a member \nof the Oregon Natural Resources Council, what is now Oregon Wild; the \nBoard of the Oregon Environmental Council; and Friends of the Columbia \nGorge. She was also a charter member of 1000 Friends of Oregon. To \nmotivate still greater involvement by citizens in the protection of \nMount Hood, Kate helped form Friends of Mount Hood, a nonprofit \norganization dedicated to protecting the alpine meadows, wetlands, \nwildlife, and forests of Mount Hood by working with the Forest Service \nand the Oregon congressional delegation.\n  In 2002, Kate McCarthy was recognized as a Women of Distinction \nhonoree by the soroptimists of Hood River for making a difference in \nthe lives of women and girls in her local community. She also received \nthe highest award given by the Mazamas Mountaineering Club, becoming \nonly the 41st person given the top award since the club's founding in \n1894. For several years, Kate worked closely with local organizations, \nas well as my office, to protect the north side of Mount Hood and \nCooper Spur from a massive destination resort in the Hood River Valley. \nAfter years of hard-fought battles, Congress passed the Mount Hood \nWilderness bill. The bill protects the more than 200,000 acres of \nwilderness and rivers in the Hood River Valley, an accomplishment I am \nproud to have been a part of.\n  Because of Kate's lifetime of work to protect some of our most \nbeautiful wetlands, forests, wildlife, and farms, she has given \nOregonians and people from around the world opportunities to experience \nOregon's natural splendor for generations to come. Kate McCarthy, a \nmother, grandmother, great grandmother, friend, and advocate of the \nnatural beauty around her, deserves the utmost appreciation for a life \nfully lived. I honor the prolific life and career of Kate Rodgers \nMcCarthy and express my gratitude for her everlasting impact on our \nState and Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/senate-section/article/S8303-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8303-S8304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO DR. KATHARINE BLODGETT GEBBIE\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I wish to pay tribute to Dr. Katharine \nBlodgett Gebbie, the past director of the National Institute of \nStandards and Technology's--NIST--Physics Laboratory and its successor, \nthe Physical Measurement Laboratory. On December 10, 2015, the \nPrecision Measurement Laboratory at NIST's Boulder campus will be \nformally renamed in honor of Dr. Gebbie, the first time in more than 50 \nyears that a major NIST building has been named for an individual. This \nincredible recognition underscores and celebrates Dr. Gebbie's 45 years \nof service to NIST and her contributions on behalf of the scientific \ncommunity and our Nation.\n  At a time when a much smaller percentage of women were a part of the\n\n[[Page S8304]]\n\nAmerican workforce and pursued advanced academic degrees, Dr. Gebbie \nreceived an undergraduate degree in physics from Bryn Mawr. She went on \nto receive a B.S. in astronomy and a Ph.D. in physics from University \nCollege London. She began her career in 1966 by doing astrophysics \nresearch at the Joint Institute for Lab Physics--JILA--a cooperative \nenterprise between the University of Colorado at Boulder and NIST. She \nlater joined NIST as a physicist in 1968, working in the quantum \nphysics division of JILA.\n  Dr. Gebbie's ascent into a leadership role began in 1981, when she \nwas named as a scientific assistant at the National Measurement \nLaboratory. In 1983, she became a program analyst for then-NIST \nDirector Ernest Ambler and his deputy, Ray Kammer. In 1985, Dr. Ambler \nappointed Dr. Gebbie as the chief of JILA's quantum physics division, \nand in 1989, she was named as acting director of the new NIST Center \nfor Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics at NIST's main facility, in \nGaithersburg, MD.\n  From there, Dr. Gebbie's responsibilities only grew, reflecting her \noutstanding leadership, effective integration of emerging technologies, \nand unwavering dedication to the team of scientists and engineers who \nserved under her. In 1990, Dr. Gebbie was named as the founding \ndirector of NIST's physics laboratory, which merged elements of five \npredecessor facilities based in Maryland and Colorado. Under her \nmanagement, the NIST physics laboratory flourished. Her extensive \nsupport for her staff in the form of increased funding, encouragement, \nand logistical support contributed to an overall environment of \nscientific freedom, creativity, and innovation. The physics \nlaboratory's scientific advances under her directorship are too \nnumerous to recount here. Chief among them were progress in atomic \nclock technology, nanotechnology, advanced research on ultra-cold \nmatter, and Bose-Einstein condensation--all of which prompted \ndevelopments in a variety of scientific fields and helped to further \nestablish NIST's status as ``America's laboratory.''\n  Out of this atmosphere, an impressive four physicists in Dr. Gebbie's \norganizational unit--Bill Phillips, Jan Hall, Eric Cornell, and David \nWineland--were awarded Nobel prizes between 1997 and 2012. Other \nscientists honored under her leadership include MacArthur Fellowship \nwinners Debbie Jin and Ana Maria Rey and International Union of Pure & \nApplied Physics--IUPAP--Young Scientist Prize winners Till Rosenband, \nIan Spielman, Jacob Taylor, and Gretchen Campbell.\n  Among Dr. Gebbie's greatest contributions to the scientific community \ninclude her early promotion of the internet as a means of sharing \nscientific data at NIST through the laboratory's Electronic Commerce in \nScientific & Engineering Data program and her support of a broad range \nof NIST initiatives and external programming like the Center for \nNanoscale Science & Technology and the Joint Quantum Institute, a \nresearch partnership between the University of Maryland and NIST, \nfounded in 2006.\n  Perhaps the most enduring aspect of Dr. Gebbie's legacy, however, \nwill be the programs she pioneered to support diversity and her \ntireless efforts to promote the inclusion of women and minorities in \nso-called STEM--science, technology, engineering, and mathematics--\nfields around the country. In 1993, NIST implemented the Summer \nUndergraduate Research Fellowships--SURF--program, aimed at integrating \nunder-represented minorities into the laboratory, allowing students to \nparticipate in the cutting-edge scientific and mathematical research at \nNIST. The program has since expanded to every NIST laboratory and is \njointly funded by the National Science Foundation.\n  For her contributions to the scientific community and to the Nation, \nDr. Gebbie has been recognized with numerous accolades, including the \nWomen in Science & Engineering Lifetime Achievement Award, the \nPresidential Rank Awards for Meritorious Senior Executives, the \nPartnership for Public Service's Samuel J. Heyman Service to America \nCareer Achievement Award, the Women in Science & Engineering WISE \nAward, and two Department of Commerce gold medals. She also serves as a \nfellow of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences, a fellow of the \nAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science, a fellow of the \nAmerican Physical Society, a fellow of the Washington Academy of \nSciences, and she previously participated in the 2nd IUPAP \nInternational Conference on Women in Physics.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting Dr. Gebbie and in \ncelebrating her legacy as one of the American scientific community's \ntrailblazers. Her work will undoubtedly open the doors for countless \nscientists to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/senate-section/article/S8304-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MATTHEW BROWN\n\n Mr. BARRASSO.

Res. 324\n\n       Whereas phenylketonuria is a rare, inherited metabolic \n     disorder that is characterized by the inability of the body \n     to process the essential amino acid phenylalanine and which \n     causes intellectual disability and other neurological \n     problems, such as memory loss and mood disorders, when \n     treatment is not started within the first few weeks of life;\n       Whereas phenylketonuria is also referred to as ``PKU'' or \n     Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Deficiency;\n       Whereas newborn screening for PKU was initiated in the \n     United States in 1963 and was recommended for inclusion in \n     State newborn screening programs under the Newborn Screening \n     Saves Lives Act of 2007 (Public Law 110-204);\n       Whereas approximately 1 out of every 15,000 infants in the \n     United States is born with PKU;\n       Whereas PKU is treated with medical food;\n       Whereas the 2012 Phenylketonuria Scientific Review \n     Conference affirmed the recommendation of lifelong dietary \n     treatment for PKU made by the National Institutes of Health \n     Consensus Development Conference Statement 2000;\n       Whereas in 2014, the American College of Medical Genetics \n     and Genomics and Genetic Metabolic Dieticians International \n     published medical and dietary guidelines on the optimal \n     treatment of PKU;\n       Whereas medical foods are medically necessary for children \n     and adults living with PKU;\n       Whereas adults with PKU who discontinue treatment are at \n     risk for serious medical issues such as depression, impulse \n     control disorder, phobias, tremors, and pareses;\n       Whereas women with PKU must maintain strict metabolic \n     control before and during pregnancy to prevent fetal damage;\n       Whereas children born from untreated mothers with PKU may \n     have a condition known as ``maternal phenylketonuria \n     syndrome'', which can cause small brains, intellectual \n     disabilities, birth defects of the heart, and low birth \n     weights;\n       Whereas although there is no cure for PKU, treatment \n     involving medical foods, medications, and restriction of \n     phenylalanine intake can prevent progressive, irreversible \n     brain damage;\n       Whereas access to health insurance coverage for medical \n     food varies across the United States and the long-term costs \n     associated with caring for untreated children and adults with \n     PKU far exceed the cost of providing medical food treatment;\n       Whereas gaps in medical foods coverage have a detrimental \n     impact on individuals with PKU, their families, and society;\n       Whereas scientists and researchers are hopeful that \n     breakthroughs in PKU research will be forthcoming;\n       Whereas researchers across the United States are conducting \n     important research projects involving PKU; and\n       Whereas the Senate is an institution that can raise \n     awareness of PKU among the general public and the medical \n     community: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates December 3, 2015, as ``National \n     Phenylketonuria Awareness Day'';\n       (2) encourages all people in the United States to become \n     more informed about phenylketonuria and the role of medical \n     foods in treating phenylketonuria; and\n       (3) respectfully requests that the Secretary of the Senate \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the National PKU \n     Alliance, a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving the \n     lives of individuals with phenylketonuria.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/senate-section/article/S8307-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8307-S8308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 325--PERMITTING THE COLLECTION OF CLOTHING, TOYS, \nFOOD, AND HOUSEWARES DURING THE HOLIDAY SEASON FOR CHARITABLE PURPOSES \n                          IN SENATE BUILDINGS\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON (for himself and Mr. Blumenthal) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, promises, promises, promises. Day in and\n\n[[Page S8320]]\n\nday out, I hear stories of the broken promises of the President's \nfailed health care law in Iowa and across the country.\n  President Obama promised health insurance premiums would go down by \n$2,500. They haven't. In fact, the President's own administration \nadmits that nationwide, premiums in the exchange for the next year have \nincreased by more than 7 percent. The outlook for my State is even \nworse, with Iowans facing more than a 12-percent increase in premiums.\n  President Obama's promises don't pay these bills. Real folks in Iowa \nand across the country do.\n  Mark from Urbandale shared with me that the double-digit premium \nincreases his family faces for 2016 are unsustainable and that it may \nbe more cost effective to pay the individual mandate penalty instead.\n  Similarly, Angela from Centerville said that the plan she had hoped \nto purchase for 2016 increased by nearly $200, and that was the \ncheapest option for her. If she keeps her current coverage, her family \nwill be strapped with a nearly $1,000-per-month bill for health \ninsurance. She asks: ``How is it possible that the Affordable Care Act \nhas made health care so unaffordable?''\n  Let me say that again: How is it possible that the Affordable Care \nAct has made health care so unaffordable?\n  It is a question I get when traveling all across the State of Iowa. \nThe answer is pretty simple. ObamaCare is wrongly rooted in a \nWashington-knows-best mentality. Instead of empowering families and \nindividuals to determine what they want and need in their health care \nplans, Washington has replaced choice with new one-size-fits-all \nmandates and taxes. It is another costly example of the Washington way \nfailing everyday Americans.\n  The sad reality is that the consequences of this failed law go far \nbeyond these unaffordable premium increases. Americans were promised \njob creation and economic growth, but instead we have seen employers \nreduce employee hours in an effort to avoid ObamaCare's employer \nmandate.\n  Small businesses, such as employers at a marina in Okoboji, have \nhalted their plans to expand and create new jobs because of the \nmandate. They have even quit hiring folks to fill open jobs and had to \ncut back on hours for their existing employees to bring them to part \ntime.\n  As employers brace themselves for the impending Cadillac tax, \nemployees are already feeling the effects: rapidly increasing out-of-\npocket costs. In fact, Ryan, from Newton, recently learned that his \ndeductible will be doubling next year in anticipation of the tax going \ninto effect.\n\n  ObamaCare is not helping these folks; it is hurting them. At a time \nwhen we want to see job growth and rising wages, this is simply the \nwrong approach. Broken promises don't cut it.\n  Today we have the opportunity to roll back some of ObamaCare's most \nharmful provisions. Today we can provide much needed relief from the \nindividual and employer mandates and stop the law's trillion dollars in \ntax hikes--like the health insurance tax, the medical device tax, and \nthe Cadillac tax--from being passed on to the American people. Today we \ncan put patients and doctors back in the driver's seat when it comes to \ntheir health care decisionmaking.\n  Today I will stand up for Iowans and people all across America to \nfulfill our promise to them. I am committed to stopping this failed law \nand paving the way to implement patient-centered options that ensure \nfolks have affordable coverage and access to needed health care \nservices.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, last year the Presiding Officer and I and \na number of us went out to the folks in our great States and we \npromised that if we were elected into a majority, we would do \neverything we could to repeal and replace ObamaCare. The process the \nAmerican people are going to witness over the next 24 hours is our \nfulfillment of that promise.\n  It will take 51 votes to send a bill to the President's desk that \nrepeals the most egregious provisions of ObamaCare. Once we do that, we \ncan begin to start the process of addressing the legitimate health care \nproblems instead of an option that has made the problems worse. It is a \nsystem that will control costs and put patients first. It is a system \nthat puts choice first. It is a system that puts quality ahead of \npartisan politics.\n  This will be an open process that we will go through tomorrow, and \nthat is the way it should be. That means it will require some tough \nvotes. Many of my friends on the right may not particularly like or \nenjoy the amendments that will be offered and then voted on, but I, for \none, when confronted with a vote I may otherwise like to support--if I \nfeel it prevents us from moving forward and being successful in sending \nthis bill to the President's desk, then I am prepared to make those \ntough votes to be absolutely certain we fulfill that fundamental \npromise of repealing ObamaCare.\n  However, in the end, this is about doing everything we can to keep \nour promise to the American people. While we in Congress will put our \nconscience over politics--if we do--the President seems to put politics \nover what I believe he and many of my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle know is a failed policy. This is exactly the underlying \nfailure of ObamaCare. It was a never-ending list of promises and \nassurances that have not and never will be realized.\n  We all remember the same promise we heard over and over again from \nthe President: If you like your health care, you can keep it. If you \nlike your doctors, you can keep them. That has absolutely not happened \nin my great State of North Carolina, and I would daresay it hasn't \nhappened across the Nation. Millions of Americans were kicked off their \nplans and given a set of alternatives that were drastically more \nexpensive. They were told they could no longer see the doctors they had \nvisited and trusted for years.\n  In North Carolina alone, we had over 470,000 cancellation notices. \nWhen they promised that if you liked your health care plan, you could \nkeep it, there was a little asterisk there, and the asterisk was, you \ncan keep it if the Federal Government determines that a policy you are \nsatisfied with, they are satisfied with. That is how they say they kept \ntheir promise, but it was an empty promise and they haven't kept it.\n  We also remember the President's promises to make health care more \naffordable, boasting that ObamaCare would reduce premiums by $2,500. \nThat hasn't happened either. In North Carolina, during the first full \nyear of the exchange rollout, premium prices increased and outpaced the \nincreases in wages and inflation. The average home is spending more on \nhealth care and getting less in their paycheck.\n  The premium prices in the individual insurance market increased by \n147 percent--147 percent. This leads to the problem of people having \ninsurance they can't afford to use because they can't afford their \ndeductible or their copay. It has created real-life horror stories of \nfamilies struggling to make the choice between paying for their health \ncare and paying to keep food on their table.\n  Last month I received a letter from a North Carolina couple nearing \nretirement who are lifelong small business owners. These are their \nwords:\n\n       Last year, our premiums for a bare bones policy was nearly \n     $1,000 a month. It is a terrible policy, but nothing else was \n     available within our budget. I received the 2016 rate late \n     last Friday. The premium is going up 40 percent.\n\n  So now that $1,000-a-month policy will cost them $1,400 a month with \na higher deductible.\n  The letter continues:\n\n       For the first time in my adult life we may have to forgo \n     having health insurance and take our chances.\n\n  I received another letter from another North Carolinian. He wrote:\n\n       I'm a self-employed person barely making ends meet. My wife \n     works 60 hours a week. We might take home close to $40,000 a \n     year. We have done our best to make it on our own with no \n     government assistance. Back in 2008, the company I worked for \n     shut down. Since then, we have gone through all our life \n     savings to make ends meet. When I first started buying our \n     health insurance in 2008, our premiums were around $600 for \n     me and my two daughters. Just received our letter and found \n     out our new premium will jump to $1,700 a month.\n\n  These stories are heartbreaking, and they are not unique to North \nCarolina.\n\n[[Page S8321]]\n\nI know each and every Senator, whether they support ObamaCare or want \nto repeal it, has received similar stories from constituents \nchronicling how ObamaCare has caused them immeasurable financial and \nemotional hardship and no better access to affordable health care.\n  I can tell you that with nearly every one of these letters and calls \nto my office I receive, my constituents also express their desire for \nCongress to vote for repeal of the ObamaCare law. It has caused so much \npain, and it hasn't solved any problems. That is exactly what the \nSenate is going to do tomorrow. We are going to keep our word--\nsomething I think sometimes citizens feel we just don't do enough of up \nhere in this Chamber. We are going to send a bill to the President's \ndesk that repeals the most egregious portions of ObamaCare.\n  Keep in mind that many of the bad things that will occur with \nObamaCare are not even in place today. If you don't like it now, I \nguarantee you will not like it next year even more so.\n  Again, I want to get back to the process for a minute. This process \nwe are going through is one of the unique instances where we can pass a \nbill and send it to the President's desk with 51 votes. Normally it \ntakes 60. In order for us to be able to pass it with 51 votes, it is \ngoing to require us to be very strict in terms of what this bill may or \nmay not have in it. There are going to be games played tomorrow. There \nwill be amendments put out there that Members know would prevent us \nfrom being able to send this bill to the President's desk.\n  I, for one, am going to stand with the leadership, who I appreciate \nhaving the courage to bring this bill forward and make sure that we \ntake votes and send this bill--a fulfillment of my promise to the \ncitizens of North Carolina--to the President's desk. And to those who \nvote against it, Americans, take notice because they are not listening \nto you. They are not reading the letters and hearing the stories I hear \nevery single day, and they should be held accountable when they are \nnext up for reelection.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair for his time today, and I yield the \nfloor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/02/senate-section/article/S8321-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8321]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
