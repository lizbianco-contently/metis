Mr. President, I was glad to see Senators in both \nparties vote to advance the FAA Reauthorization Act yesterday. We will \nnow continue our work to pass this bipartisan legislation that will \nsupport American jobs. It will also enhance safety and security \nmeasures to help protect travelers in our airports and in the skies. It \nwill look out for consumers' interests by providing more information on \nthings such as seat availability and baggage fees. It will maintain \nrural access and promote American manufacturing as well. That is what \nthe FAA bill before us will do. Here is what it won't do: It won't \nraise taxes or fees on airline passengers or enact heavyhanded \nregulations that could diminish choices or services for travelers.\n  I appreciate the diligent work of Chairman Thune and Senator Ayotte, \nthe chair of the committee's aviation panel, as well as that of their \nDemocratic counterparts, Senators Nelson and Cantwell.\n  The FAA Reauthorization Act has been a bipartisan effort from the \nvery start. Let's keep working together in the same spirit today. I \nurge colleagues to work with the bill managers to process amendments, \nif they have them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/07/senate-section/article/S1775-8", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1775-S1776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, President Obama will fly to Chicago, \nwhere he will try to convince Americans that, despite his own actions \nwhile in the Senate to deny a Supreme Court nominee a vote, the \nConstitution somehow now requires the Senate to have a vote on his \nnominee no matter what, and thereby deny the American people a voice in \nthe future of the Supreme Court. In the words of the Washington Post's \nFact Checker, he will be ``telling supporters a politically convenient \nfairy tale.'' That is the Washington Post. I am sure he will gloss over \nthe fact that the decision about filling this pivotal seat could impact \nour country for decades, that it could dramatically affect the most \ncherished constitutional rights, such as those contained in the First \nand Second Amendments. I am sure he will continue to demand that \nWashington spend its time fighting on one issue where we don't agree \nrather than working together on issues where we do. I am sure he will \nspend some time refuting the words of his own Vice President. I am sure \nhe will repeatedly claim that his nominee is ``moderate''--not that he \nmeans it; it is just a useful piece of spin that has been dutifully \nechoed across the spans of the left and in the media for years.\n  Consider the recent Democratic Supreme Court nominees. One Washington \nPost columnist hailed the ``moderate'' record of President Obama's \nfirst pick to the Supreme Court. One New York newspaper proclaimed his \nsecond nominee a ``pragmatic centrist.'' When President Clinton made \nhis Supreme Court nominations, the Post declared one a--you guessed \nit--``moderate,'' and the New York Times practically fell all over \nitself exalting the ``resolutely centrist'' style of the other. That \nlast nominee--who said it would be a good idea to abolish Mother's Day, \nby the way--was not just firmly centrist, not\n\n[[Page S1776]]\n\njust decisively centrist, but resolutely centrist, in the Times' \nopinion. The records of every one of these Supreme Court Justices have \nbeen anything--anything--but moderate or centrist in the years since. \nThey have been resolutely leftwing. But that is the point. ``Moderate'' \nisn't exactly a true descriptor for Democratic Supreme Court nominees; \nit is just burned into the printing presses of the editorial boards.\n  Yet, even the New York Times has had to admit that President Obama's \ncurrent nominee would give Americans the most leftwing Supreme Court in \n50 years--in 50 years. That is why the far left is squarely behind \nPresident Obama's campaign to deny the American people a say in this \nmomentous decision.\n  The American people understand what is at stake. The administration \ndoesn't want the American people messing this up for them, and they \nwill say what they always say to get what they want today: a far-left \nSupreme Court for decades to come. That is just one more reason why the \nAmerican people are lucky to have a Judiciary chairman like Senator \nGrassley in their corner. Senator Grassley is passionate about giving \nthe people of this country a voice in such a critical conversation. He \nhas stood strong for the people throughout this debate, and he has \nproven himself a dedicated legislator throughout this new majority, \nwith yet another Judiciary Committee-passed bill clearing the Senate on \na bipartisan basis just this week. He understands that we don't need to \nget stuck fighting about one issue. He understands that we can let the \nAmerican people have their voices heard on this matter while the Senate \ncontinues doing its work on important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/07/senate-section/article/S1776-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             REMEMBERING STEPHANIE AND JUSTIN MOORE SHULTS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I agree with the Republican leader that it \nis important that we get the FAA bill done as soon as possible, but I \nwould just have everyone reflect--when we were in the majority, we \ntried to bring up the FAA bill, and that went on for weeks and weeks, \nwith unnecessary filibusters. The FAA came to a screeching halt.\n  As we have said, if you are a responsible minority, you work to get \nthings done. That is what we have done. We have worked hard with the \nmajority to come up with an FAA bill we can support. So I hope everyone \nunderstands that obstruction doesn't work. We understand that. That is \nwhy we have tried to be as collegial as we can be on legislation.\n  I just finished my ``Welcome to Washington'' this morning. A little \nboy asked me: How do you get things done?\n  I said: Well, you know, things in Congress are done just like in \nlife. I have had the good fortune in my time in public service, my time \nin Congress, to be able to have things with my name on them, bills that \nhave passed, but I have never ever gotten something that I wanted--it \nwas always a compromise. We always have had to compromise to get \nsomething passed.\n  Frankly, that is the way life is. Life is a time where we work with \npeople to try to get along to work things out. That is the way things \nused to be done here, but with the untoward obstruction during the \nObama years, it has been difficult to get things done.\n  So I agree that the FAA bill is something we need to pass. As I have \nsaid, we are constructively working with the Republicans--those on the \nother side of the aisle--to get things done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/07/senate-section/article/S1776-4", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1776-S1777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we can play around all we want with the \nSupreme Court and what the Constitution says or doesn't say, but we \nknow that the Constitution says that the President shall--not may, but \nshall--nominate Supreme Court Justices. He has an obligation. He has to \ndo that. The Constitution is also very affirmative: There has to be \nadvice and consent. That is what we are instructed in the Constitution.\n  It is a little strange how we can have from the Republicans advice \nand consent when the vast majority of the Republicans won't even meet \nwith the man. They refuse to hold hearings and certainly to have a \nvote.\n  So I don't know how anyone is reading the Constitution, but we need \nto do our job. We are not doing our job when we don't hold hearings and \nhave a vote. We shouldn't be here talking about Supreme Court nominees \nbeing far left or far right or moderate.\n  To show how off track this has gotten, 2 days ago the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, the senior Senator from Iowa, gave a speech here. \nGuess who he was attacking. Justice Roberts, the Chief Justice of the \nSupreme Court. He said to the Chief Justice: Heal yourself. The Chief \nJustice. Is there anyone in the world--anyone in the United States, \nanyone in the legal field, anyone in the political field--who thinks he \nis some kind of crazy liberal, John Roberts, who worked on the court \nwith Merrick Garland? They wrote opinions together. They agreed almost \n90 percent of the time on their opinions.\n  So it is really too bad that now we are here with a Supreme Court \nJustice--for the first time in the history of the country, because we \nare in the final year of a Presidency, we are not going to do anything. \nWe are going to wait. In the meantime, justice will be delayed. We have \nalready had a significant number of tied, 4-to-4 decisions by the \nCourt, and, using the logic of the Republicans, this is going to go on \nfor another 18 months. So it is unfortunate that this has turned into \nsomething that has never happened before.\n  They go back and keep repeating: The Biden rule. The Biden rule. The \nBiden rule.\n  The year he gave that speech--and he gave a speech at Georgetown \nUniversity just a week ago saying: Read my speech. Read the whole \nthing.\n  And what was the result of his action as chairman of the committee \nthat year? He brought nominations to the floor even though they didn't \nget enough votes in the committee to be reported. The nominees lost in \nthe Judiciary Committee, but Biden brought them here anyway.\n  There was an op-ed written by one of my predecessors, former \nDemocratic leader George Mitchell, a stunningly good Senator from \nMaine. He wrote that 2 days ago. It appeared in a Boston newspaper. He \nsaid that when Clarence Thomas came before the Senate, he had lost in \nthe committee. He didn't get enough votes to be reported out of the\n\n[[Page S1777]]\n\ncommittee. Biden reported him out anyway: Bring him to the floor. Let's \nhave a debate.\n  That is what Senator Mitchell talked about. We had a debate. And he \nhad pressure. It wasn't tremendous, but he had pressure. People asked: \nWhy don't you filibuster him? He said: I am not going to filibuster. \nLet's have a vote, and that is the way it used to be done. He had 52 \nvotes. Could that have been stopped? Of course. Would the Court have \nbeen better? Observers can make the determination themselves as to \nwhether we would be better off without Clarence Thomas on that Court. \nBut the fact is he could have been stopped easily, and it wasn't done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/07/senate-section/article/S1777-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1777-S1778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   PROTECTING AMERICA'S PUBLIC LANDS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am gratified that the Presiding Officer \ntoday is from the State of Nevada--my friend, the junior Senator from \nNevada. When I think of home, I think of the desert, and you can't talk \nabout Nevada as a desert only, even though the vast majority of the \nState of Nevada is a very arid place. Nevada also has beautiful Sierra \nNevada--the Ruby Mountains. We are the most mountainous State in the \nUnion except for Alaska. We have 314 separate mountain ranges. We have \n32 mountains over 11,000 feet high. We have one mountain that we share \nwith California that is almost 14,000 feet high. It is a beautiful \nState, but today I am going to focus on some of those arid places--the \nplace where I was born and raised.\n  Having been back here such a long time--37 years--I often think of \nthe blue skies in Nevada. They hover over a beautiful canvas. No one \ncan paint a picture as beautiful as these mountains, which are in the \nmiddle of the desert, Joshua trees, or sagebrush. It is that beauty \nthat is drawing thousands of visitors to Nevada and Nevada's wilderness \nevery year.\n  Yesterday, the Reno Gazette-Journal had a tremendous article that \nreported just how important this quiet recreational industry is to our \ncountry. They said:\n\n       The big time solitude found in the big empty spaces of the \n     western U.S. generates big money for regional economies. \n     That's according to a study that attempts to put a dollar \n     value on ``quiet recreation'' on Bureau of Land Management \n     property.\n\n  That is an editorial comment by me: ``quiet recreation.'' People are \nnow biking, packing, and camping. Quiet is what is referred to as when \nthere are no motorized vehicles.\n  To continue the quote:\n\n       It found that sports like hiking and mountain biking on BLM \n     land generated more than $1.8 billion in spending in 2014, \n     that's roughly equivalent to two months of gambling revenue \n     in Las Vegas casinos.\n\n  Our public lands are jewels that we must protect. To its credit, the \nBureau of Land Management--when I was first elected here, the BLM was \nthe hiss and cry of government. They were on par with the Internal \nRevenue Service. No one liked them, but now they are admired. They have \ndone a remarkably good job in taking care of public lands. As I said, \nto their credit, the BLM and their dedicated employees do a remarkable \njob in safeguarding these national treasures so that all Americans can \nenjoy them.\n  John Sterling, the executive director of The Conservation Alliance, \ntold the Reno Gazette-Journal:\n\n       The BLM is the final frontier for a primitive experience on \n     our public lands. They represent the future of outdoor \n     recreation.\n\n  Unfortunately, there is a growing threat to these public lands and to \nthe Americans who protect and preserve those areas. Most Americans are \nfamiliar with what happened earlier this year in Oregon when the \nMalheur National Wildlife Refuge in southeastern Oregon was taken over \nwhen a dangerous group of militants staged an armed takeover of the \nrefuge. They came with their canvas shirts, camouflaged pants, guns, \nassault rifles, and pistols that were obvious. They had their all-\nterrain vehicles and set out to take over this Federal property, and \nthey did. They damaged it to the tune of about--we don't know for \nsure--$20 million. They defecated on some of the ruins and different \nfacilities. They stopped the Indians from being able to do their annual \nfishing.\n  I am sorry to say this particular episode of domestic terrorism has \nroots in Nevada.\n  Ammon and Ryan Bundy--who are now in jail, which is where they should \nbe--are the sons of Cliven Bundy. They were two of the participants in \nthe unlawful takeover. Cliven Bundy is, of course, a Nevadan and has \nbeen breaking Federal laws for decades. I have been disappointed that \nsome of my colleagues have supported this outrageous lawbreaker.\n  Teddy Roosevelt created the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in \nOregon. This radical President, Theodore Roosevelt--and I say that \nsarcastically because he was, in fact, a great President--created the \nrefuge in 1908. Roosevelt used the tools at his disposal as President \nof this great country, including the Antiquities Act, in order to \nprotect our national heritage so that generations of Americans could \nenjoy it, as they have for more than 100 years in Oregon. Congress \ncreated the Antiquities Act to empower the President to protect our \ncultural, historic, and natural resources when and where Congress \ncannot--or will not. These cultural resources are stunning. For more \nthan 100 years Presidents have done just what Theodore Roosevelt did.\n  Our current national parks were created using this authority--not all \nof them, but some of them. In fact, 16 Presidents--8 Democrats and 8 \nRepublicans--have used this authority to protect lands for the \nbenefit of the American people. The younger George Bush used the \nAntiquities Act. Republican Presidents have been doing this a lot, but \nunfortunately many Senate Republicans want to undermine this act. They \nrefuse to defend our cultural and historic antiquities that are being \nsystematically destroyed. That is why the Antiquities Act was created--\nto safeguard against these threats in the absence of congressional \naction. Take, for example, a stunningly beautiful place called Gold \nButte, the area where Cliven Bundy illegally grazed his cattle for \ndecades. It is a stunning landscape.\n\n  Is this worth protecting? This chart shows the beautiful landscape. \nLook at it. This picture is not doctored up; that is the way it is. The \nsky isn't as blue as I have seen it so many times. We don't get a lot \nof clouds in Nevada, especially in this part of Nevada. We don't get \nmany storm clouds. It doesn't happen often, but this is part of the \ngreatness of Nevada.\n  Look at that. Is that worth preserving? Of course it is. This State \nhas such magnificent areas. There are sandstone formations just like \nthese petroglyphs, which date back thousands of years.\n  Take a look at this. This is a picture of petroglyphs. These Indian \nwritings and drawings are centuries old. They are in an area we want to \nprotect--Gold Butte. Look at that. The picture shows panel after panel \nof this magnificent part of history. But because of the trouble caused \nby the Bundys and their pals, the Federal employees have been prevented \nfrom doing their job of safeguarding these antiquities. About 19 of the \nvandals have been indicted. Most of them are still in jail where they \nbelong. These employees have been under constant physical and mental \nthreat for doing what the American people have asked them to do--that \nis their job.\n  Petroglyphs are being destroyed, drawn over, shot at, and stolen. \nThis is an example of one panel they have destroyed. Look at what they \nhave done. We can see that there are bullet holes. There is graffiti \nall over these beautiful Indian writings. These are not bricks that \nhave been put in place. This is the way that nature has created this \nland, and they are destroying it. Look at what they have done. They \nhave also cut pieces out of this and hauled them away. It is a crime, \nbut they are criminals. They don't mind doing it, and that is what they \ndo. What a shame.\n  This is only one example, and it is right here in the middle of the \npicture. It was, frankly, a vulgar drawing. They knew what they were \ndrawing. They were telling everybody how they felt about this \nantiquity. We can see the bullet holes here. They used it for target \npractice.\n  The final picture I will show is the damage that was done to the \nJoshua trees. I know a lot about Joshua trees because where I lived and \nhad my home for many years--and I still own quite a bit of property in \nSearchlight--has one of the thickest Joshua tree forests in\n\n[[Page S1778]]\n\nthe world. These trees are stunning. They grow about two inches a year. \nThey last for up to 150 years. People don't understand that these trees \nare so terrific. These trees have been brutalized by these criminals. \nThey chopped this one down. One of my staffers said: Well, maybe they \nused it for firewood. Well, folks, have you ever tried to start a fire \nwith cantaloupe? You can't burn this. I guess you can burn anything, \nbut you will not stay warm. They are soft inside. It is not something \nyou can burn.\n  We don't know how old the tree in this picture was, but it was \nprobably 80 or 100 years old. Look at that beautiful tree behind it. It \nis really unfortunate, but that is what they are doing. They are just \ndestroying these beautiful trees.\n  One of them who was part of the Oregon crowd had a brand. He went out \nbranding everything with his brand. He stamped his brand on different \nthings that should be protected. This is sad.\n  I have tried to protect Gold Butte for a long time, and the reason we \nhaven't been able to do anything up to this point is that the Bundy \nboys and their pals kept everybody off of that property, and that is \nwhy I am grateful for the Antiquities Act. Because of this legislation, \nthe Bundys are in jail.\n  I will reach out to the White House--and there is no guarantee we \nwill get it done, that's for sure--to see if President Obama will \nprotect this area. He has the authority, as any President does, to stop \nthis sort of destruction and stop it now. Threats to our public lands \nare threats to our economy, our environment, and our culture. When we \npreserve our lands, we preserve America, and that is what we are trying \nto do: Preserve this beautiful place.\n  I say again: Is this worth protecting and preserving? Of course it \nis.\n  Mr. President, please announce the Senate business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/07/senate-section/article/S1778-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds).

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 636, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 636) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 to permanently extend increased expensing limitations, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Thune/Nelson amendment No. 3464, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n       Thune (for Gardner) amendment No. 3460 (to amendment No. \n     3464), to require the FAA Administrator to consider the \n     operational history of a person before authorizing the person \n     to operate certain unmanned aircraft systems.\n       Thune amendment No. 3512 (to amendment No. 3464), to \n     enhance airport security.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, we have the FAA bill on the floor. I would \nlike to discuss some of the amendments that are proposed and, \nhopefully, a couple that we will be voting on this morning. There are a \ncouple of amendments--one offered by Senator Thune on behalf of himself \nand this Senator, the ranking member of the Commerce Committee, and \nanother offered by Senator Heinrich. Both amendments deal with the \nissue of security but in different arenas.\n  Let me explain. The Thune-Nelson amendment applies to the question of \nperimeter security, of allowing employees to get into an airport--not \nthe sterile area controlled by TSA, although, as I will explain, it can \ndefinitely affect the sterile area as well. On the other hand, the \nHeinrich amendment addresses security in the areas where passengers \nbunch up outside of TSA security, such as in a queue-up line going \nthrough TSA security, or passengers bunched up at the ticket counters, \nchecking in their luggage.\n  Either way, as we saw from the experience of the Brussels airport \nexplosion, those are very tempting targets for a terrorist. Therefore, \nthe proposal in the Heinrich amendment, which I would commend to the \nSenate, is to increase the level of security, particularly with what \nare called VIPR teams, which, in essence, are not only at airports but \nat seaports and at transportation hubs.\n  Remember that in Brussels there was a bombing in one of the train \nstations as well. So we need to increase the surveillance and the \nsecurity there, including dogs. As a matter of fact, our K-9 friends \nare some of the best that we have when it comes to protecting us \nbecause their noses are attuned to being able to sniff out the \nexplosives that you cannot detect with metal detectors or with the AIT \nmachine that we go through where we hold up our hands to see if we have \nanything on us.\n  It can detect if you have a package, if you have an explosive that is \nsomewhere in one of your body cavities. It is going to be very, very \ndifficult.\n  Dogs, because of their God-given sense of smell, can detect that. A \nproperly trained dog is just amazing to watch. Now, interestingly, \nconcurrently there is research going on at NIST, the National Institute \nof Standards and Technology, for an artificial dog nose, a mechanical \nitem or a piece of software and hardware that would actually do the \nsame job.\n  But that has not been perfected yet. That is going to be really \ninteresting to see what they come up with. This Senator will report to \nthe Senate later on that. But for the time being, the Heinrich \namendment, which I hope we will vote on this morning, is concerned with \nthat security that we have seen as a result of the Brussels bombing.\n  We certainly want to enhance security in our airports. Thank goodness \nwe have the intelligence apparatus that we do in this country to be \nable to smoke out the terrorist before he ever does his dirty deed. It \nis more difficult for them to do it here in America than it is in \nEurope because of the alienation of those communities that then harbor \nthe terrorists. We see the result in Brussels as well as Paris. That is \nthe Heinrich amendment. That is a broad characterization of it, but \nbasically that is the thrust.\n  The Thune-Nelson amendment is going at the perimeter security. OK, \nthink Egypt and the Russian airliner. It was an airport employee who \nsmuggled the bomb onto the plane, not as a passenger but as an airport \nemployee. Think the Atlanta airport, 2 years ago. In a gunrunning \nscheme over 3 months, over 100 guns were transported from Atlanta to \nNew York.\n  The police in New York could not figure out how all of these guns \nwere getting on the streets in New York. They kept checking the trains, \nand they kept checking the interstates. They could not figure it out. \nHere is how they did it. An employee at the Atlanta airport--because \nAtlanta was not checking their employees--would smuggle the guns in. \nThen that employee had access in the terminal to get into the sterile \narea--the TSA sterile area--and he would go into the men's room, meet \nthe passenger who had already come through security and was clean, and \ngive the guns to him to put them in his empty knapsack, his backpack. \nThis employee, over the course of 17 times, over 3 months, smuggled \nover 100 guns. Thank goodness it was a criminal enterprise, not a \nterrorist, because you can imagine what would have happened.\n  The Miami International Airport 10 years ago figured this out. What \nthey did was, instead of having hundreds of entry points into the \nairport for airport employees in a very large airport like Atlanta, in \nMiami they boiled it down to a handful. There the employees went \nthrough similar security that passengers do to check to see if they had \nany weapons. They had a special identification card that they would \nhave to stick into an electronic machine and put in their code, which \nwas another way of checking to make sure that the employee was who they \nsaid they were.\n  Miami solved the problem after having a problem with drugs 10 years \nago. Interestingly, in the interim, the Orlando International Airport, \nlikewise, about 4 years ago had a similar drug problem. They did the \nsame thing. They boiled down hundreds of entry points for airport \nemployees to a handful. They had those checks. I have gone to see those \nchecks at those two airports. That is exactly how they do it.\n  The fact is, we have 300 airports in the United States. There were \nonly two that were doing this kind of perimeter checking. Atlanta then \nbecame the\n\n[[Page S1779]]\n\nposter boy of what can happen in a gunrunning scheme. I am happy to \nreport to the Senate that, in fact, the Atlanta airport has now done \nexactly what Miami and Orlando have done. But we have 297 other \nairports that need to do the same thing.\n  So the Thune-Nelson amendment is exactly getting at that kind of \nperimeter security situation. I highly commend both the Thune-Nelson \namendment as well as the Heinrich amendment. There are a whole bunch of \ncosponsors--bipartisan--on each of these. I highly recommend both of \nthese to the Senate. I hope we will vote on those today--hopefully, \nthis morning.\n  Now, there are going to be, of course, a series of many other \namendments, some very well intentioned that have some technical \nglitches, and we have our very expert staff right now starting to try \nto work out some of these technical glitches. Then we can get moving \nwith this FAA bill.\n  I would mention one other amendment that this Senator will be \noffering, and that is on a cyber security bill. Did the Presiding \nOfficer see the ``60 Minutes'' segment where people with a laptop could \ntake over an automobile by going through the electronics of the \nautomobile? They can speed it up, they can make it stop it, and they \ncan make it turn and completely take over the operation of an \nautomobile.\n  Can the Presiding Officer imagine somebody being able to do that with \nan airliner with 250 people on board? Therefore, whether we want to \nface it or not, we better face it because we are in an era that what we \nneed to do is to make sure technically that the systems in an airliner \nare separate, that there is an air gap, and that whatever those systems \nare--it might be Wi-Fi for the airplane, it might be music, or it may \nbe whatever it is--there is an air gap so that someone cannot go into \nthat system and suddenly get into the aircraft controls.\n  That is super important. One other thing I would mention is what we \nknow as unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones. They have become quite \npopular. But, obviously, one of the things that is already in the bill, \nwhich Senator Thune and I have insisted on as we approach this FAA \nbill, is that we have to come face-to-face with the reality that drones \nare now impairing the safety of an ascending or a descending aircraft. \nWe have seen--the two of us--an operation where you can now take over \nthe operation of a drone.\n  Education can do so much. People have to understand that you \nbasically have to not fly a drone within 5 miles of an airport. Just \nrecently, at Miami International Airport, there was an inbound American \nAirlines plane, and there was a drone about 1,000 feet off on the left \nside. Remember Captain Sully Sullenberger, when a flock of geese \nsuddenly got sucked into the engines and all power was lost. \nFortunately, he had the Hudson River that he could belly it in after he \nhad taken off from LaGuardia.\n  You put a drone with plastic and metal, let that get sucked into the \nengine, and you will have a catastrophic failure. You don't want to put \nyour passengers in that kind of operation. Therefore, education is one \nthing, but there is always going to be a young person that does not \nknow about this. We don't know the answer. We know we can take over the \noperation of the drone, send it over here, have it set down, and have \nit land. The technology is there, but how do we apply that technology \nso we avoid this aircraft collision? There is an increasing use of \ndrones that are so helpful for so many commercial purposes, not to \nmention the pure pleasure of flying a drone around, which we are seeing \nhas become exceptionally popular. We address that in the bill by giving \nthe appropriate direction to the FAA to start coming up with the \nsolutions of how we are going to protect aircraft in and around \nairports.\n\n  On down the line, there are going to be so many different issues with \nregard to drones, far beyond the scope of the FAA bill. On the question \nof privacy--a drone suddenly coming down and coming at eye level \noutside your bedroom window snooping--there are all kinds of questions \nabout privacy. What about the fact that you can now put a gun on a \ndrone? We know in a war zone we have the capability of doing that with \nvery sophisticated weapons, such as Hellfire missiles, but now some \npeople are experimenting with putting a gun on a drone. We have the \nramifications of what that means for society to deal with in the \nfuture. For the immediate future, the FAA bill on the floor--we have \nthis problem of avoiding drones colliding into aircraft, and that is in \nthe bill and it is addressed.\n  We have a lot of interesting issues to talk about. Let's get the \nSenate on it, and hopefully we can get agreement so we can at least \nvote on two of these amendments this morning.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HEINRICH.

The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, this amendment would strengthen U.S. \nairport security, especially in nonsecure or soft-target areas of \nairports--places such as check-in and baggage claim areas. It would \nalso update Federal security programs to provide active shooter \ntraining for law enforcement and increase the presence of Federal \nagents with bomb-sniffing canines at these nonsecure areas.\n  I thank the cosponsors of the amendment: Senator Manchin, Senator \nSchumer, Senator Nelson, Senator Klobuchar, Senator Cantwell, Senator \nCarper, Senator Baldwin, Senator Durbin, Senator Bennet, and Senator \nBlumenthal.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting the adoption of \nthis amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S1780]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rubio). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the bill and ask consent \nto do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my colleague \nfrom Pennsylvania Senator Toomey to talk about an issue we began to \ndiscuss on the floor yesterday, but we have been working many months on \nthis issue.\n  It is a rather simple issue, but it is a matter that has some real \nurgency connected to it because we are talking about a secondary \nbarrier on airplanes--meaning a barrier other than what we know now to \nbe a reinforced cockpit door--to prevent terrorists from getting into \nthe cockpit. What we need to do in addition to that, after Congress \nmandated the installation of these reinforced cockpit doors, is add a \nsecondary barrier.\n  This is something that arises because we not only know from the \nattack on \n9/11 but thereafter, we know that, No. 1, this is still an intention \nthat terrorists have to take over an airplane. We know since 9/11, 51--\nI will correct the record from yesterday, I think I said 15, I had \ntransposed the number--but it is 51 hijacking attempts around the world \nsince 9/11. This is not a problem that is going away, and we have to \ndeal with it.\n  This is the barrier we are talking about. So people understand the \nnature of this barrier, this is a lightweight wire mesh gate that would \nprevent a terrorist from getting into the cockpit or even getting to \nthe door of the cockpit, which, as we said, is already reinforced. What \nit does fundamentally is block access to the flight deck. That is what \nwe are talking about. That is what our amendment does.\n\n  We know the substantial number of groups that support this. I will \njust read the list for the record. And this actually is support for the \nunderlying bill that Senator Toomey and I and others have been working \non for a while. The underlying bill itself was S. 911. Also, the \namendment, amendment No. 3458, is endorsed by the following groups: the \nAirline Pilots Association, the Allied Pilots Association, the \nAssociation of Flight Attendants, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers \nAssociation, the US Airline Pilots Association, the Coalition of \nAirline Pilots Association, the Port Authority of New York & New \nJersey, and Families of September 11.\n  There have been numerous studies done. I am holding a study--although \nyou can't see it from a distance--which was conducted by the Cato \nInstitute, among others, on terrorism risk and cost-benefit analysis of \naviation security.\n  So we not only have substantial support from virtually every group \nyou could point toward, but we have some expertise on how to protect \npilots in the cockpit, how to protect passengers on an airplane, and, \nof course, how to do that by preventing terrorists from getting through \nor near the cockpit because of a good secondary barrier.\n  This effort started literally from folks we now know in Pennsylvania. \nIt started with, among other people, the Saracini family, Ellen \nSaracini, the wife of Captain Victor Saracini, who piloted United \nFlight 175, which terrorists hijacked and flew into the World Trade \nCenter on 9/11. So in memory of Captain Saracini and inspired by the \ngreat work of his wife Ellen Saracini, we offer this amendment.\n  Again, I am very pleased to be working on this with my colleague \nSenator Toomey, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I would like to underscore the points made \nby my colleague Senator Casey. I thank him for his leadership.\n  This is a very simple matter that is very straightforward and common \nsense. We know there is a very real vulnerability in our commercial \naircraft. We know this. There is no mystery here. And we have a very \nsimple, affordable, reasonable solution that will provide the security \nwe need.\n  After September 11, 2001, Congress very rightly mandated that the \ncockpit door be reinforced so that it is virtually impossible to \ndestroy that door, to knock down that door, to defeat the purpose of \nthat door when it is closed and latched. The problem is that when it is \nopen--which it must be open periodically during many flights--a very \nstrong door is useless. We know what happens now on airlines because we \nhave all witnessed it, right? When a pilot needs to come out or go in \nor there is access to the cockpit when that door is open, the flight \nattendant rolls a little serving cart in front of the door. I suppose \nthat is better than nothing, but it is not much better than nothing. \nThat cart can be rolled away.\n  We are not the only ones who have observed this. An FAA advisory has \nobserved this risk. The 9/11 Commission pointed out that the terrorists \nwere very focused on the opportunity created by the opening of the \ncockpit door. As Senator Casey pointed out, there have been multiple \nattempts to breach that door. Several have been successful. We have an \namendment that solves this problem in a very affordable, reasonable, \nsensible way. It is a lightweight, collapsible barrier made of wire \nmesh, and a flight attendant can simply draw it across the opening, \nlock it, and then at that point the cockpit door can be opened and \nthere is no way someone would be able to rush through that wire mesh in \ntime to get to the cockpit during that moment when the door is open. \nThat is what our amendment does.\n  It passed the Transportation Committee in the House unanimously. As \nSenator Casey pointed out, it has very broad support from many of the \nstakeholders who care about the security of our commercial aviation.\n  It is our hope and understanding that we will be very soon \npropounding a unanimous consent agreement which will allow this \namendment to be pending and that this will be one of the amendments \nwhich will be on the docket for a subsequent vote. I hope we will get \nto that momentarily. I hope we will get that locked in, and then I \nwould urge my colleagues to vote yes on our amendment and enhance \ncommercial aviation safety.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise to discuss an important matter \nbefore the Senate, the reauthorization of our Nation's Federal Aviation \nAdministration. The FAA is tasked with a critical mission to manage the \nsafety and the security of our Nation's airspace.\n  Our Nation's airspace is an incredible resource that fuels our \neconomy. According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, in 2015, \na record 896 million passengers traversed America's skies. Our aviation \nsystem contributes $1.5 trillion to our Nation's economy and it \nsupports 11.8 million jobs for hard-working Americans, as noted by the \nNational Air Traffic Controllers Association.\n  The Senate's FAA reauthorization bill will make our aviation system \nstronger for families, children, veterans, and the traveling public. It \nwill also benefit Nebraska's rural airports and local aviation \nstakeholders. Notably, this carefully negotiated bill will strengthen \nAmerica's aviation system without raising fees or taxes on airline \npassengers.\n  Our robust, bipartisan legislation includes several major priorities \nI championed. I am proud of bipartisan language I worked to include in \nthe bill, along with Senators Booker, Cantwell, and Ayotte. Our \nprovision\nwould compel the FAA to work with the airline industry to \ncomprehensively assess and update guidelines for emergency medical kits \non commercial aircraft. These kits, which haven't been statutorily \nupdated since 1998, provide lifesaving resources for passengers. It is \nwell past time for the FAA to evaluate medications and equipment \nincluded in these kits. Doing so will ensure all passengers,\n\n[[Page S1781]]\n\nparticularly families with young infants facing unknown allergic \nreactions, have access to the medical supplies they might need in an \nemergency situation.\n  In addition, I worked with Senator McCaskill to include an amendment \nthat would make it easier for traveling mothers to care for their young \ninfants. Our amendment unanimously passed the Commerce Committee. We \nworked closely with airport stakeholders, including Omaha's Eppley \nAirfield, to establish reasonable minimum standards for both medium- \nand large-hub airports to develop private rooms for nursing mothers in \nfuture capital development plans. Traveling as a new mom can be \nchallenging and it can be stressful at times, but I believe this \nimportant change will provide increased flexibility and also peace of \nmind for mothers traveling through airports across our country.\n  I also joined Senator Hirono to include an amendment that would \nensure disabled veterans working at the FAA have access to service-\nconnected disability leave. The FAA was one of the few agencies not \nincluded in the recently passed Wounded Warriors Federal Leave Act. \nThat bill required Federal agencies to ensure disabled vets have access \nto service-connected disability leave. Our disabled veterans bravely \nserved our country, and they deserve access to benefits they have \nearned. I am grateful for the achievements this bill will advance for \nthe flying public. At the same time, the bill is also a victory for \nNebraska's rural communities and airports.\n  The Small Airport Regulation Relief Act, which is included in the FAA \nbill, would create a temporary exemption for small airports so they can \ncontinue to receive airport improvement program funds--those AIP \nfunds--despite downturns in air service. The survival of smaller \nairports, such as Scottsbluff's Western Nebraska Regional Airport, \ndepends on these crucial funds to provide service to local passengers \nand businesses. Several of Nebraska's small and community airports, \nsuch as Alliance, Chadron, Grand Island, McCook, North Platte, and \nScottsbluff, will also benefit from a continuation of the Essential Air \nService, or EAS, Program. The EAS Program incentivizes air carriers to \nprovide service to underserved and rural areas, and it is critical to \nensuring air service continues for Nebraska's rural communities.\n  Meanwhile, the Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island is \ngrowing and hosts a privately operated Federal contract tower. I \nencouraged the inclusion of provisions to compel the FAA to complete a \npending cost-benefit analysis for Federal contract tower airports. This \nanalysis would reflect the cost-share arrangement more accurately \nbetween our local airports and the FAA for those contract towers. \nThrough this legislation, we can help to reduce the burden on local \nairports such as Grand Island, NE.\n  One of the major challenges facing aviation manufacturers has been \nthe FAA's inconsistent and often unclear regulatory process. I \ncollaborated with Duncan Aviation of Lincoln, NE, the largest family-\nowned maintenance, repair, and overhaul organization in the world, to \naddress this challenge. In fact, Chairman Thune toured the facilities \nat Duncan Aviation with me in Lincoln last fall.\n  Our bill would provide clarity to aviation businesses like Duncan \nAviation by compelling the FAA to establish a centralized safety \nguidance database. Moreover, the bill would require the FAA to \nestablish a Regulatory Consistency Communications Board. The Board \nwould set standards to ensure the consistent application of regulations \nand guidance at regional offices throughout our country. Agricultural \naviators in Nebraska will also benefit from safety enhancements in this \nbill. Far too many of our agricultural pilots have died in recent years \nafter collisions with unmarked utility towers.\n  This legislation would ensure that towers are marked to create safer \nskies for our agriculture pilots. Passing our FAA bill will be a major \naccomplishment for the Senate. I appreciate and commend the hard work \nof Chairman Thune, Ranking Member Nelson, and their committee staffers \non this meaningful FAA reauthorization bill. In the coming days, I look \nforward to working together to help pass this critical legislation that \nwill benefit the flying public, our national aviation system, and \nNebraska's rural airports and aviation stakeholders.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment \nnumbered 3512 be modified with the changes at the desk and that at \n12:05 p.m. today the Senate vote on the following amendments in the \norder listed: Thune No. 3512, as modified; and Heinrich No. 3482, as \nmodified; further that at 1:45 p.m. today the Senate vote on the \nSchumer amendment No. 3483 and that no second-degree amendments be in \norder to any of the amendments prior to the vote and that there be 2 \nminutes equally divided prior to each vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3512), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n      TITLE ___--TRANSPORTATION SECURITY AND TERRORISM PREVENTION\n\n       Subtitle A--Airport Security Enhancement and Oversight Act\n\n     SEC. _101. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Airport Security \n     Enhancement and Oversight Act''.\n\n     SEC. _102. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) A number of recent airport security breaches in the \n     United States have involved the use of Secure Identification \n     Display Area (referred to in this section as ``SIDA'') \n     badges, the credentials used by airport and airline workers \n     to access the secure areas of an airport.\n       (2) In December 2014, a Delta ramp agent at Hartsfield-\n     Jackson Atlanta International Airport was charged with using \n     his SIDA badge to bypass airport security checkpoints and \n     facilitate an interstate gun smuggling operation over a \n     number of months via commercial aircraft.\n       (3) In January 2015, an Atlanta-based Aviation Safety \n     Inspector of the Federal Aviation Administration used his \n     SIDA badge to bypass airport security checkpoints and \n     transport a firearm in his carry-on luggage.\n       (4) In February 2015, a local news investigation found that \n     over 1,000 SIDA badges at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta \n     International Airport were lost or missing.\n       (5) In March 2015, and again in May 2015, Transportation \n     Security Administration contractors were indicted for \n     participating in a drug smuggling ring using luggage passed \n     through the secure area of the San Francisco International \n     Airport.\n       (6) The Administration has indicated that it does not \n     maintain a list of lost or missing SIDA badges, and instead \n     relies on airport operators to track airport worker \n     credentials.\n       (7) The Administration rarely uses its enforcement \n     authority to fine airport operators that reach a certain \n     threshold of missing SIDA badges.\n       (8) In April 2015, the Aviation Security Advisory Committee \n     issued 28 recommendations for improvements to airport access \n     control.\n       (9) In June 2015, the Inspector General of the Department \n     of Homeland Security reported that the Administration did not \n     have all relevant information regarding 73 airport workers \n     who had records in United States intelligence-related \n     databases because the Administration was not authorized to \n     receive all terrorism-related information under current \n     interagency watchlisting policy.\n       (10) The Inspector General also found that the \n     Administration did not have appropriate checks in place to \n     reject incomplete or inaccurate airport worker employment \n     investigations, including criminal history record checks and \n     work authorization verifications, and had limited oversight \n     over the airport operators that the Administration relies on \n     to perform criminal history and work authorization checks for \n     airport workers.\n       (11) There is growing concern about the potential insider \n     threat at airports in light of recent terrorist activities.\n\n     SEC. _103.

Mr. President, if I might just speak to amendment No. \n3512, which we will be voting on momentarily, I know Senator Nelson has \nalready spoken on this issue. We worked very hard on a series of \nsecurity bills that we could bring to the floor. We are trying to move \nthem separately, but I think they fit nicely into the debate we are \nhaving on the FAA reauthorization.\n  Senators Nelson, Ayotte, Cantwell, and I have been leading oversight \nof airport and airline workers abusing their secure area access badges. \nThis oversight led our committee to approve bipartisan legislation--S. \n2361, Airport Security Enhancement and Oversight Act--to tighten the \nvetting of airport workers with ties to terrorists and serious criminal \nbehavior that should disqualify them from accessing sensitive airport \nareas.\n  Just in the past few weeks, a number of badged aviation industry \nworkers have been caught in the act of helping criminal organizations. \nOn March 18, a flight attendant abandoned a suitcase with 68 pounds of \ncocaine after being confronted by transportation security officers in \nCalifornia. On March 26 in Florida, an airline gate agent was arrested \nwith a backpack containing $282,400 in cash that he intended to hand \noff to an associate.\n  As we work to address the threat of an aviation insider helping \nterrorists,\n\n[[Page S1786]]\n\ncriminals who break laws for financial gain and those with a history of \nviolence are a really good place to start. It is high time that we \nstart cracking down on these types of offenses for people who are \nworking in sensitive areas of our airports.\n  U.S. terrorism experts believe that ISIS is recruiting criminals to \njoin its ranks in Europe, and some of the perpetrators in the deadly \nattacks in Brussels were previously known to authorities as criminals. \nEnsuring that airport workers with security credentials are trustworthy \nis especially important, considering that experts believe an ISIS \naffiliate may have planted a bomb on a Russian Metrojet flight leaving \nEgypt with the help of an airport employee, which killed 224 people on \nboard. The recent attacks by ISIS in the unsecured area of the Brussels \nAirport also underscore the vulnerability of airport areas outside of \nTSA security screening checkpoints.\n  The House of Representatives and the Commerce Committee also approved \nlegislation--H.R. 2843, the PreCheck Expansion Act--in December of 2015 \nto expand the PreCheck program by developing private sector \npartnerships and capabilities to vet and enroll more individuals. These \nprivate sector partners would be required to use an assessment \nequivalent to a fingerprint-based criminal history record check \nconducted through the FBI. These changes would increase the number of \npassengers who are vetted before they get to the airport. As a result, \nmore passengers would receive expedited airport screening and get \nthrough security checkpoints more quickly, ensuring they don't pose the \nkind of easy target that the ISIS suicide bombers exploited at the \nBrussels Airport.\n  In addition to the bills approved by our committee on March 23, the \nHouse Homeland Security Committee approved H.R. 4698, the SAFE GATES \nAct of 2016, which would strengthen security at international airports \nwith direct flights to the United States. Specifically, the bill would \nrequire TSA to conduct a comprehensive risk assessment of all last-\npoint-of-departure airports, a security coordination enhancement plan, \nand a workforce assessment. It would authorize the TSA to donate \nsecurity screening equipment to foreign last-point-of-departure \nairports and to evaluate foreign countries' air cargo security programs \nto prevent any shipment of nefarious materials via air cargo.\n  I believe these bills will help make air travel more secure, and they \nshould advance in the full Senate in this amendment to the FAA bill. I \nencourage my colleagues to support the Thune-Nelson amendment and then \nalso follow-on with the Heinrich amendment, which will come up shortly \nafter a vote on that amendment. I think the Heinrich amendment also \nmakes a number of important security improvements that will also \nstrengthen airport security.\n  There has been a discussion about whether there ought to be more VIPR \nteams. I think there are 30 or so at this point, and the amendment \nwould allow that number to go up to 60. Yesterday we had the \nopportunity to question the TSA Administrator, Admiral Neffenger, about \nwhether additional VIPR teams would be useful. He said they could put \nto use anything they were given in terms of additional units that might \nbe deployed to places around the country where they think there is a \nneed. So that is the principal component of the Heinrich amendment, \nwhich also addresses some of the security issues.\n  I don't think we can understate how important security is in light of \neverything that is going on in the world today. We have people who want \nto harm Americans, and it is our job to make sure we are giving those \nauthorities who are there to prevent those types of attacks against \nAmericans all the tools they need in order to do their jobs \neffectively.\n  I encourage our colleagues here in the Senate--when we have an \nopportunity to vote here momentarily on both of these security \namendments--to support those amendments. They improve and strengthen \nsecurity at our airports around this country, and I think they fit \nnicely within the context of the FAA reauthorization bill and the \ndebate we are currently having on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3483 to Amendment No. 3464\n\n  Mr. NELSON.

Madam President, airports, bus depots, and train \nstations are things that we all rely on every day to have the freedom \nof movement we enjoy in this country.\n  In the wake of the recent terror attacks in the Brussels Airport and \nMetro, Americans are worried about their security, and they want to \nfeel safe when traveling with their loved ones.\n  While we relentlessly target terrorists overseas, we must also do all \nwe can to intelligently protect Americans here at home. My amendment \nwould increase the number of TSA VIPR teams, who provide a visible \ndeterrent to terrorist threats in high-priority locations. These teams \nare recognizable as they often have bomb-sniffing canines. My amendment \nwould also provide active shooter training for law enforcement and \nstrengthen security in nonsecure so-called soft-target areas, such as \ncheck-in and baggage claim areas.\n  By employing these additional commonsense safeguards, we will \nintelligently respond to these threats. Most importantly, by preserving \nour freedom to go about our daily lives, we will ensure that the \nterrorists have failed to change how we live and who we are.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                Iranian Access to U.S. Financial System\n\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, when Obama administration officials sold \nthe President's nuclear deal last summer to the American people, they \nwere clearly sensitive to charges that they gave too much away. They \nknew that giving Iran $100 billion that we could never get back in \nexchange for a mere temporary deal that expired in 10 to 15 years would \nbe viewed with deep skepticism.\n  They knew that an inspection system that gives the ayatollahs a 24-\nday heads-up before an inspection would not pass the laugh test. They \nknew that granting the ayatollahs massive sanctions relief while still \nallowing them to develop an industrial-scale nuclear enrichment program \nwould invite accusations that the President was, to put it frankly, \nswindled.\n  So in their sales pitch, these administration officials sought to \nblunt these expected criticisms. They repeatedly stated that the United \nStates would maintain certain tough sanctions, even after the deal \nbecame effective. They said the United States would hold the line on \nmeasures that punish and suppress Iran's nonnuclear malign activities. \nThey emphatically stated that in no way would the U.S. economy be \nallowed to bolster an Iranian economy that is significantly controlled \nby the Iranian regime, tainted by illicit financing of terrorism, and \nused by the ayatollahs to fund domestic oppression and international \naggression--including blowing up hundreds of American soldiers in Iraq \nwith roadside bombs.\n  In particular, these administration officials were emphatic that the \nUnited States would never, ever, ever grant Iran access to the U.S. \nfinancial system and U.S. dollars to facilitate Iran's trade in oil and \nother goods.\n  For instance, when testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee in July, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew stated:\n\n       Iranian banks will not be able to clear U.S. dollars \n     through New York, hold correspondent account relationships \n     with U.S. financial institutions, or enter into financing \n     arrangements with U.S. banks. Iran, in other words, will \n     continue to be denied access to the world's largest financial \n     and commercial market.\n\n  Likewise, Adam Szubin, the Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and \nFinancial Intelligence, echoed that sentiment and was even more \nprecise. In September he stated:\n\n       Iran will not be able to open bank accounts with U.S. \n     banks, nor will Iran be able to access the U.S. banking \n     sector, even for that momentary transaction to, what we call, \n     dollarize a foreign payment. . . . That is not in the cards. \n     That is not part of the relief offered under the JCPOA. So, \n     the U.S. sanctions on Iran, which, of course, had their \n     origins long before Iran had a nuclear program, will remain \n     in place.\n\n\n[[Page S1788]]\n\n\n  It is difficult to overstate the importance of these statements \nuttered just a few months ago. The U.S. dollar is the standard currency \nin which international trade is conducted. Because the ayatollahs can't \ndeal in dollars, they haven't fully opened their economy to the world--\nthankfully. In addition, the U.S. financial system hasn't yet been \ntainted by Iran's terror financing, its international aggression, and \nits crackdown on domestic democratic dissent.\n  But now, a mere 7 months into a 15-year agreement, the Obama \nadministration is shedding the resolve its officials tried to so hard \nto display before Congress. According to numerous reports, the \nadministration intends to backtrack on the statements of Secretary Lew \nand Adam Szubin. It is looking for some way, somehow to give Iran \naccess to U.S. dollars to boost Iranian trade and investment.\n  I want to be very clear. If the President moves to grant Iran access \nto the U.S. dollar--whether directly or indirectly--there will be \nconsequences. If there is any statement, guidance, regulation, or \nExecutive action that opens the U.S. banking sector to Iran even a \ncrack, the Senate will hold hearings with each official who assured the \nAmerican people last summer that the ayatollahs would never access the \ndollar. We will explore whether they lied back then or whether they \nintend to resign in protest now.\n  If this policy change moves forward, I will dedicate myself to \nworking with my colleagues to pass legislation blocking the change. If \nthe Obama administration proceeds with this massive concession to the \nayatollahs, every Member of the Senate who voted to accept the Iranian \ndeal will have to go home and explain why the U.S. economy is now \ncomplicit in Iran's financing of terrorist attacks against Americans \nand American allies.\n  That the Obama administration would even consider allowing Iran \naccess to the U.S. banking sector is extremely disconcerting, but it is \nnot surprising. It follows a steady pattern that has become \nincreasingly clear since the conclusion of the nuclear deal. Time and \nagain, Iran provokes the United States, commits brazen acts to \ndestabilize its neighbors, and threatens to undo the Iran deal. In \nresponse, the United States rushes to grant the ayatollahs more \nconcessions in order to placate them.\n  Iran has tested ballistic missiles, captured U.S. sailors, and fueled \nconflicts in Syria and Yemen with fresh arms and troops--all while \nemploying ``Death to America'' as a rallying cry.\n  But in the face of Iran's continued aggression, the President has \ndisplayed only weakness. Instead of steeling himself for a fight with \nthe ayatollahs, he has laid down and rolled over for them.\n  He has repeatedly refused to designate Iran's tests of ballistic \nmissiles as the violations of U.N. Security Council resolutions they so \nclearly are.\n  The President also agreed to send an additional $1.7 billion to the \nayatollahs, ostensibly to settle outstanding claims. For good measure, \nthat $1.7 billion includes $1.3 billion in gratuitous interest \npayments.\n  The President granted clemency to seven convicted Iranian criminals \nand dismissed arrest warrants for 14 Iranian fugitives who faced \ncharges for sanctions violations. Now the President may be on the verge \nof granting the largest concession yet--dollarizing Iran's \ninternational trade and declaring Iran truly open for business.\n  We should call this for what it is--concession creep. In the same \nmanner that no Member of the Senate should trust Iran to abide by its \ncommitments made in the Iranian nuclear deal, we can no longer trust \nthe administration to hold fast to the specific concessions contained \nin the four corners of that deal. The ink is hardly dry on the deal, \nand the President has already shown himself all too susceptible to the \ntemptations of appeasement.\n  The ayatollahs reportedly have complained to U.S. officials that it \nis too hard to transact business without access to U.S. dollars. The \nanswer to that should be ``too bad.''\n  It should not be easy for the world's worst sponsor of terrorism to \ndo business with the global economy. It should not be easy for \nindustries dominated by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps to trade \nin financial markets. International business leaders, directors, CEOs, \nand general counsels should not rush into Iran for fear of the grave \nreputational, financial, political, and legal consequences of doing \nbusiness with this outlaw regime.\n\n  The Iranians know the Obama administration is desperate to preserve \nthe nuclear deal. They hold the possibility of walking away from the \nagreement as a sword of Damocles over the President's head in order to \nextract concession after concession. They lord it over him in order to \nforestall any U.S. action that would meaningfully stop their regional \naggression and campaign of terror. So intense is President Obama's fear \nthat the Ayatollah will rip up the nuclear agreement, he has completely \nupended U.S. strategy in the Middle East to the point where adversaries \nare allies and allies are becoming adversaries.\n  This parade of concessions must stop, and it must stop now. The \nadministration must fully implement all new sanctions passed by \nCongress to punish Iran's development of ballistic missiles, its \nsponsorship of terrorism, and its human rights abuses. It must work \nwith our traditional allies in the Middle East to neutralize Iran's \nattempt to foment instability throughout the region. The President \nshould issue a very clear order that Iran will not be granted any \ndirect or indirect access to the U.S. banking system and the dollar.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 3490.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Interference with security screening personnel or air carrier \n              customer representatives.''.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I call up this amendment and offer it \nbecause the issue is making sure that those who work in the air \ntransportation system are safe and secure. This is an important issue \nto the men and women who work at Sea-Tac and at other airports and are \npart of the delivery system of making sure air transportation is safe. \nThey are an integral part of air transportation at every airport in the \nUnited States of America.\n  This issue is something that has been considered in the House of \nRepresentatives as part of the transportation package as well, and it \nis part of what we think should be in this package in the Senate; that \nis, making sure that those who are part of the delivery system--ticket \ncounter agents, agents who are aiding and assisting in getting \npassengers through the terminals and onto planes at the gate, \nassisting, as many of the challenging days go by, in delivering good \nair transportation service. What has happened is that these individuals \nhave become victims--the victims of physical, violent abuse; that is, \nthe public has taken to bodily harm against these individuals. So this \namendment puts in similar safeguards\n\n[[Page S1789]]\n\nthat are in line with other transportation officials who are protected \nfrom this kind of physical abuse.\n  I will have more to say on it, but I know my colleague is trying to \nget to the floor to speak as well. I will put into the Record examples \nof individuals who are ticketing agents, baggage agents, air \ntransportation delivery system workers who have been hurt, and they \ndeserve to have protection.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3483\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to urge a ``yes'' vote on \nthe upcoming amendment to require the FAA to set a minimum standard \nseat size.\n  This amendment would ensure that airlines can't keep chopping down on \nseat size and legroom until consumers are packed in like sardines in a \ncan on every flight.\n  Over the last few decades, between the size of the seat and the \ndistance between the seats, the flying public has lost half a foot of \ntheir space. Flying is not pleasant anymore. You are crammed in. I am \nnot that tall--a little under 6-foot-1. What I do when I fly is I take \nout the magazine and the air-sickness bag and the little folder that \nshows you where the exits are to gain one-sixteenth of an inch more \nlegroom. Moms with kids have a lot of trouble in those very narrow \nseats. Have you ever been in the situation where you are in the middle \nand there are two sort of large people on either side of you? It is not \nthe most pleasant flying experience.\n  We don't have too much competition anymore. We have very few \nairlines. This is a place where the public is clamoring for change. \nWhen I said I was going to offer this amendment, I got more feedback on \nit than most other things. And you don't have to be 6-foot-4 to \nunderstand the problem.\n  You would think that by cramming in more and more passengers on each \nflight, the airlines could lower their prices. Instead, several major \nairlines went in the other direction: They started charging for the \nextra inches and legroom that were once considered standard. So it \npractically costs you an arm and a leg just to have space for your arms \nand legs.\n  At a time when airlines are making record profits, at a time when \nfuel costs are extremely low, we need this amendment to protect \nconsumers' safety and comfort.\n  This amendment would do three things. It doesn't set a standard seat \nsize; it freezes the current seat size in place so they can't shrink it \nany further. It directs the FAA to set minimum standard seat size and \npitch for all commercial flights. And some of this involves comfort, \nbut some of it involves safety. God forbid there is something terrible \nhappening on a plane--the seats are so narrow, it is harder for people \nto get out. Finally, we focus on transparency. We require airlines to \npost their seat sizes on their Web sites, providing at least a \ncommercial incentive for airlines to offer more comfortable seat \narrangements.\n  Most folks travel under the expectation that the airlines are going \nto set the guidelines and that is that; there is nothing they can do \nabout it. We actually had to put in the underlying bill that airlines \nshould refund bag fees charged to consumers if the airline lost their \nbags. And I would say to my good friends on the other side, if we can \nmandate that bag fees be returned--not leave it up to the free market--\nwe can mandate that the FAA at least set a proper seat size. They can't \nsay: Well, leave it up to the free market on one but not on the other. \nIt is not a little fair.\n  Now we see why we need these amendments. The bag fee--and I agree \nthat if they lose your bags or delay your bags, they shouldn't keep the \nextra bag fee. It should be refunded. In most industries, that would be \na standard practice. If you fail to deliver a service somebody paid \nfor, they should get their money back. But sometimes in the airline \nindustry you have to require basic courtesy.\n  In conclusion, the great Abraham Lincoln was once asked how long a \nman's legs should be, and he famously answered: Long enough to reach \nfrom the body to the ground. If you asked a major airline today how \nlong a man's legs should be, they would say: Short enough to miss the \ntray table. That is no way to fly.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and move this bill in \na more consumer-friendly direction.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, some of my colleagues have to catch \nplanes, and it takes extra time for them to squeeze into those small \nseats with no legroom. So I yield back my time, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that we move the vote up to right now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3483.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE.

The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n               Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Bill\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues in the \nHouse of Representatives to pass the legislation we passed here in the \nSenate a few weeks ago called the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery \nAct, or CARA. We passed it on March 10, which was 27 days ago--almost a \nmonth. It is estimated that we lose about 120 Americans every day to \ndrug overdoses. That means that during that time period--those 27 \ndays--we lost about 3,240 additional Americans who we represent to \nsubstance abuse and death from heroin and prescription drug overdoses.\n  Since 2007, drug overdoses have killed more people in Ohio than any \nother cause of accidental death, even surpassing car accidents. It is \nprobably\n\n[[Page S1790]]\n\ntrue nationally now as well. Addiction is treatable, but 9 out of 10 \npeople who need treatment aren't getting it. That is a tragedy. It \nshows that the system we have right now just isn't working, and that is \nwhat our legislation addresses, among other things. In one 5-day span \nsince we passed CARA, just in the last month, we had five people die \nfrom heroin and Fentanyl overdoses in one of the cities I represent--\nCleveland, OH.\n  I was in Athens, OH, more than 2 weeks after we passed CARA, and \nreceived a tour of the Rural Women's Addiction Recovery Bassett House \nfacility. Dr. Joe Gay and Ruth Tarter took me around so I could meet \nsome of the brave women who stepped forward to treat their addiction \nissues. Some of them were there with their kids. They have an amazing \nsuccess rate.\n  I will tell you that 3 days after I left Athens, OH, $40,000 of \nheroin was seized at a traffic stop very close to this treatment \nfacility. It is everywhere. It knows no ZIP code. It is in rural areas, \nsuburban areas, and inner cities. States are starting to take action. \nOhio is taking action, your States are taking action, and communities \nare taking action. Local leaders know this is a problem, but they want \nthe Federal Government to be a better partner. That is what CARA \nprovides. It provides best practices from around the country. It \nprovides more funding for some critical elements that are evidence-\nbased--based on research and what actually works. Our States and local \ncommunities are desperate for this right now.\n  By the way, this legislation is not just bipartisan. It is also \nbicameral. In other words, not only have Republicans and Democrats \nworked across the aisle here in the Senate over the last 3 years \nputting this bill together, but our colleagues in the House have worked \ntogether as well. I am encouraged by the fact that the CARA legislation \nin the House has 113 cosponsors. It is bipartisan. It is based on good \nevidence. It is based on a lot of work and effort. Today I heard \nthrough a media account that one of the House leaders said there is \ninterest in moving something even this month. That is great. But he \nalso talked about hearings and markups and so on. Let's be sure the \nhearings and markups don't delay what we know we should do, which is to \npass the CARA legislation. It has been bicameral and bipartisan. It \npassed the Senate with a 94-to-1 vote. That never happens around here--\n94 to 1. This is legislation which we know will make a difference right \nnow in our communities that are dealing with a crisis we all face. \nLet's move this legislation.\n\n  I say to my friends in the House with all due respect, this \nlegislation has been carefully crafted and we have done the hard work. \nI mentioned that we spent 3 years of factfinding on this bill. We \ndidn't think we had all the right answers, so we went out to experts \nall over the country. We took time to listen. We consulted with them. \nWe listened to experts, doctors, law enforcement, and patients in \nrecovery. We listened to the drug experts in the Obama administration, \nsuch as the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, ONDCP. \nThey have been very helpful. We brought in people from Health and Human \nServices and listened to them. We brought in people from my home State \nof Ohio and other States around the country.\n  We heard from family members, many of whom have channelled their \ngrief at losing a loved one into advocacy for the CARA legislation \nbecause they know it is going to help. One testified in the Judiciary \nCommittee when we marked up the legislation. Tonda DaRe from \nCarrollton, OH, talked about having lost her daughter, who was a very \nsuccessful high school student and engaged to be married. Everything \nwas going great. When she turned 21, she made a mistake: She tried \nheroin. She went into recovery. She relapsed. She ended up dying of an \noverdose.\n  Unfortunately, this is a story that is retold all over our country. \nThere are moms, there are dads, there are aunts and uncles and brothers \nand sisters who come forward to tell us these tragic stories about \nlosing a loved one. They want this legislation to pass because they \nknow it is going to help another family member or a friend or a \ncoworker or someone whom they have never met but whom they want to help \nso they don't have to go through the grief they have gone through.\n  Senator Sheldon Whitehouse--a Democrat--and I have worked on this \nlegislation together, along with many other people in this Chamber. We \nhave also worked, as I said, with many on the House side. We worked \nwith folks on both sides of the aisle and both sides of the Capitol \nbecause this has become an issue that affects us all. It is a \nnonpartisan issue. We have to move it forward.\n  We held five forums here in Washington, DC, and brought in experts to \nget counsel and advice. They helped us develop a legislative proposal \nthat was thoughtful because it actually addressed the real problem.\n  In April 2014, we had a forum on the criminal justice system which \nincluded alternatives to incarceration, and you will see that in our \nlegislation. The notion is, for users who get arrested for possession, \nlet's not just throw them in jail because that hasn't worked. Let's get \nthem into treatment and get them into a recovery program that works.\n  In July 2014, we held a forum on how women are impacted by this drug \nepidemic, looking particularly at addiction and treatment responses. \nSome new data that is out there now shows that most of the people who \nare suffering from heroin and prescription drug addiction are women.\n  In December 2014, we held a forum on the science of addiction--how we \ncould get at this from a medical point of view, how we could come up \nwith better medical approaches to this to be able to stop the craving, \nto deal with the addiction problem, to get people through withdrawal. \nWe also talked about how to address some of the collateral consequences \nof addiction.\n  In April of 2015, we held a forum on our youth and how we can better \npromote drug prevention. After all, keeping people from getting into \nthe funnel of addiction in the first place has to be a priority. To \nhelp people avoid going down that funnel of addiction, we need better \nprevention, better education. That is part of our legislation. We also \nhad input about what is working in recovery and what is not working in \nrecovery.\n  We held a forum in July of 2015 to talk about our veterans, to talk \nabout the very sad situation with veterans who are coming back to our \nshores who have PTSD--post-traumatic stress disorder--and who have \nbrain injuries. Some recent data shows that about 20 percent of \nreturning veterans with those issues are becoming addicted to \nprescription drugs or heroin; therefore, veterans courts are a major \npart of our legislation. These are drug courts that are focused on \nmental health and addiction specifically for our veterans. I have seen \nthem in Ohio. They are working great. It is unbelievable.\n  I talked to a guy who has been in and out of the system his whole \nlife. He is about 45 years old now. He finally found this court that \nwas going to help him--took him out of jail and got him into treatment. \nHanging over his head was the possibility of incarceration if he didn't \ndo the right thing and stay clean. He is now a senior at Ohio State \nUniversity and is about to get his degree, and he reunited with his \nfamily for the first time in many years. He is clean. It can work.\n  The final result was the legislative text that reflected this open \nand deliberative process I am talking about. This bill--just like the \nresearch it supports--is evidence-based. We didn't ask who had the \nidea; we just asked whether it was a good idea.\n  It is no wonder that CARA now has support from 130 national groups, \nfrom the Fraternal Order of Police, to stakeholders in public health--\ndoctors and nurses, those in recovery, experts in the field, people who \nactually know what is going on because they are in the trenches working \non this. They want this bill passed. They know it will help them and \nhelp them now.\n  As I said, that vote was 94 to 1, which means 94 Senators say this \nbill is ready to go. These are Senators from every State in the Union \nwho support this legislation, therefore representing every \ncongressional district in the United States of America. It makes sense. \nIt expands prevention and educational efforts to prevent opiate abuse, \nthe use of heroin and prescription drugs.\n  It increases drug-disposal sites to get medications out of people's \nhands and get it into the right hands. It takes\n\n[[Page S1791]]\n\nthis medication off the bathroom shelves.\n  It has a drug-monitoring program to get at the overprescribing issue. \nSo many people who are currently addicted to heroin started with \nprescription drugs. In fact, the majority did. There is different data \nout there, but it is very clear that prescription drugs are a huge part \nof heroin addiction.\n\n  It also authorizes law enforcement task forces to combat heroin and \nmeth. Law enforcement has an important role to play here. It expands \ntraining and the availability of naloxone, or Narcan, to law \nenforcement. This is for our firefighters. When you go to a firehouse \nin your State--for those listening in the House, in your district--ask \nthem: Are you going on more fire runs or are you going on more runs to \nhelp people with overdoses? They will tell you what they tell me: \noverdoses. That is what it has come to. That is happening in your fire \ndepartment in your community.\n  By the way, to tell you how much this law can make a difference--\nbecause we do help get the training for them to be able to use Narcan \nand get the Narcan or naloxone into the right hands--Ohio public safety \nofficials have administered naloxone over 16,000 times since 2015--\n16,000 overdoses that might otherwise have resulted in death. For the \nmost part, this miracle drug works. First responders know how important \nit is. That is why the Fraternal Order of Police supports this bill. \nThey want to equip their officers, but so do the firefighters.\n  CARA also supports recovery programs, including those focused on \nyouth and building communities of recovery. To avoid people getting \ninto addiction in the first place, it also creates a national task \nforce on recovery because there is a lot of information out there we \nneed to bring together to find out what works and what doesn't work \nprecisely in terms of dealing with the collateral consequences imposed \nby addiction.\n  CARA expands treatment for pregnant women who struggle with addiction \nand provides support for babies who suffer from what is called neonatal \nabstinence syndrome. What does that mean? That means babies who are \nborn addicted. In Ohio, tragically, we had a 750-percent increase in \nthe number of babies born with addiction in the last 12 years. I have \nbeen to the hospitals. I have been to St. Rita's in Lima. I have been \nto Rainbow Babies in Cleveland. I have been to Cincinnati Children's \nHospital. I have seen these babies. These are tiny babies who are \naddicted, and they have to be taken through withdrawal.\n  The compassionate nurses and doctors who are doing it--God bless \nthem--I asked them: What is going to happen to these babies?\n  They told me: Rob, we don't know. We don't know the long-term \nconsequences because it is so new.\n  But it is dramatic and it is happening in all of your hospitals. \nThese neonatal units are now taking on a whole other task, which is \nhelping babies through withdrawal.\n  I visited folks who are not only pregnant but are addicted, and I \ntalked to them about what they are going through and what the \nconsequences are going to be, and it is sad. Many say: Rob, the grip of \naddiction is so great. I am now in treatment, but I worry about what is \ngoing to happen to my baby.\n  We also expand treatment for expectant and postpartum women for that \nreason. And these expectant and postpartum women who need this help can \nmake the right decision with more help from us. It expands residential \ntreatment programs for pregnant women who are struggling with \naddiction. It creates a pilot program to provide family-based services \nto women who are addicted to opiates.\n  CARA also helps veterans, as I said. It allows those veterans to get \ninto a veterans court, where they can get help to walk through how they \nget out of this addiction, how they get into recovery. They can get \nsupport from other veterans around them to provide the kind of help \nthey need to get out of this cycle of incarceration and addiction.\n  What do we say to the 40 million Americans who are struggling with \naddiction when they ask ``Why don't you guys act?'' The Senate acted 94 \nto 1. Why can't we get this done? It is time to move. They shouldn't \nhave to wait. We shouldn't have to wait.\n  To those 40 million who struggle, to those who think they can't \novercome this addiction, to those who believe there is no one out there \nto help them, the message is, you are not alone. There is hope. You can \nbeat this. I have seen it. There are people who care and want to help.\n  There are so many heartbreaking stories of addiction, but there are \nalso so many stories of hope. I think about Vanessa Perkins from \nNelsonville, OH. Vanessa became addicted to heroin. Once she became \naddicted, she also became a victim of sex trafficking.\n  Those two are related. In Ohio, they tell me that most sex \ntrafficking has now to do with heroin addiction. In other words, the \ntrafficker gets these women--usually women--addicted to heroin, and \nthat is one way they become dependent on their trafficker.\n  What Vanessa tells me is that it took her a long time to turn her \nlife around, but she was courageous and brave enough to seek treatment, \nand she is now back on track. For the last 6 years she has been helping \nothers, taking her experience and using it to help others deal with \ntheir addiction. She is on the board of a group called Freedom a la \nCart, which is a company in Columbus, OH, that I visited last month \nthat provides job opportunities for trafficking victims. They do a heck \nof a job and teach these women a trade, too--culinary arts. Now so many \nof these women who had been trafficked, who had been heroin addicts, \nare back on their feet, reunited with their families, and know the \ndignity and self-respect that come from the work they are doing and \nfrom helping others.\n  There is hope. Treatment can work.\n  Mr. President, leaders in the House say they want to move anti-heroin \nlegislation through regular order. Again, I heard today that one of the \nleaders said they are planning to take action. I had conversations with \nSpeaker Ryan on this issue. I had conversations with other leaders in \nthe House on it. I take them at their word. I am hopeful we will see \nthe House begin to act next week when that Chamber returns, but I will \nsay this: The House must act, and they must act soon. I am not going to \nbe patient on this. This is urgent, and people's lives are at stake. \nThe House must pass this bill so the President can sign it and so it \ncan begin to make a real difference in the lives of the people we \nrepresent. This is our responsibility. We need to take advantage of \nthis opportunity that the Senate has given us by this huge vote--94 to \n1--to get this legislation to the President and get it enacted into \nlaw.\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                     FLINT, MICHIGAN, WATER CRISIS\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, today I would like to speak about two \ndifferent subjects. Both are connected in the sense that they involve \nlack of action and people counting on us to act as a Senate.\n  The first involves the fact that today in the city of Flint, MI, we \nstill have people who can't drink the water coming out of the tap. I \nthink any one of us would have trouble if that happened for 1 day, but \nwe are talking about months and months--going on 2 years now--that we \nhave seen a system completely broken down because of decisions, because \nof lack of treating the water, a whole range of things.\n  From my perspective, the most important thing is the fact that people \nstill don't have access to clean, safe water. They can't bathe their \nbabies. They can't take a shower themselves. I can't imagine what it \nmust be like for families in Flint who are waiting and waiting for \nhelp.\n  I want to thank President Obama for doing what he can do through the \nadministration to help from the standpoint of health and nutrition and \neducation, but the fundamental problem is replacing the damaged pipes.\n  As my colleagues know, we have been working very hard and we have \ndeveloped a bipartisan proposal. I wish to thank the chair and ranking \nmember of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Senator Murkowski \nand Senator Cantwell, for working with us, and so many colleagues who \nare now bipartisan cosponsors on a bill with myself and Senator Peters. \nI wish to thank Senator Inhofe as chair of EPW and ranking member \nSenator Boxer and so many people who have\n\n[[Page S1792]]\n\ncome together to support this effort, not only for Flint, but we now \nare seeing headlines across the country about other areas where lead \npoisoning in water is a serious issue and where we have all kinds of \ncommunities with water infrastructure needs.\n  We have put together a proposal. We have a bipartisan proposal. We \nare ready to move forward. We need a vote on this proposal. As people \nin this building know, the junior Senator from Utah is holding us up \nfrom being able to get that vote. We have spent weeks now--weeks--\ntrying to find a way to get beyond this objection. We thought we had an \nagreement, and then the bar just keeps changing.\n  This is not a game. These are real people, and we are trying to solve \na real problem. We have put forward a proposal fully paid for that \nactually reduces the deficit, paid for out of a program that I care \ndeeply about because I authored it in 2007, and prior to Senator Peters \nbeing a Senator, when he was in the House, he was the champion of the \nprogram that we are offering to use as a payfor.\n  So I just want to remind everyone--and I am going to continue to come \nto the floor and remind colleagues every day--that a group of Americans \nin a city of 100,000 where there has been a Federal emergency declared \nare still waiting for us to act to help them--not to do the whole \nthing, not to pay for all of what needs to be done in terms of water \ninfrastructure, but to do our part as a Federal Government, as we have \ndone in communities across the country for other kinds of emergencies.\n  We need to help the children of Flint. Nine thousand children under \nthe age of six are being exposed to lead poisoning; some homes have \nexposure higher than a toxic waste dump. I can tell my colleagues as a \nmother and now as a grandmother, I would never tolerate something like \nthat. I can't imagine what is happening for families.\n  We have the opportunity to do something. It is easy. It is fully paid \nfor. It is fully paid for by something that colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle have wanted to eliminate--fully paid for. It helps \ncommunities across the country. Now we have a situation where one \nMember has indicated, well, it is not his problem. He doesn't care; it \nis not his problem.\n  I hope as Americans we are willing to say that other people's \nproblems--I would think we care about them, whether it is our own \nchildren, our own grandchildren, people we know or not. That is what we \nexpect when there are emergencies and disasters across the country. And \nwhether it is in the farm bill that I worked on with the distinguished \nPresiding Officer where we strengthened livestock disaster assistance--\neven though that is not a huge issue to me in the State of Michigan, \nbut I know it is for a lot of States and a lot of communities. That is \nwhat we do as Americans. We care about people and communities.\n  We have a group of people right now who are not being seen. I want my \ncolleagues to see this baby and the picture this represents of a group \nof people who are waiting for help and deserve help.\n\n\n                   Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to address something else now and turn to \nhistory to talk about somebody else who is waiting. He can drink his \nwater and take a shower. That is a good thing. But we have a very \ndistinguished jurist, the Chief Judge of the DC Court of Appeals, \nnominated by the President of the United States to be a Supreme Court \nJustice, who is waiting for the opportunity to be heard, to have a \nhearing, to meet with people, to have a vote, yes or no.\n  We have spoken a lot about the Constitution, about responsibilities, \nabout debates. Our three branches of government are sworn to uphold \nboth the written word of the Constitution and the spirit of the \nConstitution. This spirit was expressed in a series of articles \nbeginning in 1787. I wasn't there at the time. But in reading what our \nFounding Fathers said--those who framed the Constitution--I think it is \nimportant to look at what they intended through the Federalist Papers.\n  On April 1, 1788, Alexander Hamilton, writing in Federalist Paper No. \n76, outlined two specific roles for Supreme Court nominees: that the \nPresident nominate Justices and the Senate provide advice and consent. \nHamilton explained how the Senate held the power to reject a nominee, \nto prevent the appointment of unfit characters from family connection, \nfrom personal attachment, or from other biases.\n  As my colleagues know, Senators can investigate the character of a \nnominee by meeting the nominee in person, by holding hearings, and by \nlooking at their writings. At the Senate Judiciary Committee they can \nask the nominee questions in full view of the public. Based on \nresponses, if they believe a nominee does not have the appropriate \ncharacter, they can reject the nomination. They can vote no. That is \nour right as Senators.\n  But Senators in the current Republican majority are refusing to do \nany of that. They have said they will not hold hearings. Most of them \nwill not even meet with the nominee, Judge Merrick Garland. I want to \ncommend Republican Senators who are, in fact, meeting with Judge \nGarland. This is their job. This is our job--the job established for us \nby America's Founding Fathers--and a majority of the majority is \nrefusing to do it.\n\n  Now, according to the average time for moving a Supreme Court nominee \nthrough the process, if the Republican majority did their job, as \nprevious Senates did, then there would be a hearing of the Judiciary \nCommittee by April 27, but there is none scheduled. The Judiciary \nCommittee would hold a vote by May 12, but there is no vote coming. And \nbased on historical precedent, the Supreme Court nominee would then \ncome to the floor for a vote on confirmation before Memorial Day. But \nbecause my colleagues across the aisle are refusing to do their job, \nthat vote will not happen.\n  My Republican colleagues like to say that the Senate does not confirm \nSupreme Court nominees during a Presidential year, but that doesn't \nsquare with the facts. More than a dozen Supreme Court nominees have \nbeen confirmed by the Senate in an election year. In 1988, also a \nPresidential year, the Senate did its job by confirming President \nReagan's Supreme Court nominee, Justice Anthony Kennedy, with a \nDemocratically controlled Senate. In 1940, another Presidential \nelection year, the Senate did its job by confirming President Franklin \nRoosevelt's nominee, Justice Frank Murphy. In 1932, the Senate did its \njob by confirming President Hoover's Supreme Court nominee. In 1916, \nthe Senate did its job twice by confirming President Wilson's two \nnominees for the Supreme Court.\n  The U.S. Constitution was ratified in June 1788, just a few months \nafter Hamilton published the Federalist Paper I mentioned a few minutes \nago. And for nearly 228 years--228 years--during times of war, times of \npeace, periods of prosperity, and periods of economic hardship, America \nhas balanced the powers between the executive and the legislative \nbranches in selecting who would serve in the third branch of \ngovernment. We have done it during Democratic majorities and Republican \nmajorities for 228 years.\n  To those who are refusing to hold hearings on a nomination, my \nquestion is this: What has changed? What has changed this year? What is \nit about this President that causes him to be treated this way? What is \nit that is leading my colleagues to question the judgment and the \nwisdom of Alexander Hamilton and the rest of the Founding Fathers who \nsigned the Constitution and gave us the responsibility for advice and \nconsent?\n  In short, why now are you refusing to do your job? Just do your job. \nDo what we are paid to do.\n  Last month, I went over in front of the Supreme Court on a beautiful, \nsunny day when a lot of people were here visiting, and I talked to a \nnumber of citizens and asked them what they thought about what was \nhappening, the debate going on about filling a vacancy on the Supreme \nCourt. I also asked them what would happen to you if during a year you \ntold your employer that a major part of your job--a very big \nresponsibility that you have in your job--you were going to refuse to \ndo for a year or so. What would happen? Well, the answer is pretty \neasy. People said: I would be fired.\n  People say: Why aren't you doing your job? Why isn't the majority \ndoing its job? Because if you are not willing to do the work, why \nshould you have the job? Nobody else can do that in their job.\n\n[[Page S1793]]\n\n  That is why the polls show overwhelmingly that the American people \nside with those of us on the Democratic side, with all of us who stand \ntogether as Democratic Senators to say: Do your job. We are willing to \ndo our job. People stand with the Constitution and with the \noverwhelming history of our country.\n  It is very simple. It is a very simple idea. It is a phrase we say \nall the time in all kinds of circumstances. We say to our children, we \nsay to people we work with: Just do your job. Well, this is our job. \nHold a hearing, meet with the nominee, have a vote. You can vote yes; \nyou can vote no. You could skip that day. But this judge deserves a \nvote, and it is our responsibility to vote and to fill the vacancy on \nthe highest Court in the land. That is what the American people expect \nus to do. That is what they deserve.\n  It is time that the Senate do its job.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss several \nprovisions in an amendment to the FAA reauthorization bill that is \ncurrently before the Senate and that specifically benefits my home \nState of Louisiana.\n  There are more than 253 air traffic control towers throughout the \ncountry operating through a successful public-private partnership \ncalled the Federal Contract Tower Program. This program is especially \ncritical to rural areas--as I have in Louisiana and as does the \nPresiding Officer--to ensure that America's airspace and the traveling \npublic are safe. However, there are currently 30 towers awaiting the \nFAA to finalize an internal agency formula called the benefit-cost \nanalysis, referred to as the BCA, which will allow eligible towers to \nenter the Federal Contract Tower Program. One of these airports is the \nHammond Northshore Regional Airport in Hammond, LA.\n  The Federal Contract Tower Program has been in place for more than 30 \nyears and is a prime example of an effective public-private partnership \nbetween government and the private sector. Contract towers handle \napproximately 28 percent of the Nation's air traffic control tower \noperations but account for only 14 percent of the FAA's total tower \noperations budget. Repeated studies by the U.S. Department of \nTransportation inspector general have shown that the Contract Tower \nProgram increases aviation safety while reducing costs to taxpayers and \nthe Federal Government. It is also important to note that approximately \n80 percent of the contract controller workforce are veterans.\n  Congress has demonstrated numerous times in bipartisan fashion the \nmerit and need for the Federal Contract Tower Program. Given the \nsuccess of the program and the increasing likelihood of further FAA \ndelays, I am pleased the Commerce Committee included language in the \nFAA reauthorization bill to strengthen and improve the Federal Contract \nTower Program. Senators Cornyn, Vitter, Portman, and Wicker have been \nleaders on this issue, and their work is greatly appreciated.\n  Currently, America's trade and economy are being hampered because \nmany cargo planes from other countries are prohibited from flying into \nU.S. airports because they have not been upgraded to newer types of \ntechnology. Some aircraft are what is called ``Stage 2 aircraft.'' \nThese aircraft were phased out following the passage of the Airport \nNoise and Capacity Act of 1990, which mandated the phaseout for Stage 2 \naircraft over 75,000 pounds. I have introduced an amendment that would \npermit flights to a small number of airports under limited \ncircumstances for revenue and nonrevenue flights of Stage 2 aircraft \nover 75,000 pounds.\n  One of the airports that meets the criteria is the Acadiana Regional \nAirport in New Iberia, LA. This airport is located in a heavy \nindustrial complex and surrounded by agricultural land. The Acadiana \nRegional Airport has an advantage over other types of airports because \nit is surrounded by land use compatible with airport operations. \nAdditionally, it is situated near the Port of Iberia, which is home to \nmore than 100 companies employing close to 5,000 people in industries \nsuch as construction, energy, equipment rental, and trucking. This \nwould bolster Louisiana's economy, help working families, and improve \nAmerica's ability to trade with the world.\n  Louisiana's economy relies on the thriving maritime industry. In 2014 \na study from the Transportation Institute showed that 54,850 maritime-\nrelated jobs contribute more than $11 billion annually to Louisiana's \neconomy. One in every 83 Louisiana jobs is connected to the domestic \nmaritime industry, nearly twice that of any other State.\n  With ports along the Mississippi and Red Rivers, our State sees \nvessels of varying sizes and types. While loading cargo, these ships \nmust drain ballast water that they have taken on to maintain the \nbalance of the ship. This can have varying degrees of environmental \neffects, with costly and confusing State and Federal regulations making \ncompliance difficult.\n  Senator Rubio is sponsoring the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act, \nwhich creates a uniform, enforceable, and scientifically based national \nstandard on ballast water discharges. This is needed in order to \nsimplify the highly complicated and overly burdensome patchwork of \nState and Federal regulations that are in place today.\n  Everyone I talk to in Louisiana's maritime industry and also in the \ninland marine, which would take the agriculture products from States \nsuch as the State the Presiding Officer represents, says it is \nnecessary for these regulations to be harmonized, and they emphasize \nthe importance of passing this bill. I am a cosponsor of this bill, and \nI am glad to see that Senator Rubio has filed the amendment to the bill \nwe are considering on the floor today.\n  The FAA Reauthorization Act contains many measures that will protect \nAmericans, improve our economy, and protect our environment. I urge all \nmy fellow Senators to support the bill and these amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3512, as Modified\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Aviation safety, as much as all national \nsecurity, must be of paramount importance. I am increasingly concerned \nwith reports from across the country that Secure Identification Display \nArea, SIDA, badges have gone missing, either through loss or theft. \nThese badges, which grant access to secure areas of airports, allow \nemployees to bypass traditional security checkpoints and, in the wrong \nhands, can pose a considerable security threat.\n  An amendment considered and adopted earlier today by the Senate, \nThune amendment No. 3512, is aimed at addressing this problem and would \nimplement additional accountability and oversight methods to ensure \nthat these SIDA badges do not fall into the wrong hands. It would \nprovide for further employer accountability and allow for increased \nfines and enforcement actions against workers that fail to report the \nloss or theft of a badge. These are well-intentioned goals and ones \nthat I support.\n  I opposed this amendment, however, because extraneous provisions \nincluded in the amendment directly contradict bipartisan efforts in \nthis Congress to reform our criminal justice system, including by \nreducing unnecessary barriers to employment for people with criminal \nrecords. The amendment will require the TSA Administrator to propose \nincreasing the lookback period from 10 years to 15 years for background \nchecks of airport and airline workers who have or are seeking SIDA \nbadges. Under current regulations, there are a number of offenses that \ndisqualify a potential employee, if the individual was convicted of the \noffense during the 10-year lookback period.\n  The amendment would also require the TSA Administrator to consider \nadding more offenses to the list of disqualifying crimes. Disqualifying \noffenses already include a number of low-level offenses, such as felony \ndrug possession. These provisions would exacerbate barriers to reentry. \nThe scope of the changes will still exclude many potential employees \nand lead to the firing of a number of current employees.\n\n[[Page S1794]]\n\nI ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the conclusion \nof my remarks a letter from Transport Workers Union of America, the \nAFL-CIO, the Association of Flight Attendants, CWA--the Communication \nWorkers of America, the International Association of Machinists and \nAerospace Workers, the Transportation Trades Department--AFL-CIO, the \nLeadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, and the National \nEmployment Law Project in opposition to this amendment.\n  I am committed to working with Senator Thune to ensure greater \naccountability for Secure Identification Display Area badges. It must \nbe a priority. I hope that he and others will work with me through the \nconference of this bill to eliminate these barriers to employment for \nindividuals with certain criminal records.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    April 6, 2016.\n\nOppose the Airport Security Enhancement and Oversight Act (S. 2361) as \n         an Amendment to the FAA Reauthorization Act (H.R. 636)\n\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the undersigned organizations, \n     we write to oppose any efforts to expand background checks on \n     aviation workers as proposed in the Airport Security \n     Enhancement and Oversight Act (S. 2361). In particular, we \n     are opposed to the inclusion of S. 2361 as an amendment to \n     H.R. 636, the FAA Reauthorization Act, which is currently \n     under consideration in the Senate. As drafted, S. 2361 would \n     undermine reforms around the nation that have reduced \n     barriers to employment of people with criminal records, thus \n     representing a serious setback for the bipartisan criminal \n     justice reform movement.\n       The Airport Security Enhancement and Oversight Act would \n     alter the requirements for airport workers to obtain Secure \n     Identification Display Area (SIDA) badges by instructing the \n     Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Administrator to \n     propose increasing the lookback period on many aviation \n     workers' employment background checks from 10 years to 15 \n     years. This provision undermines the goal of promoting \n     rehabilitation, and it conflicts with the substantial \n     research documenting that criminal history lookback periods \n     should not extend back more than seven years.\n       The bill also instructs the TSA Administrator to consider \n     increasing disqualifying criminal offenses to include crimes \n     that do not appear to be related to transportation security. \n     These reforms would have far reaching impact and exacerbate \n     barriers to reentry. As many as one in three Americans have a \n     criminal record and nearly half of U.S. children have a \n     parent with a criminal record, creating life-long barriers to \n     opportunity, including employment, for entire families. This \n     change will also have an overwhelming discriminatory impact \n     on communities of color, who have been hardest hit by a \n     flawed criminal justice system. Moreover, this proposal does \n     not account for the compelling evidence documenting the \n     impact of gainful employment on those who have previously \n     been convicted of a crime. Full integration into society is \n     essential to successful anti-terror programs and efforts to \n     lower recidivism rates. By requiring the dismissal of many \n     current employees who have worked in a position for years, \n     the legislation ignores these widely accepted principles.\n       We do support some elements of this legislation. The bill \n     would create a waiver process for those who are denied \n     credentials. This would ensure the consideration of \n     circumstances from which it may be concluded that an \n     individual does not pose a risk of terrorism or to security. \n     The waiver process would consider the circumstances \n     surrounding an offense, restitution, mitigation remedies, and \n     other factors. This provision is modeled on a very successful \n     program in the Transportation Worker Identification \n     Credential (TWIC), a credential that is similar to a SIDA, \n     which is used at secure areas of port facilities.\n       We strongly encourage you oppose the inclusion of any \n     amendment providing blanket categorical exclusions that would \n     increase background checks on aviation workers and act as \n     additional barriers to the employment of people with criminal \n     records. Thank you for your consideration. If you have any \n     questions, please feel free to contact Brendan Danaher, \n     Director of Government Affairs at the Transport Workers \n     Union, or Greg Regan, Senior Legislative Representative at \n     the Transportation Trades Department, AFL-CIO.\n           Sincerely,\n     Transport Workers Union of America.\n     AFL-CIO.\n     Association of Flight Attendants--CWA.\n     Communication Workers of America.\n     International Association of Machinists and Aerospace \n     Workers.\n     The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.\n     National Employment Law Project.\n     Transportation Trades Department, AFL-CIO.\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I was absent from today's votes on \nthree amendments to the pending business, H.R. 636, the vehicle for a \nbill to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration, due to events \nI attended with President Obama in Illinois. Had I been present, my \nvotes would have been as follows.\n  On rollcall vote No. 41, Thune amendment No. 3512, as modified, I \nwould have voted against adoption. I am concerned about the impact that \na provision in this amendment will have on formerly incarcerated \nindividuals who have successfully reintegrated into society after \ncompleting sentences for low-level crimes unrelated to transportation \nsecurity. The provision, which will make it more difficult for these \nindividuals to obtain certain aviation jobs years after a criminal \nconviction, undermines efforts to reduce barriers to reentry, lower \nrecidivism rates, and reform our criminal justice system.\n  On rollcall vote No. 42, Heinrich amendment No. 3482, as modified, I \nwould have voted in favor of adoption. This amendment will further \nstrengthen the homeland by increasing security in soft targets at \nairports, in areas like check-ins and baggage claims, where terrorists \nrecently carried out deadly attacks in Brussels. The amendment will \nexpand and enhance visible deterrents, create a new eligible use under \nHomeland Security grants for training exercises to enhance preparedness \nfor active shooter incidents, and authorize and make explicit that \nHomeland Security grants can be used for airport and surface \ntransportation in these nonsecure soft target areas. I am proud to have \ncosponsored this amendment.\n  On rollcall vote No. 43, Schumer amendment No. 3483, I would have \nvoted in favor of adoption. This amendment would establish consumer \nsafeguards like minimum standards for space for passengers on \naircrafts, including the size and pitch of seats, the amount of leg \nroom, and the width of aisles.\n  As these votes demonstrate, after a series of temporary extensions, \nthe Senate is finally considering a long-term FAA reauthorization bill. \nIn light of recent threats both here and abroad, it is important that \nwe get this right. I look forward to continuing to work with my \ncolleagues on a bipartisan basis on these important security reforms, \nconsumer protections, and other pressing aviation-related issues in the \ncoming days and weeks.\n  Mr. CASSIDY.

The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                   Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we have a unique opportunity for the \nAmerican people to have a voice in the direction of the Supreme Court. \nThe American people should be afforded the opportunity to weigh in on \nthis very important matter.\n  Our side, meaning the Republican side, believes very strongly that \nthe people deserve to be heard, and they should be allowed to decide \nthrough their vote for the next President the type of person who should \nbe on the Supreme Court.\n  As I have stated previously, this is a reasonable approach, it is a \nfair approach, and it is a historical approach--one echoed by then-\nChairman Biden, Senator Schumer, and other Senators.\n  The other side, meaning the Democratic side, has been talking a great \ndeal about the so-called pressure campaign to try to get Members to \nchange their position. It is no secret that the White House strategy is \nto put pressure on this chairman of the Judiciary Committee and other \nRepublicans in the hopes that we can be worn down and ultimately agree \nto hold hearings on the nominee.\n  This pressure campaign, which is targeted at me and a handful of my \ncolleagues, is based on the supposition that I and they will crack and \nmove forward on the consideration of President Obama's pick.\n  This strategy has failed to recognize that I am no stranger to \npolitical pressure and to strong-arm tactics--not necessarily just from \nDemocratic Presidents but also from Republican Presidents.\n  When I make a decision based on sound principle, I am not about to \nflip-flop because the left has organized what they call a pressure \ncampaign.\n  As many of my colleagues--and especially my constituents--know, I \nhave done battle with administrations of both parties. I have fought \nover irresponsible budgets, waste, fraud, and policy disagreements. I \nhave made tough decisions. I have stuck with those tough decisions \nregardless of what pressure was applied.\n  The so-called pressure being applied to me now is nothing. It is \nabsolutely nothing compared to what I withstood from heavyhanded White \nHouse political operations in the past.\n  Let me say, by the way, that most of that has come from Republican \nWhite Houses. To just give a few examples, in 1981, as a new Member of \nthe Senate and a brand-new member of the Senate Budget Committee, I \nvoted against President Reagan's first budget proposal because we were \npromised a balanced budget and it didn't balance. I remember very \nspecifically the Budget Committee markup in April 1981 on President \nReagan's first budget.\n  It happened to be that I wasn't alone on this. I was one of three \nRepublicans to vote against that resolution because it did not put us \non a path to a balanced budget. You can imagine that when a budget has \nto come out on a party-line vote, you cannot lose three Republicans, \nand three Republicans who were elected in 1980 on a promise to balance \nthe budget did not go along with it.\n  What a loss this was for this new President Reagan--that his budget \nmight not get adopted by the Budget Committee. We were under immense \npressure to act on the President's budget regardless of the deficits \nthat it would cause. But we stood on principle and didn't succumb to \nthe pressure.\n  As an example, right after that vote where the President's budget \nwasn't voted out of the Budget Committee, I was home on a spring \nrecess. I remember calls from the White House. I remember threats from \nthe Chamber of Commerce while I was home for Easter break, even \ninterrupting my town meetings. Four years later, I led the charge to \nfreeze spending and to end the Reagan defense buildup as a way to get \nthe Federal budget under control. In 1984 I teamed up with Senator \nBiden, a Democrat, and Senator Kassebaum of Kansas, a Republican, to \npropose a freeze of the defense budget that would have cut hundreds of \nbillions of dollars from the annual deficit.\n\n  At the time, it was known as the Kassebaum-Grassley Budget or the KGB \ndefense freeze. We were going to make sure that across-the-board \nbudgets were responsible.\n  For months, I endured pressure from the Reagan administration and \nfrom my Republican colleagues who argued a freeze on defense spending \nwould constitute unilateral disarmament. President Reagan had put \ntogether a less aggressive deficit reduction plan. We didn't think it \nwent far enough. My bipartisan plan was attacked for being dangerous \nand causing draconian cuts to the defense budget. I knew it was \nrealistic and a responsible approach. I didn't back down.\n  We forced a vote that year in the Budget Committee. We forced a vote \non the Senate floor on May 2, 1984, and that particular year we were \nnot successful. However, this effort required the Senate and the Nation \nto have a debate about a growing defense budget. We started that \ndebate, about the waste and inefficiency in the Pentagon and the \ngrowing Federal fiscal deficits. Despite the weeks-long pressure from \nconservatives in the Reagan administration, I did not back down because \nI knew the policy was on my side.\n  In this process I stood up to pressure from President Reagan, Defense \nSecretary Casper Weinberger, Secretary Barry Goldwater, Senator John \nTower, Chairman of the Budget Committee, and many others. I remember a \nmeeting at the White House where I reminded the President that he had \nbeen talking through the campaign about the Welfare queens impacting \nthe budget. It happens that I reminded him there were Defense queens as \nwell.\n  I started doing oversight on the Defense Department. It wasn't long \nbefore the evidence of waste and fraud began appearing. We uncovered \ncontractors that billed the Defense Department $435 for a claw hammer, \n$750 for toilet seats, $695 for ashtrays. We even found a coffee pot \nthat cost $7,600.\n  I had no problem finding Democrats to join my oversight effort back \nthen, but it is interesting how difficult it is to find bipartisan help \nwhen doing oversight in the current Democrat administration. \nNevertheless, 12 months later, on May 2, 1985, after a year of\n\n[[Page S1796]]\n\nwork to make the case that the Defense Department needed structural \nreforms and slower spending growth, I was successful. My amendment to \nfreeze the defense budget and allow for increases based on inflation \nwas agreed to when a motion to table failed by a vote of 48 to 51.\n  A majority of the Republicans opposed me, and a majority of the \nDemocrats were with me. That didn't matter because I knew we were doing \nthe right thing. I went against my own party, my own President, to hold \nthe Pentagon accountable, and I never backed off.\n  I had a similar experience with President George W. Bush in 1991. In \nJanuary 1991, the Senate debated a resolution to authorize the use of \nU.S. Armed Forces to remove Saddam Hussein's forces from Kuwait. I \nopposed the resolution because I felt the economic and diplomatic \nsanctions that I voted for should have been given more time to work. I \nwas not ready to give up on sanctions in favor of war.\n  In the end, I was one of just two Republicans, along with Senator \nHatfield of Oregon, to oppose the resolution. I was under pressure from \nPresident Bush, Vice President Quayle, and White House Chief of Staff \nJohn Sununu. I was even pressured by Iowa Governor Terry Branstad. I \nheard from a lot of Iowans, particularly Republicans, who were \ndisappointed and even angry with my position. Some were even \nconsidering a public rebuke because of my vote. As one of just two \nRepublicans, it was difficult to differ with a Republican President on \nsuch a major issue. But as I stated at the time, my decision was above \nany partisanship. It was a decision of conscience rather than a matter \nof Republican versus Democrat.\n  After a tremendous amount of soul-searching, I did what I thought was \nright, regardless of the political pressure. The same is true today \nwith regard to the Supreme Court vacancy.\n  Under President George W. Bush, I faced another dilemma. The \nPresident and the Republican congressional leadership determined that \nthey wanted to provide $1.6 trillion in tax relief in 2001.\n  I was chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance. The problem is, we \nhad a Senate that was divided 50-50 at the time. The parties' numbers \nalso equal, on the Senate Finance Committee. I had two members on my \nside who were reluctant to support a huge tax cut because they had \nconcerns about the deficit and the debt.\n  As we saw a few years later, their concerns were not totally \nunwarranted. But, at the time, the administration leadership would have \nnothing to do with anything except what the President wanted--$1.6 \ntrillion in tax relief. Obviously, the White House wasn't thinking \nabout how many Republicans might vote against it, and when you have a \n50-50 Senate, you can't lose a lot of Republicans.\n  After very difficult negotiations, I finally rounded up enough votes \nto support $1.3 trillion in tax relief. A hailstorm of criticism \nfollowed. There were Republican House Members who held press \nconferences denouncing the fact that the Committee wasn't able get \nenough votes for the whole $1.6 trillion. Those House Members were more \nprofessional in their criticism of my position, than what we currently \nwitness almost every day from the current minority leader about my role \nas chairman of the Judiciary Committee. But, it was still a very \ncontentious and difficult period that included both the budget and the \nreconciliation process.\n  Minority Leader Reid has already recently brought up the pressure I \ncame under in regard to ObamaCare back in 2009. Of course, his version \nis his usual attempt to rewrite the actual history. At that time, I was \nthe ranking member of the Finance Committee. I was involved in very in-\ndepth negotiations to try to come up with a health care solution. We \nstarted in November of 2008. We had negotiations between three \nRepublicans and three Democrats on the Finance Committee. We met for \nhours and hours at a time.\n  We met between November 2008 and mid-September 2009, and then the \nother side decided they ought to go political and not worry about \nRepublicans. The minority leader, in his usual inaccurate statement of \nfacts has tried to say that Republicans walked out of those \nnegotiations on ObamaCare. The fact is, we were given a deadline and \ntold that if we didn't agree with the latest draft of the bill, then \nDemocrats would have to move on.\n  I would suggest that anybody in the Senate who wants some reference \non this should talk to Senator Snowe or Senator Enzi. I was the other \nRepublican. Talk to Senator Baucus, talk to Senator Conrad and the \nthen-Senator from New Mexico. The President called six of us to the \nWhite House in early August of 2009. The first question I got was this: \nWould you, Senator Grassley, be willing to go along with two or three \nRepublicans to have a bipartisan bill with ObamaCare at that point? And \nI said: Mr. President, the answer is no. What do you think we have been \nworking on for 9 months? We have been working, trying to get a broad \nbipartisan agreement. It's something like 70 to 75 votes you need to \nget if you really want to have a changed social policy and have it \nstick.\n  We didn't abandon this until 2009. But my idea is that probably it \nwas that meeting at the White House in early August 2009 where this \nPresident decided: we don't want to mess around with those Republicans \nanymore. We have 60 votes; we are going to move ahead. Well, that \nhappened then in that September.\n  The fact is, we were given that deadline, and we were shoved out of \nthe room. So when we didn't bow to this pressure and agree to \nDemocratic demands, it ended up being a partisan document. That is why \nit still doesn't have the majority support of the American people.\n  I want the minority leader to know that is what happened, not what he \ndescribed a couple of weeks ago. Eventually, as we all know, the former \nmajority leader--now minority leader--had his staff rewrite the bill \nthat came out of the HELP Committee and in secret in the back rooms of \nhis leadership office. And we ended up with the disaster called \nObamaCare that we have today.\n  The Senate minority leader also recently proclaimed that rather than \nfollow Leader McConnell--and these are Senator Reid's words--\n``Republicans are sprinting in the opposite direction.'' The minority \nleader also wishfully claimed that the Republican facade was cracking \non the issue. Senator Schumer fancifully stated that ``because of the \npressure, Republicans are beginning to change.''\n  You can almost hear the ruby slippers on the other side clicking \nwhile they wish this narrative they describe were true. The fact is, \nthe pressure they have applied thus far has had no impact on this \nSenator's principled position or the principled position of almost \neverybody on this side of the aisle. Our side knows and believes that \nwhat we are doing is right, and when that is the case, it is not hard \nto withstand the outrage and the pressure they and the White House have \nmanufactured.\n  The pressure we are now getting on this issue pales in comparison to \nthe pressure I have endured and withstood from both Democrats and \nRepublicans in the past.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nbill that is on the floor, the Federal Aviation Administration \nReauthorization Act. I thank Senator Thune and Senator Nelson for their \nleadership.\n  I serve on the Commerce Committee. I am proud of this bill. Our State \nhas a long history of aviation. It was the childhood home of Charles \nLindbergh. We are home to the Minneapolis-St. Paul International \nAirport, the 13th busiest airport in the United States. We are home to \nCirrus Design Corporation in Duluth, which makes planes and is a very \nsuccessful company, as well as many people whose jobs and ways of life \ndepend on the aviation industry, not to mention the 148th Fighter Wing \nNational Guard base, as well as the one in the Twin Cities and the one \nin Duluth.\n  I see my colleague from Arizona is here, so I will focus on one \nissue, and that is aviation security.\n  Mr. President, 9/11 was our country's wake-up call that our \ntransportation system is a target, and the attacks in Brussels last \nmonth remind us that we must continue to do everything we can to \nstrengthen security, and not just in our security lines at the airports \nbut also in places like baggage claim areas and other forms of \ntransportation, like train stations. We need to make sure\n\n[[Page S1797]]\n\nour soft-target areas, as they are called--like the security lines, \nbaggage claims, and ticketing counters at the airport--are safe.\n  I am a cosponsor of the amendment that passed today that will help \naddress the issue by doubling the number of visible intermodal \nprevention and response teams from 30 to 60. These teams help provide \nimportant deterrent security at potential air and ground transportation \ntargets across our country.\n  This amendment which passed today will also improve existing security \nsystems in airports and train stations by expanding bomb-sniffing dog \npatrols, law enforcement training for emergency situations, and \nsecurity in all perimeter areas of the airport.\n  We must also improve the secure areas of airports where airline \nemployees have secure access to what are called sterile areas. In \nMarch, as we all know, an airline employee was arrested after \nattempting to use his badge to enter the boarding area of a terminal \nfrom the tarmac, bypassing security gates. He had a backpack with \n$282,000 in it. In the same month, we saw another employee try to \nsmuggle 70 pounds of cocaine in her suitcase at LAX, and she was caught \nat a security checkpoint. The most egregious breach of security \nhappened at the Atlanta airport, where airline employees helped to \nfacilitate a gun-smuggling ring and were successful at getting guns on \nat least 20 flights from Atlanta to New York. Needless to say, there \ncontinues to be significant concern, as much as we know that the vast \nmajority of our airline employees are hard-working and good employees.\n  Eighty-five Senators just voted in support of the Airport Security \nEnforcement and Oversight Act, a bill I cosponsored that would help \naddress this issue of security at the airport, but I would like to add \nour own story out of Minnesota-St. Paul.\n  First of all, it is a story of inefficiency, so we made a \nreconfiguration at our airport. There were lines at one point where the \naverage time was 45 to 50 minutes--average time. That was just a month \nago. There were passengers waiting for 2 hours and missing their \nflights. There were simply not enough TSA agents. They were out at a \ntraining, which was, of course, necessary because of the inspector \ngeneral's report that came out this June and showed some severe \nproblems in security at our airports. So we had a perfect storm of \npeople out for training, a new reconfiguration, and finally the spring \nbreak travel. But it was simply unacceptable when our taxpayers are \npaying for TSA. In fact, this Congress authorized $100 million--$90 \nmillion more than they asked for in the last budget year.\n  I have appreciated TSA Administrator Neffenger coming to Minnesota, \nsaying that it was unacceptable, saying that they were hiring people \nwith the budget money that was provided.\n  There are also plans to use these K-9 units not just in the \nperimeters of the bill we passed today but also on these lines. Not \nonly do these dog teams add more security, by working a line of \npassengers, they actually speed up that line because then those \npassengers essentially become precheck passengers and they don't have \nto be prechecked. They become prechecked because of the dogs, and that \nspeeds up everything for all airport passengers.\n  I think we have seen enough of these terrorist attacks across the \ncountry, planes with bombs going down in other places. We know this is \na danger. We don't want this in our homeland.\n  I appreciate the support of my colleagues on these amendments. We \nwill continue to work on security issues.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                      Permanent VA Choice Card Act\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the urgent need \nfor Congress to reform how the Department of Veterans Affairs delivers \nhealth care to our Nation's veterans. One of the great scandals and \nshameful aspects of the greatest Nation in the world is the way we \ntreat our veterans. I believe important progress has been made since \nthe scandal in which veterans died, waiting on nonexisting wait-lists \nfor care at the Phoenix VA medical center and VA hospitals around the \ncountry, but we have a long way to go to fulfill our solemn promise to \nevery veteran who has served and sacrificed.\n  In the matter of that terrible scandal, I was proud that Congress \nquickly acted to pass the bipartisan Veterans Access, Choice, and \nAccountability Act. That bill was an important first step--and I \nemphasize ``first step''--in reforming the gross mismanagement and lack \nof accountability at the VA.\n  In my view, the hallmark of the bill is the Choice Card Program, \nwhich for the first time allows any veteran who is waiting more than 30 \ndays for an appointment or who lives more than 40 miles from a VA \nhealth care facility to receive a Choice Card that they can use to \nvisit a participating doctor in their community instead of being forced \nto wait with no recourse.\n  So how is the VA Choice Card working? My colleagues in the Senate and \nI continue to hear from veterans in Arizona and across the country \nabout their ongoing problems receiving care. Veterans find that VA \nstaff don't know about the Choice Card or how to authorize care through \nit. Veterans are forced to wait on hold for hours with a call center in \norder to schedule an appointment. Community doctors and hospitals that \nvolunteered to participate in the Choice Program are not getting paid \nfor their services. Veterans who are able to use the Choice Card once \nand need to use it again have to start all over from scratch. Veterans \nstill have to drive long distances to get prescription medications.\n  There should be no doubt that the VA is failing to fully and \neffectively implement the Choice Card. In doing so, it is preventing \nour veterans from receiving the flexible care they have earned and \ndeserve.\n  We know that when implemented correctly, the Choice Card Program is \nimproving care for our veterans. After an extremely difficult start, \nthe VA Choice Card is now authorizing more than 110,000 appointments \nfor veteran care per month--over 5,000 per workday. Each of these \nappointments represents a veteran's appointment that would otherwise be \ndelayed and pending for months in the VA scheduling system. It also \nfrees up appointments at the VA for veterans who do not use the Choice \nCard, helping countless veterans receive an appointment faster.\n  We have also seen what can happen when the VA properly reimburses \ncommunity doctors for their services. In the western region alone, \ncommunity doctors participating in the VA Choice Program have increased \nfrom around 95,000 to nearly 160,000. More than 90 percent of all \ndoctors are being paid within 30 days, and the vast majority of doctors \nare choosing to stay in the VA Choice Program--mainly because of their \nlove of country--to treat our Nation's veterans.\n  Moreover, we have seen that when the VA is equipped to handle the \ndemand for Choice Program appointments made through call centers, \nveterans are getting their appointments faster. Recent openings of new \ncall centers have greatly reduced wait and on-hold times among our \nveterans. Today, wait time averages for veterans calling into the \nwestern region call centers for Choice Card appointments are less than \n1 minute.\n  As a result of a positive VA policy change last year, contractors are \nnow able to contact veterans and ensure that their authorizations for \ncare are approved ahead of time so that appointments can be made much \nfaster over the phone.\n  While we are seeing important progress as a result of the Choice \nCard, far too many veterans are still experiencing long wait and on-\nhold times with call centers and confronting difficulties getting an \nappointment. Unfortunately, some veterans, veterans service \norganizations, and opponents of the VA Choice Card cite these \nshortcomings as evidence that the whole Choice Card Program is broken \nand needs to be eliminated. These opponents are wrong, and they know \nit. The problem isn't the Choice Card; it is that the VA refuses to \nimplement it correctly.\n  Instead of working to solve the problems at the VA head-on, the same \nbureaucrats who have completely bungled the implementation of the VA \nChoice Card are using their own failures as an excuse to shut down the \nentire program. Allowing them to do so would only send veterans back to \nthe unacceptable status quo of never-ending\n\n[[Page S1798]]\n\nwait times for appointments. Does anybody want to return to the status \nquo?\n  I refuse to send our veterans back to the nonexistent wait-lists that \nled to the scandal of denied and delayed care in the first place. Every \nrepresentative in Congress and every official at the VA should too. \nAccording to a poll recently released by Gallup, the American people \noverwhelmingly agree. Ninety-one percent of survey respondents believe \nthat veterans should be allowed to get health care from any provider \nwho accepts Medicare, not just the VA.\n  This chart describes the main problems with VA health care before the \nChoice Program. Today, military and civilian retirees; Federal \nemployees, including VA employees; ObamaCare enrollees; civilians on \nemployer insurance plans; and refugees and illegal immigrants have the \nability to choose their doctors. The only group of Americans who is \nstill being denied universal choice in health care is disabled \nveterans. How is it that we have created a system where virtually \neveryone in America gets to choose their doctor except for our Nation's \ndisabled veterans?\n  Our veterans want and need the opportunity to choose the health care \nthat works best for them. It is simply unacceptable that half a million \nveterans nationwide today are waiting for a medical appointment that is \nscheduled more than 30 days from now. We can address this crisis now by \nmaking simple changes to the law. Under the law, the VA Choice Card \npilot program expires next year. We cannot and will not go back to the \nway our VA operated before the scandal.\n  While some senior VA leaders are aggressively implementing the Choice \nProgram, many others believe veterans should be forced to stay within \nthe walls of the VA no matter what. Making the program permanent will \nsend a clear message that we refuse to send veterans back to the days \nof denied and delayed care. That is why I introduced legislation to \nmake the VA Choice Card permanent and universal. I believe every \nveteran--no matter where they live or how long they are waiting for an \nappointment--should have the ability to see a doctor of their choice in \ntheir community.\n\n  Last week I held a townhall meeting with veterans in Phoenix, AZ, \nalong with Mike Broomhead, a distinguished leader in our community. \nWith tears in their eyes and frustration in their voices, veterans \ndescribed the unending wait times for appointments and difficulty \nobtaining and using the Choice Card to receive the care they want and \nneed. More than 2 years after the scandal in care first arose in \nPhoenix, AZ, and more than a year after reform legislation was signed \ninto law, the VA is still failing our veterans.\n  It doesn't have to be this way. There are additional steps we can \ntake now to reform this broken health care system. That is why I \nrecently announced my Care Veterans Deserve action plan. The elements \nof my plan address some of the most urgent problems still plaguing the \nVA.\n  First, the action plan proposes keeping the VA open later during the \nweek and opening the VA on weekends for local doctors and nurses to \ntreat our veterans. This would address the most common complaint we \nhear that wait times for appointments are still too long. In Arizona, \nwait times have gotten worse--not better--over the last year, with more \nthan 10 percent of all the Arizona veterans having to wait more than 30 \ndays for care at the VA.\n  Despite these long wait times, veterans are still not allowed to make \nappointments past 3 p.m. during the week and have very few appointment \noptions on weekends. VA employees abruptly close clinics no matter what \na veteran needs at the end of the day. By keeping the VA open later and \nadding hours on weekends, we can address these unacceptably high wait \ntimes and maximize the use of our VA facilities.\n  I have also proposed in the Care Veterans Deserve action plan that \nthe VA allow community walk-in clinics to treat veterans for minor \ninjuries and illnesses such as a cold, the flu, allergies, sinus \ninfections, immunizations, vaccines, sore throats, and minor headaches. \nAgain, this would greatly reduce the need for veterans to visit VA \nemergency rooms after hours and would free up appointments for everyone \nwaiting for care at the VA.\n  The plan also proposes that we require VA pharmacies to stay open \nuntil 8 p.m. during the week and for at least 8 hours on Saturday and \nSundays. This would tackle a common complaint among our working \nveterans who cannot visit VA pharmacies during their limited workday \nhours to obtain a prescription. It is absurd that a civilian can go to \na pharmacy 24 hours a day in most cities in America, but VA pharmacies \nclose early on weekdays and completely on the weekends.\n  I also propose in this action plan that individual VA hospitals \nundergo peer review from the best in health care: Mayo Clinic, \nCleveland Clinic--there is a long line of them--and other top-tier \nhealth care networks. I was disappointed that the independent review \nrequired by the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act only \nresulted in a high-level review of the VA health care system. Its \nfindings were so broad and general that they provided Congress with \nvery little guidance on what is happening at individual VA hospitals in \nour States. By requiring the VA to undergo peer reviews from the best \nin health care, we will have better insight into how to fully reform \nthe VA health care system.\n  I intend to include the elements of that action plan in a bill I will \nintroduce in this Congress. By enacting legislation as soon as \npossible, we can fix the serious inequity in veterans health care. It \nis absurd to me and many others that virtually every American receives \nFederal subsidies for choice and freedom in health care while veterans \nare forced to wait in line and ask permission from a VA bureaucrat \nbefore getting access to care.\n  I thank my colleagues for working with me on these and other measures \nthat will help finish the work we started nearly 2 years ago with the \nVeteran Access, Choice and Accountability Act and urge passage of my \ncommonsense reforms as soon as possible.\n  Before I close, I want to take a moment to applaud the efforts of my \nfriend from Georgia, the chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, Johnny Isakson, for his leadership, particularly on the \nissue of accountability at the VA. One of the most disgraceful aspects \nof the scandal at the VA is that only a small number of senior VA \nexecutives responsible for the wait-time scandal were fired. This was \ndespite the fact that Congress provided the VA Secretary broad \nauthority to hold corrupt executives accountable for wrongdoing. I look \nforward to working with Chairman Isakson and my colleagues in the \nSenate to pass legislation that would ensure we hold all those \nresponsible for denied and delayed care, even the deaths of some, \naccountable.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               EUREKA Act\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President and my fellow colleagues, I once again come \nto the floor to talk about Alzheimer's and the efforts being made in \nthis country and in this Senate and in this city to find a cure and \nfind better treatments for the scourge of Alzheimer's. Many of you know \nthis is the most expensive disease our country has ever seen; one-half \ntrillion dollars a year in costs to programs that we need to protect \nlike Medicare, Medicaid. This will rise to $1 trillion per year in the \nlifetime of many people within the sound of my voice unless something \nis done.\n  I am so appreciative of the some 1,200 people who descended on \nWashington this week advocating on behalf of the millions of Americans \nliving with Alzheimer's and their family members. I was honored to be \ninvited to their conference and to speak to over 1,000 people in the \nhotel where they were meeting earlier this week. They then came to \nCapitol Hill to visit in the offices of Senators and Members of the \nHouse of Representatives, and I had a great meeting on Wednesday in my \noffice. We want to reaffirm our dedication to putting an end to this \nterrible disease. My mom died with dementia. Most of us have family \nmembers who have had Alzheimer's or who have been impacted by \nAlzheimer's.\n\n[[Page S1799]]\n\n  I appreciate the support of my colleagues in this Congress for NIH \nfunding. It is very important to continue funding, to continue \nincreasing the funding for the excellent work done by the National \nInstitutes of Health to fight Alzheimer's disease and fund Alzheimer's \nresearch.\n  I appreciate my colleagues voting for a $350 million increase in \nresearch for Alzheimer's disease, but of course this falls far short. \nThis is funding that experts say is needed to reach our goal of curing \nAlzheimer's within the next decade. Along those lines, I have \nintroduced legislation that I think gives us a different way to \napproach the disease of Alzheimer's. My bill is called the EUREKA Act \nthat involves a prize competition, in addition to everything we are \ndoing in research, everything NIH is doing, and all the research being \ndone around the country. It is a prize competition inviting innovators, \ninviting people to think outside the box, come forward, and give us \ntheir ideas.\n  EUREKA stands for ``Ensuring Useful Research Expenditures is Key for \nAlzheimer's.'' Of course, the Greek translation for Eureka is ``I found \nit.'' That is what we are trying to do--trying to find a cure for \nAlzheimer's, trying to find milestones that will lead to a cure, and \ntrying to find treatments to help those suffering from the disease.\n  The goal of my EUREKA Act is to find the best and brightest minds in \nthe country, the best and brightest minds in the world, to come forward \nand use their ingenuity to solve this complex problem. As I have \nreiterated in visits with Member after Member, and I have reiterated on \nthe floor, with a prize competition, we pay only for success. \nRegardless of the amount of money we put on the prize, you don't pay \nthe money until we have success, which is one of the reasons this \nEUREKA provision wouldn't come out of NIH funding. It would add to it, \nand we would only pay the money if we got the result, which of course \nwould be far more valuable than the prize.\n  The numbers associated with Alzheimer's are daunting--even worse, \nchilling. The disease affects 5 million Americans. The number of people \nwith Alzheimer's is on the rise, as we all know. It is the sixth \nleading cause of death in America and, again, it is the most expensive \ndisease in America: $236 billion this year and $1 trillion per year by \nthe year 2050. Of course, there is a huge burden for the caregivers \nalso.\n  There is good news, to be sure. It was announced last week that \nthere's been an analysis by UsAgainstAlzheimer's, and it showed some 17 \ndrugs for Alzheimer's could be launched in the next 5 years. In \nMississippi, the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson \nhas developed a service called TeleMIND as part of its MIND Center. \nTelehealth technology is being used to attack Alzheimer's, to treat \nAlzheimer's patients, and make life better for them and their family.\n  Let us try the concept of EUREKA also. Let us try the concept of \noffering a prize to young minds. Perhaps people from around the world \nmight come to the United States. This might be someone in a basement or \nin his mom's garage or might be some major international corporation. \nWe don't care. We want to offer an incentive for somebody to come \naround, think outside the box, and get us to a cure quicker.\n  Prizes have a history of success. In 1927, Charles Lindbergh achieved \na nonstop flight between New York and Paris. He won a prize of $25,000 \nin so doing. In 2004, the XPRIZE--sponsored by the XPRIZE Foundation--\noffered $10 million for the first reusable manned spacecraft. You know \nwhat happened. It drew down $100 million in investments, this $10 \nmillion prize. In 2011, $1 million was awarded for a breakthrough in \noilspill cleanup. So prizes work. It can work, in addition to the \nresearch NIH is doing around the country.\n  Let me say, in addition to myself as principal sponsor of this act, \nwe now have 39 cosponsors among this 100-person Senate. We are day-by-\nday, step-by-step getting toward a majority. It is my hope the \nleadership of the HELP Committee that is now working on the 21st \nCentury Cures Act that came over from the House with an overwhelming \nbipartisan vote--I hope we can, in a bipartisan fashion, with the \nleadership of Senator Alexander, with the leadership of Senator \nMurray--his lead Democrat on the committee--I hope we can make a \ndecision to add the EUREKA bill to the 21st Century Cures Act, to have \nthis extra opportunity, in addition to everything we are doing, to cure \nAlzheimer's.\n  I would urge my colleagues, I would urge the staff members who might \nbe listening to this, to check and see if their Members have \ncosponsored this and to help us with an additional tool to attack the \nproblem of Alzheimer's.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I thank my colleague from Michigan for deferring for a moment or two \nwhile I make these remarks.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                     Flint, Michigan, Water Crisis\n\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, it is very hard for me to believe I am \nonce again standing on this floor. I have to come before my colleagues \nin the Senate to report that despite the fact that we have been \nbuilding bipartisan support for legislation that will address the \ncatastrophic situation in Flint, we still have one Senator standing in \nthe way of this coming to a vote.\n  It has been now nearly 2 months since Senator Stabenow and I \nintroduced legislation to deal with the catastrophic crisis in the city \nof Flint, MI. Since that time, we have been able to build a broad \ncoalition of folks on both sides of the aisle, Republican cosponsors \nwho have joined with us to say it is time for this body, it is time for \nthe Senate, to stand and help those in need in the city of Flint, as \nwell as issues all across this country. Senator Stabenow and I offered \nlegislation, along with Senator Inhofe, and a long list of Democrats \nand Republicans, including Senators Burr, Capito, Kirk, and Portman, \nhave been working very closely with Senator Murkowski as chair of the \ncommittee as well.\n  Yet we have one Senator, one Senator who says that is not enough. He \nwants to have more, and he is standing in the way of the people of \nFlint getting the help they desperately need. He is standing in the way \nof children like this young infant who appeared on the cover of Time \nmagazine. To me, those eyes are very compelling, and I think those eyes \nare very compelling to every American who has witnessed what has \nhappened in that city, who has witnessed the horror and the tragedy of \nhaving poisoned water going into people's bodies for many months while \nthe State government dropped the ball.\n  I will say folks around the country have responded. There has been an \noutpouring of help from people in every corner of this great country of \nours. People have sent bottled water. They have sent filters and are \nproviding resources. It is what our country does. It is what our people \ndo when we see people in crisis. We stand and lend that helping hand. \nWe know any one of us at any time could be in that situation. The \nwonderful thing about being an American is that as Americans we look \nout for each other. We know we are a community, a very special place in \nthis world, and we look out for each other.\n  That is why people back home in Michigan--and as I travel around the \ncountry--people are at a loss and wondering why the U.S. Congress \nhasn't done something to address this issue. When I tell them we have \nlegislation that will help deal with infrastructure, not just in Flint \nbut in communities all across the country, that will plus-up public \nhealth programs to deal with lead poisoning at a time when we realize \nlead poisoning is not just an issue for Flint but is an issue for \ncommunities all across this country and one we need to focus on and \nprobably ignored for far too long, they wonder why we have not acted. \nWhen I tell them we have one Senator--just one Senator--standing in the \nway, it only adds to their belief that this is a dysfunctional place; \nthat partisanship and polarization have prevented this body from doing \nwhat is right.\n  We can't forget the people of Flint, and I know many of my colleagues \non the Senate floor have not. That is why we have been able to get \nbroad support from both Democrats and Republicans, who have come \ntogether and said to both my senior Senator, Ms. Stabenow, and me: We \nunderstand it is a problem in Flint, but we also understand it is a \nproblem in other communities around the country. Let us design \nlegislation to deal with that.\n  That is what we have before us. We have legislation that will provide \nmoney for those cities that may be in\n\n[[Page S1800]]\n\na declared emergency, which is where we are with the city of Flint, but \nwe also know there may be other communities in this country--in fact, \nwe think there will be a community very soon--that will also have a \ndeclared water emergency that will be able to access those funds. We \nalso know aging infrastructure is not unique to the city of Flint. It \nis with cities all across the country, especially older urban areas \nthat have lead surface lines, but there are certainly many rural areas \nthat have that as well. Those pipes need to be taken out.\n  In this legislation, we create a fund that will allow money to be \nloaned to those communities--oftentimes, communities that don't have a \nlot of resources but desperately need infrastructure improvement. It is \na loan fund that will be paid back to the taxpayers but will extend the \nmoney necessary to make improvements that truly will be lifesaving \nimprovements for the citizens in those cities.\n  We also plus-up a number of public health programs from the CDC that \ndeal with lead poisoning in children.\n  The insidious thing about lead poisoning is that once it gets into \nthe brain of a young child--like this child who is looking at us right \nnow in this picture I have in the Chamber--it has lasting effects. It \nhas lifetime effects. We need not only to embrace that child with our \nlove but understand that the child is going to need health care for \ndecades. That child is going to need educational support to be able to \npursue his or her version of the American dream that he or she may \nhave. They are going to need to have, in addition to education and \nhealth care, good nutrition, making sure the food they eat will provide \ntheir bodies with the nourishment that can counter some of the impacts \nof lead.\n  But it is not just the children; it is everybody in the city of \nFlint. Senior citizens have also been impacted. I have gone door to \ndoor in Flint and worked with volunteers, including the American Red \nCross, delivering bottled water to the people of Flint. I never thought \nI would have to go with the American Red Cross to deliver bottled water \nto a community because the water they were getting out of their pipes \nwas poisoned--not in this country, not in the United States of America. \nBut that is what people are doing, and filters as well are being given \ndoor to door.\n  The people of Flint are appreciative. Please know they are extremely \nappreciative of the generosity they have seen from people across this \ncountry and from FEMA response as well, but they are also frustrated. \nPeople can't bathe with bottled water. They are cooking and cleaning \nfood--all of the basic things we take for granted each and every day. \nIt is simply impossible to live just on bottled water and have that \nbottled water delivered to them every few days. It is not a workable \nsystem. It is unacceptable, and it certainly should be unacceptable to \neverybody in this country.\n  That is why we need to have a long-term solution. It has to be a \nlong-term solution that will fix the problem permanently by making sure \nthe infrastructure improvements are there, lead pipes are pulled out, \nbut makes sure other support services are going to be there for \ndecades.\n  My fear for the people of the city of Flint is that although they \nhave been the beneficiaries of a great outpouring of love and support \nfrom people around the country, they have been able to get that because \nthe spotlight has been on Flint and the TV cameras are in Flint. We all \nknow in today's media world that those cameras will eventually go away. \nThere won't be media attention for Flint. There won't be the bright \nlights of publicity motivating people to do what is needed in the city \nof Flint. When those lights go down and when it goes dark, the people \nof the city of Flint will still be confronted with this absolutely \ncatastrophic situation that is impacting them in their homes. It is \nimpacting businesses--businesses that have been rocked as a result of \nthis. People don't want to go to restaurants because they are not sure \nof the water there. Real estate values have plummeted. This is a \ndifferent kind of a disaster than a natural disaster if a hurricane \ngoes through or a tornado goes through. Then we can rebuild, and it can \nbe as good as new.\n  Our concern with Flint is that there will always be this stigma \nattached to the city as a result of this, and if that stigma is there, \nit is going to make it even more difficult.\n  The people of Flint are resilient and courageous and brave and \nstrong. They will survive, but we need to be there to lend that helping \nhand. That is why it is even more frustrating to me, given the fact \nthat when we have natural disasters across this country, this body--the \nSenate--acts. We send money. We help those local governments. The State \ngovernments provide help.\n  Now, I know some colleagues have said that this is not a natural \ndisaster, that this is a manmade disaster. All I can say is to ask that \nchild when he or she grows up: Does it make a difference that it was a \nmanmade disaster or a natural disaster? Ask the senior citizen in Flint \nright now. Ask the parent who is concerned about that child. Does it \nmake any difference? I don't think any American here thinks it makes a \ndifference. There isn't anybody in this country who thinks it makes a \ndifference. A disaster is a disaster.\n  Now, it is true the State government messed up horribly in Michigan. \nIn fact, the Governor's own task force that he appointed to look into \nit clearly points the finger at the State of Michigan and the \nincompetence that was shown by the government of the State of Michigan. \nThat is a given. They are primarily responsible and need to step up, \nand they have. But they need to do a whole lot more than what they have \ndone so far.\n  But even though the State has to do that and must do that, that \ndoesn't prevent us, the Federal Government, from also standing up and \nsaying: We can help as well because that is what we do. It is what the \nAmerican people expect us to do. I certainly hope my colleagues will \nhelp Senator Stabenow and I move this legislation forward. If we can't \nget around this one Senator who wants to constantly move the goalpost, \nwho wants to change the basis of negotiations even though this \nlegislation is completely paid for--we have used a pay-for that Senator \nStabenow fought for, authored to help manufacturers in the Midwest. I \nfought aggressively to keep that fund when I was a Member of the House. \nThis is something that is important to us, but we know that dealing \nwith a catastrophic situation in Flint and water infrastructure across \nthis country so that we don't have any more Flints is more important. \nThat money will be used to help the people of Flint and communities \nacross this country. Not only does it pay for this, but it actually \nreduces the deficit at the same time.\n  I think it is important to say that usually when a disaster hits this \ncountry, we don't look for pay-fors. We step up and provide money for \npeople in need. We have been asked to come up with a pay-for, and we \ndid--completely paid for while reducing the Federal deficit at the same \ntime. Yet we have one Senator who wants more. He wants more.\n  I don't know how that one Senator can hold up something that has been \nable to get this kind of bipartisan support and can hold up something \nthat is so important to this child in this picture. How can you stand \nin the way? If that one Senator does not like this legislation, that is \nfine. They can vote against it. But allow the other 99 Senators in this \nbody an opportunity to have their say. That is the way this institution \nis supposed to work.\n  I still believe in this institution. I still believe the Senate can \ndo better than allowing one Member to stand in the way of helping this \nchild and other children just like this one.\n  It is now our task as Members of this body to come together and say: \nEnough is enough. We are going to help somebody in this country no \nmatter who you are, no matter where you live, no matter the \ncircumstances. If you have been hit by a major disaster, we will stand \nwith you. We will help you. That is who we are as Americans. It goes to \nthe very core of our values.\n  It is now up to my colleagues here in the Senate to please join \nSenator Stabenow and me and our long list of both Democratic and \nRepublican cosponsors. Put this legislation on the floor. Let's vote on \nit, let's pass it, and let's help the people of Flint and other folks \nall across the country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n[[Page S1801]]\n\n  \n\n\n\n              Tribute to Trent Harmon and La'Porsha Renae\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I don't know what other Members of the \nSenate will be doing at 8 p.m. eastern time, but I can tell you I will \nbe in front of my television set watching ``American Idol.'' We all \ntake pride in people from our own States, but I want to boldly predict \nthat the winner of ``American Idol'' tonight will be a contestant from \nmy State of Mississippi. The reason I am so certain of this is that two \ntalented Mississippians are the two finalists remaining in the \n``American Idol'' competition tonight.\n  They say this will be the final season of ``American Idol.'' Perhaps \nwe are only going to have a timeout for a few years, and we will see it \nback. This is the 15th season of ``American Idol.'' I am so proud to \nannounce to my colleagues in the Senate and to the Presiding Officer \nthat the two finalists are none other than Trent Harmon of Amory, MS, \nand La'Porsha Renae of McComb, MS.\n  Now, in Mississippi we proudly call ourselves the Birthplace of \nAmerica's Music, and I think we do that with some justification. From \nblues to country to rock and roll, our State has produced more Grammy \naward winners per capita than any other State in the Nation. Elvis \nPresley comes from Mississippi, as well as Robert Johnson, B.B. King, \nJimmie Rodgers, Charley Pride, Faith Hill, and the list goes on and on \nand on.\n  Last month, I was honored to participate in the opening of the Grammy \nMuseum in Cleveland, MS. There are now two Grammy museums in the \ncountry. One is in Los Angeles and the other is in the Mississippi \nDelta in Cleveland. The Mississippi Delta is a testament to the many \nmusical inspirations that have emerged there.\n  In 1986, Paul Simon sang: ``The Mississippi Delta is shining like a \nNational guitar.'' He sang that line 20 years before the first \nMississippi Blues Trail marker was placed, but he was correct. We now \nhave some 200 Blues Trail markers across our State, and I invite each \nand every Member and all the rest of you to come and visit those \nlocations in Mississippi.\n  But tonight, the entire State of Mississippi will be shining like a \nnational guitar with talents like La'Porsha Renae and Trent Harmon. \nThey are keeping our legacy alive. They represent the wide range of \nMississippi's musical influences. It was wonderfully touching to watch \nthe video of their hometown visits, where the people came out to \nsupport them, showing off their Mississippi talent and the dedication \nof their fans.\n  Trent Harmon is from Amory, MS. He grew up on his family's farm, \nworking in his parents' restaurant, the Longhorn Fish and Steakhouse. \nGrowing up in Amory is truly a small town beginning. The town has a \npopulation of around 7,500 people. Trent's interest in music was \napparent from early on, as he spent his time in high school and college \nperforming in musicals. My wife and I have numerous times been to Amory \nHigh School to see Trent Harmon perform in programs such as ``Joseph \nand the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat,'' ``Forever Plaid,'' and other \nperformances. He was a star then, and he is going to be a star in the \nfuture. Trent's powerful voice and versatility seem effortless. He can \ndo it all, from southern soul to R & B.\n  La'Porsha Renae comes from McComb, MS, down in the southwestern part \nof our State. She worked for a call center before auditioning for \n``American Idol.'' She has shared with America the details about her \nstory of survival from an abusive relationship in which she had to seek \nrefuge in a women's shelter. Her soulful voice has been compared to \nAretha Franklin, and the emotion she pours into every performance is \ntruly show-stopping. She credits her former high school algebra \nteacher, Angelia Johnson, as one of her biggest mentors who encouraged \nher to embrace her own signature style. La'Porsha dedicated last \nnight's moving performance of ``Diamonds'' to her young daughter who \nwas in the audience.\n  So when it comes to talent, I believe ``American Idol'' may have \nsaved the best for last, and I very much anticipate a great performance \ntonight. Millions of Americans will choose one of these outstanding \nyoung Mississippians as the latest, but perhaps not the last, \n``American Idol.''\n  Trent and La'Porsha have made Mississippi proud. They have made me \nproud, and I wish them all the best tonight and in their future musical \ncareers. I am quite certain that both of them will be incredibly \nsuccessful.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE.

Mr. President, I wish to call the attention of my \ncolleagues to the 227th anniversary of Congress' first quorum, which \nthe House of Representatives achieved on April 1, 1789, and which the \nSenate achieved 5 days later. In the first week of April, the \nAssociation of Centers for the Study of Congress remembers these \nmilestones by observing Congress Week--an annual celebration which \nincludes commemorative events at member institutions across the \ncountry.\n  The Association of Centers for the Study of Congress is composed of \nmore than 40 universities that work to preserve the historical \ncollections of Members of Congress. The organization's goal is to \npromote public understanding of the House and the Senate by focusing on \nthe history of Congress and its role in our constitutional system of \ngovernment. Having served as a member of this body for nearly four \ndecades, I understand well the importance of keeping good records, \nwhich is why I am sincerely grateful for the Association of Centers for \nthe Study of Congress and its efforts to help us in this endeavor.\n  While Presidents have Presidential libraries maintained by the \nNational Archives, we--the Members of Congress--are responsible for \npreserving our own personal documents. Only by archiving these records \nwill historians, students, and teachers be able to appreciate the vital \nrole that Congress has played in our national history.\n  As President Pro Tempore, I am committed to upholding the reputation \nand dignity of this institution. Part and parcel to that effort is \npreserving the Senate's history. To this end, I strongly encourage my \ncolleagues to keep comprehensive records of their work in Congress. \nJust as important as writing legislation is maintaining a thorough \nrecord of the bills we pass, so that future generations can appreciate \nthe historical importance of our accomplishments.\n  Serving as a Member of the world's greatest deliberative body is no \nsmall honor; it is a tremendous privilege that none of us should take \nfor granted. The American people have placed their confidence in our \nability to effect meaningful change for the good of the country. May we \nhonor this sacred trust by keeping detailed archives of the work we do \nhere.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/07/senate-section/article/S1802-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1802-S1803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ARMS SALES NOTIFICATION\n\n  Mr. CORKER.

The proposed \n     sale supports the United States' continued commitment to the \n     Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's security and strengthens U.S.-Saudi \n     Arabia strategic partnership. Sustaining the USMTM supports \n     Saudi Arabia in deterring hostile action and increases U.S.-\n     Saudi Arabia military interoperability.

Harris is a close friend and trusted adviser, \nand I would like to take this time to not only wish him the best on \nthis milestone, but to reflect upon his remarkable life.

Kennedy \nduring the civil rights movement; to a participant in the 1965 march \nfrom Selma to Montgomery; from a peace activist arrested in protest of \npolice brutality during the 1968 Democratic National Convention; to a \nSenator championing universal healthcare in the 1990s. The story of \nHarris Wofford is the story of the steady march of equality and \nprogress. He answered President Kennedy's call on a cold inaugural day \nin 1961 to ``Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can \ndo for your country.''\n  Harris's potential for leadership was evident early in high school \namidst the chaos of World War II when he founded the Student \nFederalists, an organization which advocated for a united world \ngovernment in order to bring about lasting peace. By the time he turned \n18, the organization had grown to over 1,000 members in 30 chapters and \nled Newsweek to predict that the intrepid young man would one day rise \nto be President. He went on to graduate from the University of Chicago \nin 1948 and then enrolled in Howard University Law School, finishing \nhis education with a degree from Yale Law School in 1954, just as the \ncivil rights movement was truly picking up momentum.\n  In 1957, Harris joined the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights as a legal \nassistant to Reverend Theodore M. Hesburgh, the president of Notre Dame \nUniversity. When Senator John Kennedy ran for President in 1960, he was \nasked to join the campaign as a civil rights coordinator. It was during \nthat close election that Harris made one of his most lasting \ncontributions to American history. In October 1960, Dr. King was \narrested in Georgia while battling segregation, and in those tense \nhours after his arrest, Harris Wofford suggested to Sargent Shriver \nthat Kennedy call Dr. King's wife, Coretta Scott King, and offer his \nsupport. Kennedy made the call despite the political risk. The news of \nthe Democratic candidate for President--the nominee of a party that \nstill held deep roots in the Jim Crow South--calling the wife of Dr. \nKing was powerful and helped sway many African-American voters to \nKennedy, which some feel decided the election.\n  After the election, Harris Wofford joined the Kennedy Administration \nas special assistant to the President for civil rights and the chairman \nof the Subcabinet group on civil rights. He helped Shriver in the \nfounding of the Peace Corps in 1961, and, as was common for him, he not \nonly advocated for the idea, but also served as the director of \noperations in Ethiopia and the organization's special representative to \nAfrica. In 1964, he was named associate director of the Peace Corps.\n  He reentered the world of academia in 1966 as president of the State \nUniversity of New York at Old Westbury. His career brought him to \nPennsylvania as president of Bryn Mawr College in 1970. Later he \npracticed law in Philadelphia. After 16 years in Pennsylvania, he was \nasked to reenter the political world in June 1986 as chairman of the \nPennsylvania Democratic Party. When my father was elected Governor of \nPennsylvania that year, he asked Harris Wofford to serve as the \nSecretary of the Department of Labor and Industry for the Commonwealth. \nIn May 1991, after the tragic death of Senator John Heinz in a plane \ncrash, my father appointed Harris Wofford to fill the vacancy until a \nspecial election could be held. After winning a surprise victory in the \nspecial election under the banner of universal healthcare, Senator \nWofford used his time in the Senate to foster the development of \nnational service and to push for health insurance. He was a key sponsor \nin the establishment of the Corporation for National and Community \nService and worked closely with Representative John Lewis to establish \nMartin Luther King, Jr., Day as a National Day of Service.\n  Although Senator Wofford was defeated in his reelection attempt in \n1994, President Bill Clinton appointed him as the chief executive \nofficer of the Corporation for National and Community Service, CNCS. \nHis lifelong advocacy for national and community service made him an \nideal choice to lead the CNCS into an influential organization, and, \nunder his leadership, the organization's volunteer branches grew to \nover 50,000 members. After leaving the CNCS in 2001, he continued his \ndedication to public service and civil rights through his work on the \nboards of the America's Promise Alliance, Malaria No More, Youth \nService America, the Points of Light Foundation, and as a trustee of \nthe Martin Luther King, Jr., Center for Non-Violent Social Change.\n  Throughout his life, Harris Wofford has left an indelible mark on our \nNation's history and the lives of those who have had the privilege to \nwork with him. When I took the oath of office for the U.S. Senate in \n2007 to fill the seat he once held, I was honored and humbled to have \nhim with me at the ceremony. For over 90 years, he has stood for \ncourage, idealism, and a steadfast defense of equal rights for all \nAmericans. As we look back on the growth of community service and the \nmarch of civil rights in our Nation's history, we see the steady, \nguiding hand of Harris Wofford. I am grateful for his experienced \ncounsel and support on the many issues facing our Nation today, and I \nam pleased that he shows no signs of slowing down. On behalf of the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania and a grateful Nation, I am pleased to \nonce again wish Harris Wofford a happy birthday and many more years of \nhealth and happiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/07/senate-section/article/S1803-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1803-S1804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING CARL ALLEN KOONTZ\n\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, today, on the eve of what would have \nbeen his 27th birthday, I rise to recognize and honor the extraordinary \nservice and ultimate sacrifice of Howard County, IN, deputy Carl \nKoontz. Dedicated, loyal, and, above all, compassionate to those in \nneed, Deputy Koontz served with the Howard County Sheriff's Department \nfor nearly 3 years.\n  A native of Kokomo, IN, and a graduate of Western High School and \nIndiana University Kokomo, Carl served his community with dedication as \na corrections officer prior to attending the Indiana Law Enforcement \nAcademy and achieving his dream of becoming a sheriff's deputy. Those \nwho served alongside Deputy Koontz describe him as selfless, dedicated, \nand determined. A respected friend, leader, and mentor, he touched the \nlives of all who had the privilege to know him, including the students \nand staff of the Northwestern School Corporation, where he served as a \nschool resource officer.\n  On March 20, 2016, while serving a search warrant, Deputy Koontz and \nSergeant Jordan Buckley were shot in the line of duty. We mourn the \nloss of Deputy Koontz, who succumbed to his injuries, and we wish \nSergeant Buckley a quick recovery. Every day, our law enforcement \nprofessionals and first responders get up, go to work, and put their \nlives on the line to keep our communities safe. That is exactly what \nDeputy Koontz, Sergeant Buckley, and their fellow officers were doing \nin the early hours of that Sunday morning--their job. They put their \nlives on the line so that we have the chance to live in safety, and we \nare eternally grateful.\n  Deputy Koontz is survived and deeply missed by his wife, Kassie; son, \nNoah; parents, Allen and Jackie; sister, Alice; grandparents, Ann and \nAllen Koontz and Alice and Carl Durham, as well as the entire Koontz \nand Floyd family and the Howard County Sheriff's Department. No words \nor sentiment can adequately express our sadness and grief. As a \ncommunity, we can only offer our prayers, our support, and our \ncontinued commitment to honor his service.\n  Deputy Koontz loved his work, and he gave his life to serve and \nprotect the citizens of Howard County. Although he would not have \nconsidered himself a hero, Deputy Koontz demonstrated his character \ndaily by conducting himself with compassion, honor, courage, and\n\n[[Page S1804]]\n\nintegrity. Let us always remember and emulate the shining example this \nbrave man set for us and honor him for his selfless commitment to \nserving his fellow citizens. May God welcome Carl home and give comfort \nto his family and friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/07/senate-section/article/S1804-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO ZEESY BRUK\n\n Mr. DAINES.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana memorializing the United States \n     Congress to extend Louisiana's seaward boundary in the Gulf \n     of Mexico to three marine leagues; to the Committee on Energy \n     and Natural Resources.\n\n                   Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 4\n\n       Whereas, in United States of America v. States of \n     Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, 363 U.S. \n     1 (1960), the seaward boundary of the state of Louisiana in \n     the Gulf of Mexico was judicially determined by the United \n     States Supreme Court to be three geographical miles, despite \n     evidence showing that Louisiana's seaward boundary \n     historically consisted instead of three marine leagues, a \n     distance equal to nine geographic miles or 10.357 statute \n     miles; and\n       Whereas, the seaward boundaries in the Gulf of Mexico for \n     the states of Texas and Florida were determined to be three \n     marine leagues; and\n       Whereas, the unequal seaward boundary imposed upon \n     Louisiana has resulted in (1) economic disparity and hardship \n     for Louisiana citizens and entities; (2) economic loss to the \n     state of Louisiana and its political subdivisions; and (3) \n     the inability of the state of Louisiana and its political \n     subdivisions to fully exercise their powers and duties under \n     the federal and state constitutions and state laws and \n     ordinances, including but not limited to protection and \n     restoration of coastal lands, waters, and natural resources, \n     and regulation of activities affecting them; and\n       Whereas, in recognition of all of the above the Legislature \n     of Louisiana in the 2011 Regular Session enacted Act No. 336, \n     which amended Louisiana statutes to provide that the seaward \n     boundary of the state of Louisiana extends a distance into \n     the Gulf of Mexico of three marine leagues from the \n     coastline, and further defines ``three marine leagues'' as \n     equal to nine geographic miles or 10.357 statute miles; and\n       Whereas, Act No. 336 further provides that the jurisdiction \n     of the state of Louisiana or any political subdivision \n     thereof shall not extend to the boundaries recognized in such \n     Act until the United States Congress acknowledges the \n     boundary described therein by an Act of Congress or any \n     litigation resulting from the passage of Act No. 336 with \n     respect to the legal boundary of the state is resolved and a \n     final nonappealable judgment is rendered; and\n       Whereas, through the federal Submerged Lands Act of 1953, \n     Congress has the power to fix the unequal disparity of the \n     lesser seaward boundary forced upon Louisiana by recognizing \n     and approving that Louisiana's seaward boundary extends three \n     marine leagues into the Gulf of Mexico; and\n       Whereas, as shown by the national impact of natural and \n     manmade disasters such as hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 \n     and the Deepwater Horizon BP Oil Spill in 2010, the seaward \n     boundary of Louisiana is vital to the economy and well-being \n     of the entire United States, since among other benefits the \n     Louisiana coastal area: (1) serves as both host and corridor \n     for significant energy and commercial development and \n     transportation; (2) serves as a storm and marine forces \n     buffer protecting ports and the vast infrastructure of \n     nationally significant oil and gas facilities located in such \n     area; (3) provides critical environmental, ecological, \n     ecosystem, and fish, waterfowl, and wildlife habitat \n     functions; (4) provides protection from storms for more than \n     400 million tons of water-borne commerce; and (5) offers \n     recreational and eco-tourism opportunities and industries \n     that are known and appreciated throughout the world; and\n       Whereas, the Louisiana coastal area accounts for 80% of the \n     nation's coastal land loss, with its valuable wetlands \n     disappearing at a dramatically high rate of between 25-35 \n     square miles per year; and\n       Whereas, hurricanes Katrina and Rita turned approximately \n     100 square miles of southeast Louisiana coastal wetlands into \n     open water, and destroyed more wetlands east of the \n     Mississippi River in one month than experts estimated to be \n     lost in over 45 years; and\n       Whereas, the economic, environmental, and ecological damage \n     of the Deepwater Horizon BP Oil Spill is already calculated \n     in terms of billions of dollars, and potential longer-lasting \n     impacts are still being determined; and\n       Whereas, adopted in 2006, the federal Gulf of Mexico Energy \n     Security Act (GOMESA) would provide ongoing revenues to \n     Louisiana from federal oil revenue derived from gulf leasing \n     and drilling, with the first payment in 2017 estimated to be \n     approximately $176 million, and with such monies dedicated to \n     coastal restoration, hurricane protection and coastal \n     infrastructure; and\n       Whereas, despite strenuous objection, efforts are now \n     underway to repeal or amend GOMESA that would result in \n     depriving Louisiana and other gulf coast states of such \n     monies; and\n       Whereas, the extension of Louisiana's seaward boundary into \n     the Gulf of Mexico for three marine leagues will provide a \n     much-needed stream of revenue for use in the state's ongoing \n     efforts to clean up, rebuild, protect and restore the \n     Louisiana coastal area from losses suffered due to both \n     natural and manmade disasters, and will benefit both the \n     state and the entire nation: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to extend Louisiana's \n     seaward boundary in the Gulf of Mexico to three marine \n     leagues; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the President of the United States, to the \n     secretary of the United States Senate and the clerk of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and to each member of \n     the Louisiana delegation to the United States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-142. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana memorializing the United States \n     Congress to maintain the Outer Continental Shelf revenue \n     sharing arrangements established under the Gulf of Mexico \n     Energy Security Act of 2006 for the creation of a recurring \n     funding stream in support of Louisiana's coastal program; to \n     the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                   Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 7\n\n       Whereas, the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 \n     (GOMESA) provides for the sharing of qualified Outer \n     Continental Shelf (OCS) revenues to Gulf Coast states and \n     their political subdivisions that host energy production in \n     order to help mitigate the demands associated with that \n     production on infrastructure and natural resources; and\n       Whereas, GOMESA stipulates that funds can only be used for \n     the purposes of coastal protection including conservation, \n     restoration, hurricane protection, the mitigation of damage \n     to wildlife and natural resources, and the mitigation of \n     effects from Outer Continental Shelf activities through \n     onshore infrastructure projects, and associated \n     administrative costs; and\n       Whereas, in 2006, the people of Louisiana voted \n     overwhelmingly to constitutionally dedicate the revenues \n     received through GOMESA to the Coastal Protection and \n     Restoration Fund for the purposes of coastal wetlands \n     conservation, coastal restoration, hurricane protection, or \n     infrastructure directly impacted by coastal wetland losses; \n     and\n       Whereas, revenues received by Louisiana and its eligible \n     coastal parishes from 2009 to 2015 under phase one of GOMESA \n     provided only $11.5 million to the state, but phase two is \n     estimated to generate more than ten times as much revenue \n     each year for coastal projects; and\n       Whereas, GOMESA revenues have long been seen as a crucial, \n     reliable and recurring revenue stream to support Louisiana's \n     coastal protection and restoration work; and\n       Whereas, since 2007, Louisiana has created a framework for \n     its coastal protection and restoration program and set the \n     national standard for utilizing world-class science and \n     engineering and public outreach to meet the challenges of a \n     vanishing coast through its Comprehensive Master Plan for a \n     Sustainable Coast (Coastal Master Plan); and\n       Whereas, the 2012 Coastal Master Plan further evolved \n     Louisiana's approach to coastal protection and restoration \n     with the prioritization of projects in a resource-constrained \n     funding and physical environment; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana's land loss crisis demands a robust and \n     integrated coastal protection and restoration program that \n     operates effectively and urgently for the safety, livelihood, \n     culture, and enjoyment of its people; and\n       Whereas, the entire United States derives fantastic benefit \n     from the natural assets of coastal Louisiana including its \n     energy resources, the commerce and connections provided by \n     its ports and waterways, its seafood production, and many \n     other invaluable ecosystem services; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana's coastline has already lost twenty-five \n     percent of its 1932 land area and without the implementation \n     of large scale restoration projects it could lose an \n     additional 1,750 square miles of land at the end of fifty \n     years; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana has a science-based plan to meet these \n     challenges that include massive public investments in the \n     restoration of America's largest river delta, structural \n     protection where necessary, and an extensive program to \n     floodproof, elevate, and voluntarily acquire homes and \n     businesses at greatest risk of flooding; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana aims to pioneer the engineered \n     replication of natural processes such as the construction of \n     sediment diversions off of the Mississippi River, and develop \n     other expertise that can be exported around the globe to \n     other cities, states, and countries adapting to climate \n     change; and\n       Whereas, by maintaining GOMESA, Congress can follow through \n     on a promise nearly ten years old, support Louisiana's \n     efforts to provide for a sustainable coast, help to protect \n     and maintain nationally significant economic and natural \n     resources, and help reduce federal liabilities like insured \n     properties in the National Flood Insurance Program and future \n     hurricane disaster payouts: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to maintain the Outer \n     Continental\n\n[[Page S1809]]\n\n     Shelf revenue sharing arrangements established under the Gulf \n     of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 for the creation of a \n     recurring funding stream in support of Louisiana's coastal \n     program; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-143.

A bill to amend the Truth in Lending Act to address certain \nissues related to the extension of consumer credit, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, an American historian, James Truslow \nAdams, wrote a book in 1931 entitled ``The Epic of America,'' and in \nthis book he coined the term the ``American dream.'' He went on to say \nthis: ``Ever since we have become an independent nation, each \ngeneration has seen an uprising of the ordinary Americans to save that \ndream from the forces which appeared to be overwhelming and dispelling \nit.''\n  One of those forces that has been overwhelming the effort of middle-\nclass, hard-working Americans to be successful is predatory lending. \nToday I am specifically rising to discuss the introduction of the SAFE \nLending Act. SAFE stands for stopping abuse and fraud in electronic \nlending.\n  The focus of this is short-term, high-interest loans, often referred \nto as ``payday'' loans. These loans often have interest rates of 300 \npercent, 400 percent, 500 percent. The debt a family has with one of \nthose loans just grows and grows and grows. Consider this: If you take \nout $1,000 today, a year from now, at 500 percent interest, you owe \n$5,000. In 2 years you owe $25,000--an impossible sum for a family of \nmodest means. So these payday loans pull families into a vortex of debt \nfrom which they cannot escape, and this vortex destroys them \nfinancially. These are huge consequences for the parents, certainly, \nbut huge consequences for the children. It does a tremendous amount of \ndamage to American families. This is why many major religions in the \nworld have come out over time--over thousands a year--and said high-\ninterest lending destroys and shouldn't be done, but here we have it, \nright here in America.\n  Many States, including my State of Oregon, have worked to end this \nvortex of debt. They have put a cap on the interest rate. They have \nstopped the every-2-week rollovers, and so they have returned, if you \nwill, small-dollar lending to being an affordable instrument that \ndoesn't destroy families. These tough State laws are under assault by \nnew tactics of the payday loan industry, and we need to address those \nnew tactics.\n  Specifically, the industry is starting to use an instrument called \nremotely created checks. How does this work? Let's say you have your \nbank account and you take out a payday loan. The dollars are put into \nyour bank account, and you think they are going to stay there, but now \nthis online payday loan company--and who knows where in the world these \npeople really are; they may be overseas in any remote location, \nextremely difficult to find, extremely difficult to enforce our laws--\nhas your bank account number, and that is all they need to write a \ncheck to themselves to withdraw the money from your account and put it \nin their account, an account that is likely to be so remotely located \nno one can enforce the State laws.\n  In other words--let me say this again--the payday lender, once they \nhave your checking account number, can reach into your account without \nyour permission and take your money out; thereby, having the ability to \nbypass the State laws. An Oregon law may say if you have interest rates \nover those established by Oregon law your loan is uncollectible; that \nit is illegal\n\n[[Page S1812]]\n\nin our State. Well, these online predatory payday lenders do not care \nthat it is illegal in Oregon. They have your account number, and they \nare going to reach in and take your money illegally.\n  That is not the only predatory practice that is evolving. These \npayday loan companies have also established a practice whereby instead \nof putting money into your bank account, they give you a prepaid card. \nThis prepaid card looks very convenient. You use it like a credit card, \na debit card, and we are familiar with that in America, but here is the \nringer. They put fees on these cards that add to the 300-percent, 400-\npercent, or 500-percent interest rate that is already destroying \nfamilies, particularly over balance fees.\n  You may not know whether your card has $20 or $30 or $50 left on it. \nSome of these prepaid cards, in other parts of the financial industry, \ncharge for all kinds of things. They charge you to call and ask what \nyour balance is. They charge if you call and ask a question about how \nthe card works or even what the fees are. They charge a fee just for \nasking what the fees are. Some of them charge a fee every time you use \nthe card. Some might charge an additional monthly fee, but particularly \nthese prepaid payday loan cards are notorious for their overbalance \nfees.\n  Let us assume you have perhaps $50 left in your account, you buy \nsomething for $52, and maybe immediately you get charged a $35 fee, \nwhich they can reach into your account and take, but then that is an \noverdraft fee on the bank, so the bank is now charging you a fee. Then, \nbecause you don't know it is an overdraft because they didn't turn down \nthe transaction, you buy a pack of gum for 50 cents, and there is \nanother $35 fee. You buy a hamburger at Burger King for lunch, and \nthere is another fee. So you can see how these predatory fees line up \nvery quickly on top of the 300-percent, 400-percent, or 500-percent \ninterest rates.\n  So here is the thing. State after State has said these are destroying \nfamilies and we are going to act. In fact, in the U.S. Senate years ago \nwe acted to protect military families from these predatory loans. The \nadmirals and generals came to Capitol Hill to testify. They said: At \nour military bases these predatory payday loans are destroying our \nmilitary families, and it is not just their finances. When their \nfinances are destroyed, relationships are frayed, children's \nopportunities are damaged. We cannot have this type of terrible impact \non our military families. So we established a national cap of interest \non these short-term loans.\n  It is good we did. It is good we protected our military families from \nthese abusive, destructive practices, but if these practices are so \ndamaging to families in the military, aren't they equally damaging to \nfamilies who are not in the military? Shouldn't we apply the same \nprotection to every American family we apply to a military family? \nDon't we value the success of every American family more than we value \nprotection for legalized loan sharking? Certainly we should, in this \nChamber, extend to all families in America the same protection we gave \nto military families. Until we do that, we should at least make sure \nthe Federal framework requires honoring the tough laws passed by State \nafter State after State to stop these practices. I think the total is \nabout 19 States at this point.\n  That is why I introduced the SAFE Lending Act today. The SAFE Lending \nAct--stop the abuse and fraud in electronic lending. This act does a \ncouple of key things. First of all, it says these remotely created \nchecks in which a company reaches in and takes your money without your \npermission--those are banned. You regain control of your checking \naccount. Second, the legislation bans the overdraft fees on these \nprepaid payday loan cards and other predatory fees established through \nthe Commission. Third, it says that all small-dollar lenders have to \nregister in order to be monitored by their States so they are not in an \nunregulated world out there without people even knowing they exist. \nFurthermore, it says that every lender of every type has to abide by \nthe State laws. It doesn't matter whom they are regulated by. Finally, \nit bans lead generators.\n  Now, what is a lead generator? A lead generator is a fake Web site \nthat pretends it is a payday loan company, offers you a product, and \ntheir whole goal is to get your bank account number. Again, once they \nhave that bank account number, they can reach in and take funds out of \nyour account. It is incredible that this is true; that you don't have \nto sign the check. They basically just use your number and ask to take \naway the money from John Consumer or Jane Consumer and give it to us, \nand the bank complies and does it. As amazing as that sounds, that is \nthe way the banking system works. That is what these remotely created \nchecks do.\n  So we to make sure that regardless of what your financial regulator \nis, you have to abide by the State rules, and we ban these lead \ngenerators that are fishing for these bank account numbers. Once they \nhave them, they sell them to the lending industry, to the payday loan \nindustry, and who knows what other hands these numbers end up in.\n  I was surprised a couple of years ago when I noticed a charge on my \nbank account that wasn't something that either my wife Mary or I had \npurchased from a store we don't go to. I looked at it carefully and \ndiscovered the number of the check was out of the order of my \ncheckbook. So I pulled up the copy of the check on the computer, \nlooking through my account on the computer, and I could see the number \nmatched my account, but the name on the check didn't match my account, \nthe address didn't match my account, and the signature didn't match my \nsignature. None of it matched. The only thing on this check was the \nnumber of the bank account that matched my bank account, and that is \nall that is required for someone to reach in and take money out of your \naccount.\n  That type of fraud is surprising as well, but it reinforces the point \nthat once an online electronic payday loan company has your number, \nthey can reach in. That is all they need to take the money out of your \naccount. So we are going to ban these lead generators as another piece \nof this predatory profile of the electronic payday loan industry. It is \nwhy I am introducing the act.\n  I greatly appreciate my cosponsors on this act, and I would like to \nthank them all.

Thank you to all of my \ncolleagues who care a lot about ending predatory financial transactions \nthat strip billions of dollars out of hard-working Americans' accounts.\n  We have a lot of work to do on this. We have accomplished some. There \nis much more to be done. Certainly, when James Truslow Adams said that \nindividuals of each generation will have to stand and fight against \npractices designed to destroy the American dream, he was talking about \nthings such as this--practices that proceed to undermine the success of \nAmerica's working families. Let us stop those predatory practices in \ntheir tracks and pass the SAFE Lending Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Cruz, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. \n        Blumenthal):\n  S. 2763. A bill to provide the victims of Holocaust-era persecution \nand their heirs a fair opportunity to recover works of art confiscated \nor misappropriated by the Nazis; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2763\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Holocaust Expropriated Art \n     Recovery Act of 2016''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) It is estimated that the Nazis confiscated or otherwise \n     misappropriated as many as 650,000 works of art throughout \n     Europe as part of their genocidal campaign against the Jewish \n     people and other persecuted groups. This has been described \n     as the ``greatest displacement of art in human history''.\n       (2) Following World War II, the United States and its \n     allies attempted to return the stolen artworks to their \n     countries of origin. Despite these efforts, many works of art\n\n[[Page S1813]]\n\n     were never reunited with their owners. Some of the art has \n     since been discovered in the United States.\n       (3) In 1998, the United States convened a conference with \n     44 nations in Washington, D.C., known as the Washington \n     Conference, which produced Principles on Nazi-Confiscated \n     Art. One of these principles is that ``steps should be taken \n     expeditiously to achieve a just and fair solution'' to claims \n     involving such art that has not been restituted if the owners \n     or their heirs can be identified.\n       (4) The same year, Congress enacted the Holocaust Victims \n     Redress Act (Public Law 105-158, 112 Stat. 15), which \n     expressed the sense of Congress that ``all governments should \n     undertake good faith efforts to facilitate the return of \n     private and public property, such as works of art, to the \n     rightful owners in cases where assets were confiscated from \n     the claimant during the period of Nazi rule and there is \n     reasonable proof that the claimant is the rightful owner.''.\n       (5) In 2009, the United States participated in a Holocaust \n     Era Assets Conference in Prague, Czech Republic, with 45 \n     other nations. At the conclusion of this conference, the \n     participating nations issued the Terezin Declaration, which \n     reaffirmed the 1998 Washington Conference Principles on Nazi-\n     Confiscated Art and urged all participants ``to ensure that \n     their legal systems or alternative processes, while taking \n     into account the different legal traditions, facilitate just \n     and fair solutions with regard to Nazi-confiscated and looted \n     art, and to make certain that claims to recover such art are \n     resolved expeditiously and based on the facts and merits of \n     the claims and all the relevant documents submitted by all \n     parties.''. The Declaration also urged participants to \n     ``consider all relevant issues when applying various legal \n     provisions that may impede the restitution of art and \n     cultural property, in order to achieve just and fair \n     solutions, as well as alternative dispute resolution, where \n     appropriate under law.''.\n       (6) Numerous victims of Nazi persecution and their heirs \n     have taken legal action to recover Nazi-confiscated art. \n     These lawsuits face significant procedural obstacles partly \n     due to State statutes of limitations, which typically bar \n     claims within some limited number of years from either the \n     date of the loss or the date that the claim should have been \n     discovered. In some cases, this means that the claims expired \n     before World War II even ended. (See, e.g., The Detroit \n     Institute of Arts v. Ullin, No. 06-10333, 2007 WL 1016996 \n     (E.D. Mich. Mar. 31, 2007)). The unique and horrific \n     circumstances of World War II and the Holocaust make statutes \n     of limitations and other time-based procedural defenses \n     especially burdensome to the victims and their heirs. Those \n     seeking recovery of Nazi-confiscated art must painstakingly \n     piece together their cases from a fragmentary historical \n     record ravaged by persecution, war, and genocide. This costly \n     process often cannot be done within the time constraints \n     imposed by existing law.\n       (7) Federal legislation is needed because the only court \n     that has considered the question held that the Constitution \n     prohibits States from making exceptions to their statutes of \n     limitations to accommodate claims involving the recovery of \n     Nazi-confiscated art. In Von Saher v. Norton Simon Museum of \n     Art, 592 F.3d 954 (9th Cir. 2009), the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the Ninth Circuit invalidated a California law \n     that extended the State statute of limitations for claims \n     seeking recovery of Holocaust-era artwork. The Court held \n     that the law was an unconstitutional infringement of the \n     Federal Government's exclusive authority over foreign \n     affairs, which includes the resolution of war-related \n     disputes. In light of this precedent, the enactment of a \n     Federal law is the best way to ensure that claims to Nazi-\n     confiscated art are adjudicated on their merits.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are the following:\n       (1) To ensure that laws governing claims to Nazi-\n     confiscated art further United States policy as set forth in \n     the Washington Conference Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art, \n     the Holocaust Victims Redress Act, and the Terezin \n     Declaration.\n       (2) To ensure that claims to artwork stolen or \n     misappropriated by the Nazis are not barred by statutes of \n     limitations and other similar legal doctrines but are \n     resolved in a just and fair manner on the merits.\n\n     SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act--\n       (1) the term ``actual discovery'' does not include any \n     constructive knowledge imputed by law;\n       (2) the term ``artwork or other cultural property'' \n     includes any painting, sculpture, drawing, work of graphic \n     art, print, multiples, book, manuscript, archive, or sacred \n     or ceremonial object;\n       (3) the term ``persecution during the Nazi era'' means any \n     persecution by the Nazis or their allies during the period \n     from January 1, 1933, to December 31, 1945, that was based on \n     race, ethnicity, or religion; and\n       (4) the term ``unlawfully lost'' includes any theft, \n     seizure, forced sale, sale under duress, or any other loss of \n     an artwork or cultural property that would not have occurred \n     absent persecution during the Nazi era.\n\n     SEC. 5. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     Federal law, any provision of State law, or any defense at \n     law or equity relating to the passage of time (including the \n     doctrine of laches), a civil claim or cause of action against \n     a defendant to recover any artwork or other cultural property \n     unlawfully lost because of persecution during the Nazi era or \n     for damages for the taking or detaining of any artwork or \n     other cultural property unlawfully lost because of \n     persecution during the Nazi era may be commenced not later \n     than 6 years after the actual discovery by the claimant or \n     the agent of the claimant of--\n       (1) the identity and location of the artwork or cultural \n     property; and\n       (2) information or facts sufficient to indicate that the \n     claimant has a claim for a possessory interest in the artwork \n     or cultural property that was unlawfully lost.\n       (b) Possible Misidentification.--For purposes of subsection \n     (a)(1), in a case in which there is a possibility of \n     misidentification of the artwork or cultural property, the \n     identification of the artwork or cultural property shall \n     occur on the date on which there are facts sufficient to \n     determine that the artwork or cultural property is likely to \n     be the artwork or cultural property that was unlawfully lost.\n       (c) Applicability.--\n       (1) In general.--Subsection (a) shall apply to any civil \n     claim or cause of action (including a civil claim or cause of \n     action described in paragraph (2)) that is--\n       (A) pending on the date of enactment of this Act; or\n       (B) filed during the period beginning on the date of \n     enactment of this Act and ending on December 31, 2026.\n       (2) Inclusion of previously dismissed claims.--A civil \n     claim or cause of action described in this paragraph is a \n     civil claim or cause of action--\n       (A) that was dismissed before the date of enactment of this \n     Act based on the expiration of a Federal or State statute of \n     limitations or any other defense at law or equity relating to \n     the passage of time (including the doctrine of laches); and\n       (B) in which final judgment has not been entered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/07/senate-section/article/S1813-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1813-S1814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 416--RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF HAWAII TO THE \n    CULINARY HERITAGE OF THE UNITED STATES AND DESIGNATING THE WEEK \n     BEGINNING ON JUNE 12, 2016, AS ``NATIONAL HAWAIIAN FOOD WEEK''\n\n  Mr. SCHATZ (for himself, Mr. Isakson, Ms. Hirono, and Mr. Perdue) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 416\n\n       Whereas when individuals first came to the Hawaiian islands \n     more than 1,500 years ago, there was little to eat other than \n     birds and a few species of ferns, but the individuals found \n     rich volcanic soil, a year-round growing season, and abundant \n     fisheries;\n       Whereas the history of Hawaii is inextricably linked with--\n           (1) foods brought to the Hawaiian islands by the first \n     individuals who came to Hawaii and successive waves of \n     voyagers to the Hawaiian islands;\n           (2) the agricultural and ranching potential of the land \n     of Hawaii; and\n           (3) the readily available seafood from the ocean and \n     coasts of Hawaii;\n\n       Whereas the food cultures initially brought to Hawaii came \n     from places including French Polynesia, China, Japan, \n     Portugal, North Korea, South Korea, the Philippines, Puerto \n     Rico, and Samoa;\n       Whereas the foods first brought to Hawaii were simple, \n     hearty fare of working men and women that reminded the men \n     and women of their distant homes;\n       Whereas individuals in Hawaii, in the spirit of Aloha, \n     shared favorite dishes with each other, and as a result, the \n     individuals began to appreciate new tastes and learned how to \n     bring new ideas into their cooking;\n       Whereas the blend of styles in Hawaiian cooking evolves as \n     new groups of individuals make Hawaii their home;\n       Whereas the fusion of dishes from around the world creates \n     a unique cuisine for Hawaii that is as much a part of a visit \n     to Hawaii as the welcoming climate, friendly individuals, and \n     beautiful beaches in Hawaii;\n       Whereas the food of Hawaii is appealing because it came \n     from hard-working communities of individuals that farmed, \n     fished, or ranched for their livelihoods, which are core \n     experiences of individuals throughout the United States;\n       Whereas the growing appreciation for the food of Hawaii \n     comes from hard-working and ingenious farmers, fishers, \n     educators, ranchers, chefs, and businesses that innovate and \n     export the taste of Hawaii all over the world; and\n       Whereas as the taste for the food of Hawaii spreads across \n     the United States, individuals in Hawaii proudly welcome \n     individuals in the State of Georgia to partner and bring the \n     cuisine of the individuals ``home'' to new communities: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning on June 12, 2016, as \n     ``National Hawaiian Food Week''; and\n\n[[Page S1814]]\n\n       (2) recognizes the contributions of Hawaii to the culinary \n     heritage of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/07/senate-section/article/S1814-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1814-S1815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3518.

IMPROVING AIRLINE COMPETITIVENESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The people of the United States and the United States \n     economy depend on a strong and competitive passenger air \n     transportation industry to move people and goods in the \n     fastest, most efficient manner.\n       (2) In a global economy, air carriers connect the people of \n     the United States with the rest of the world. A strong air \n     transportation industry is essential to the ability of the \n     United States to compete in the international marketplace.\n       (3) A strong air transportation industry depends on \n     competition between a number of air carriers servicing a \n     variety of routes for domestic and international travelers, \n     at both the national and local levels.\n       (4) Important stakeholders contribute to, and are dependent \n     on, a robust air transportation industry, including--\n       (A) business and leisure travelers;\n       (B) the tourism sector;\n       (C) shippers;\n       (D) State and local governments and port authorities;\n       (E) aircraft manufacturers; and\n       (F) domestic and foreign air carriers.\n       (5) As a result of the consolidation of United States air \n     carriers, there has been a precipitous decline in the number \n     of major passenger air carriers in the United States.\n       (6) In the past few years, the air transportation industry \n     has become increasingly concentrated. In 2015, the top 4 \n     major air carriers accounted for 80 percent of passenger air \n     traffic in the United States.\n       (7) The continued success of a deregulated air carrier \n     system requires actual competition to encourage all \n     participants in the industry to provide high quality service \n     at competitive fares.\n       (8) Further consolidation among air carriers threatens to \n     leave the industry without sufficient competition to ensure \n     that the people of the United States share in the benefits of \n     a well-functioning air transportation industry.\n       (b) Establishment of National Commission to Ensure All \n     Americans Have Access to and Benefit From a Strong and \n     Competitive Air Transportation Industry.--There is \n     established a Commission, which shall be known as the \n     ``National Commission to Ensure All Americans Have Access to \n     and Benefit from a Strong and Competitive Air Transportation \n     Industry'' (referred to in this section as the \n     ``Commission'').\n       (c) Functions.--\n       (1) Study.--The Commission shall conduct a study of the \n     passenger air transportation industry, with priority given to \n     issues specified in subsection (d).\n       (2) Policy recommendations.--Based on the results of the \n     study conducted under paragraph (1), the Commission shall \n     recommend to the President and to Congress the adoption of \n     policies that will--\n       (A) achieve the national goal of a strong and competitive \n     air carrier system and facilitate the ability of the United \n     States to compete in the global economy;\n       (B) provide robust levels of competition and air \n     transportation at reasonable fares in cities of all sizes;\n       (C) provide a stable work environment for employees of air \n     carriers;\n       (D) account for the interests of different stakeholders \n     that contribute to, and are dependent on, the air \n     transportation industry; and\n       (E) provide appropriate levels of protection for consumers, \n     including access to information to enable consumer choice.\n       (d) Specific Issues to Be Addressed.--In conducting the \n     study under subsection (c)(1), the Commission shall \n     investigate--\n       (1) the current state of competition in the air \n     transportation industry, how the structure of that \n     competition is likely to change during the 5-year period \n     beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, whether \n     that expected level of competition will be sufficient to \n     secure the consumer benefits of air carrier deregulation, and \n     the effects of--\n\n[[Page S1829]]\n\n       (A) air carrier consolidation and practices on consumers, \n     including the competitiveness of fares and services and the \n     ability of consumers to engage in comparison shopping for air \n     carrier fees;\n       (B) airfare pricing policies, including whether reduced \n     competition artificially inflates ticket prices;\n       (C) the level of competition as of the date of the \n     enactment of this Act on the travel distribution sector, \n     including online and traditional travel agencies and \n     intermediaries;\n       (D) economic and other effects on domestic air \n     transportation markets in which 1 or 2 air carriers control \n     the majority of available seat miles;\n       (E) the tactics used by incumbent air carriers to compete \n     against smaller, regional carriers, or inhibit new or \n     potential new entrant air carriers into a particular market; \n     and\n       (F) the ability of new entrant air carriers to provide new \n     service to underserved markets;\n       (2) the legislative and administrative actions that the \n     Federal Government should take to enhance air carrier \n     competition, including changes that are needed in the legal \n     and administrative policies that govern--\n       (A) the initial award and the transfer of international \n     routes;\n       (B) the allocation of gates and landing rights, \n     particularly at airports dominated by 1 air carrier or a \n     limited number of air carriers;\n       (C) frequent flier programs;\n       (D) the rights of foreign investors to invest in the \n     domestic air transportation marketplace;\n       (E) the access of foreign air carriers to the domestic air \n     transportation marketplace;\n       (F) the taxes and user fees imposed on air carriers;\n       (G) the responsibilities imposed on air carriers;\n       (H) the bankruptcy laws of the United States and related \n     rules administered by the Department of Transportation as \n     such laws and rules apply to air carriers;\n       (I) the obligations of failing air carriers to meet pension \n     obligations;\n       (J) antitrust immunity for international air carrier \n     alliances and the process for approving such alliances and \n     awarding that immunity;\n       (K) competition of air carrier codeshare partnerships and \n     joint ventures; and\n       (L) constraints on new entry into the domestic air \n     transportation marketplace;\n       (3) whether the policies and strategies of the United \n     States in international air transportation are promoting the \n     ability of United States air carriers to achieve long-term \n     competitive success in international air transportation \n     markets, and to secure the benefits of robust competition, \n     including--\n       (A) the general negotiating policy of the United States \n     with respect to international air transportation;\n       (B) the desirability of multilateral rather than bilateral \n     negotiations with respect to international air \n     transportation;\n       (C) whether foreign countries have developed the necessary \n     infrastructure of airports and airways to enable United \n     States air carriers to provide the service needed to meet the \n     demand for air transportation between the United States and \n     those countries;\n       (D) the desirability of liberalization of United States \n     domestic air transportation markets; and\n       (E) the impediments to access by foreign air carriers to \n     routes to and from the United States;\n       (4) the effect that air carrier consolidation has had on \n     business and leisure travelers, and travel and tourism more \n     broadly; and\n       (5) the effect that air carrier consolidation has had on--\n       (A) employment and economic development opportunities of \n     localities, particularly small and mid-size localities; and\n       (B) former hub airports, including the positive and \n     negative consequences of routing air traffic through hub \n     airports.\n       (e) Membership.--\n       (1) Appointment.--The Commission shall be composed of 21 \n     members, of whom--\n       (A) 7 shall be appointed by the President;\n       (B) 4 shall be appointed by the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives;\n       (C) 3 shall be appointed by the minority leader of the \n     House of Representatives;\n       (D) 4 shall be appointed by the majority leader of the \n     Senate;
