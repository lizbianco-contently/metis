Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, I asked the Obama \nadministration to step back from the Iran negotiations, press pause, \nand reexamine the point of having the talks in the first place. That \nwould have been the most rational and reasonable approach for the White \nHouse to take, especially considering that its own allies in the Senate \nwere using phrases such as ``deeply worrying'' to describe the \ndirection of the talks.\n  But instead of taking the time to reexamine basic objectives with its \npartners and agree on the nonnegotiable elements of any deal--things \nsuch as anytime, anywhere inspections, complete disclosure of previous \nmilitary-related nuclear research, and phased relief of sanctions tied \nto Iranian compliance--the White House acquiesced instead to artificial \ndeadline after artificial deadline and opportunity after opportunity \nfor Iran to press for additional concessions along the way.\n  The result is the comprehensive nuclear agreement announced today. \nGiven what we do know so far, it appears that Republicans and Democrats \nwere right to be deeply worried about the direction of these talks.\n  It seems Americans in both parties were right to fear that a deal \ninked by the White House would further the flawed elements of April's \ninterim agreement, that it would aim at the best deal acceptable to \nIran rather than one that might actually end Iran's nuclear program. \nRemember, ending Iran's nuclear program was supposed to be the point of \nthese talks in the first place. What is already clear about this \nagreement is that it will not achieve or even come close to achieving \nthat original purpose.\n  Instead, the Iranians appear to have prevailed in this negotiation, \nmaintaining thousands of centrifuges, enriching their threshold nuclear \ncapability instead of ending it, reaping a multibillion-dollar windfall \nto spend freely on terrorism, dividing our Western allies and \nnegotiating partners, some of whom will undoubtedly sell arms to Iran, \nand gaining legitimacy before the world.\n  This was an entirely predictable result--in fact, the most \npredictable result given the administration's stance. As noted back in \n2012, here is what I said: ``The only way the Iranian regime can be \nexpected to negotiate to preserve its own survival rather than to \nsimply delay as a means of pursuing nuclear weapons is if the \nadministration imposes the strictest sanctions while at the same time \nenforcing a firm, declaratory policy that reflects a commitment to the \nuse of force.''\n  But, no, the administration never did that. Instead, it relied upon \ntrain-and-equip programs instead of forward presence, emphasized \nspecial operations forces in economy of force efforts, pursued a \ndrawdown from Iraq and Afghanistan based on timelines, not battlefield \nconditions, and executed a drawdown of our conventional and nuclear \nforces and a withdrawal of those forces by both attrition and \nredeployment. Through actions such as these and by eschewing any \ndeclaratory policy toward Iran, the President made clear to the world, \ncontrary to his rhetoric, that all options were not on the table. All \noptions were simply not on the table. Knowing this, the Iranians never \nfeared for their survival--of course, the survival of their regime \nbeing their No. 1 goal. And so we have the deal we have today.\n  It appears we have lost the chance to dismantle Iran's nuclear \nprogram and that will now become a challenge for the next President to \nconfront, regardless of political party. But the Senate has yet to \nreceive the final text of the agreement. We will not come to a final \njudgment until we do. The country deserves a thorough and fair review \nright here in the Senate, and that is just what we intend to pursue.\n  Committees will be holding hearings, witnesses will be coming to \ntestify, and then Congress will approve or disapprove the deal in \naccordance with the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act.\n  The test of the agreement should be this. Will it leave our country \nand our allies safer? Will this agreement leave our country and our \nallies safer?\n  There are several things we will be looking at in particular as we \nweigh\n\n[[Page S5022]]\n\nwhether it will, and here are a few of them: Will the agreement allow \nfor anytime, anywhere inspections of military installations and \nresearch and development facilities?\n  Will the agreement compel the Iranians to disclose the possible \nmilitary dimensions of their nuclear program?\n  Will the agreement make any real impact on Iran's ability to continue \nresearching and developing advanced centrifuges?\n  Will the agreement's sanctions relief be tied to Iran's strict \nadherence to the terms of the deal, and will we have any real way to \nverify its compliance?\n  These parameters will also help us determine just how successful the \nIranians have been in extracting concessions from the White House. So \nwe will be examining them very closely.\n  I will remind colleagues of the deadly seriousness of the issue at \nhand. This should not be about some political legacy project. This is \nnot some game either.\n  It is certainly not the time for more tired, obviously untrue talking \npoints about the choice here between a bad deal and war. No serious \nperson would believe that is true. Even the people saying these things \nhave to know they are not true, and they probably know that the very \nopposite is, in fact, more likely. So the country doesn't have time to \nwaste on more White House messaging exercises when the seriousness of \nthe moment calls for intellectually honest debate. The choices made \ntoday are sure to affect our country for years--probably decades--to \ncome.\n  The future we leave to our children is at issue as well. The Senate \nshould engage in serious consideration of what faces us in the years \nahead. I invite every Democrat and every Republican to join us in that \ncritical conversation. Our country deserves no less. What we must \ndecide now is whether this is really the right time to be reducing \npressure on the world's leading state sponsor of terror and for what in \nreturn. We already know what the Quds Force is capable of under the \nsanctions regime. What will Iran's support of terrorism look like with \nthe additional funding obtained from sanctions relief?\n  Let's not forget that Iran is pursuing a full-spectrum campaign to \nexpand its sphere of influence and undermine American security and \nstanding in the region. Iran's continued support of terrorism and its \ndetermination to expand ballistic missile and conventional military \ncapabilities should be gravely concerning to each of us. They certainly \nare to me. They pose significant challenges to our country and \nPresident Obama's successor.\n  This comes on top of the many other threats that challenge our \ncountry today and into the future from groups such as the Taliban, Al \nQaeda, and ISIL to increasingly aggressive regimes in Moscow and \nBeijing. A bad deal won't make any of those threats go away. Pretending \notherwise isn't going to make us safer. A bad deal will only ensure \nthat Iran has more funding to threaten us with renewed vigor. It will \nonly ensure that Iran expands its stockpile of missiles and that it \nstrengthens terrorist proxies such as Hezbollah, the Houthi insurgents \nin Yemen, and the Assad regime in Syria.\n  In fact, here is a Reuters headline from this morning. Listen to \nthis: ``Syria's Assad sees more Iranian support after nuclear deal.'' \nThat is the reaction from the Syrian regime. ``Syria's Assad sees more \nIranian support after the nuclear deal.''\n  Look, the White House needs to know that the Congress elected by the \npeople is prepared to do anything it can to make America safer. We want \nto work collaboratively with the President to advance that goal, but if \nwe have to work against a bad agreement to do so--a flawed deal that \nthreatens our country and our allies--I assure you, we will.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/14/senate-section/article/S5022-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton).

Mr. President, in the Chamber this morning we have the \nchairman of the education committee, a man for whom I have the utmost \nrespect. He is a person who understands education. He was the Governor \nof the State of Tennessee. He was the Secretary of Education, and he \nhas been an outstanding Senator.\n  But something occurred last night that I think is really outside the \nspecter of reasonableness. Cloture was filed on the education bill last \nnight, meaning we are going to have a vote on it tomorrow morning.\n  We have worked on a few amendments, and basically all of them could \nhave been accepted with voice votes. There was not a single difficult \namendment that was brought up. So now cloture is being sought, and in \nthe process, ignoring Democratic amendments that we have been waiting \nto offer for some time now. We are not going to allow cloture to \nsucceed unless we have a pathway forward on these amendments.\n  The ranking member of the committee, the senior Senator from \nWashington, knows this. She has talked with the chairman of the \ncommittee about this, and we are going to have to have a reasonable \ntime to debate those amendments and have votes on those amendments. \nOtherwise, we are not going to complete this bill. It is an important \nbill. We should complete the bill.\n  Senate Democrats have said for months that Republicans are running a \nsham on the appropriations process. From the very beginning, the \nRepublicans have proceeded with an appropriations process that is \ndesigned to fail. They moved forward bills they know Democrats cannot \nsupport. Republican leaders in Congress simply have shown no interest \nin funding our government in a fair and responsible manner.\n  This past week, even we were surprised how House Republican \nleadership has handled the appropriations process. Republicans brought \ntheir interior and environment appropriations bill before the House for \ndebate. This legislation is nothing short of a disaster. In fact, the \nbill that they brought to the floor is so bad that President Obama has \nmade it clear already that it will be vetoed.\n  What does it do? It strangles the Environmental Protection Agency's \nbudget, cutting it by 9 percent, $700 million. It prohibits completion \nand implementation of pollution standards for dirty powerplants to \naddress climate change. It cuts funding for State drinking water \ninfrastructure. It cuts funding for National Parks.\n  We have such an infrastructure deficit in our National Park System \nthat it is a crying shame. Yet they cut more from this program. We are \nthe envy of the rest of the world with our national parks, but with how \nthe Republicans have treated this wonderful system of parks we have, \nthey are really being depleted. It allows corporations to shift costs \nof their toxic waste bills to taxpayers.\n  We have had for decades a very successful program to clean up these \nvery, very dirty spills dealing with chemicals and other substances \nthat shouldn't be on the ground. It is called Superfund. What it does \nis make sure that these environmental disasters are paid for by the \npeople who created the disaster. What does the House do on this? They \nchange this and say: No, we are not going to have the people that \nmessed up the environment clean it up; we are going to have the \ntaxpayers clean it up. That is wrong.\n  This bill that was in the House last week blocks hydraulic fracking \nrules for public lands designed to provide transparency and protect \ncommunities that host oil and gas drilling. Rules for public lands, not \nprivate lands--they eliminate that.\n  Those are only a small number of the devastating provisions the \nRepublicans\n\n[[Page S5023]]\n\nhave piled into this funding bill. But even more shocking was what \noccurred next, as legislation pertaining to the removal of the \nConfederate flag brought the Republicans' appropriations bill to a \nscreeching halt. In an attempt to avoid voting on amendments that would \noutlaw the use of Confederate emblems, the House leadership shut down \ntheir own spending bill.\n  The Confederate flag issue was brought up by Republicans. They \naccepted it the day before this debacle took place on the House floor. \nBut then they wanted more debate on the Confederate flag, and it didn't \nsell. What did they do? They figured out a way to drop this bill \ntotally and take it off the floor.\n  Listen to a few of the headlines that were in the newspapers that \nfollow.\n  From the Atlantic: ``Republican Defenders of the Confederate Flag \nDerail a Spending Bill.''\n  From Politico: ``GOP Leaders Yank Bill after Confederate Flag \nFracas.''\n  From Roll Call: ``The Confederate Flag Imperils Republican Goal to \nFinish Spending Bills by August.''\n  Finally, from the Wall Street Journal: ``Confederate Flag Debate \nPrompts House to Pull Spending Bill.''\n  It is very disappointing that this is what the Republican Party of \nthe 21st century stands for--protecting emblems of racism and our \ntragic past. The Congress should not be protecting the Confederate \nflag. Protecting the Confederate flag certainly is not worthy of \nbringing the entire U.S. Government to a standstill. But that is what \nthe Republicans have been doing all along with their bogus \nappropriations bills--bringing our country to a standstill.\n  It has been clear for months that the only way Congress will arrive \nat a responsible budget is by Republicans and Democrats, Senate and \nHouse, sitting down together and finding a path forward. Now is the \ntime to negotiate--not in September, not in October.\n  We know that the Republicans are experienced in shutting down the \ngovernment. They did it before for several weeks. It was devastating to \nour economy, and it was a real shock to the worldwide community. \nSequestration is another ingenious method of the Republicans to hurt \nthe American middle class.\n  Republicans are experienced in shutting down the government. They did \nit 2 years ago. We know how the American economy suffered.\n  Senate Democrats aren't the only ones calling on Republican leaders \nto sit down for bipartisan funding talks. Listen to what was said by \ncongressional Republicans. Hal Rogers is dean of the Kentucky \ndelegation and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. Here is \nwhat he said:\n\n       If we wait until the end of the fiscal year, then we're \n     going to have to pass a C.R . . . then try to cobble together \n     something in the meantime like we've been doing, but under \n     pressure. And that's not the best way to legislate.\n\n  House Appropriations subcommittee chairman Mike Simpson of Idaho \nsaid:\n\n       Under sequestration, the way it currently exists, you can't \n     pass appropriations bills. It ensures that what you've got is \n     a C.R. for the rest of your life.\n\n  House Appropriations subcommittee chairman Tom Cole said:\n\n       The reality is we still live in a divided government. It's \n     not as if the Democrats can be shut out, but they can't \n     dictate to us any more than we can dictate to them. It's time \n     to sit down and see if we can make a deal.\n\n  Charlie Dent, Appropriations subcommittee chairman in the House, from \nPennsylvania, said:\n\n       We all know there's going to have to be a short-term C.R. \n     to take us from September to December. And I would hope \n     sometime between now and then, we'll have a negotiated budget \n     agreement.\n\n  These are just a few of the quotes of the House Republic chairmen. \nThe only way we are going to avoid another Republican Government \nshutdown is by both parties sitting down to construct a bipartisan \nagreement.\n  Let's skip all of the unnecessary drama by starting today to work \ntogether to avoid another government shutdown.\n  What is the business of the day, Mr. President?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/14/senate-section/article/S5023-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the Democratic leader expressed the \nhope that we could have a path to the end on amendments, and I can \nassure him that Senator Murray and I agree with him wholeheartedly. We \nare working together to try to be able to do that. In the committee, we \nadopted 29 amendments. Most of those were Democratic amendments. We \nhave adopted 22 on the floor, and the majority of those are Democratic \namendments. The Democratic leader has been very helpful to allow us to \ncome to the floor without delay, and I can assure him and the majority \nleader that Senator Murray and I intend to try to resolve the couple of \nissues we have right now and be able to recommend to the leadership a \npath forward. It would be my hope that we don't even have to have a \ncloture vote--that we didn't have to have one to get on the floor, and \nI hope we don't have to have one to get off the floor. I am not \nprepared to say we can do that yet, but we agree with him, and we will \ndo our best to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Through the Chair to my friend, the senior Senator from \nTennessee, the way the rules now exist, now after coming in tomorrow, \nthere will be a cloture vote. I say to my friend that we need an \nagreement prior to that or we are not going to get cloture on the bill, \non the substitute, which would be a shame. I hope that we can have \nadequate debate on these amendments. If we have 5 minutes per \namendment, that won't work. I know that my friend is a fair man, but we \nare trying to understand why there was a rush on filing cloture on this \nbill.\n  I know there is a lot of work to do around here, but you can't \nshortchange one bill in an effort to get to something else that may not \nwork either. We have two cloture votes on this bill. We can avoid the \ncloture vote, and that would be great. Maybe we can avoid the cloture \nvote on the bill itself. I hope so. But until my Senators are \nprotected, we are not going to invoke cloture tomorrow morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I understand what the Democratic leader \nis saying. I think the best thing for Senator Murray and me to do is to \ncontinue to work as we have with other Senators. I believe we know \nalmost all of the amendments that are to be adopted. Not only have we \nadopted the ones in committee and the ones on the floor, but Senator \nMurray and I have several dozen other amendments that we are prepared \nto recommend to the full Senate be adopted in the substitute agreement. \nI would say to Senators that if there is any other amendment, I hope \nyou will let us know about it. The filing deadline is 2:30 this \nafternoon. I hope we have all of the amendments that we need to have.\n  Occasionally, I am asked: Why do the Senators argue all the time? My \nanswer usually is this: That is what we\n\n[[Page S5024]]\n\nare here to do. We are presented with the most contentious issues in \nthe country--issues that can't be resolved in other places. So of \ncourse, we are going to argue a lot. We debate. We have rules about \ndebate. We debate what to do about the Iran nuclear deal. We debate \nwhat to do about health care. We debate what kind of trade agreements \nwe should have. But occasionally, we come to a consensus about what to \ndo. A consensus is the way you govern a complex country.\n  I remember very well when I was a very young staff member here, I \nwatched Senator Dirksen, the Republican leader--this was in 1968--and \nPresident Johnson, the Democratic President, work together to pass a \ncivil rights bill. The bill was written in the Republican leader's \noffice, even though it had been proposed by the Democratic President. \nIt took 68 votes to pass it, in order to get cloture at that time. When \nthey finally got 68--it took 67; they got 68--Senator Russell of \nGeorgia, who led the opposition, flew to Atlanta and said: It is the \nlaw of the land; we need to support it. That is why we have the Senate. \nThe Senate has been called the one authentic piece of genius in the \nAmerican political system. It is the only place in our Government that \nencourages and actually forces consensus on important issues.\n  When you take a complex issue and try to resolve it and have it be \nthe rule for a country as big and diverse as ours, consensus is the \nonly way to do it. I cannot think of an issue about which there needs \nto be more consensus than one that involves the 100,000 public schools \nin our country, which have 50 million children and 3\\1/2\\ million \nteachers. Having a debate such as this about elementary and secondary \neducation is like attending a football game at the University of \nTennessee or Arkansas or Washington. Everybody in the stands is an \nexpert. Everybody in the stands knows they can be the coach or the \nquarterback.\n  It is not that easy to get a consensus about what to do about \nelementary and secondary education in America. What is the proper role \nfor the Federal Government? Once you have decided that, then what do \nyou do about it? How much do you spend? What rules do you set?\n  The remarkable thing is that we have come to a consensus in two ways \nhere about our elementary and secondary education legislation which is \non floor today. The first is that we need to get something done. We are \n7 years overdue. Newsweek magazine said this last week in the headline \nto its story: ``The Education Law Everyone Wants to Fix.'' We have \ntried twice in the last two Congresses. It was a well-intentioned \nbipartisan effort. Each failed. Each failed. We don't have to go into \nthe reasons why, but they did fail.\n  In this Congress, we are off to a different start. We have heard from \nour teachers, our Governors, our superintendents, and our parents that \nyou have to get this done. We want the bill to be as much like the one \neach one of us would write as possible. But in the end, let's get it \ndone. Not only do we have a remarkable consensus about the need to fix \nNo Child Left Behind, but we have a remarkable consensus about how to \ndo it. I give a great deal of credit for that to the Senator from \nWashington, Mrs. Murray, who suggested to me that she and I write a \ndraft bill together, which we did. We presented it to our committee, \nwhich includes many of the most liberal Members of the Senate and many \nof the most conservative Members of the Senate.\n  We worked through that draft. We considered 58 amendments. We adopted \n29. A majority of those were Democratic amendments. In the end, every \nsingle member of the committee voted to report it to the floor. That \ndid not mean every single member of the committee supported every \nprovision in the bill, but I think what it meant--and I asked the \nmembers this before they voted: One, has it been a fair process? Have \nyou had a chance to have your say? Is this bill good enough to present \nto the full Senate? The answer was yes for 22 Senators on both sides of \nthe aisle.\n\n  Now, we have come to the Senate floor and we have been here about a \nweek. We have adopted already 22 amendments, 14 of them are Democratic \namendments. We have several dozen more amendments that Senator Murray \nand I have reviewed with our staffs and we agree with them. We are \ngoing to recommend to the full Senate that those be adopted by voice \nvote. They are important amendments, important contributions to the \nbill. We have about two dozen remaining to go which we need to vote on.\n  We need to do that today and we need to do that tomorrow. There is no \nneed for us to go longer than that. We know what the amendments are. We \nhave time to talk about those amendments on those 2 days. One or two of \nthose are particularly contentious. We are trying to work those out.\n  So today what I would appeal to my colleagues for is cooperation. We \nhave had excellent cooperation in the committee. We have had members of \nour committee who agreed not to offer amendments in the committee \nbecause they were told by me and Senator Murray that they have a chance \nto offer those amendments on the floor. We intend for them to have that \nopportunity before we finish this bill.\n  Senators on both sides of the aisle exercised restraint in that way \nin pursuit of a result. Most of the Members of the Senate on both sides \nof this aisle so far in this debate for the last week have done the \nsame. I would simply ask all the Members of the Senate on both sides of \nthe aisle in the next couple of days to show that same kind of \nrestraint and help us get a result.\n  There is no need for us to go more than a couple of days. There is no \nneed for us to have a cloture vote. We should be able to agree the \namendments we know about can be scheduled and there can be an adequate \ntime for debate on those and we can vote on them. We should be able to \ndo that by unanimous consent. We want Senators to have a right to have \ntheir say on amendments that are related--related to elementary and \nsecondary education.\n  So I thank the majority leader for placing this bill on the floor. I \nthank the Democratic leader for helping to create an environment in \nwhich we can succeed. I thank Senator Murray and her staff and our \nstaff for working with the other Senators to get as far as we go. What \nI would ask our colleagues once again to do is to say: Our filing \ndeadline is 2:30. We hope we already have all of the amendments. If \neveryone will cooperate with us, hopefully, the Senator from Washington \nand I can present to the leadership a list of amendments, a time \nagreement for how much debate there should be, and we should get \nstarted. We ought to be able to have one or two amendments voted on \nbefore lunch. When that is agreed to, we will let Senators know. \nOtherwise, I would expect there to be several votes in the afternoon, \nand a great many votes on Wednesday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, at Zillah High School in my home State of \nWashington, Jeff Charbonneau teaches science and engineering classes. \nNearly half of the students in his school are struggling with poverty \nor come from low-income backgrounds. But despite the challenges poverty \ncan present for students, Jeff and his colleagues engage their students \nand work tirelessly to help them succeed.\n  That dedication had paid off. Zillah High School graduates more than \n95 percent of its seniors, and Jeff was named National Teacher of the \nYear a couple of years ago. But despite all of that success, today \nJeff's school is labeled as ``failing.'' The reason: Last year, \nWashington State lost its waiver from No Child Left Behind \nrequirements. That means most of the schools in my home State are \nlisted as failing.\n  That is not fair to teachers like Jeff who pour their energy into \nmaking sure students can succeed. It is not fair to Washington State \nparents who are still facing a great deal of uncertainty about their \nchild's school. It is not fair to students who deserve better than the \ncurrent K-through-12 education law. It is time to finally fix No Child \nLeft Behind. I am working hard to fix this broken law for teachers in \nmy home State like Jeff.\n  I am working to restore certainty for parents in Washington State and \nacross the country because they want to feel confident in the school \nwhere they send their child. I am working to make sure all students can \nget a quality education at our public schools no matter where they live \nor how they learn or how much money their parents\n\n[[Page S5025]]\n\nmake. The Every Child Achieves Act is our chance to finally fix the \ncurrent law.\n  It gives States more flexibility, while also including Federal \nguardrails to make sure all students have access to a quality public \neducation. I look forward to making this good bill even better. It is \nwhy I am disappointed with the majority leader's decision last night to \nfile cloture and move toward ending debate on the bill. We still have \nseveral important issues to address. Senator Franken has an amendment \nto help protect LGBT students from bullying and discrimination at \nschool.\n  I think it is an absolutely critical issue. When students do not feel \nsafe at school, we have failed to provide them with the educational \nopportunities they deserve. I hope all of our Senate colleagues agree \nthat we need to protect LGBT students from bullying and discrimination. \nWe also have an amendment to expand access to high-quality early \nchildhood education from Senator Casey, making sure kids can start \nkindergarten ready to learn. It is one of the best investments we can \nmake to help them succeed in school and later in life. I look forward \nto having that debate on the Senate floor.\n  We also need to improve accountability. Our bipartisan bill already \nincludes some Federal guardrails to help students get access to a \nquality education, but there is more we can do to strengthen those \nmeasures and make sure all kids, especially our most vulnerable \nstudents, are able to learn and grow and thrive in the classroom.\n  So we have many issues yet to work through concluding debate on this \nbill. Getting this right cannot be more important for students across \nthe country. Providing a quality education is not just good for \nstudents today, it is an investment in our future workforce, it is an \ninvestment in our future economy, and it will help our country grow \nstronger. Around the country, and in my home State of Washington, \nparents, students, teachers, and communities are looking to us to fix \nthe No Child Left Behind law. We cannot let them down.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, first of all, before I get into my \nprepared remarks, I want to say thanks to Senator Alexander and Senator \nMurray for their great work on this bill. I very much appreciate where \nwe are today, and hopefully when the amendments are all done, this bill \nwill continue to be a step forward for this country's public education \nsystem and the students who are in it.\n  As everybody may know in this body, I am a third-generation farmer \nfrom North Central Montana. My wife Sharla and I have the incredible \nopportunity of farming the same land my grandfather and grandmother \nhomesteaded and my folks worked for 35 years. I have been working on \nthe farm since I was very young. From the age of 8, I knew I wanted to \nbe a farmer, but my parents were insistent that I work hard in school \nand that I pursue a degree, even though agriculture was in my blood.\n  They knew a degree would give me greater opportunity both on and off \nthe farm. My mother, in particular, had an unbreakable faith in the \npower of public education. So I went to college and after college--I \ngraduated and got a degree--I started teaching in the same elementary \nschool I attended as a child. While my calling as a farmer pulled me \naway from my time as a public school teacher in rural America--now, to \nbe honest with you, the fact is, I could make more money in 1 day \nprocessing meat than I could in a week of teaching school. But that is \nanother problem.\n  Nonetheless, I left the formal public education classroom. But it \nremained a key part of my life because I knew education was important. \nMy parents instilled that in me. So I ran for the school board and got \nelected. I have been involved in public education my entire life, as a \nstudent, as a teacher, as a parent, as a school board member, as a \nState senator, as a grandfather, and now as a U.S. Senator. I have seen \nthe positive impact that good education can have on folks' lives. I \nhave seen how our system has failed too many kids.\n  Last year, Denise Juneau, Montana's Superintendent of Public \nInstruction, put out a report on why graduation matters. Nearly 80 \npercent of the male inmates in Montana's prison system are high school \ndropouts--80 percent of the male inmates in Montana's prison system are \nhigh school dropouts. Nearly three-quarters of the women in Montana \njails are high school dropouts.\n  Superintendent Juneau estimated that Montana could combine crime \nreduction savings and additional revenue of over $19 million annually \nif we just graduated 5 percent more kids and incarcerated fewer of \nthem. Nationally, these stakes are just as high. According to some \nfigures, over 80 percent of the incarcerated population is high school \ndropouts. It is true that over 8,000 Americans drop out of high school \neach and every day. We can see how quickly the cost of incarceration \nwill add up, even if many stay out of trouble and some go back and get \ntheir GED years later.\n  But it is not only the question of incarceration. The only jobs left \nwithin reach of a high school dropout are almost always going to be \nminimum wage or close to it. That perpetuates the cycle of poverty. So \nevery American ought to know what we are up against. I know that what \nwe do this week with the Every Child Achieves Act will affect millions \nof American families for years to come.\n  For the past few months, the Appropriations Committee has been \nworking on bills that impact everything from our national defense to \nveterans, to agriculture, to access to public lands. I have been highly \ncritical of where this majority thinks we should spend money and where \nit thinks we don't need to invest. My colleagues on the Appropriations \nCommittee deserve a lot of credit for doing the best they can, but the \nend result is still unacceptable.\n  They have underfunded care for veterans by over $850 million compared \nto what the VA says it needs to keep up with the increased number of \nveterans accessing the VA. They have rejected efforts to make Head \nStart a full-day, full-year learning initiative. By freezing Head Start \nfunding, they risk kicking more than 12,000 kids out of Head Start, \ndespite the successes I have already told you about prison populations \nand education. It is a direct connection.\n  They have cut half a billion dollars out of clean water projects. \nMeanwhile, they have funneled $40 billion of borrowed money into an \noff-the-books account used for overseas military operations. This week, \nas we work to reform elementary and secondary education to ensure that \nour kids and our grandkids are prepared for the challenges of this \nworldwide economy in which we live, we simply cannot afford to \nshortchange their future.\n  That doesn't just mean providing the framework that will guide our \nNation's 100,000 school districts as they work to improve education \nthat our students receive, it also means letting them make decisions \nfor themselves. If schools are not teaching well, they are accountable \nto school boards. If school boards are hiring bad teachers or \nmisapplying resources, they are accountable to their voters. I can tell \nyou as a former school board member, they are accountable to their \nvoters.\n  But we also have to provide them with the resources they need to \nsucceed. This is an investment we must make. Almost everyone in this \nbody agrees that education is the single best investment we can make to \nensure that folks are able to climb the economic ladder and get out of \npoverty. While I do not agree with everything in the Every Child \nAchieves Act, I can tell you it is certainly a step in the right \ndirection.\n  Most importantly--most importantly--this bill eliminates adequate \nyearly progress known as AYP and moves us away from some of the failed \nhigh-stakes testing we have come to know. The chairman and ranking \nmember need to be applauded for that. No Child Left Behind assumed that \nall students were the same and that success in the classroom meant \npassing a standardized test. We all know that is simply not the case. \nNo Child Left Behind aimed to hold teachers and administrators solely \nresponsible for the performance of their students, and punishment for \nlow performance was rendered in the halls of the Department of \nEducation here in Washington, DC.\n\n[[Page S5026]]\n\n  Well, yes, I can tell you teachers and administrators must be held \naccountable, but much of that achievement gap is tied to things out of \nthe hands of those teachers and administrators. It is tied to what \nhappens outside the classroom.\n\n  Students' lives both inside the classroom and out are significantly \ndifferent depending on their community and the home in which they live.\n  One of the single biggest factors that impact students' lives is \npoverty. If we do not address that issue, then this well-intentioned \nbill will not have the desired effects. If we do not recognize that \nurban poverty and rural poverty are very different, then we will fail \nto keep the promise that in America, any kid can grow up to be in the \nU.S. Senate or be successful in business or in the arts. Quite simply, \nif we are going to hold teachers and students accountable without \naddressing the root of some of the inequities in our public schools, \nthen we are not addressing one of the most basic problems our Nation \nand our schools face.\n  Using a single formula to grade the Nation's 100,000 schools didn't \nwork, especially when folks in Washington expected schools to change \novernight. That expectation added so much pressure to perform that \nstudents and teachers alike dreaded going to school. We lost a lot of \ngood teachers.\n  This bill, resulting from the hard work of Senator Alexander and \nSenator Murray, acknowledges that Washington doesn't have all the \nanswers when it comes to educating our kids. It puts more control in \nthe hands of our States and local school boards.\n  For example, under No Child Left Behind, all 100,000 schools in this \ncountry were subjected to the same regulation for graduation rates. \nUnder that regulation, schools can only count students who graduate \nwith a diploma in 4 years. School districts don't get credit for \nstudents who graduate in 5 years or if they earned a GED.\n  Oftentimes, students who take more than 4 years to graduate have \npersonal or family issues that prevent them from graduating on time. \nStates would have to beg for permission from the Department of \nEducation to count fifth-year graduates, and if the Department chose to \naccept those graduates, it would tell the States how much weight those \nstudents would count toward the schools' assessment. Under the Every \nChild Achieves Act, States will no longer have to apply to count fifth-\nyear graduates and they can determine on their own how to weigh those \nstudents when assessing graduation rates.\n  This bill also builds on the Schools of Promise Initiative that has \nworked well in Montana to put some of our poorest performing schools on \nthe right path. Under the leadership of Superintendent Juneau, the \ncommunities that are home to Montana's five lowest rated public schools \nhave received support to attract and retain better teachers and to \nencourage community members to be more involved in the education of our \nchildren. That model, which empowers districts and schools to get \nbetter--and hire better--is being strengthened by the Every Child \nAchieves Act.\n  While this bill can and should go further to place more power at the \nlocal level, we have taken a good first step in its potential to do \neven better.\n  I recently paid a visit to Busby, MT, on the border of the Northern \nCheyenne and Crow Indian Reservations. Beautiful country surrounded by \nrolling hills, Busby is so small that if you blink while driving, you \ncould miss it. Busby is home to one of Montana's three Bureau of Indian \nEducation schools. It is easy to see how broken America's promise to \nour tribal communities really is when one goes to Busby. The school has \ntoo few resources. The science teacher doesn't have any working \nmicroscopes. The teachers often cut pages out of their instruction \nmanuals and make photocopies for each of their students. And the school \nneeds maintenance.\n  While the scene at many BIE schools would drive you to tears, the \npublic schools that educate over 90 percent of our Native American \nstudents are also in serious need of support. Over the last decade, \nNative American students are the only group--they are the only group--\nwho has not seen improvements in reading and math. In fact, the \nachievement gap in math has actually widened during that time. Native \nAmerican students are also the most likely to skip school or drop out \nand the least likely to go to college.\n  That is why last week the Senate passed my amendment to restore four \ngrant programs that could help improve education in Indian Country, if \nthey get funded. My amendment allows schools and colleges to train \nteachers to understand Native American culture so they are better \nequipped to help those Native American students succeed. It preserves \nfellowship programs for Native American students to get greater hands-\non experience through their degree. It protects gifted and talented \nprograms to better address the needs of bright young Native American \nstudents, and it maintains support for adult literacy and GED programs \nin Native American communities. Those title VII initiatives have never \nbeen funded, but they will have a major, positive impact on Native \nAmericans across the country if we can find the money to fund them. \nLast week's bipartisan vote showed there is real support for these \ninitiatives, and we should provide them with adequate resources.\n  Additionally, this bill includes strong steps toward improving native \nlanguage instruction. It is a very good initiative because we know that \nwhen Indian kids learn in their native language, they do better in \nschool and carry their history and tradition on to future generations, \nand they graduate at a higher rate.\n  Another important step we can take--one that I hear about often when \nmeeting with parents, teachers, and administrators back home--is \nreducing the annual Federal testing requirement because right now, \nunder No Child Left Behind, we are testing our kids to death. As my \ncolleagues know, a student will take 17 federally mandated tests by the \ntime they graduate high school--17.\n  I met with some fourth and sixth grade students, as well as their \nteachers and parents, about how much testing the Feds require. As my \ncolleagues well know, fourth and sixth grade students usually tell it \nlike it is. There is not a political agenda behind it when they ask a \nquestion or tell it the way they see it. So when I asked how much \ntesting is the right amount, one bright young girl replied, ``I don't \nknow, but I can tell you now it is too much.'' A fourth grade teacher \nthere told me they are spending over 4 weeks a year testing. That is 4 \nweeks out of the year. That takes away from instruction time where kids \ncould be learning. The level of testing that is currently required is \nchoking out creativity, innovation, and taking away from our students' \nability to learn.\n  I have offered an amendment to replace that current annual testing \nwith fewer tests. Instead of taking federally mandated tests every \nyear, students would be required to take one test in elementary school, \none test in middle school, and one test in high school. If States want \nto test their students more, they can. If school boards want to test \ntheir students more, they can. But, as the young girl in Billings said, \nwhat we are doing right now is too much.\n  My goal and the goal of many in this body is to give a greater voice \nto the State and local community leaders to determine how best to \neducate the next generation. This bill as drafted puts us on that path. \nIt is a chance to leave a better future for our country by making sure \nthat every child--from the best school in the big city to the poorest \nIndian reservation in Montana--has a chance to succeed.\n  Our schools should not be designed as data warehouses where we can \ncollect statistics on every student in America. Instead, we should be \nmaking sure our students love to learn so that they continue to learn \neven after they graduate and enter the workforce. We should make sure \nthey have the same appreciation for education my mother did. That is \nwhat we should be investing in, and that is whom we should be investing \nfor.\n  I once again thank Senator Alexander and Senator Murray for their \nwork on this bill. I look forward to making this bill better through \nthe amendment process--not worse--so that hopefully we have a good bill \nto vote on at the end of this week.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n[[Page S5027]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 2132\n\n  Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, I rise today regarding my amendment No. \n2132, specifically targeting an opportunity to improve education for \nthose kids attending title I schools. This is a portability amendment.\n  As we debate this Education bill, we must ensure our focus is in the \nright place. Education policy is not about protecting a bureaucracy, it \nshould not be about empowering Washington, and it cannot be about an \nendless, fruitless push for some sort of one-size-fits-all type of \nsystem. This conversation must be about kids--5-year-olds and 15-year-\nolds--and their unlimited potential.\n  I believe without question that each and every child has within them \na reservoir of potential. We should make sure that the access to \nexperiencing the fullness of their potential is available to all \nAmericans throughout this country. Too many of our Nation's children \ntoday do not have access to quality education. They don't have access \nto the education they deserve.\n  Now, more than half of the students in our Nation's public schools \ncome from low-income households. This is an important point. As someone \nwho grew up in poverty, as someone who grew up in a single-parent \nhousehold, I know full well the challenges that come with poverty. Poor \nkids too often move a lot. By the time I was in the fifth grade, I had \nattended four different schools--four schools in my first 5 years of \neducation. That is 4 different administrators, 4 different sets of \nteachers, 4 different funding streams--probably 40 different funding \nstreams. So when we look at this through the eyes of a poor kid or if \nwe look at this through the eyes of a single mother who is struggling \nsimply to make ends meet, it seems very clear to me that providing more \neducational options is the right path forward for us to make sure every \nchild everywhere experiences their full potential.\n  Giving States the ability to provide portability for the title I \ndollars--school choice for those most in need--is the kind of reform \nour kids deserve. It is the kind of reform they need. I don't care \nwhether it is public, private, charter, virtual, home school; I don't \nreally care what option as long as we have all the options so that the \nparents find the best for their kids.\n  Instead of forcing funds through redtape and bureaucracy, let's have \nit directly follow our students. We are not talking about all the \nschool funding this amazing Nation provides--somewhere around $700 \nbillion of funding for schools. We are talking about a sliver--about 14 \npercent. Let that 14 percent of the Federal dollars--let those dollars \nbe portable. Give the children in title I areas the greatest \nopportunity for success we know as a nation.\n  We all understand and appreciate the fact that to achieve the \nAmerican dream today, it requires a quality education. By backpacking \nthose funds, we will help kids who are like I used to be--growing up in \ndifficult circumstances--to look into their own future with hope, \nunderstanding that opportunity lives and breathes everywhere in \nAmerica.\n  We are seeing what happens when the majority of parents simply do not \nhave those basic options, and we are seeing it in some challenging and \nstunning statistics. In 2010, there were 2.8 million high school \ndropouts between the ages of 16 and 24. The unemployment rate in \nAmerica today is around 5.2 percent, but for those kids who dropped \nout, the unemployment rate is 29 percent, and nearly 36 percent--more \nthan a third of those students--were not participating at all in the \nworkforce. Taken as a whole, nearly two-thirds of all high school \ndropouts are simply not working. These are devastating numbers for our \nNation as a whole. No matter where one lives in America, one is \nimpacted by these statistics, and they should cause us to stand up and \ntake notice.\n  These are students who deserve better, students who just need a \nlittle confidence in their abilities, and we can provide that through \nschool choice. These kids, trapped in failing schools and \nunderperforming schools, deserve an opportunity. It is simply not fair \nto our children, it is not fair to their parents, and it is not fair to \nAmerica to allow the status quo to remain.\n  I know there is no silver bullet, but school choice is a large step--\na leap--in the right direction. That is one of the reasons why I \nlaunched my Opportunity Agenda with school choice, the CHOICE Act, as a \npart of the foundation. That is why I am standing here today \ndiscussing--pleading with my colleagues to take a serious look at the \neducational opportunities available in some of the poorest ZIP Codes in \nAmerica.\n  I think it is important to note that my amendment complements a \ngrowing body of evidence where we see 57 school choice programs in 29 \nStates--57 school choice programs in 29 States--not in the South \nprimarily, but in the South, yes; the Southwest, yes; the Northeast, \nabsolutely; and the Midwest, yes. Local and State leaders are figuring \nout that when parents have a choice, kids have a chance.\n  Let me be crystal clear. It is absolutely paramount that we act and \nthat we act now. I know opponents of school choice want to use \n``voucher'' as a dirty word. I understand the tactics of those who do \nnot support giving every child a quality opportunity. I understand. But \nthey forget that the Federal Government already authorizes vouchers for \neducation. We just call them Pell grants. Too often too many of our \npoor kids and our kids of color never receive a Pell grant because \ntheir high schools did not prepare them for college.\n  Now we know there are quality public schools all over this country, \nand we should celebrate the success of our quality public schools. I am \na big fan of our public schools when they work, but I am a bigger fan \nof removing the potential traps to our kids in underperforming schools.\n  We can make a difference, we should make a difference, and this \namendment provides us the opportunity to make that difference today. We \ndon't have to wait until tomorrow. We don't have to wait until next \nyear. We can do it today. You see, this Senator took a Pell grant to \nCharleston Southern University, probably the greatest university in the \nhistory of the country. Charleston Southern University, a private \nuniversity, is where I took my Pell grant and experienced a wonderful \neducation.\n  Faith and hope are two of the most powerful and necessary emotions. \nThey oftentimes serve as the glue to better opportunity. We can restore \nthose two powerful emotions in areas where kids too often are losing \nhope. This Senator knows that personally. This Senator has seen it \nhappen personally in his own life. That is the power of school choice.\n  All of our kids--yes, all of our kids--have amazing potential. I \nbelieve there are good people on the other side of this argument. I \nknow the other side believes school choice, as I am describing it, is \nwrong. I believe they have good intentions. This Senator is speaking \nfrom personal experience. This Senator is speaking from the statistical \nrealities that we see across this country. This Senator is speaking on \nbehalf of those kids who have been trapped too long, locked out too \noften, and said no to too many times. It is up to us as policymakers to \ncreate an environment where we unlock their potential.\n  I hope we will continue to have a robust debate, leaving politics \nbehind and figuring out how to improve educational opportunities for \nall of our children.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                   American Workers and Overtime Pay\n\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, American workers have fought long and hard \nto improve their lot--banning child labor, better safety on the job, \nminimum wage, and an 8-hour workday. Unions often led these fights, but \ntheir efforts also helped tens of millions of workers who often had no \nunion representation.\n  In 1868, Congress passed its first 8-hour workday law, and by 1975 \nrules protecting the 8-hour workday covered about 65 percent of all \nworkers. Of course, those workers might work longer--might be required \nto work longer--but if they did, they got time and a half for their \nextra hours. Managers were exempt from those rules, but they were paid \nmore to offset the lost overtime.\n  To be sure, American workers did their part too. Year over year, \ndecade over decade, workers increased output so that today American \nworkers are among the most productive in the\n\n[[Page S5028]]\n\nworld. The basic 8-hour day, with overtime for extra hours, was a \ngodsend to families, and, in a larger sense, it was a core part of the \ndeal that American workers could count on. From the 1930s through the \n1970s, as American workers' productivity increased, GDP went up and so \ndid wages for the average worker. In other words, as companies got \nricher, their workers got richer too. This was the America that built \nthe great middle class, the America that created opportunity and \nprotected that opportunity for nearly two-thirds of all workers.\n  But over time, that basic deal quietly vanished because we haven't \nmeaningfully updated these rules since the 1970s. Instead of two-thirds \nof the workforce being protected, today only 8 percent of all salaried \nworkers are covered. That means that only the lowest paid workers, \nworkers whose salaries are so low that they are below the poverty line \nfor a family of four, are legally entitled to be paid anything for \ntheir overtime. Today, a fast-food worker or a janitor or a grocery \nstore clerk making a little over $23,000 can be classified as a manager \nand be required to work 10, 12, 14 hours a day, 5, 6 or 7 days a week, \nwith no overtime pay of any kind.\n  Today, the productivity of American workers continues to rise, but \nthe gains go to Wall Street and to CEOs and are no longer shared with \nthe people doing much of the back-breaking work to make it all happen. \nThat is a broken system.\n  Two weeks ago, the President announced he is going to fix these \nbroken overtime rules. The administration's new proposal would raise \nthe salary threshold under which a worker is guaranteed overtime pay to \njust over $50,000, more than double the current threshold and roughly \nback to the 1975 level, when both corporations and workers benefited \nfrom a growing economy.\n  This matters. According to the White House, nearly 5 million \nAmericans--including over 100,000 people in Massachusetts alone--will \nget a raise. They estimate that workers will see an additional $1.4 \nbillion in wages in just the first year alone.\n  But make no mistake, it will be a fight. Some businesses are used to \ngetting an extra 5, 10, 20 hours for free from their employees--and \nthey are just fine keeping the rules just the way they are. They will \nclaim that fixing overtime will hurt businesses. Well, don't believe \nit. History shows that increases in overtime pay are actually good for \nthe economy.\n  Employers usually respond to increases in the overtime threshold in \none of three ways. Some will actually pay existing employees overtime \nfor the extra work. Others will avoid overtime costs by hiring more \nworkers to get the job done, and some will increase the hours of part-\ntime workers. That is what we are likely to get: higher wages, more \njobs or more hours for part-time workers. Even the National Retail \nFederation, which has lobbied hard against fixing the overtime rules, \nadmits this proposal will add tens of thousands of jobs to this \neconomy. We need those jobs.\n  But this issue is about more than jobs. This issue is also about \nfairness. If a worker puts in more time and produces more for the \ncompany, the worker should get a chance to share in its benefit. No \nmore free work. Economic growth over the past three decades has been \nbuilt on the backs of hard-working people, and it is time those hard-\nworking people get a little bit more of all they have produced.\n  Fixing our outdated overtime rules will not end inequality. It is \ntime to raise the minimum wage. Women should get equal pay for equal \nwork. Workers deserve paid sick leave and paid family leave. Social \nSecurity should be expanded. But this is an important step forward, a \nvital piece of the puzzle that will increase wages, increase hours, and \nincrease employment for millions of Americans, and it is a step that \nwill show that the government can be made to help working people. There \nare plenty of examples of Washington writing rules that favor the rich \nand the powerful, but this time we have an overtime rule that will give \nworking families a fighting chance to build some security for \nthemselves. The President has proposed a new rule to benefit working \nfamilies, and the rest of us are here today ready to fight for that \nrule.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, we are continuing our discussion of \nlegislation to fix No Child Left Behind. We are still hopeful that we \nmay have an agreement that we will have one or two votes before lunch.\n  I remind Senators that because of their cooperation we have done \npretty well. We have adopted 29 amendments in committee, 22 already on \nthe floor. Senator Murray and I have a large number of other amendments \nthat we are prepared to recommend to the full Senate be adopted by \nconsent. We have about two dozen amendments which we would like to have \na vote on today and tomorrow. So the sooner we can move to those, the \nbetter, which will take some cooperation from all Senators.\n  Senator Tester, the Senator from Montana, was here earlier. I thank \nhim for his comments. He is a former school board member. He recognizes \nthat the idea that we want to restore responsibility for student \nachievement to local school boards, to classroom teachers, to States, \nto chief State school officers is not just a Republican idea, it is a \nbipartisan consensus. We agree. We want to know whether the children \nare learning, but we want to restore to the States the decisions about \nwhat to do about the results of the tests the students take.\n  As the New York Principal of the Year wrote to us, wrote to our \ncommittee: We cherish our children, too. What she was saying was just \nbecause we fly to Washington once a week doesn't make us any more \ncaring or any wiser about how to deal with 50 million children in \n100,000 public schools from Native villages in Alaska to the mountains \nof Tennessee. In fact, we are less able to deal with that because we \nare further removed from those students.\n  The Senator from South Carolina, Mr. Scott, made that point \neloquently. He said school choice is not a political slogan, school \nchoice is an option, and we should look at it from the point of view of \nsomeone who is low-income or someone who is growing up in a home with a \nsingle parent, which he did. He talked from his own perspective. We \nshouldn't look down, we should be looking up. Look up at opportunity. \nLook up to the point of view of a single parent with less income and \none or more children who is thinking: How can I help my children rise? \nHow can they look up? Probably the one thing that almost all of us \nwould agree on is, the better the educational opportunity is, the more \nchance that child has to climb the ladder.\n  If you have money in your family, you have those choices. You may \nmove to a different part of town or you may choose a private school if \nyou have the money. If you don't have the money, you don't have the \nchoices. So what Senator Scott proposes to do is to take $14 billion of \nFederal funding and allow States--this is not a mandate on the State; \nthis will be up to the State--to say that money can follow the low-\nincome child to the school the child's parent wants that child to \nattend, public or private.\n\n  There is often a lot of talk about what is the proper Federal role \nfor education. Some people don't think there is any. I was in that camp \nand probably still would be if I were the king. I remember going to see \nPresident Reagan in the early 1980s and suggesting that the Federal \nGovernment get completely out of elementary and secondary education and \nlet the States do it all. In exchange, the Federal Government would \ntake all of Medicaid. That would have been a good swap for the States, \nand it would have been good for education. But that is not where we are \nas a country today.\n  But if someone were to say what is the single reason why the Federal \nGovernment ought to have something to do with education, one answer \nwould be to prevent discrimination, and another answer would be to help \nlow-income children.\n  What is the best way to help the low-income child? This is what the \nSenator from South Carolina is saying: Why don't we take the money we \nhave available, and let it follow that child to the school that the \nchild's parent thinks is best? That is what we allow the wealthier \nparent to do. Why don't we\n\n[[Page S5029]]\n\ndo it for the child? Why do we send it through bureaucracies and let \nother people make that decision? Why do we look down when, instead, we \nshould be looking up?\n  As he also pointed out, it is not such an alien thought--this idea of \nletting money follow a student to a school. He pointed out that since \n1944, with the GI bill for veterans, we have had great success in this \ncountry with allowing Federal dollars to follow students to the college \nof their choice.\n  In fact, the GI bill for veterans is often described as the most \nsuccessful social piece of legislation in our country's history. It \nhelped to create the ``greatest generation.'' It said you could take \nyour Pell grant or your student loan to Notre Dame, to the University \nof Arizona, to Maryville College in Tennessee or you can go to Yeshiva, \nyou can go to Howard University. That is your choice. Public, for-\nprofit or nonprofit, you go. If it is accredited, that is your choice.\n  We also have vouchers, and that is a voucher at the other end of the \nscale. We have something called the child care and development block \ngrant. It is a very big Federal program, maybe $8 billion. It says to \nlow-income mothers--mainly mothers--that here is a voucher that you \ncould spend at a daycare center while you work or while you go to \nschool so that you can earn enough money so that you won't have to have \na government voucher anymore.\n  So we have vouchers for parents with 3-, 4-, 5-, and 6-year olds. We \nhave vouchers for students who are 18, 19, and 21 years olds, and \nsomehow we think there is something wrong with having vouchers for \nelementary and high school students. That line is changing all the \ntime.\n  I was in Jackson, TN, recently, and the president of Jackson State \nCommunity College told me that 30 percent of the students at Jackson \nState Community College are also in high school. We call that dual \nenrollment. That means that while you are a junior or a senior in high \nschool, you might be taking physics, mathematics or some program at the \ncommunity college or some apprenticeship there that might better \nprepare you for a job.\n  At Walters State Community College in Morristown, TN, I spoke at the \ngraduation this year. A student there was graduating from Jefferson \nCounty High School and Walters State Community College in the same \nweek. That student was going on to Purdue University, but he was going \nto enter Purdue at the second semester of his sophomore year. In other \nwords, because he had been in both community college and in high \nschool, he was able to save, he said, $65,000 by enrolling in the \nsecond semester of the sophomore year.\n  So we have a voucher to help him pay, if he is low income, to go to \nWalters State Community College, but somehow there is something wrong \nwith a voucher to allow him to choose among the public high schools he \nattends. That doesn't make a lot of sense based on our history. It \nwould be rare that we have a social experiment or a social legislation \noffered in our country where we have these two good pilot programs: the \nGI bill for veterans, operating since 1944, and the child care and \ndevelopment block grant, operating since the first President Bush was \nin office and which was reauthorized just last year by Congress.\n  We all vote for Pell grant vouchers. We all vote for child care and \ndevelopment block grant vouchers, and then we have a big argument when \nit comes time to talk about vouchers for elementary and secondary \neducation. I think a way to resolve that is to take Senator Scott's \nadvice. Instead of looking down on the students, let's look up. Let's \nlook up from the perspective of Senator Scott--the Senator from South \nCarolina--when he was a child, when he was growing up in a home without \nmuch money, with a single parent, with limited educational options.\n  He knows the value and option that a Pell grant gave him for college. \nHe would like to extend that option to elementary and secondary \neducation for students who grow up as he grew up, and I would like to \ndo that as well. We have an opportunity to do that by voting for his \namendment when it comes time for a vote on this bill. I intend to vote \nyes, and I hope my colleagues will too.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up Casey amendment No. 2152, the Strong \nStart for America's Children Act, an amendment to the Every Child \nAchieves Act, which will establish a Federal-State partnership to \nprovide access to high-quality public prekindergarten education for \nlow- and moderate-income families.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, as well, to add Senators \nTester, Reed of Rhode Island, Klobuchar, and Merkley as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to adding the cosponsors?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, this is \na very important amendment that was thoroughly discussed in the \neducation committee when we considered this legislation.\n  Both Senator Murray and I believe it should be offered on the floor \nand that Senators should have a chance to vote on it.\n  The trouble is that the Finance Committee objects to the way it is \npaid for. And in a moment, on behalf of the chairman, Senator Hatch, \nthe Senator from Utah, I will have to object.\n  But my hope would be that the Senator from Pennsylvania, who is a \nmember of that committee, could work with the chairman and the ranking \nmember to come up with a different way of paying for the bill so that \nSenators would have a chance to vote on this important amendment today \nor tomorrow.\n  So I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, by way of response, I understand what my \ncolleague from Tennessee just mentioned as it relates to the objection \nto the so-called pay-for. I don't agree, obviously, for a couple of \nreasons.\n  No. 1 is I would hope that corporations that get the benefit of \nretaining a lot of operations in the United States and then seek to \navoid taxes by so-called inversion would understand, I believe, the \nduty they have to this country. They benefit from our workers, our \ninfrastructure. They benefit in so many ways. I would hope those \ncompanies would understand and Senators here would agree with the \nnotion that they should undertake the duty to pay their fair share. I \nunderstand there is a debate about that. I understand there is an \nobjection, but I would hope at some point we can get to the resolution \nof this basic question: Are we going to require companies to do more if \nthey seek to engage in a tax-avoidance scheme by a so-called inversion?\n  But I respect what my colleague said, and we will try to move forward \nconstructively.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I have nothing more.\n  Mr. CASEY. I yield to my colleague from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, first I commend my friend and colleague from \nPennsylvania, Senator Casey, for his amendment, and I appreciate the \ndiscussion between him and the chair of the committee.\n  I think that getting rid of these inversions is very important. I am \nsurprised people on the other side don't want to do it, but so be \nit. Funding this program is the most important way, and if we could \ncome up with a bipartisan way to get the funding, that will help \neducate millions of America's young children, and that is why I support \nthis amendment so strongly.\n\n  Educating our children is not a sprint, it is a marathon. No one just \ngets up one day and decides to run a marathon. They plan, they train, \nand they eat right. We can avoid the most common problems if we start \nour kids\n\n[[Page S5030]]\n\nout early with the right training, not just for some but for every \nstudent.\n  The research has shown that children who attend high-quality \npreschool programs are more likely to be prepared for school and \ngraduate on time. They get better jobs. They are less likely to wind up \nin the criminal justice system or to rely on our social safety net. All \ntoo often in this body we do what many groups, corporations, and others \nin America do, we are unwilling to think of the long term. We may be \nspending a dollar today on this program, but we are going to save tens \nof dollars for each dollar we spend over the long run. All the studies \nshow it. So having quality pre-K programs for kids who need it is a \ngreat investment in America. Yet millions of middle-class and low-\nincome children don't have access to these programs that would provide \nan immense benefit to them and our country.\n  In short, pre-K should not be a luxury for the wealthy. Every child, \nno matter where they live or how much money their parents make, should \nbe able to start their education in pre-K. It is not only for the good \nof them and their families but for the good of America. Senator Casey's \namendment helps us get there by helping States fund high-quality \nprekindergarten for 4-year-olds from low- and moderate-income families. \nIt specifies that all preschools be inclusive of children with \ndisabilities and addresses the need for increased funding to support \ntheir needs.\n  As I said, there is nothing wrong with doing inversions. Getting rid \nof them is the right thing to do, but if there is another way to go, I \nam certainly open to it, and I know Senator Casey, our leader on this \namendment, is too.\n  By the way, we will see where the pay-for is. It is the kind of win-\nwin that everyone can get behind, and so I hope my colleagues will come \ntogether and fully pay for this. If we can't do it with inversions, \nwhich I think is right--and I believe most Americans would think \nclosing the inversion loophole is right--let's find something else.\n  In New York, there are cities and communities that are already making \nthe investment to ensure access to pre-K for their children. It is \nworking. But at a time when budgets are tight, they shouldn't have to \ndo it alone. Under this amendment, New York will receive the support it \nneeds to serve an additional 137,000 kids over 5 years. States across \nthe country would be able to help a similar number of their \nschoolchildren, all without costing the Federal Government a single \nplug nickel.\n  As we debate how to best ensure students graduate ready for college \nor careers, we are doing a disservice if we ignore the need to invest \nin early education.\n  I thank my friend Senator Casey for offering this amendment. I urge \nmy colleagues to vote on it in the original form. Stand up against \nthese inversions, but if that vote fails, to have a different proposal \nwould be a good thing to do, although I think we should have a vote on \nthis particular amendment first.\n  Mr. President, I would like to speak for a moment, with the \nindulgence of my colleagues, on the title I cuts and the amendment \nSenator Burr has offered with respect to title I funding, which of \ncourse provides assistance to low-income districts and schools that \neducate a high number of low-income children.\n  We cannot forget that title I is the largest source of Federal \neducation funding and applies to a wide swath of school districts and \nincludes many suburban and middle-class communities as well as school \ndistricts in our cities where poverty is concentrated. You might say: \nWell, this only affects the poor. It doesn't. If a school is going to \nlose its title I funding, they may have to do it and spend the money on \ntheir own and take away from science or afterschool programs or sports \nor something else. It affects everybody. Even though title I, since the \ndays of Lyndon Johnson, was aimed at poor kids, it is going to hurt \neverybody if we make the kind of drastic cuts in so many school \ndistricts that the Senator from North Carolina has proposed.\n  What Senator Burr's amendment would do would not increase funding, \nwhich is what we usually do around here when we want to try to change \nformulas, as we should. He simply robs Peter to pay Paul. He takes away \nmoney from a needy school in one State to give to a needy school in \nanother State.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, over 9,600 school \ndistricts across the country will lose title I funding under this \namendment. These schools count on title I funds year in, year out. They \nbudget for it, and without the funding, they could be forced to lay off \nteachers, cut afterschool programs, and make other dramatic cuts. So it \nis no answer. Redistributing a limited pie is no way to make Federal \npolicy.\n  One of my disappointments with this bill is that every American \nsupports increased funding in education, particularly in things like \ntitle I. The bill doesn't do it.\n  At a time when America is competing against China, Japan, Europe, and \nthe world, we are saying we shouldn't help with education, which is the \nladder up for so many millions of American families, but we are not. \nBut then to say, while keeping the funding flat, we should take huge \namounts of money--$300 million from my State--and give it to other \nStates to help the poor, when in fact it doesn't even require that that \nmoney goes to the needy, that doesn't make much sense, in my opinion, \nand that is not the way to legislate.\n  We should have a real conversation about our Federal investment in \neducation, one that recognizes that all of our school districts with \nlow-income student populations would benefit from additional resources, \none in which my colleagues across the aisle are fond of saying, in a \ndifferent context, we are not picking winners and losers. I think we \nwould agree that all of our low-income school districts need and \ndeserve extra help.\n  In conclusion, education is the cornerstone of the American dream. We \nhave to keep that American dream alive, and there is no better way than \nin funding education. I know my colleagues believe that.\n  I hope everyone will join us across the aisle in opposing Senator \nBurr's amendment to change the title I formula without increased \nFederal support for our schools.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York for \nhis remarks. I know how passionately he feels about the amendment by \nthe Senator from North Carolina. He has made that clear to me on more \nthan one occasion, and my hope is that the Senator from New York and \nthe Senator from North Carolina will have a successful resolution of \nthat difference of opinion in the next day or two. I know Senator \nMurray and I will be glad to work with them to try to do that, but I \nhear him loud and clear, and I appreciate him coming to the floor and \nmaking those statements.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If the Senator will yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Tennessee, and \nI know how much he cares about both this bill and education. I look \nforward to making this bill as good a bill as we possibly can make it, \nand so I am always open to any suggestion he might make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York. He \nhas not been on the floor in the past at the beginning of the day when \nI thanked both the majority leader and Democratic leader for their \nattitude toward this bill. While it is probably not noticed by people \naround the country, it is noticed here.\n  The Democratic leader and the Democratic leadership, which the \nSenator from New York is a part of, allowed this bill to come to the \nfloor without any delay. We have had a chance to offer and consider a \nlot of amendments. We have already considered and adopted 22 on the \nfloor.\n  Senator Murray and I have several dozen or more that we will \nrecommend to the full Senate to be adopted, and we have about two dozen \nother amendments that we would like to begin voting on soon. We seem to \nbe moving along. Senators are cooperating.\n  There have been some developments this morning that are encouraging, \nand I hope to be able, within the next few\n\n[[Page S5031]]\n\nminutes, to announce that we will have a few votes--one to four votes--\nbefore lunch and that we will have more votes at 4 p.m., but I am not \nable to make that agreement yet. For the information of Senators, that \nis our hope. Then, tomorrow, if we continue on this path, we will have \na large number of votes.\n  I thank the Senators for their cooperation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I have just a point of clarification. I may \nhave said amendment No. 215-something, it is amendment No. 2152.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise again in support of my sanctuary \ncities amendment and to urge us to come together around sensible \nlegislation that will stop jurisdictions around the country from \nopposing and not following what is already Federal law.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, Federal law is very clear. It says \ndeportation and immigration enforcement is a Federal responsibility, \nbut local law enforcement authorities need to properly cooperate with \nFederal authorities regarding that. It doesn't mean they need to take \nit over or take on huge burdens or unfunded mandates. It does mean they \nneed to properly cooperate with Federal authorities.\n  Well, for several years, as the Presiding Officer knows, there have \nbeen hundreds, if not thousands, of so-called sanctuary cities in other \njurisdictions around the country that have a formal policy that is \ncompletely at odds with that. These policies in various jurisdictions, \nsuch as the city of San Francisco, say straight out: We are not going \nto cooperate in any meaningful way with Federal immigration \nenforcement. I think that is flatout ridiculous, and tragically it \nleads to dangerous situations and horrible results. We saw one of those \ndangerous situations and horrible results just in the last few weeks \nwith the murder of a completely innocent woman in San Francisco by an \nillegal alien who had been convicted of felonies seven times, deported \nfive times, and released onto the streets of San Francisco, in part, \nbecause of San Francisco's sanctuary city policy.\n  This absurdness--political correctness gone haywire--is to the \ndetriment and danger of American citizens, and it has to end. That is \nwhy several years ago I brought legislation to the Senate, beginning in \n2009, to put teeth in what is already Federal law. My legislation will \nensure that there are consequences when jurisdictions, such as San \nFrancisco, don't properly cooperate with Federal authorities over \nimmigration enforcement. Unfortunately, that has been blocked and \nblocked and blocked in the Senate.\n  I brought the same proposal as an amendment to the education bill \nthat is on the floor now to revisit this issue and to urge us to come \ntogether around sound, sensible policy that ends sanctuary cities \nflaunting Federal law and creating very dangerous situations. I urge my \ncolleagues to come around to a commonsense solution to that.\n  I have fully cooperated with Senator Alexander, who has been the \nfloor leader on this important education bill. As part of that, I \nagreed not to demand a vote on that amendment on the floor this week if \nour Judiciary Committee, the appropriate committee of jurisdiction, \ntakes up the issue in a timely way--we reached that agreement yesterday \nwith Senator Grassley, the chair of the Judiciary Committee--and that a \nVitter bill on this topic would be taken up appropriately at a markup \nof the Judiciary Committee this work period.\n  Well, that is certainly progress, and so let's use this opportunity \nto make real progress and end sanctuary cities flaunting Federal law \nand not properly cooperating with immigration enforcement. Let's come \ntogether around a strong, meaningful bill that doesn't allow that, that \nputs consequences and teeth in present Federal law that says local law \nenforcement has to properly cooperate with Federal immigration \nenforcement.\n  I very much look forward to doing that in the Judiciary Committee--\nthe committee of jurisdiction--thanks to the work of Senator Alexander \nand the agreement of Senator Grassley to take up this measure to work \nwith me and have a markup this work period.\n  I very much look forward to that being a very constructive path \nforward. If for any reason it is not, I will certainly be back. I will \ncertainly be back directly on the floor in the context of the highway \nbill or some other significant piece of legislation because we can't \nallow this ridiculous political correctness to continue to create truly \ndangerous situations in communities all over the country.\n  Federal law requires local law enforcement to properly cooperate with \nFederal immigration enforcement. The problem is there are no teeth in \nthat law, and that law is ignored and flaunted all the time by many \njurisdictions which advertise and brag about their so-called sanctuary \ncity policy and they will not cooperate with Federal immigration \nenforcement in any way. Really? A seven-time convicted felon, five \ntimes deported from the country. And once he was back in, still \nreleased onto the streets of San Francisco to commit murder? Really? \nThat is really going to be your policy? If it is, is it really going to \nbe our response that we do absolutely nothing about it?\n\n  I urge appropriate action. I urge us to come together around \ncommonsense change and reform to end this all-too-pervasive practice. I \nlook forward to starting that very constructive path forward in the \nJudiciary Committee with the markup of the Vitter bill, and I am \nalready working with Senator Grassley and his staff in this work \nperiod.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I wish to say to the Senator of \nLouisiana two things:\n  First, I understand his passion on this issue. I have heard him speak \nabout it. He talked to us last week about how best to express that on \nthe Senate floor. There are a number of Senators who share his view on \nthat. He is a member of the Judiciary Committee. We will have an \nopportunity to deal with it when the committee does work next week.\n  Second, I would like to say to him through the Chair that I greatly \nappreciate the way he has handled this. He not only gave us advance \nnotice of his interest in this amendment last week, he has worked in \nthe Judiciary Committee to find a way to move ahead on his interest \nwithout interfering with the progress of our bill to fix No Child Left \nBehind. I am not surprised by that because he has made a major \ncontribution to the bill to fix No Child Left Behind. Specifically, we \nhave adopted his language or some of his language that would end the \ncommon core mandate and stop Washington, DC, from telling Louisiana, \nArizona, Tennessee, and Washington State what their academic standards \nhave to be. If a State wants to have an academic standard, it can have \nit; if it doesn't want it, it doesn't have to have that particular \nstandard.\n  The fact that the Senator has been willing to say that this is a very \nimportant issue and that he will work with Senator Grassley in the \nJudiciary Committee and pursue it there leaves us free to move ahead on \nfixing No Child Left Behind, which is important to his State as well as \nto all other States. I greatly appreciate the way he has handled that \nand thank him for doing that.\n  We are still hoping to consider three or four amendments and perhaps \nhave one rollcall vote before lunch, but we will know more about that \nin the next few minutes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as we continue to debate this bipartisan \nbill to fix the badly broken No Child Left Behind law, I want to take a \nstep back to lay out why this is so important.\n  First of all, the idea of a strong public education for all children \nis part of who we are as a nation. It is sewn into the fabric of \nAmerica.\n  Providing quality education is also an economic imperative. When all \nof\n\n[[Page S5032]]\n\nour students have the chance to learn, we strengthen our future \nworkforce, and that helps our country grow stronger. And we empower the \nnext generation of Americans to lead the world. Education is like \ninsurance for our Nation's future economic competitiveness in the years \nto come. It opens more opportunities for more students, and it helps \nour economy grow from the middle out, not the top down.\n  One of the best ways I believe we can strengthen our education system \nis by making sure more students start kindergarten ready to learn. As \nwe work to fix No Child Left Behind, we also have the opportunity to \nexpand access to high-quality early childhood education and set \nstudents on a path toward success.\n  I am very proud of the bipartisan early learning grants we secured in \nthe base of this bill. I think we should continue to build on that \nbipartisan progress to make sure more students have access to high-\nquality early learning programs. That is exactly what Senator Casey's \namendment would do. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  First of all, it is important to understand why early learning is \nessential. Learning begins at birth. Research suggests that before \nchildren set foot in kindergarten, they have already developed a \nfoundation that will determine all of the learning, health, and \nbehavior that follows. Early learning programs can strengthen that \nfoundation so more students can start their K-12 education on strong \nfooting.\n  Preschool programs can be especially important for students from low-\nincome backgrounds. A child growing up in poverty will hear 30 million \nfewer words by her third birthday compared to a child from a more \naffluent family. That is a serious disadvantage. By the time she starts \nkindergarten, the deck will already be stacked against her and her \nfuture success.\n  Studies have confirmed both the short-term and long-term benefits of \nquality early learning. Children who attend preschool are less likely \nto repeat a grade. They are less likely to be placed in special \neducation. They are less likely to drop out of school, depend on social \nsafety net programs, or commit a crime. And they are more likely to go \nto college and earn higher wages. Research suggests we get back between \n$7 and $8 for every dollar we invest in high-quality preschool \nprograms.\n  Simply put, early learning is one of the smartest investments we can \nmake for our families, our children, and our country. But today just 14 \npercent of our 3-year-olds in America are enrolled in Federal- or \nState-funded preschool programs and 41 percent of 4-year-olds are \nenrolled.\n  If we are serious about closing education gaps in grades K through 12 \nand if we are truly committed to making sure all students have the \nchance to succeed, we have to invest in quality early education.\n  I was pleased that during the committee debate on this bill, we were \nable to pass a bipartisan amendment for early childhood education. I \nthank my colleague Senator Isakson for working with me to include that \nin the committee markup. Throughout this process, I have appreciated \nthe way he has worked with me on a bipartisan basis to improve the \nlegislation before us.\n  Our amendment, which is now part of the base bill we are considering, \nwould create a grant program for States that want to improve early \nchildhood education coordination, quality, and access. The program \nwould target resources to low- and moderate-income families. States \nthat want to serve children from birth to the time they enter \nkindergarten will be eligible. It will help support the work that \nStates like my home State of Washington are already doing to make sure \nmore of our youngest learners have access to preschool. These grants \nwill help States improve the quality of their early childhood system \nand also expand access to high-quality early learning opportunities for \nmore children.\n  While I am very proud of what we have achieved in this base bill on \nour early childhood education, this is not the last step we need to \ntake to improve and expand access to high-quality preschool. The grants \nare a step in the right direction, but we need to significantly \nincrease investments to ensure that every child in this country starts \nkindergarten ready to succeed.\n  My colleague, the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, offered an \namendment that would expand access to high-quality preschool programs. \nIt would provide Federal funding to every State that commits to improve \naccess to high-quality learning opportunities for all of our low- and \nmoderate-income 4-year-olds. For the States that already meet that \ngoal, it will help them offer preschool to 3-year-olds. This amendment \nwould support States that don't yet have the infrastructure needed to \nprovide preschool to all low- and moderate-income kids. With preschool \ndevelopment grants, these States will be able to build up their early \nlearning systems. This amendment also provides funding for early Head \nStart and childcare partnerships to improve the quality of childcare \nfor infants and toddlers through age 3 and provide funding for early \nlearning services for young children with disabilities. Finally, his \namendment recognizes the importance of the Maternal, Infant, and Early \nChildhood Home Visiting Program, which I helped to create to deliver \nvoluntary parent education and family support services to parents with \nyoung children.\n  I am glad to say this amendment will be fully paid for by closing a \nwasteful corporate tax loophole. Our Tax Code is riddled with a lot of \nwasteful loopholes and special interest carve-outs. Far too many of \nthese tax breaks are skewed to benefit the wealthiest Americans and \nbiggest corporations.\n  Today some of my Republican colleagues objected to bringing up his \namendment solely because it would close one of those corporate tax \nloopholes. It is disappointing that they are choosing the biggest \ncorporations over our youngest learners.\n  I urge our Senate to consider this amendment. I support it because I \nbelieve investing in our youngest learners is so important for our \nchildren and their families, and it is one of the smartest investments \nwe can make so students can start kindergarten ready to learn and \nsucceed later in life.\n  I don't believe this is a partisan issue. When I talk to sheriffs in \nmy State, they tell me the young people they bring into the police \nstation might have chosen a better path in life had they had a stronger \nstart in school. That is why law enforcement officials across the \ncountry want Congress to expand early learning.\n  Military leaders have stressed the importance of early learning \ninvestments. In fact, at a Senate hearing last year, Air Force Brig. \nGen. Douglas Pierce, Retired, said: ``How we prepare our youngest kids \nto learn and succeed has a profound impact on our military readiness.''\n  Business leaders have called on Congress to support preschool \nprograms. Why? Because they need the students of today to be able to \ncreate and take on the jobs of the 21st-century global economy.\n  Lawmakers from red States and blue States alike see early learning as \na wise investment. Alabama, Kansas, Michigan--States with Republican \nGovernors and Republican-controlled legislatures--have recently made \nstronger investments in early learning.\n  It is now time that the U.S. Senate catch up with what State \nlawmakers, business leaders, law enforcement officials, and military \nleaders recognize. We need to invest in early childhood education so \nall of our students can start school ready to learn.\n  The importance of early childhood education is something I have \nwitnessed firsthand. Before I ever thought about running for office, I \ntaught preschool in a small community in my home State of Washington. I \nremember that the first day with new students would always start the \nsame way: Some kids would not even know how to hold a pencil or turn a \npage in a book. But over the first few months, they catch up; they \nlearn how. They learned how to listen at story time. They learned how \nto line up for recess. By the time they left for kindergarten, they had \nbasic skills so they could tackle a full curriculum in school. I have \nseen the kind of transformation early learning can inspire in a child.\n  If we are serious about strengthening our education system, we have \nto make sure more children have the chance to get a strong start in \npreschool. In reauthorizing this Education bill, we have the chance to \nhelp more students start kindergarten ready to learn.\n  With the amendment Senator Casey offers, we have the opportunity to \nset\n\n[[Page S5033]]\n\nkids on the path toward success not just in grade school but into \nadulthood. We have the chance to fortify our economic competitiveness \nfor years to come.\n  I urge my colleagues to support his amendment, to support this bill \nthat already contains bipartisan early learning grants, and then take a \nstep further and support the Casey amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I would say to the Senator that we are \nhoping to be able to lock in some amendments, but we are not quite \nready yet. So what I might do is ask him to yield during his speech so \nthat we can do that. I would say to the Senator through the Chair that \nwe look forward to his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   American Workers and Overtime Pay\n\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I want to join my colleagues in voicing my \nsupport for President Obama's proposal to extend overtime benefits to \nnearly 5 million people across the country. These new rules will \nsignificantly enhance family budgets and add over $1.2 billion \nnationwide to workers' pockets. Once implemented, the proposal would \nmore than double the salary threshold for overtime eligibility from the \ncurrent level of $455 per week to $970 a week next year. That means \nemployees earning an annual salary of around $50,000 or less will \nautomatically become eligible for overtime pay. Today, the annual \nsalary threshold for earning overtime pay is around $24,000. That is \nwell below the poverty level for a family of four, particularly so for \nfamilies in Hawaii.\n  The overtime salary threshold is long overdue for an update. Since \n1975, it has been updated only once. Forty years ago, nearly two in \nthree employees benefited from overtime pay--two in three. Today, it is \none in nine.\n  I appreciate the priority this administration and especially \nSecretary Perez have placed on work and family issues, policies that \ndirectly impact the lives of average Americans.\n  According to the Department of Labor, approximately 20,000 workers in \nHawaii would become eligible for overtime pay with this rule change.\n  By increasing the overtime salary threshold, current employees would \nbe able to earn more money and employers could hire more workers, \ncreating more jobs for our economy.\n  Housing, transportation, and food costs in Hawaii have made Hawaii \none of the most expensive places to live in the country. The high cost \nof living requires a large percentage of people in Hawaii to work more \nthan one job. The new overtime rules could allow workers to make a \nliveable wage with one job. If a worker is able to live without a need \nfor a second or third job, it creates more employment opportunities for \nindividuals struggling with unemployment or underemployment to find \nwork.\n  The potential change in overtime rules can offer more than financial \nbenefit to Americans. If a business does not want to pay overtime, the \nemployees' hours would be limited to 40 hours a week. Since they are \nsalaried and not paid by the hour, they would have more time off with \nno loss of pay. This would allow individuals to better balance their \nwork and family obligations and give them the opportunity to spend more \ntime with their family, a chance to volunteer in their community, or \nperhaps further their education.\n  The new rules will be subject to a 60-day public comment period. I \nencourage my constituents from Hawaii to let their voice be heard.\n  This change in overtime rules is appropriate and will help to lift \nour national and state economy, offer families more choices, and foster \ngreater fairness in the workplace.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. For the information of Senators, I am about to ask for \nunanimous consent--which I expect to receive--to have two rollcall \nvotes and two voice votes before lunch. So I now will do that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 12:10 p.m. the Senate vote in \nrelation to the following amendments: Scott No. 2132, Booker No. 2169, \nPortman No. 2137, Bennet No. 2159; further, that at 4 p.m. today the \nSenate vote in relation to the following amendments: Isakson No. 2194, \nBennet No. 2210, Lee No. 2162, and Franken No. 2093; with no second-\ndegree amendments in order to any of the amendments prior to the votes; \nthat there be 2 minutes equally divided prior to each vote, with 4 \nminutes prior to the vote on the Franken amendment, and that all after \nthe first vote be 10-minute votes; that the Scott and Franken \namendments be subject to a 60-affirmative-vote threshold for adoption \nand that it be in order to call up any amendments in the list not \ncurrently pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask to set aside the pending amendment \nand call up the following amendments en bloc: on behalf of Senator \nBooker, amendment No. 2169; Bennet amendment No. 2159; and Bennet \namendment No. 2210.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is now 2 minutes of debate prior to a \nvote on the Booker amendment No. 2169.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of my amendment, \nwhich I am offering with Senator Inhofe, Senator Grassley, Senator \nAyotte, and Senator Wyden.\n  The homeless population is at an alltime high in our country, with 1 \nin 45 children--or 1.6 million--homeless in the United States every \nyear. Homeless students experience a significant educational \ndisruption, and only about 11.4 percent are proficient in math and 14.6 \npercent proficient in reading compared to their peers. Homeless \nstudents are almost twice as likely as other students to have to repeat \na grade, be expelled, get suspended, or drop out of high school.\n  There are more than half a million foster children in the United \nStates, and foster children also have challenges and are not likely to \nbe on grade level, more likely to change schools during the academic \nyear, and more likely to drop out of high school.\n  Sixty-seven percent of inmates in our State prisons are high school \ndropouts, and this disproportionate share comes from these backgrounds.\n  The amendment is simple. It adds a simple reporting of the graduation \nrates for homeless and foster youth to the State and school district \nreport cards so we can begin to focus in on this important population \nwe should not leave behind. It provides----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for an \nadditional 18 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n  Mr. BOOKER. This amendment provides essential information to \neducators, policymakers, and the public toward improving the \neducational outcomes for these students.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from New Jersey \nfor his passion for education but suggest that I am going to vote no \nbecause this amendment is premature. It is another burden on States. It \nadds reporting requirements instead of reducing reporting requirements. \nIt adds 2 new subgroups for every school in the country, and there are \n100,000 of those. These populations are difficult to track due to the \ntransient nature of the populations. For foster youth, school districts \nare poorly equipped to do it. Child welfare agencies would probably do \nbetter.\n  Now what we should be doing is recognizing that we do not need a \nnational school board. This is a good argument, but it should be made \nto the local school board or to the State school board. We do not need \nanother Federal mandate on 100,000 local schools. That is exactly the \nwrong direction for us to go.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

This is a program that is working incredibly well around \nthe country, both to get young people through high school and to \nincrease graduation rates, which is part of the objective of this \nlegislation, and also to get them not just into college but to stay in \ncollege. All of the experience from this program indicates it is \nworking.\n  I had a recent opportunity to visit the Dayton Early College High \nSchool, the academy, and 100 percent of their graduates are from a low-\nincome area. Almost every single one of the students were either the \nfirst generation to go to college or into the military. Their retention \nrate in college is incredibly impressive. This amendment encourages \nmore of that.\n  Early college high schools are working. It is part of the reform \neffort that is being undertaken in my State and others, and I strongly \nencourage a ``yes'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I am honored to join with the Senator from \nOhio in cosponsoring this amendment. I, too, have recently visited an \nearly college high school in my home State, which Delaware State \nCollege, our historically Black college, has established. It has shown \nreal promise in terms of the possibilities for college access, college \naffordability, and college completion.\n  I urge an ``aye'' vote from my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am here today to stand up for Maryland \nand for all the students who could lose resources under an amendment \noffered by the Senator from North Carolina, Mr. Burr.\n  There is much I admire about Senator Burr, but his current amendment \nwould cause Maryland tremendous problems. The Burr amendment would \npunish States that make significant investments in those students who \nneed extra help. This amendment would not do one thing to lift kids out \nof poverty or to close the achievement gap. In fact, it makes it worse.\n  The so-called hold-harmless provision that is in the amendment does \nnot hold Maryland harmless. It does not prevent any of the Maryland \nschool districts from losing money. Under the Burr amendment, Maryland \nwould lose $40 million. Let me repeat. Under the Burr amendment, \nMaryland would lose $40 million.\n  Marylanders know that I have always been on the side of students, \nteachers, those who run programs, and the taxpayers who pay for them. \nWe in America believe in public education, where one generation is \nwilling to pay taxes to fund the education of the next generation.\n  Title I in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act was created to \nlift children up and to close the education gap.\n  Let me tell you what the Burr amendment would do. Right now, every \ncounty and Baltimore City would lose money. There are 24 school \ndistricts in Maryland, with 400,000 public school students. Mr. \nPresident, 170,000 students--or 45 percent of that population--are \neligible for something called title I funding. If the Burr amendment \npasses, every single one of those boys and girls would lose academic \nresources they currently get. Let me give you the numbers: Baltimore \nCity, 12 percent; Baltimore County, 23 percent; Garrett County in \nwestern Maryland, 20 percent; Somerset County on the Eastern Shore, 15 \npercent.\n  From my students in urban schools in the Baltimore/Washington \ncorridor to my rural schools in western Maryland and the Eastern Shore, \nevery single one loses resources, and if you lose resources, you lose \nopportunity. If we believe in an opportunity ladder, then do not cut \noff the rungs. It is not the schools that lose, it is the kids who \nlose. They lose resources and they lose opportunities.\n  I have heard from school superintendents across Maryland. They tell \nme the same thing over and over: Do not cut the money for title I.\n  Dr. Henry Wagner, the superintendent in Dorchester County over on the \nEastern Shore, says that the rural schools on the Eastern Shore would \nbe impacted and that he would have to eliminate teaching positions, \nreduce reading and math services. And the very services to bring in \nparents would go by the wayside.\n  Over in Washington County, the gateway to the Eastern Shore, Dr. \nClayton Wilcox, the superintendent of Washington County schools, \ndescribes how a rural school would be harmed. In his letter in which he \ndescribes title I, he said: Senator Mikulski, title I resources ``have \nallowed us to create hope.'' He said: ``They have enabled us to provide \nextra instructional support in literacy and math--subjects that open up \nwindows and doors often shut to [these boys and girls].'' Without title \nI dollars, Washington County would have to cut this instructional \nsupport in literacy and math. He writes: ``Senator Burr's amendment is \nbad for the children and young people of Maryland.'' It is bad for all \nof the children in Maryland.\n  Baltimore City, where we certainly have had our share of problems \nlately, would be deeply cut. Right now, Baltimore City receives $50 \nmillion. It will lose 10 percent of that funding. Mr. President, $5 \nmillion in Baltimore right now sure means a lot. If we cut that money, \nwe are going to shrink pre-K access. The afterschool and summer \nlearning programs will go by the wayside. If they go by the wayside, \nyou will not only have kids with time on their hands, but they will \nfall behind in reading, in the very things they had gained over the \nschool year. And the professional development for teachers, especially \nthose new teachers we were bringing in, will be eliminated.\n  I am so proud that Maryland allocates more of its title I dollars to \nschools that need it the most. For example, 85 percent of students in \nBaltimore--those kids live in poverty. It has the lowest wealth per \npupil in Maryland. So the State allocates more of its resources in this \narea.\n  Maryland actually gets penalized under the Burr amendment for putting \nmoney where it will do the most good, and, in fact, Maryland gets \npenalized for making education a priority. Well, I thought we believed \nin State determination. If a State determines it is going to make a \nsignificant investment\n\n[[Page S5036]]\n\nin public education and make the funding of the closing of the \nachievement gap a priority, why punish it for States that cut taxes, \ncut opportunity? And now we want to change the formula to reward their \nbehavior when we should be rewarding the good behavior of States like \nmy own.\n  This amendment is bad for Maryland, it is bad for other States, and \nmost of all it is bad for children. Mr. President, 58 percent of the \nstudents who benefit from title I funding will get fewer resources, \nless opportunity.\n  Title I certainly does need to be reformed and refreshed. Senators \nMurray and Alexander should be congratulated in the way they led the \ncommittee through a civil, cogent process. But we cannot make changes \nbased on the needs of a handful of States that essentially have \npenalized their own children.\n  The last time the Congress reauthorized the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act was in 2001. During that reauthorization, Congress \nclearly stated that it shall be a national priority that title I should \nbe a priority. In that bill, Congress committed to steadily increase \nfunding for title I. But Congress never fully funded the program. It \nnever provided the adequate funds.\n  In the major effort that was done just 2 weeks ago within the \nappropriations bill of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, \nSenator Murray offered an amendment to increase title I by $1 billion. \nEvery single Republican on the committee voted against it.\n  We cannot keep doing this. We need to fully fund title I. This is not \nabout statistics. This is not about numbers. This is about human \nbeings. The genius of America is that we believe--we believe--in the \neducation of our people, that we truly believe that the way we lift all \nboats in our country is to have a public education system that works \nwell and is funded adequately.\n  We have had a formula that has worked for title I because it rewards \nthose States that are willing to make public education and the next \ngeneration a priority. Let's keep the formula we have. Let's reform \nwhere we need to. And let's make sure that our focus is not on bottom \nlines but that more children get to the head of the class.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, early childhood learning is critical to \nbuilding a strong foundation for each child's welfare and success. It \nis linked to better outcomes in school, such as high school and college \ncompletion rates, higher wages, and better social and emotional skills.\n  Research shows that for every dollar spent, the benefits of early \nchildhood education to society are $8.60. Around half of that reflects \nincreased earnings for children when they grow up. Early childhood \neducation can also lower involvement with the criminal justice system \nand reduce the need for remedial education.\n  Clearly, early childhood education such as pre-K is crucial to \npreparing each generation for the academic and professional challenges \nahead. There is no doubt that families play a critical role in \nachieving academic success. When families are involved in children's \nlearning at a young age, it better prepares them to succeed in school. \nResearch shows that when parents and families are involved in their \nchildren's education, children are more likely to succeed. For example, \nchildren whose parents read to them at home recognize letters and write \ntheir names sooner than those whose parents do not.\n  It is because of the importance of early childhood education and \nparent and family involvement in that early education that I worked on \nlanguage that is now included in the Every Child Achieves Act.\n  I thank my colleagues, Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray, \nfor working with me to include language allowing funding for programs \nthat promote parent and family engagement in the new early learning and \nimprovement grants as a part of the Every Child Achieves Act. This \neffort was also supported by the National PTA, the National Center for \nFamilies Learning, the National Education Association, and the American \nFederation of Teachers. The competitive early learning alignment and \nimprovement grants would provide funding to States that propose \nimprovements to coordination, quality, and access for early childhood \neducation. The language I worked on would allow States to use funding \nfrom the early learning alignment and improvement grant to develop, \nimplement or coordinate programs determined by the State to increase \nparent and family involvement; encourage ongoing communication between \nchildren, parents, and families, and early childhood educators; and \npromote active participation of parents, families, and communities.\n  I thank my colleagues again for working with me to get this included \nin a substitute amendment because parent and family engagement in those \nearly years is critical to each student's success as well as to our \ncountry's future.\n  I am committed to working with partners in Indiana to ensure that \nHoosier children can take advantage of these important programs, and I \nstand ready to continue working with my friends on both sides of the \naisle to further invest in early childhood education so we can provide \nbrighter futures for more Hoosiers and additional American children.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNET. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I am obviously a Senator from Colorado, but as I rise, I am speaking \nmore as the father of three daughters in the Denver Public Schools and \na former superintendent of schools.\n  It was a great privilege of mine, probably the privilege of a \nlifetime, to have been the superintendent of Denver Public Schools for \nalmost 5 years. I can't begin to express, as I am standing on this \nfloor, my gratitude for what I have learned from teachers, principals, \nand parents who were sending their kids to what was then a school \ndistrict that had seen declining enrollment for many years. It is now \nthe fastest growing urban school district in America. Of course, the \nstudents themselves day after day inspired all the adults around them \nto want to help deliver a high-quality education.\n  But I also was struck when I was superintendent with the barriers \nthat we have accepted as a country and as a society that we would never \naccept for our own children. We would never accept them for our own \nchildren. The first barrier I talked about on the floor before is the \nfact that if you are born poor in this country, you show up to \nkindergarten having heard 30 million fewer words than your more \naffluent peers. This is an enormous barrier we haven't addressed as a \ncountry, and there are many other challenges up to and including the \nfact that we have made it harder and harder as years go by for people \nto afford a college education without bankrupting themselves or \nshackling themselves to a mountain of debt.\n  In the face of all that, we have been very slow to change. We have \nbeen very slow at every level to change the way we deliver K-12 \neducation or early childhood education through higher education. Let me \njust give you one example that this bill addresses today, in part. We \nhave done almost nothing in this country to change the way we attract \nteachers, recruit teachers, inspire teachers, train teachers, reward \nteachers, since we had a labor market that discriminated against women \nand said the only job you can have is being a teacher or being a nurse. \nThose are your two jobs. So why don't you come to the Denver Public \nSchools and teach Julius Caesar every year for 30 years of your life \nfor a really low compensation. But if you stick with us for 30 years--\nwhich you would not do anymore--we will give you a pension worth three \ntimes that of Social Security. That sounded like a good deal because \nyou\n\n[[Page S5037]]\n\nwere likely to outlive your spouse, you weren't paid a lot during your \nlifetime, and you get the pension at the end. We have done nothing to \nchange that. That is our offer.\n  I can tell you again--not speaking as a politician but speaking as a \nschool superintendent, speaking as somebody who has never done anything \nbut substitute teach. I have never actually taught as a traditional \nteacher. I substitute taught from time to time. That is the hardest job \na person can have, especially when you are teaching in a high poverty \nschool. It is much harder, I can say without any doubt, than any job \nany Member of the U.S. Senate has. Yet we have an offer that belongs to \nan era that no longer exists.\n  In all honesty, we used to subsidize the public education system in \nthis country through that discrimination in our labor, our approach to \nlabor, because even though the deal wasn't a good deal, we might have \nbeen able to get the very best British literature student in her class \nto commit to be a teacher of British literature because she had no \nother options except for perhaps becoming a nurse. Fortunately, that \nhasn't been true in this country for 30 or 40 years, but we haven't \nupdated the offer, and we haven't changed the way we train our teachers \nonce they get there.\n  That is why this bill is important in some parts because it makes \nsome important steps in the right direction. We are not going to teach \nchildren from Washington. Our kids who today are in systems all across \nthis country in their schools and classrooms are never going to \nremember who here worked on the new version of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act. That is not going to be of concern to them, \nbut hopefully what they will remember is a third grade teacher who made \na huge difference for them, a fourth grade teacher who made a huge \ndifference for them, a college adviser who took a special interest and \nmade sure somebody who didn't know that college was for them was for \nthem.\n  Our job, it seems to me, is to do what little we can to try to help \nput people at home in a position to do that job. That is why it is \ncritical in this bill that we raise the quality of professional \ndevelopment by encouraging ongoing training and education that actually \ntracks the specific strengths and areas of growth for each individual \nteacher, instead of group workshops that we know are ineffective. For \ninstance, teachers who need help in classroom management will receive \ntraining in that specific area, if a school district or a school would \nwant to do that.\n\n  We promote collaboration and the use of common planning time, so that \nteachers can work together in groups as teams, each of whom may have a \ndifferent view of each kid but together can figure out how to get each \nchild in the school to their potential. One of the things I heard all \nof the time from the teachers that I worked with in Denver was that \nthey felt that they faced a binary choice when it came to their \nprofession. Yet they loved to teach. They loved being with the kids. \nBut the only other option besides teaching was becoming a principal or \ngoing to work in the central office. We worked very hard in that school \ndistrict and across the State to think differently about career ladders \nfor teachers, to give more opportunity and options for people to give \nback, and to be able to help perfect their own craft as teachers by \nlearning from their peers and also serving as master teachers.\n  This bill, for the first time, allows funding to be used for hybrid \nroles that allow teachers to serve as mentors or academic coaches while \nremaining in the classroom. It creates options, as I said. It \nencourages teacher-led and colleague-to-colleague professional \ndevelopment among teachers. I may have learned it the hard way, but I \nknow that nobody knows how best to improve instruction more than our \nteachers do.\n  But the struggle is how to figure out how to break out of the old \nroles to give people the opportunity to be able to have the chance to \nmentor their colleagues and also, significantly, have the time in the \nschool day and in the school year, when the stress of other business \nmakes it hard to do, to create the time for people to be able to work \ntogether for our kids.\n  In this bill we recognize the work that is happening in cities such \nas Chicago, Denver, and Boston, around teacher residency programs, an \nalternative approach to bringing teachers into the profession, not \nrelying anymore solely on higher education, understanding that maybe \nwhat we need is content matter experts who can learn how to teach by \nbeing latched to master teachers in a school district such as the \nDenver public schools, who bring their content, their substance from \ntheir undergraduate degree but can acquire a masters as they are \nlearning on the job in the classroom, as in a medical residency \nprogram. We allow funding to be used for that. These programs can \nprovide critical clinical experience to teacher candidates.\n  There is funding to train and place effective principals to lead \nhigh-need and low-performing schools. You cannot have a good school \nwithout a good principal. Ask anyone. You cannot have a good working \nenvironment for a teacher without a good principal. It is impossible. \nWe skipped over that in our efforts of implementation across the \ncountry. When I had the good fortune to be the superintendent of Denver \nPublic Schools, my chief academic officer was a guy named Jaime Aquino, \na gifted school leader.\n  He and I would start every single day for 2 hours with a group of 15 \nprincipals in one of their schools. It was not about broken boilers, \nand it was not about who got left on the bus. It was about teaching and \nlearning in Denver Public Schools.\n  We would do the same thing for 3 weeks, and then we would start over \nagain, which meant that I got to see every principal in my school \ndistrict once every 3 weeks, and they got to see each other. They came \nto understand that they had a reciprocal obligation to each other as we \nthought about the obligation we had to the kids in Denver. I will give \nyou an example of one of the sessions. Jaime would bring a 1\\1/2\\-page \npiece of student writings to these meetings, because it is really \nimportant for teachers to look and analyze student work to be able to \ndifferentiate their instruction to meet the individual needs of kids in \nthe classroom.\n  It is easy to say that. It is easy to have the fly-by professional \ndevelopment where a bunch of people are sleeping in auditorium \nlistening to really boring stuff. It is another thing to actually get \npeople to want to do the work. At the beginning it was hard. We would \npass out that piece of student writing and you would hear sort of a \ncrescendo as people were talking about it, and they would say: I cannot \nread this. I don't know what this says. This looks like a foreign \nlanguage to me.\n  Then Jaime would say: Based on what you have read, what are Nancy's \nstrengths as a writer?\n  She turned out to be a very typical fourth grader in our school \ndistrict.\n  They would say: Well, she writes from left to right. She has a sense \nof story structure. She spells high-frequency words correctly.\n  Jaime would say: Well, why is that? He would say: Well, maybe she had \na vocabulary test. He would say: Maybe she had a word wall, and she is \nusing it to scaffold her instruction.\n  Over time, the principals saw what their role was as leaders and how \nreliant we were on them.\n  I can tell you firsthand that school leaders have a powerful affect \ndramatically improving the quality of teaching and raising student \nachievement, and we have skipped over them. This bill no longer skips \nover them.\n  We also update and improve the teacher incentive fund in this bill. \nWe encourage districts to redesign their systems for recruiting, \nhiring, and placing teachers.\n  We incentivize districts to think about paying different teachers \ndifferently. In Denver, we don't have a monopoly on wisdom, but if you \nare working in a high-poverty school, you get paid more for that. It is \nharder to find you. It is a harder job. We recognize that. If you are \nteaching a subject for which it is hard to find people to teach, we pay \na little more for that.\n  If you are driving student achievement or your colleagues are, we pay \nyou a little more for that. Through this incentive fund, we promote \nschool autonomy over budgeting, staffing, and other school-level \ndecisions. We incentivize folks to change hiring schedules so high-need \nschools can hire\n\n[[Page S5038]]\n\nearlier in the year and select from the best and brightest teachers, \ninstead of the reverse.\n  So we have done some good things here on teachers. It is one of the \nreasons why I am supporting this legislation. I want to thank Chairman \nAlexander and Ranking Member Murray, who are both on the floor today, \nfor their exceptional leadership in bringing this bill out of \ncommittee. The people who are watching this on television know that \nthis body cannot seem to agree on anything these days. Because of their \nwork, we were able to produce a bill that got unanimous support in the \nHELP Committee. Every single member of the committee supported it. \nImagine that. Imagine that in this body.\n  You know what. There are no ringers on that committee either. That \ncommittee has the junior Senator from Kentucky on it, Mr. Paul; it has \nthe junior Senator from Vermont on it, Mr. Sanders, and everybody in \nbetween. That is a rare case of unanimity among a very diverse set of \nSenators, which I think argues well for getting this bill through in \nthe Senate and hopefully in the House.\n  I see my colleague is here. If I can just take 2 more minutes I want \nto mention a word or two about the title I formula. I have joined my \nfriend from North Carolina in supporting an amendment to change the \ntitle I funding formula. The formula I think that we are trying to \npropose today is sensible and eliminates the overly complex and opaque \nformulas that we currently have. It creates one formula that is \ntargeted and provides more funding for districts with higher \nconcentrations of poverty.\n  I am extremely sensitive to the arguments that others have made, such \nas my friend from New York. I also agree that we need to invest \nsignificantly more in our kids. This formula change is good for my home \nState of Colorado. I think if you are a poor kid in Alamosa or Woodrow, \nCO, you deserve every chance to get a great education, including \nreceiving an equitable share of Federal resources.\n  With that, I see my colleague from Utah is here. So I will relent and \nyield the floor and come back at a later time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                Amendment No 2162 to Amendment No. 2089\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask to call up and make pending the Lee \namendment No. 2162.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 \n     relating to parental notification and opt-out of assessments)\n\n       On page 52, strike line 3 and all that follows through line \n     9 and insert the following:\n       ``(K) Parental notification and opt-out.--\n       ``(i) Notification.--Each State receiving funds under this \n     part shall ensure that the parents of each child in the State \n     who are scheduled to take an assessment described in this \n     paragraph during the academic year are notified, at the \n     beginning of that academic year, about any such assessment \n     that their child is scheduled to take and the following \n     information about each such assessment:\n\n       ``(I) The dates when the assessment will take place.\n       ``(II) The subject of the assessment.\n       ``(III) Any additional information that the State believes \n     will best inform parents regarding the assessment their child \n     is scheduled to take.\n\n       ``(ii) Delayed or changed assessment information.--If any \n     of the information described in clause (i) is not available \n     at the beginning of the academic school year, or if the \n     initial information provided at that time is changed, the \n     State shall ensure that a subsequent notification is provided \n     to parents not less than 14 days prior to the scheduled \n     assessment, which shall include any new or changed \n     information.\n       ``(iii) Opt-out.--\n\n       ``(I) In general.--Notwithstanding the requirement \n     described in section 1111(b)(3)(B)(vi), or any other \n     provision of law, upon the request of the parent of a child \n     made in accordance with subclause (II), and for any reason or \n     no reason at all stated by the parent, a State shall allow \n     the child to opt out of the assessments described in this \n     paragraph. Such an opt-out, or any action related to that \n     opt-out, may not be used by the Secretary, the State, any \n     State or local agency, or any school leader or employee as \n     the basis for any corrective action, penalty, or other \n     consequence against the parent, the child, any school leader \n     or employee, or the school.\n       ``(II) Form of parental opt-out request.--Unless a State \n     has implemented an alternative process for parents to opt out \n     of assessments as described in this subparagraph, a parent \n     shall request to have their child opt out of an assessment by \n     submitting such request to their child's school in writing.\n\n       ``(iv) Applicability.--The requirements relating to \n     notification and opt-out in this subparagraph shall only \n     apply to federally mandated assessments. A State may \n     implement separate requirements for notification and opt-out \n     relating to State and locally mandated assessments.''.\n       On page 58, on line 21, after ``paragraph (2)'' insert \n     ``(except that such 95 percent requirements shall exclude any \n     student who, pursuant to paragraph (2)(K), opts out of an \n     assessment)''.\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Paul be \nadded as a cosponsor to my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, parents and teachers all across America are \nfrustrated by Washington, DC's heavyhanded, overly prescriptive \napproach to public education policy. I have heard from countless moms \nand dads in Utah who feel as though anonymous Federal Government \nofficials, living and working 2,000 miles away, have a greater say in \nthe education of their children than they do.\n  One of the most frustrating issues for parents is the amount of \nstandardized tests that their children are required to take, \nparticularly the tests that are designed and mandated by the Federal \nGovernment. It is not just the frequency of those tests that is \nfrustrating. Too often parents do not know when these federally \nrequired assessments are going to take place, and they do not even find \nout until after the fact. It is important to recognize that this is not \na partisan issue. The notion that parents should not be expected to \nforfeit all of their rights to the government, just because they enroll \ntheir children in the public school system, is not a Democratic idea \nnor is it a Republican idea. It is simply an American idea.\n  That is why several States, including States as distinct as \nCalifornia and Utah, have passed laws that allow parents to opt out of \nfederally required tests. But there is a problem. Under current law, \nStates with opt-out laws risk potentially losing Federal education \ndollars if a certain portion of parents decides opting out is best for \ntheir children, because schools are required to assess 95 percent of \ntheir students in order to--and as a condition to--receive Federal \nfunds.\n  The bill before the Senate today, the Every Student Achieves Act, \ndoes not fix this problem. My amendment does. Here is how. My amendment \nwould protect a State's Federal funding for elementary and secondary \nschools by removing the number of students who opt out of Federal tests \nfrom the number of non-assessed students. In other words, the number of \nstudents opting out of federally required tests could not threaten a \nState's eligibility to receive Federal funds.\n  My amendment would also give parents more information about tests \nmandated by the Federal Government, ensuring that parents are notified \nof any federally required assessment that children are scheduled to \ntake. It would allow parents to opt out their children from such \nassessments. It is important to note that this amendment would have no \neffect on assessments that are required by the State, local education \nagency, school or teachers. Nor does it prohibit a State from expanding \ntheir parental opt-out laws to apply to a broader set of assessments if \nthey choose to do so.\n  This amendment would not jeopardize a State law that provides parents \nthe opportunity to opt out their children and it would allow the State \nto continue to use its own process that allows parents to take such \naction.\n  Whether you believe the bill before the Senate today strikes the \nappropriate balance between Federal and State control, I think all of \nmy colleagues can support this amendment. I believe all of us can agree \nthat parents\n\n[[Page S5039]]\n\nshould have the final say in their child's education and should have \naccess to information about the testing that is taking place before \nthat testing takes place, and they should be able to decide whether \ntheir child will be part of that testing.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah for his \ncomments. We will be voting on the Senator's amendment this afternoon \nat 4 o'clock, and I want to just make a couple of comments about it.\n  I have a little different view of what his proposal is. He talks \nabout our being opposed to Washington's heavyhanded approach. The way I \nunderstand his proposal, it is even more of a heavyhanded approach than \nthe bill we are voting on today, and this is why.\n  His proposal is that Washington tells Utah or Oklahoma or Tennessee \nor Washington State what to do about whether parents may opt out of \nthese federally required tests. Now, they are not federally designed. \nUtah has its test. Tennessee has its test. They are designed by the \nStates, but they are required. And there would be--since 2001, and this \ncontinues that--for example, two tests for a third grader. The \ntestimony would be that it might take 2 hours for each test, so that \nwould be 2 hours for a math test, 2 hours for a science test; then \nagain in the fourth grade, 2 hours for a math test, 2 hours for a \nscience test.\n  I don't think anyone believes those are a great burden on students, \nit is all the other tests that seem to be required as schools prepared \nfor the tests I just described. What we have done in this legislation \nis restore to States the power to decide how much these standardized \ntests count.\n  So the legislation Senator Murray and I have proposed--and that came \nout of our committee unanimously--for the first time authorizes States \nto decide whether parents may opt out, may allow their children to opt \nout of these tests or not. Let me say that again. The legislation that \nSenators will be voting on, hopefully tomorrow for final passage, \nallows States to decide for themselves whether parents may vote to opt \nout of the No Child Left Behind tests.\n  The proposal from the Senator from Utah is a Washington mandate that \nsays to States that Washington will decide that.\n  So our proposal is local control. His, the way I hear it, is \nWashington knows best. That is like Common Core.\n  The proposal that is on the floor for a vote tomorrow says Washington \nmay not mandate to any of our States what its academic standards should \nbe. That ends the Washington Common Core mandate. In the same bill, why \nshould we put a Washington mandate about whether you can opt out of \nyour test? Why don't we allow States to make that decision?\n  So I say to my Republican friends, especially, do we believe in local \ncontrol only when we agree with the local policy? I don't think so.\n  The great economist Art Laffer likes to say: States have a right to \nbe right, and States have a right to be wrong.\n  I have a different view. I am going to vote no on the amendment of \nthe Senator from Utah because it takes away from States the right to \ndecide whether and how to use the Federal tests and whether parents may \nopt out.\n  Why is that a problem? Well, in the following States, States use \nthese tests as part of their State accountability system. They don't \nhave to do it, but they do use it. I am told by the State of Tennessee \nthat if we were to adopt the Utah proposal Federal mandate, that the \nState would have to come up with a different accountability system.\n  So which States on their own have decided to use these tests as part \nof their State accountability system? Florida has, Georgia, Idaho, \nIndiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, \nPennsylvania, Tennessee, and Texas.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote for the Alexander-Murray proposal \nbecause it reverses the trend toward a national school board and \nspecifically allows States to decide whether States may opt out of \ntests while the amendment goes the other way. It is a Washington \nmandate that takes away from States the ability to make that decision.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2194 to Amendment No. 2089\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask to set aside the pending amendment \nand call up my Isakson amendment No. 2194.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Isakson] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2194 to amendment No. 2089.\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require local educational agencies to inform parents of \n any State or local educational agency policy, procedure, or parental \n right regarding student participation in any mandated assessments for \n                           that school year)\n\n       On page 110, strike lines 7 through 17 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(1) Information for parents .--\n       ``(A) In general.--At the beginning of each school year, a \n     local educational agency that receives funds under this part \n     shall notify the parents of each student attending any school \n     receiving funds under this part that the parents may request, \n     and the agency will provide the parents on request (and in a \n     timely manner), information regarding any State or local \n     educational agency policy, procedure, or parental right \n     regarding student participation in any mandated assessments \n     for that school year, in addition to information regarding \n     the professional qualifications of the student's classroom \n     teachers, including at a minimum, the following:\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I begin my remarks by commending Ranking \nMember Murray and Chairman Alexander on a tremendous due diligence \neffort to see to it that we finally answered the question that States \nhave been asking for 7 years; that is, when are you going to \nreauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act? When are you \ngoing to end the day when 82 percent of all educational public school \nsystems have to get waivers from Washington to teach children the way \nthey want to teach them? When are you going to see to it that money can \nflow to the States and flow to the student from those States, not \neverything flow from Washington to the student. It is about time we \nfixed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  In my lifetime, I have been in elected office for 38 years. I have \nbeen in every legislative body I can legally be elected to, and I have \nserved on the Education Committee in the Georgia House, the Georgia \nSenate, the U.S. House, and the U.S. Senate. I don't know a lot about a \nlot of things, but I know a little bit about public education. In fact, \nin 1996, Zell Miller, whose seat I now hold in the Senate, called on me \nto take over the Georgia State Board of Education when Georgia had a \nmajor crisis. So I learned under fire.\n  I learned the following: Children rise to expectations, and in an \nabsence of expectations, children sink. That is why gangs attract kids \nfrom broken families, because they seek some kind of recognition, and \nthe gang gives it to them.\n  We need to make sure education gives them that recognition, that \nexpectation, and that goal to reach higher and higher standards, but \nthat happens closest to home, not in Washington, DC. It happens where \nthe parents and the children are. The more opportunities parents have \nto engage with their children--the children see the expectations of \ntheir local students and their local citizens--the better off they will \nbe, which is why in the committee I offered the amendment which is \nincluded in the body of the Alexander-Murray bill, which allows parents \nin States that approve it to opt out of any testing they want to opt \nout of--a parent's right to see to it they can opt out of a required \ntest if the State allows them to do so.\n  Amendment No. 2194, which is before us now, makes sure that provision \nis in the section of the bill that calls for the parents' right to \nknow. So every parent has the right to know whether the State allows an \nopt-out. It already lets them know what their child's teacher's \nqualifications are, what their level of achievement in school is, \nnotice if their child is being taught by a teacher not meeting State \nstandards, and rights as a parent of an English language learner.\n\n[[Page S5040]]\n\n  The bill is specific in all of those areas, telling the parent: It is \nyour right to know if we have an ESL Program. It is your right to know \nif we allow an opt-out, and if we do not allow an opt-out, it is your \nright as a citizen to go to the board of education and make sure we do \noffer one. In other words, we are opening the door for local control \nthe way all of us planned on it being for years and for years and for \nyears.\n  It is time we took the shackles off public education. The Washington \nweight is dragging it down. It is time our school systems no longer \nhave to come to Washington for waivers and all those types of things, \nbut instead we said--in the case of title I, our poorest kids and among \nthose most in need of help, our IDEA kids, where the Federal Government \nhas a role--besides those two areas, it is time for the local system to \nsee to it they are meeting the needs of those kids, the parents know \nwhat the system is doing, and the parents have a right to inquire. And \nif the parent doesn't want the kid to be tested the way the State is \ndoing it and the State allows it, they should be able to opt out. That \nis the ultimate of local control. It is also the ultimate of \nexpectations for the child through the parent and the school, not \nthrough some Washington mandate.\n  You know the old saying: Education makes people easy to govern and \nimpossible to enslave, easy to build and impossible to drive.\n  Education is the power that leads our democracy to discoveries. Just \ntoday in America--or just sometime today in America--Pluto was \ndiscovered by an American satellite that was launched 9 years ago. It \nhas been traveling hundreds of thousands of miles a second to go there. \nThat manpower was done in the educational system of the United States \nof America.\n  There is no dream that can't be realized in this country, but it has \nto be based on education and knowledge. It has to be based on a country \nthat relishes education, a State that embellishes education, and a \nparent that is involved with their child.\n  I commend Senator Murray and Senator Alexander for their work, for \nincluding the opt-out provision in the base of the bill. I ask and hope \nthe Senate will adopt my amendment to require that in the parents' \nright to know, that provision is made available to every single parent \nin terms of what the State does and does not require when their kids go \ninto the public school system. So we have a better informed parent, \nbetter local control, less Federal mandate, and a child who has \nexpectations that are raised for them by the parents and the teachers \nclosest to them, not by a bureaucrat in Washington, DC.\n  We live in the greatest country on the face of this Earth. You don't \nfind anybody trying to break out of the United States of America. They \nare all trying to break in. And when you ask them why, it is because it \nis a country of opportunity, education, hope, and promise.\n  Today and tomorrow, the Senate has the ability to reauthorize the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, which has languished for 7 \nyears without a reauthorization. I hope we will do it and give local \nsystems and local boards of education and the parents the choices they \nneed to make the decisions that are right for their children.\n  I encourage every Senator to vote for amendment No. 2194, the Isakson \nopt-out amendment and the parental right-to-know amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the Senator from Washington is going to \nspeak in just a moment, but while the Senator from Georgia is on the \nfloor, I thank him for his huge contribution to this bill that would \nfix No Child Left Behind. No committee member has been more valuable \nthan he. He has worked with Senator Murray to include within a \nprovision an important step on early childhood education.\n  He has used his experience as chairman of the Georgia State Board of \nEducation and as a member of the education committee in both the Senate \nand the House to help us know how to do a better job here.\n  He is the champion of giving parents the right to know whether their \nState gives them the opportunity to opt out of the federally required \ntests. That is his amendment today. And he was the sponsor of the \namendment that appears in the Alexander-Murray bill, which gives States \nthe express authority to decide whether the parents may opt their \nchildren out of the tests.\n  So the Isakson amendment says: Give States the power to provide the \nopt-out, and it gives parents the opportunity to know enough \ninformation to be able to do it. That is consistent with this \nlegislation, which requires the important measurements of achievement \nso we can know whether children are achieving and whether schools are \nachieving, but then restores to States and local school boards, \nclassroom teachers, and parents the decisions about how to help those \nchildren achieve.\n  That is the kind of local control of education that I think most of \nus on both sides of the aisle--whether it is the Senator from Montana \nspeaking this morning or the Senator from Georgia speaking this \nafternoon, that is the spirit of the consensus that guides this bill.\n  Senator Isakson's contribution has been enormous to the right of \nparents to provide an opt-out of a federally required test for them and \ntheir children if they and their State choose to do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2093\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to speak in favor \nof the Franken amendment, which we will be voting on shortly. I want to \nstart with the story of Chandler, who was a 9th grader in Arkansas who \nexperienced daily bullying and harassment. At school, his classmates \nharassed him based on his perceived sexual orientation. His mom \ndescribed him as a good kid. She said all he wanted was to fit in, but \nChandler couldn't walk down the hall between classes without kids \nharassing him. He wrote to his school counselor saying he couldn't \nhandle ``being an outcast for four more years.''\n  And while teachers knew about the bullying, the school district never \nput a plan in place to address his concerns. And one day in 2010, \nChandler took his own life after enduring endless bullying and \ntormenting at his school.\n  Chandler's story is more than a tragedy, it feels like an all-too-\ncommon trend for students across the country.\n  As a mother, grandmother, a former educator, and as a citizen, I \nbelieve Congress has to act to protect kids such as Chandler. When kids \ndo not feel safe at school, when they are relentlessly bullied because \nthey are different, when they endure harassment simply because of who \nthey are, we have failed to provide them with the educational \nopportunities they deserve. We have failed them.\n  As we debate our Nation's K-12 education bill, we need to do \neverything we can to prevent bullying, harassment, and discrimination \nand provide students with a safe learning environment. Today, we will \nconsider an amendment to address the unique challenges LGBT students \nface.\n  I thank Senator Casey for his work on the Safe Schools Improvement \nAct. It is a bill we will not be voting on but will continue working \non. I thank, especially, Senator Franken for his tireless leadership on \nthe Student Non-Discrimination Act.\n  On the HELP Committee, I have been a proud cosponsor of this \nlegislation for years, and today I hope all of our Senate colleagues \nwill join us in protecting students from discrimination based on their \nactual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity.\n  Discrimination, bullying, and harassment at school leads to students \nwho feel unsafe. It leads to kids who skip classes so they avoid \nharassment. Some students drop out of school because they don't feel \nsafe there. If students don't feel safe, then there is very little else \nwe can do to improve their education that will matter.\n  This type of bullying and harassment can be severe, particularly for \nLGBT students. The Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network recently \ndid a survey on the experiences of LGBT youth in our schools. In that \nsurvey, 6 out of 10 lesbian, gay, and bisexual students reported \nfeeling unsafe at school and 8 out of 10 transgender students said the \nsame.\n  Eighty-five percent of LGBT students report they have been harassed \nbecause of their sexual or gender identity. Even\n\n[[Page S5041]]\n\nthough bullying and harassment is prevalent for these students, they \nand their families have limited legal recourse for that kind of \ndiscrimination. I believe our students deserve better. The amendment we \nwill be voting on will help to tackle this problem.\n  The student non-discrimination amendment would prohibit \ndiscrimination and harassment in public schools based on actual or \nperceived sexual orientation and gender identity. The amendment would \nalso prohibit any retaliation for lodging a complaint of \ndiscrimination. That would give our LGBT students who are suffering \nfrom bullying and harassment legal recourse, and it would allow Federal \nauthorities to address discrimination.\n  This amendment would offer LGBT students similar protections that \ncurrently exist for students who are bullied based on race, gender, \nreligion, disability, or country of national origin. Unless you think \nLGBT students don't deserve protection from discrimination the way \nthese other students do, this should be easy to support. This amendment \nis absolutely critical for expanding protections for LGBT students. \nAgain, I thank the junior Senator from Minnesota for his tremendous \nwork.\n  I know some of our Republican colleagues have argued that taking \nsteps to prevent bullying would only create lawsuits. But I believe \nthese students deserve justice. Giving students and families legal \nrecourse would help provide that.\n  Under this amendment, the process for legal recourse would be similar \nto title IX, which actually has been on the books since 1972. In the \nmajority of title IX cases, a school is more than willing to fix the \nproblem so it no longer engages in discriminatory practices. After all, \nschool leaders want to do the right thing and end bullying or \nharassment in their classrooms. They want to make sure their school is \nsafe for a particular group of students. They want to make sure \nstudents are not discriminated against simply because of who they are. \nWith this amendment, this same process would be afforded to LGBT \nstudents.\n  I have also heard some critics of this amendment say there is no need \nto focus on LGBT students. They don't want to define who would be \ncovered in an anti-discrimination amendment. But that logic doesn't \nfollow what we already know works. There is a reason the civil rights \nlaws of our country clearly define who is protected from \ndiscrimination. For example, our civil rights laws make it clear that \nit is unlawful to discriminate based on race and gender. A generic \nanti-discrimination policy will not cut it. A vague policy would lead \nto years of litigation about who is and who is not protected and what \nlegal standards should apply. Making meaningful progress to prevent \nbullying, harassment, and discrimination requires us to clearly define \nwho will be protected.\n  We know LGBT students are being bullied. They are being harassed. \nThey are being discriminated against. Ignoring that fact with vague \nlanguage doesn't help those students; it does them a real disservice, \nand it is wrong.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. The pain physical and \nemotional abuse can cause is tragic.\n  In Ohio, a young man named Zach is an openly gay student. Since he \nwas in the third grade, he has been called names at school. That abuse \nhas escalated since then. When he was 16, Zach was physically attacked \nand repeatedly punched by another student during his third-period \nclass. In a video from the ACLU, Zach's mom said it is not that Zach \nattended a bad school. She said: ``It's just not a good school for gay \nor lesbian children.''\n  It should not matter what school a child attends; all students \ndeserve a safe learning environment. Bullying and harassment take that \naway from too many of our Nation's students.\n  I want to take a moment to note the historical significance of this \ndebate and the vote we will be taking on shortly. A few weeks ago, the \nSupreme Court settled a question that for decades has been an issue of \ndebate in our country. After years of fighting for equal rights, LGBT \ncouples finally have the guarantee of marriage equality nationwide and \nthe protections that all married couples enjoy.\n  I am proud of how far our country has come. Since the Court's ruling, \nthis--right now, today--will be the first vote this body takes on \nlegislation aimed at ending discrimination against LGBT individuals and \nin this case discrimination against LGBT children in our schools. \nSurely we can agree that a minority group of students who have long \nendured bullying, harassment, and discrimination deserves the same \nprotections we afford other groups of students. There is no excuse for \na school or for a United States Senator to stand by as our kids endure \nharassment and discrimination that puts their academic success and \nemotional well-being in jeopardy. The country will be watching.\n  I urge our colleagues to support this amendment and give students \nacross the country the assurance that we are on their side.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I wish to thank Chairman Alexander and \nRanking Member Murray for their excellent leadership as stewards of \nthis important bipartisan effort. In my conversations with parents, \neducators, and advocates across my State, one theme prevails: We must \nreform this outdated law. This bipartisan legislation before us, while \nnot perfect, is a step in the right direction.\n  I am glad my language was included in the substitute amendment to \naddress conflict resolution and crisis intervention services in \nschools. It will provide support and the ability of school districts to \nprovide suicide, trafficking, trauma, and violence prevention models. \nSuch models will assist educators as they foster positive school \nclimates so that students can enter school excited and ready to learn.\n  However, I hope we can also advance my amendment No. 2171, which \nwould support those schools where such preventions are needed the most. \nMy amendment will restore access and make improvements to school and \nmental health support grants under an existing program in ESEA--the \nintegration of schools and mental health systems. Unfortunately, the \nbill before us eliminates this program simply because of recent budget \ncuts. Those budget cuts have allowed for the diversion of its funding \nto other priorities. This program, however, is more important than ever \ntoday.\n  I am not calling for new or expanded funding or even a new program. \nThe funding conversation should take place during the appropriations \nprocess. But for these purposes, we must make sure the program's \nauthorization is not eliminated, as students across this country and \nstudents in my State critically need these integrated services that \nhelp them deal with the effects of poor educational environments as \nwell as the effects of toxic stress and trauma.\n  The need to address this problem is something I have heard repeatedly \nsince becoming North Dakota's Senator and previously in my role as \nNorth Dakota's attorney general. Through my personal experiences with \naffected children, school leaders, and tribal representatives, I have \nfocused on making sure all children have the ability to succeed and \novercome obstacles associated with suicide, trauma, violence, and \nstress on their mental health.\n  In May of 2015, Futures Without Violence, alongside partners such as \nthe Alliance for Excellent Education, the National Education \nAssociation, and the National PTA, released a report entitled ``Safe, \nHealthy, and Ready to Learn'' that detailed how unhealthy school \nclimates, exposure to violence, and the effects of trauma reduce \nacademic success. As a result of such conditions, students with two or \nmore adverse childhood experiences are more than twice as likely to \nrepeat a grade. Students exposed to violence are at a greater risk of \ndropping out or having difficulty in school. Children exposed to \nviolence scored lower on tests of verbal ability and comprehension, \nreading and math skills, and overall achievement on standardized tests.\n  As a member of the Indian Affairs Committee, I can attest that \nnowhere\n\n[[Page S5042]]\n\nare adverse childhood experiences more common than in schools serving \nthis country's Native communities and Native American tribes. The \nsuicide rate for young adults aged 15 to 34 years is 2\\1/2\\ times \nhigher than the national average.\n  In South Dakota, from December 2014 to May 2015, the Oglala Sioux \nTribe lost nine--nine--of their young people to suicide between the \nages of 12 and 24. At least 103--I want to repeat that number--103 \nattempts were made by young people aged 12 to 24 just in those few \nmonths.\n  North Dakota has had a similar experience with suicide. Five young \npeople--three teenagers and two 25-year-olds--on the Standing Rock \nSioux Reservation took their own lives within a 2-month period.\n  Much like North and South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, and Alaska's \nsuicide rate has increased dramatically in recent years--jumping 70 \npercent in 10 years, with large increases among middle and high school \nstudents.\n  As populations have increased in the West, violent crime has \nsimilarly risen 121 percent in some areas. Through drug crimes, \ngunrunning, gang activity, and limited capacity of law enforcement, \nhuman trafficking has become epidemic, with 83 percent of all victims \nin the United States being American. How can we expect children to \nlearn when they face such obstacles as these? This is an injustice.\n  We must make sure our schools have the means to partner with health \nsystems and provide preventive measures and family engagement models \nfor improving school environments and mental health stress. \nUnfortunately, schools are often the last line of defense for our \ncountry's most vulnerable students. My amendment would simply preserve \na voluntary program that helps schools provide children stability and \nthe tools necessary to handle mental stress.\n  I understand the call for Federal streamlining and local flexibility. \nFor North Dakota, strengthening local efficiency is a top priority. \nHowever, this particular program should not be a part of that \nstreamlining. This authorization is about updating a civil rights law \nbased on helping all--even the most disadvantaged--students achieve and \nhave access to a better future.\n  But for many of our States, those disadvantaged students are also \nowed a Federal trust responsibility. While this language would protect \na grant program that is accessible to all, the services provided under \nthis amendment target issues epidemic to Indian Country. As such, it \nwould work to uphold the distinct trust responsibility of this \ngovernment to provide educational resources to Native children. Much \nlike the amendment from the senior Senator from Montana, which the \nSenate adopted last week, I hope the Senate will similarly protect this \nprogram.\n  By helping schools coordinate with health professionals specializing \nin addressing the effects of traumatic events and mental stress, we \nwill secure for our most disadvantaged the equal opportunity they \ndeserve--that equal opportunity to learn and to achieve.\n  I want to tell you a quick story. The first year I was elected, I had \nan opportunity to visit with a lot of North Dakota constituents who \ncame into my office. I remember distinctly the day the grade school \nprincipals came to visit me, and I thought that I would prepare for \nthis meeting--that I would prepare on No Child Left Behind. I shared a \nlot of their concerns, and I was ready to talk about No Child Left \nBehind. That is not what they wanted to talk about. One principal told \nme a story about two young boys who were in second and third grade who \nhad ridden the bus that morning and beaten up two little girls. When \nthey got to school, the principal asked them why they would ever do \nthat. They said: Well, you understand that last night my dad beat up my \nmom and he went to jail. They wanted to visit their dad.\n\n  How prepared is a school district to deal with that situation? If we \ndo not engage the mental health community, our schools will continue to \nbe those first responders, ill prepared to deal with the trauma of that \nlife. We have to begin to integrate these programs, and we have to look \nat what is happening with trauma and stress and the effects trauma and \nstress have on learning and the ability to succeed.\n  I understand and can completely appreciate and support the idea that \nwe need to streamline programs. I think this is a program whose time \nhas come. We should fund this program. That is a conversation for the \nAppropriations Committee. We have to begin to emphasize the conditions \nin which children live if we are going to educate all of our children \nequally.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Futures Without Violence report, \n``Safe, Healthy, and Ready to Learn,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Safe, Healthy, and Ready to Learn\n\n\n                           executive summary\n\n       Dr. Martin Luther King, at the crossroads of this nation's \n     civil rights movement more than 50 years ago, talked about \n     the ``fierce urgency of now.'' Today, more than ever, every \n     child deserves equality of access and opportunity that will \n     prepare him or her to compete in the changing economies and \n     realities of the 21st century. Yet, for too many children, \n     exposure to violence and trauma can deny them both access and \n     opportunity. Forty-six million children in the United States \n     will be exposed to violence, crime, abuse, or psychological \n     trauma in a given year: two out of every three children in \n     this country. They are our sons, daughters, grandsons, \n     granddaughters, nieces, and nephews. They are our future.\n       There is an undeniable urgency of now to shine the light on \n     these children and, even more importantly, prevent our \n     children from exposure to violence. We owe it to them to give \n     them the opportunity to live up to their full potential. We \n     should not wait, we cannot wait, and we must not wait.\n       In partnership with leaders from throughout the health, \n     education, justice, and child development fields, Futures \n     Without Violence (FUTURES), with the support of The \n     California Endowment, Blue Shield of California Foundation, \n     and the Lisa and John Pritzker Family Fund, has spent the \n     last year working to develop public policy solutions to \n     prevent and address childhood exposure to violence and \n     trauma. We examined research, consulted with experts across \n     the country, and convened a multi-disciplinary working group \n     to develop a comprehensive set of recommendations designed to \n     combat this silent epidemic.\n       Children's exposure to violence, trauma, and ``toxic \n     stress'' can have a permanent negative effect on the chemical \n     and physical structures of their brain, causing cognitive \n     impairments such as trouble with attention, concentration, \n     and memory. Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) research \n     documents the short- and long-term connections between \n     exposure to violence and other adversity and poor health and \n     educational outcomes, such as increased absenteeism in school \n     and changes in school performance. Individuals who have \n     experienced six or more ACEs die, on average, 20 years \n     earlier than those who have none. We know that the effects of \n     this trauma are playing out in numerous ways every day.\n       The good news is that we know what works to prevent harm \n     and heal children. Our collective task is to identify and \n     elevate the effective policies, programs, and practices that \n     are working and advance them at the federal, state, and local \n     level. This report is designed to do just that.\n       FUTURES is especially grateful to the thoughtful work and \n     commitment of our policy working group, which made the report \n     possible. The group is unique in its diverse membership and \n     in the willingness of its participants to cross boundaries \n     and recognize the interconnectedness of multiple issues. From \n     reforming school discipline practices and creating positive \n     school climates to combating child abuse and promoting \n     children's physical, emotional and mental health, the group \n     worked to examine and lift up core strategies to meet the \n     needs of the whole child, to address trauma in children's \n     lives, and to create conditions to allow our children to \n     thrive and succeed.\n\n\n                                 goals\n\n       The working group developed a set of recommendations that \n     will support each of these seven goals:\n       1. Invest early in parents and young children\n       2. Help schools promote positive school climates, be trauma \n     sensitive, and raise achievement\n       3. Train educators, health care workers, and other child-\n     serving professionals about preventing and responding to \n     youth violence and trauma\n       4. Prevent violence and trauma\n       5. Improve intra- and inter-governmental coordination and \n     alignment\n       6. Increase the availability of trauma-informed services \n     for children and families\n       7. Increase public awareness and knowledge of childhood \n     violence and trauma\n\n\n                       summary of recommendations\n\n       The following summarizes the key recommendations for each \n     goal:\n       No. 1--Invest early in parents and young children. The \n     federal government should support states, local \n     jurisdictions, and tribes in providing parents, legal \n     guardians, and other caregivers the resources necessary to \n     help their children thrive. A multi-generational\n\n[[Page S5043]]\n\n     approach to comprehensive and evidence-based services and \n     trauma-informed care promotes positive caretaking, reduces \n     inequities, enhances family cohesion, and interrupts the \n     cycle of intergenerational trauma. We recommend expanding the \n     federal Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting \n     Program (MIECHV) and implementing a two generation approach \n     to addressing ACEs, child abuse, and domestic violence. We \n     also suggest modifying Medicaid and child welfare financing \n     formulas to extend services to parents to address their own \n     experience of trauma.\n       No. 2--Help schools promote positive school climates, be \n     trauma sensitive, and raise achievement. The federal \n     government should provide significant resources and \n     incentives for states and local jurisdictions to create \n     connected communities and positive school climates that are \n     trauma-sensitive to keep students healthy and in school, \n     involved in positive social networks, and out of the juvenile \n     justice system. Such investments should increase opportunity \n     and close achievement gaps, promote health, resilience, \n     social and emotional learning, and engage the school \n     personnel necessary to effectuate a positive learning \n     environment. We recommend using the reauthorization of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act to support the \n     creation of positive school climates; supporting full-service \n     community schools that include school-based health centers; \n     adopting inclusive disciplinary policies that involve the \n     community; reconsidering school safety strategies and \n     prioritize investing resources in students' emotional health \n     and social connections; providing assistance to school \n     districts in their efforts to prevent and appropriately \n     respond to incidents of bullying; and having the United \n     States Department of Education design and disseminate a \n     practice guide that offers school-wide strategies and best \n     practices for creating trauma sensitive schools.\n       No. 3--Train educators, health care workers, and other \n     child-serving professionals about preventing and responding \n     to youth violence and trauma. States and other accrediting \n     bodies should support training and certification of child- \n     and youth-serving professionals to effectively respond to \n     children's exposure to violence with a coordinated and \n     trauma-informed approach. Our report urges that school \n     personnel should be trained on implementing effective \n     academic and behavioral practices, such as Positive \n     Behavioral Interventions and Supports and social and \n     emotional learning, and providing pediatricians and staff in \n     community health settings the tools they need to serve \n     traumatized youth.\n       No. 4--Prevent violence and trauma. Federal, state, and \n     local governments and tribes should increase incentives and \n     expand violence prevention efforts to reduce children's \n     exposure to violence. Research and strategies should be \n     interwoven among the fields of community violence, child \n     abuse, school violence, sexual assault, and domestic \n     violence. Specific policy recommendations are as follows: \n     expanding funding for domestic violence prevention and \n     response services within the Family Violence Prevention and \n     Services Act; providing greater technical assistance to \n     health care providers so they can effectively deliver \n     universal education to parents and caregivers about the \n     impact of exposure to violence on youth and deliver more \n     integrated care to children who may already be exposed to \n     violence; expanding targeted prevention programs focused on \n     healthy relationships among youth developed jointly by the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Office on \n     Violence Against Women; engaging men and boys in prevention; \n     and supporting resilient and healthy communities.\n       No. 5--Improve intra- and inter-governmental coordination \n     and alignment. Federal, state, and local governments and \n     tribes should better coordinate youth violence prevention and \n     early intervention approaches among themselves and with non-\n     governmental organizations, particularly as it relates to \n     school/community and public/private sector coordination. We \n     recommend the creation of a White House task force to \n     identify specific youth violence and trauma prevention goals, \n     make recommendations on how federal agency resources can be \n     used to meet those goals, and provide guidance to state and \n     local partners. In addition, the federal government should \n     include incentives in relevant federal grant applications for \n     states and localities to demonstrate collaboration in service \n     delivery.\n       No. 6--Increase the availability of trauma-informed \n     services for children and families. It is time to incentivize \n     and fund states, localities, and tribes to scale up the \n     availability of trauma-informed services for children and \n     their families exposed to violence. These services should \n     support the implementation of two-generation, trauma-informed \n     approaches, coordinate efforts among schools, homes, and \n     communities, and ensure gender-specific and culturally \n     competent practices. We recommend permitting federal \n     entitlement programs to support child trauma assessment and \n     intervention, such as home-based services and crisis \n     intervention, that provide for child well-being, family \n     stability, and community health. The federal government \n     should provide specific support and attention to youth in the \n     juvenile justice system, in foster care, and to those who are \n     homeless.\n       No. 7--Increase public awareness and knowledge of childhood \n     violence and trauma. Federal, state, and local governments \n     and tribes should support public education and engagement \n     campaigns to increase awareness of the adverse effects of \n     childhood exposure to violence and trauma. The campaigns \n     should describe action people can take to prevent harm, and \n     promote effective solutions. We recommend that the federal \n     government, in coordination with the states, conduct a mass \n     media campaign that highlights the impact of ACEs and helps \n     to reduce the stigma attached to those who seek professional \n     help.\n       We know that meaningful change will not happen overnight, \n     and we recognize that budgets are tight at all levels of \n     government. However, inaction is not an option--not when tens \n     of millions of children are affected by violence and trauma \n     each year. We know what works. We know that these investments \n     will save money and will prevent many children from \n     suffering. This report provides a blueprint for what needs to \n     be done. It is now up to all of us, as policymakers, \n     educators, advocates, and parents, to take action to ensure \n     that our children's future is bright.\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota for \nbringing up a critically important issue. The need for counseling and \nmental health resources in our schools cannot be overstated. There are \nso many kids who appear to be slow learners and have problems that can \nbe traced directly to these issues.\n  I know that teachers aren't trained to be psychologists and \npsychiatrists. Many of them are struggling just to teach. So I think \nthe resources that the Senator from North Dakota is talking about are \nabsolutely essential, and I hope her amendment prevails. I will be \nhappy to support it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we come together every few years to debate \neducation. Why does the Federal Government get into the conversation \nabout grade schools and high schools? Because 50 years ago we created \nprograms sending Federal money to these schools.\n  In my State, about 5 percent of all the money spent on education \ncomes from Washington. The rest of it comes from State and local \nsources. Sending this money to schools was part of a program for \naccountability back in the 1960s. The problems we faced were largely \ntwofold, problems of poverty and the resulting difficulties that \nchildren had in school and problems with racial discrimination. So we \ntried to resolve these by sending resources to States and holding them \naccountable if they received Federal money to move toward improving \ntest scores and performance for children and breaking down the walls of \nsegregation.\n  It is 50 years later. We have tried so many different approaches to \nthis, and under President George W. Bush, a conservative Republican, \nthere was a surprising new approach called No Child Left Behind. What \nwas surprising is that a conservative Republican President actually \ncalled for a bigger role of the Federal Government when it came to \neducation.\n  President Bush felt that we should hold schools and teachers \naccountable, that we should test to make sure they were making \nprogress, and frankly, call them out if they were not. It was a pretty \nbold and controversial idea. Now we come together years later in an \neffort to do it differently. This bill before us, the Every Child \nAchieves Act, basically shifts the pendulum to the other side and says \nthat now we are going to give it back to the States to measure the \nperformance and progress of schools and intervene where necessary.\n  I think this is a worthy effort. We may find that we have gone too \nfar in moving it all back to the States and away from the multiple \ntests that face school districts under No Child Left Behind, but we are \nengaging in this new approach in the hopes that it will be better and \nfairer and that more kids in America will get a good education. That is \ngenerally why I think we are here on this floor.\n  There is one aspect of it which I think we should still maintain, and \nthat is the question or issue of accountability. Senators Murphy of \nConnecticut, Booker of New Jersey, Coons of Delaware, and Warren of \nMassachusetts filed an amendment which I have joined with to insert \nmeaningful accountability measures in this bill, including identifying \nthe 5 percent lowest performing schools--high schools where less than \ntwo-thirds of the students graduate--and subgroups of students who are \nnot doing well.\n\n[[Page S5044]]\n\n  There is a concern on the other side of the aisle, and even from some \nof my friends and supporters, that we are going back to the Federal \naccountability standards when schools or subgroups are not succeeding. \nThat is not the case with this amendment. It allows the States to still \ndecide which interventions are warranted, but it makes the information \npublic as to how the schools are doing, particularly those that are \nreally struggling, the lowest 5 percent of schools--high schools where \ntwo-thirds of the students are not performing. We should know this, and \nwe should hold the States accountable now that it is their \nresponsibility to intervene to make sure that they achieve this. To \nignore it and turn our backs on it is not fair. It is to ignore a half-\ncentury commitment by this government with the title I program in \nparticular and other programs in our government to really help the \nStates to improve with Federal resources.\n  We have gone away from overtesting in No Child Left Behind, but let's \nnot reach the point where we ignore the results. Let's hold States \naccountable. Let them come up with the interventions as required, but \nlet's do it in a way that is transparent so there is accountability. I \nsupport this amendment, and I hope it is called up soon.\n  Mr. President, there is another amendment that may soon be before us \noffered by Senator Burr of North Carolina that would make changes in \nthe title I funding program in terms of the allocations to States. \nTitle I is the single largest source of Federal funding for elementary \nand secondary education. It helps States and districts address poverty \nand the needs of low-income students.\n  Senator Burr of North Carolina has created a new formula to send \nmoney from Washington back to the States. Not surprisingly, his State \ndoes very well with that formula, others not so well. The Burr \namendment, which we finally saw in writing last night, would be \ndevastating to low-income students in Illinois. It would reduce my \nState's share of title I funds by $180 million a year. So 28 percent of \nall the title I funds now coming into the State would be eliminated by \nthe Burr amendment.\n  Chicago public schools are struggling. Mayor Emanuel, who is in \ncharge of these schools, is trying to resolve decades' old problems \nwith pensions, trying to put the money into the schools, and faces some \nextremely difficult choices.\n  Under the Burr amendment, Chicago's public schools would lose $68 \nmillion. It is not just about the city of Chicago. Every district in \nIllinois that receives title I funds for low-income students would see \na cut. North Chicago and East St. Louis are the two poorest school \ndistricts in the State. East St. Louis is my hometown and where I was \nborn. North Chicago would see a 24-percent cut of money for low-income \nstudents, and East St. Louis would see a cut of 18 percent--one of the \npoorest towns in my State. Rockford would lose $5 million, a 31-percent \ncut. Rock Island would see a 43-percent cut with the Burr amendment, \nand Carbondale and Danville, 27 and 20 percent, respectively. \nSpringfield, my hometown, would lose $2 million or 26 percent of their \ntotal funds would be cut because the Senator from North Carolina wants \nto take more money home to his State.\n  These types of cuts to Illinois, divvied up among districts in other \nStates, isn't a responsible Federal policy for making sure low-income \nkids in Illinois get a good education. It isn't responsible, and I have \nto say to my friend and colleague from North Carolina that he is in for \na fight. He may think he has chosen just enough States to get a little \nmore money to get a majority together, but my colleagues, at least on \nthis side of the aisle, realize that tomorrow someone else could come \nup with a little different formula that would be devastating to their \nown States. This amendment is the most hurtful and damaging amendment \nthat is before us in this bill as far as my State is concerned.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2093\n\n  Third, there is an amendment from my friend from Minnesota, Senator \nFranken, called the Student Non-Discrimination Act, also called SNDA. I \nurge all of my colleagues to support it. SNDA will provide critical \nprotection for LGBT students by explicitly prohibiting discrimination \nin public schools based on actual or perceived sexual orientation or \ngender identity.\n  A few weeks ago the Supreme Court had a historic decision when it \ncame to same-sex couples having the right to marry. While this decision \nis a major historic achievement, there is more that needs to be done. \nStudents who are or are perceived to be lesbian, gay, bisexual or \ntransgender continue to face extraordinary discrimination.\n  A recent survey showed that 85 percent of these students reported \nharassment. The survey also found that these students didn't perform \nwell when they were subjected to this harassment. That is no surprise. \nResearch also shows that these teenagers are four times more likely to \nattempt suicide, and 40 percent of the homeless students and children \nin America are LGBT.\n  I support Senator Franken's amendment. Let's end this discrimination.\n  Finally, I support the amendment offered by the Senator from \nPennsylvania, Bob Casey, which is based on the Strong Start for \nAmerica's Children Act, to improve and expand high-quality early \nchildhood education for more than 3 million low-income kids. The Casey \namendment would help 100,000 kids in low-income families in Illinois \nget into pre-K. How important is that?\n  Well, I am a grandfather and proud of it. We have twin grandkids who \nare 3\\1/2\\ years old. My wife and I spend a lot of time talking with \nthem and reading to them. These kids are doing just great. They have \nterrific parents and are heading to pre-K in just a few months. They \nwon't even be 4 years old when they enter the pre-K program in the city \nof Brooklyn, NY. We are excited about it. We know they are going to do \nwell. Their parents, and maybe even their grandparents, have helped \nthem reach that point.\n  What Bob Casey and his amendment try to do is to extend that \nopportunity to a lot of families--low-income families that may not have \nthe luxury of being able to spend time with their kids the way other \nfamilies can. Let's give those kids a fighting chance. Let's give them \nthe pre-K education that gets them off to a good, strong start so they \ncan learn and ultimately earn.\n  I support the Casey amendment, and I hope my colleagues will too.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2093\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this important debate about how to improve \nour schools is an opportunity to ensure that children have access to \nequal educational opportunities. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and \ntransgender students often face pervasive harassment and bullying in \nour schools. We must ensure that all children can attend school in a \nsafe and healthy environment. That is why I am proud to support the \namendment offered by Senator Franken.\n  Similar to his bill on this topic, the Student Non-Discrimination \nAct, this amendment would instill core principles of basic civil rights \nin our Nation's schools. These are commonsense, fundamental rights that \nall Americans deserve, particularly children. No person--of any age--\nshould face discrimination because of their race, economic status, \nreligion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, or learning \nabilities.\n  I have heard from countless Vermont parents about their children \nbeing bullied at school and online. I am reminded of the tragic story \nof Ryan Halligan, an Essex Junction student who took his own life at \nage 13 after being bullied for his physical appearance. After years of \ntorment, the teasing Ryan endured turned into physical violence. Ryan \nwas harassed online by one of his peers, who took private messages Ryan \nhad sent and showcased them for other students in the school. Ryan was \nlater publically shamed for what he thought was an innocent interaction \nbetween himself and a friend.\n  No child should ever face the needless horror of harassment or \nbullying. Unfortunately, as many as 7 in 10 students who are, or are \nperceived to be, lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender have been \nbullied or harassed. But unlike other forms of harassment in our \nschools, bullying based on gender identity and sexual orientation is \noften overlooked, and students and their parents have limited legal \noptions to hold schools accountable for discriminatory treatment.\n\n[[Page S5045]]\n\n  The Franken amendment would extend Federal protections from \ndiscrimination in public schools based on actual or perceived gender \nidentity or sexual orientation. The amendment prohibits public school \nstudents from being excluded from educational programs on the basis of \nsexual identity and allows students to take civil action against such \ndiscrimination. It also ensures that students who file suit will not \nface retaliation of any kind. It is a sad reality that discrimination \nstill exists in our country, and that Americans need the powerful anti-\ndiscrimination protection of our civil rights laws. But these abuses \nare happening in our schools, and children are suffering as a result.\n  What is worse, LGBT youth who face bullying at school do not always \nhave a sanctuary at home. A disproportionate and growing number of \nrunaway and homeless youth are LGBT, often because their families have \nrejected them. We must ensure that these kids have a safe place to \nstay, because they are vulnerable to abuse and sexual exploitation \nwhile living on the street. That is why Senator Collins and I included \na nondiscrimination provision in another key piece of legislation, the \nRunaway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act. This bill \nwould ensure that no child in need of shelter is turned away based on \ntheir sexual orientation or gender identity. We cannot protect these \nchildren from every injustice they might face, but we should at least \nensure that they will be safe in our public schools and federally \nfunded shelters. I will continue to fight for these protections.\n  I am proud of the many students in Vermont who have taken steps to \nprevent bullying in their schools and communities. In 2014, Rutland \nHigh School students were nationally recognized for their ``Positive \nPost-it'' campaign, in which small notes of praise and encouragement to \nfellow students were placed on windows and message boards throughout \nthe school. These young students at Rutland High School should be \ncommended for reminding us all that bullying and discrimination have no \nplace at school. Students across the country are doing their part and \nwe must do ours as well.\n  Last month, the Supreme Court issued two consequential and historic \nrulings protecting the basic rights of all Americans to marry and to \naccess housing free from discrimination. Our Nation has come a long way \nbut our work must continue. All Americans, especially our children, \ndeserve the same Federal protections. We have the opportunity to extend \nthis simple principle of basic fairness to children across this country \nand make our schools safe places for all children to learn. I hope all \nSenators will support this important amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2194\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I got a little ahead of myself. I \nshould have checked with Senator Isakson to see if he wished to speak \non behalf of his amendment. I see he is now here. Why don't we allow \nhim to do that, and then I will ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee, \nand I wish to reiterate my appreciation for what he and Senator Murray \nhave done to bring a great bill to the floor.\n  This is the ultimate local control amendment, which says if a State \nallows an opt-out, a parent can opt their kid out of testing, and it \nrequires the States to ensure that parents know if opting out is \npossible. It is a good amendment for children and local control, and I \nencourage everyone to cast a ``yes'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I support this amendment, and I thank \nSenator Isakson for working with us on this. I encourage a ``yes'' \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, as the father of three girls in Denver Public Schools \nand as a former school superintendent, I know there is a lot we can do \nto streamline tests, but the problem is not the Federal requirement. \nThat is not the real problem. The real problem is the way the Federal \nrequirement works with States and the way the State tests have piled up \non the Federal requirements.\n  That is why States should establish a cap on the total amount of time \nspent taking these assessments. This target would be State-determined, \nsubject to discussion among parents, teachers, and policymakers. If the \ndistrict exceeds the policy cap, it would be required to simply notify \nparents. This is an essential way to respond to concerns voiced by \nstudents, parents, teachers, principals, and communities across the \ncountry about overtesting.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield back time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to Bennet amendment No. 2210.\n  The amendment (No. 2210) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2162\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote on Lee amendment No. 2162.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, my amendment would clarify that parents--not \nthe Federal Government--are the primary educators of their children. It \nwould ensure that parents may allow their children to opt out of \nfederally mandated tests.\n  Now, the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Alexander, is right that States \nshould be free to make their own tests mandatory if they so choose. \nHowever, that is not what this bill allows. This bill mandates that \nStates give these\n\n[[Page S5046]]\n\ntests and requires them to get the content of such tests approved by \nthe Secretary of Education.\n  My amendment is silent on the question of State tests. It simply \nclarifies that tests mandated by this Congress are, in fact, voluntary, \nand that parents--not politicians or bureaucrats--will have the final \nsay on whether individual children take Federal tests. It also ensures \nthat the Federal Government cannot punish a State by restricting \nFederal funding for education should parents choose to opt out their \nchildren from these tests.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I urge a ``no'' vote. This bill is \nabout reversing the trend toward a national school board. The amendment \nof the Senator from Utah is about more of a national school board. The \nAlexander-Murray bill expressly says that a State may decide whether to \nallow parents to opt out of these tests. The Senator's amendment says: \nWashington knows best; it will tell States what the policy should be.\n  That is like common core. Our bill says: We are eliminating the \nWashington mandate on common core. He would reinstate a Washington \nmandate on the opt-out policy. I would say this to my Republican \nfriends: Do we only agree with local control when we agree with the \nlocal policy?\n  Art Laffer says: States have a right to be right. States have a right \nto be wrong. A ``no'' vote is a vote for local control. A ``yes'' vote \nis a vote for a national school board.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I concur with the remarks from the \nchairman of the committee and urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote on Franken amendment No. 2093.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, the Student Non-Discrimination Act would \nextend the same Federal civil rights protections available to other \nchildren to LGBT children.\n  I feel very strongly about this, and let me tell you why. LGBT kids \nare facing an epidemic of bullying in our schools. Nearly 75 percent of \nLGBT students say they have been verbally harassed at school. More than \n30 percent report missing a day of school in the last month because \nthey felt unsafe.\n  Sometimes kids cannot endure the taunting. These boys, 11 years old, \n13, and 15, committed suicide because they were harassed relentlessly, \nand they are just three of the many tragic cases. And in case after \ncase, the parents begged the school to do something, only to be \nignored. Our laws failed these children, but we can change that. We \nhave come very far on this issue. As a body, we passed ENDA, which \nprotects LGBT adults, but this is about children.\n  It is our job as adults, not just as Senators, to protect children. \nThink about the LGBT people you know--your friends, staff, family. Now \nimagine them as children just beginning to discover who they are but \ndoing so in the face of taunts and intimidation. You cannot get a good \neducation if you dread going to school. My amendment just says that \nschools would have to listen when a parent says ``My kid isn't safe'' \nand then do something about it.\n  I thank the chairman and the ranking member for committing to hold \nthis vote. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote to protect our \nchildren.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota for \nbringing up the amendment and for the way he has participated in our \ndebate and worked for us to make it possible to get a result.\n  I am going to ask for a ``no'' vote on this amendment. There is no \ndoubt that bullying or harassment of children based on actual or \nperceived sexual orientation or gender identity is a terrible problem \nand has become in some parts of our country even accurately described \nas an epidemic. But the question is, Is this an argument that is best \naddressed to the local school board or to the State board of education \nor to a national school board in Washington, DC?\n  We have 50 million children in 100,000 public schools and 3.5 million \nteachers. No more set of issues is more difficult to deal with on an \nindividualized basis in a rural area in Alaska or the mountains of \nTennessee or the middle of Harlem than a case of harassment or \nbullying. Teachers, principals, and school advisors deal with those \nevery day. We do not know more about that than they do. The U.S. \nDepartment of Education cannot make regulations for that many different \nkinds of instances.\n  This substitutes the judgment of the people closest to the children, \nwho cherish them--substitutes the judgment of Washington bureaucrats \nfor them. It allows the Federal Government to regulate and dictate \nlocal school gender identity policies, such as those related to \nrestrooms, locker rooms, and dress codes. It will lead to costly \nlawsuits.\n  It is well-intentioned. It is a problem that needs to be addressed, \nbut it should be addressed by the local school board, the State board \nof education, and not by a national school board in Washington, DC.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, may I ask how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has 10 seconds at \nthis time.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 30 \nmore seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. This isn't about lawsuits; this is about schools doing \nthe right thing when the parents ask. They are the same protections \ngranted to the kids by virtue of their race. That wasn't a local issue; \nthat was a Federal right we had to pass. The same with title IX for \ngirls. That is why we just won the World Cup.\n\n[[Page S5047]]\n\n  This is the right thing to do. We are adults here. Let's protect \nchildren. Let's protect children. This is not about lawsuits. It is \nabout adults, about a parent calling the principal and saying ``My kid \nis being harassed'' and then the principal will do something--because \nthey aren't. They aren't in many, many cases.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 20 seconds \nto conclude.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I object. I am joking.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the question is whether difficult cases \nof bullying and harassment of whatever kind in 100,000 schools with 50 \nmillion children are best handled by the judgment of men and women \nclose to the children, close to the circumstances, or by Senators in \nWashington and Federal employees in the U.S. Department of Education.\n  I believe this legitimate concern should be addressed by those who \nare closest to the children because they cherish the children more and \nthey will care for them.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. RISCH. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order requiring 60 votes \nfor the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is rejected.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, as the Senate this week considers the first \nmajor reform bill for our Nation's public schools in over a decade, I \nrise to talk about how we can ensure that every one of our country's \nchildren goes to a great school no matter his or her ZIP Code or \nbackground. Our Nation has long struggled to fulfill our fundamental \npromise of equal opportunity since our Nation's founding. It is a \nstruggle that, despite many efforts, continues today.\n  Fifty years ago, as America fought to break down racial barriers in \nour Nation's classrooms, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act into law. This civil rights act recognized \nthat without actively investing Federal resources in educating \nAmerica's underserved children, their dreams would remain tragically \ndeferred.\n  Since then, our country has continued to struggle with this \nfundamental civil rights challenge. And five decades after Johnson's \nlandmark law and 14 years after President Bush revamped it with the \nbipartisan No Child Left Behind Act, we still haven't found a way to \nensure that as a nation, we hold every school to the high standards our \nchildren deserve.\n  This week marks the latest effort in this long struggle. The Senate's \nreform bill, titled the ``Every Child Achieves Act,'' makes important \nstrides to improve what went wrong in 2001's No Child Left Behind. I \nwould like to start by commending Senator Patty Murray and Senator \nLamar Alexander for accomplishing what has eluded the Senate for so \nmany years--a truly bipartisan compromise that deals with some critical \nbut often divisive issues at the heart of America's public schools. \nThey have worked tirelessly on this bill because they understand the \nurgency of our national education crisis.\n  In the wake of No Child Left Behind's Federal micromanagement of \nschools, this bill heeds an important lesson: Communities need to have \nsome flexibility and some space to innovate and find their own \nsolutions to their education problems. But I would urge my colleagues \nthat as we work together to fix many of the law's weaknesses, we not \nlose sight of some of No Child Left Behind's important accomplishments.\n  For all its many problems, it exposed uncomfortable realities in \nAmerica's classrooms and empowered policymakers with real data that \nsimply did not exist before. Most importantly, it refused to lower our \nNation's expectations of any school and demanded that every child in \nAmerica gets the education he or she deserves.\n  In our drive to decrease the law's rigidity and address its many \nother challenges, we must maintain those high standards and continue to \nhold States and school districts accountable. Unfortunately, if it \npassed today, the Every Child Achieves Act would turn back the clock to \na time when local control too often meant national indifference. It \nwould risk letting too many of our children fall through the cracks.\n  I, myself, have seen how this indifference can hurt America's \nstudents. For 20 years, I was actively involved with the national ``I \nHave a Dream'' Foundation, which works to send some of our country's \nmost at-risk students to college. I had the opportunity to visit \nschools all over the United States, in some of our most stressed and \nchallenged neighborhoods and some of our most struggling and difficult \nschools. When I met with students during those visits and asked them \nabout their vision for their own future, while many wanted to become \nteachers, doctors or scientists, too many others did not believe those \nkinds of careers could ever be within their grasp.\n  This, to me, illustrated the twin tragedies of our public education \nsystem; the fact that for many students with big dreams, their schools \nwill not give them the chance to realize them, while for too many \nothers, dreams long dead in their families and communities had taught \nthem that daring to dream at all was futile.\n  These students had fallen victim to what President George W. Bush so \naccurately described as the ``soft bigotry of low expectations.'' They \nhad internalized the failings of the system around them to mean they \nwere not worth investing in, so they might as well just give up from \nthe beginning.\n  There are two ways I believe we can and should improve the Every \nChild Achieves Act to change that message, to raise the expectations we \ncommunicate to kids from the day they are born to the day they enter \nthe classroom, to the day they graduate.\n  The first way is to pass amendments that strengthen Federal \naccountability provisions and shine a brighter spotlight on the small \nfraction of our schools that fail our children. Simply put, we cannot \nallow ourselves to lower our expectations for any of America's schools.\n  I know for many of my colleagues and for teachers and students around \nthe country, the very word ``accountability'' in the context of \neducation is\n\n[[Page S5048]]\n\nassociated with high-stakes testing and unfunded mandates, but it \ndoesn't have to mean either of those things. Accountability means \nholding every school and every child to the same high standards because \nour public schools must work for every student no matter where they \nare, where they come from or how they learn. Accountability means not \nallowing schools to maintain the status quo when they fail to graduate \nlarge segments of their students. Accountability means refusing to \nlower our expectation even when the path forward seems hard.\n  We have already seen what accountability can accomplish for our \nchildren. Over the past decade, all students, but particularly \ndisadvantaged students, have graduated at higher and higher rates and \nare performing in math and reading better than ever before. The \nnational high school graduation rate is currently 81 percent, its \nhighest level on record. Since 2003, the reading gap between Black and \nWhite fourth graders has closed by 16 percentage points, and over the \nsame period Hispanic eighth graders have closed the gap in math by 24 \npercentage points.\n  Federal accountability is a critical part of ensuring we invest in \nall American students as if they were our own children. I urge my \ncolleagues to support Senator Murphy's amendment, which I am proud to \njoin and cosponsor. This amendment would strengthen accountability in \nthis bill by requiring States to identify low-performing schools and \ntailor interventions to help them improve their performance. It also \nensures that schools set high goals for--and pay attention to--all \nstudents, including students with disabilities, low-income students, \nEnglish language learners, Latino and African-American students.\n  The second amendment I wish to address takes on another piece of \nincreasing expectations of urging every one of our children to dream. \nThat amendment is based on my bipartisan bill called the American Dream \nAccounts Act with Senator Rubio, and it would send the important \nmessage to low-income students that a college education can be within \ntheir grasp.\n  For too long, college has been out of reach for the vast majority of \npoor Americans, but unlike in past decades, economic success today is \ndefined by college access. With the new global economy, Americans with \njust a high school diploma earn literally $1 million less over their \nworking lives compared to those who go to college. Yet too many of our \nstudents who need it most are not given the tools, the resources, and \nthe information to complete a college education.\n  As the administration has pointed out, just about 1 out of 10 \nchildren from low-income families will complete a college degree by the \ntime they are 24--just 1 out of 10. The American Dream Accounts Act is \ndesigned to address and break down many of the barriers to college \naccess that our most at-risk students face in seeking higher education. \nThey encourage partnerships between schools, colleges, nonprofits, and \nbusinesses to develop secure, Web-based individual student accounts \nthat contain information about each student's academic preparedness, \nfinancial literacy, connects them to high-impact mentoring, and is tied \nto an individual college savings account.\n  Instead of having each of these different resources available \nseparately through separate silos, an American dream account connects \nthem across existing separated programs and across existing education \nefforts at the State and Federal level. By connecting across these \ndifferent silos, it deploys a powerful new tool and resource for \nstudents, parents, teachers, and mentors.\n  Many of the kids I worked with over many years at the ``I Have a \nDream'' Foundation have grown up in schools, communities, and families \nwhere almost no one around them had the opportunity for a college \neducation. These kids took that to mean college just wasn't for them, \nthat it shouldn't be a part of their plan for their future.\n  As part of that organization, it was our job to change that \nperception, and I saw time and again how sending the message that \ncollege was a possibility from elementary school on had a powerful and \ncompounding positive impact on these students' ideas of whom they could \nbe and what they could achieve. It demonstrated that exciting and \nengaging not just young students but their parents, teachers, and an \narray of mentors has a cumulative, powerful, positive impact.\n  The American dream accounts would expand on this idea and use modern \nsocial networking technology to bring together existing programs and \ndeliver ideas that will work for more and more of our kids. The good \nnews is that by utilizing existing Department of Education funds, this \nlegislation would come at no additional cost to taxpayers.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment with Senator Rubio. It \nis amendment No. 2127, and it would authorize a pilot program to begin \nmaking the American dream accounts a reality.\n  We have an opportunity right now to build on the bill that Senators \nMurray and Alexander wrote to reform our public schools in a way that \ncommunicates to every child in every public school that they deserve a \nhigh-quality education, the kind of education that tells them not only \nthat they should have dreams but that those dreams are within their \ngrasp.\n  Mr. President, 55 years after U.S. marshals escorted first grader \nRuby Bridges to school, the nature of and need for Federal intervention \nin public education has surely changed. While schools are no longer \nclosed to certain races by law, too many students are dropping out of \nschool too early or just not receiving an education that prepares them \nfor college and future success.\n  So while educational inequality is no longer a story of deliberate, \nlegalized racism in need of Federal intervention, it is, unfortunately, \nstill a persistent and tragic national reality that afflicts classrooms \nfrom coast to coast.\n  We have made significant progress due in part to a bipartisan \nnational commitment to raising the bar for all of America's children. \nWe cannot allow ourselves to lower it once again.\n  I look forward to continuing this important debate and working with \nmy colleagues to make sure this bill strikes the right balance between \nFederal oversight and local flexibility. We must work together to make \nsure this bill moves us closer toward the goal President Johnson \nreached for when he first signed the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct into law.\n\n\n             Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session to consider the following nominations: Calendar No. \n27, Calendar No. 28, Calendar No. 29, Calendar No. 30, and Calendar No. \n31, and that the Senate proceed to a vote without intervening action or \ndebate on the nominations; that the motions to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that \nno further motions be in order to the nominations; that any related \nstatements be printed in the Record; that the President be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's action and the Senate then resume legislative \naction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nobject.\n  The reason we should not confirm new judges to the Court of Federal \nClaims has little to do with these nominees and more to do with the \ncourt itself. It doesn't need new judges. We should keep in mind that \nthe number of active judges authorized for the Court of Federal Claims \nby statute, 16, isn't a minimum number, it is a maximum. It is our duty \nas Senators to determine if the court needs that full contingent and to \nbalance judicial needs in light of our obligation to be good stewards \nof taxpayer dollars.\n  What the caseload data shows is that the court does not need all 16 \njudges--far from it. As we can see from this chart, since 2007, the \ncourt's caseload has dropped dramatically and consistently every year. \nLast year, the court had 2,528 cases on its docket. That is 51 percent \nfewer than in 2011 and 68 percent fewer than in 2007, when the court \nhad 7,185 cases on its docket.\n  Today, a full-time judge on the court is responsible for an average \ncaseload of 180 cases. That is far less than the average caseload of \n324 cases in 2011 and the average of 488 cases in 2007.\n  In light of the dramatic drop in caseloads at the court, it is hard \nto justify\n\n[[Page S5049]]\n\nspending more money to confirm additional judges. The court currently \nalso uses a contingent of six senior judges who have retired from \nactive status but can continue to hear cases. While there are currently \nonly 11 active judges, there are actually a total of 17 judges at the \ncourt hearing cases.\n  Furthermore, we should understand that senior judges receive a \nlifetime annuity worth a full-time salary regardless of whether they \nhandle cases. If the Senate confirms the five nominees, this will \nexpand the number of judges receiving a salary at an extra cost of \n$800,000 every year.\n  The bottom line is that there is no caseload crisis at the Court of \nFederal Claims. If anything, there is a caseload shortage. It therefore \nmakes no sense to spend more taxpayer dollars on judges that the court \nsimply does not need. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask my colleague from Arkansas, through \nthe Chair, first, if we cannot receive consent to take up these \nnominations which were made over 15 months ago as a group. I wish to \nbriefly describe one of the truly exceptional candidates. If I might \nalso, I think it is important for all of us in the Chamber to recognize \nthat the Court of Federal Claims, while the actual number of cases \nconsidered may have decreased, faces a steadily increasing number of \ncomplex cases which are subject to statutory case management deadlines \nthat drive the workload of the court and have roughly doubled in recent \nyears from 68 back in 2005 to 113 last year and likely double that this \nyear. So the actual number of cases may be declining, but their \ncomplexity and their workload, because of the need for them to be \nresolved in a certain period of time, have steadily increased, and I \nwill simply suggest to my colleague from Arkansas that looking more \nbroadly at the workload would suggest some of these nominees are worthy \nof consideration and confirmation.\n  I will briefly reference one of the five pending nominees, Jeri \nSomers, who has spent a decade at the DOJ civil division as a trial \nattorney but recently retired, having served in the U.S. Air Force \nReserves as a lieutenant colonel, having spent two decades as a judge \nadvocate and a military judge in the U.S. Air Force. She is a patriot, \na veteran, a highly qualified attorney, and I will simply inquire of my \ncolleague, through the Chair, whether any of the five nominees might be \nsubject for consideration for confirmation today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I have to object. Again, this is not so \nmuch about a particular nominee but the fact that the Court of Federal \nClaims is operating with 11 active judges, and when you include the \nsenior judges ready, able, and willing to hear cases, they have more \nthan 16 judges allowed by statute, and those judges will continue to \nreceive their salary even if we confirm any of these new judges.\n  Furthermore, as someone who has practiced at the Court of Federal \nClaims myself many moons ago when I was a lawyer, albeit not a very \ngood one, I know the caseload there has always been complex, and I \nsimply think the judges who are at the court are ready, willing, and \nable to handle the court's work. Therefore, I must object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. In conclusion, we have a range of highly qualified \nnominees. Armando Bonilla would be the first Hispanic judge to hold a \nseat and has been with the Department of Justice. Thomas Halkowski, a \nthird pending nominee, is a respected partner at Fish & Richardson in \nWilmington, one of the preeminent IP law firms in the Nation, and has a \nwealth of experience at a variety of different Federal courts. I think \nall three of the nominees I referenced today will make excellent \nadditions. While my colleague and I view the caseload differently, I \nthink the President has nominated able and capable nominees and the \ncourt needs and deserves to not have to rely on senior status judges to \nmeet its constitutional and statutory obligations.\n  So, with that, I will yield the floor, although I will not yield on \nthe issue.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2095\n\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the Peters \namendment No. 2095. Financial literacy has been defined as the ability \nto use knowledge and skills to manage financial resources effectively \nfor a lifetime of financial well-being. Unfortunately, too many \nAmerican families, both parents and their children, lack basic \nfinancial skills. Recent studies have shown that future generations are \nlikely to be less financially stable than those who preceded them.\n  Just last year, the FINRA Investor Education Foundation conducted a \nsurvey and found that millenials engaged in problematic financial \nbehaviors and expressed concerns about their debt. To address this \nissue, a number of States have included financial literacy as a core \ncomponent of high school education.\n  A separate FINRA study found that credit scores significantly \nimproved and delinquency rates on credit accounts were reduced in \nStates with financial literacy education. For example, that study found \nthat credit scores improved by 11 points in Georgia, 16 points in \nIdaho, and 32 points in Texas.\n  There is a clear need for practical education programming for both \nparents and students, and we should provide States with the flexibility \nto provide this programming. That is why I have filed amendment No. \n2095. The Peters amendment will include family financial literacy \nprogramming as an allowable use for title I parent and family \nengagement funding.\n  Family financial literacy programming can ensure our Nation's parents \nand children have the skills necessary to properly utilize credit, \nfinance an education, manage a household budget, and plan for \nretirement.\n  I believe we must do all we can to help our Nation's parents and \nstudents succeed in every aspect of their lives.\n  I thank Senator Murray and Senator Alexander for their leadership on \nthis bill and for their willingness to work with me on this amendment. \nI hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the Peters family \nfinancial literacy amendment No. 2095.\n  Mr. President, in addition to my financial literacy amendment, I was \nhappy to work with the chairman and ranking member to include language \nin the text of the bill that will help us identify and assist our most \nvulnerable children. The term ``dual status youth'' refers to children \nwho have come into contact with both the child welfare and juvenile \njustice systems.\n  A growing body of research has shown that dual status youth \nexperience poor educational performance, higher recidivism rates, and \nhigher detention rates. Many at-risk children lack stable home lives, \nand they are frequently funneled through the school-to-prison pipeline. \nI am glad the Every Child Achieves Act now includes language that would \nencourage States to identify dual status youth and improve intervention \nprograms in order to reduce school suspensions, expulsions, and \nreferrals to law enforcement.\n  I was also pleased to join Senator Gardner in introducing an \namendment to allow title I funds to be used to support concurrent and \ndual enrollment programs at eligible schools. This amendment would \nenable high school students to simultaneously receive college credit \nfrom courses taught by college-approved teachers in secondary \neducation. With the cost of higher education continuing to grow, \nhelping students get a head start on completing their college courses \nhelps them save money and get ahead.\n  I am proud that this body approved the Gardner-Peters amendment last \nweek. This provision will make the dream of higher education more \naccessible to students in Michigan and across the country.\n\n\n                   Working Americans and Overtime Pay\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to speak at this time in strong support of \nplans to increase our Nation's overtime pay threshold for the first \ntime in over a decade and restore meaning to a threshold that has \nsignificantly eroded over the last 40 years.\n  In 1938, Congress passed the Fair Labor Standards Act and President \nFranklin Delano Roosevelt signed the bill into law. This landmark \nlegislation represents an important promise that is as true today as it \nwas 77 years ago--that if you work hard and play by the\n\n[[Page S5050]]\n\nrules, you will have a secure future. Ensuring fair overtime pay for \nemployees is one of the most critical components of the Fair Labor \nStandards Act. It ensures that hard-working Americans are able to make \nan honest wage for their hard work. For middle-class families, who are \nthe backbone of our country, and for those families working hard to get \nthere, we must protect the important safeguards put in place by the \nFair Labor Standards Act.\n  I personally learned the value of hard work and the importance of \nprotecting labor standards for all Americans from my mother, Madeleine. \nBorn a French citizen, she met my father during World War II, married \nhim, and moved to this country. She later worked as a nurse's aide. \nWhile she enjoyed working with her patients, she did not like the way \nshe or her coworkers were treated by their employer, so she fought for \na better workplace and ultimately to win union representation. She \nlater went on to serve as a union steward.\n  A strong labor movement nationwide helped build economic opportunity \nfor millions of Americans just like my mother. Standing together to \ncall for fair wages, safer work places, and better hours, American \nworkers and their families helped build the American middle class and \nmake the American dream a reality for regular folks.\n  The strong protections of the Fair Labor Standards Act helped ensure \nthat American workers have a minimum wage, a 40-hour workweek, and \novertime pay. Unfortunately, we have allowed these protections to fall \nbehind present-day needs. Today, growing income inequality and stagnant \nwages are a serious threat to our middle class, to our economy, and to \nour democracy.\n  Americans are working harder and harder only to fall further and \nfurther behind, receiving less and less pay for their long hours. \nMiddle-class families are struggling to stay afloat, and those who \naspire to be in the middle class are finding it more and more difficult \nto achieve.\n  Today, some employees are required to put in 50 or 60 hours or more a \nweek and are not receiving any overtime pay for their efforts. Our \nNation's overtime pay rules are long overdue for an update. Decades of \ninflation have outpaced the current overtime pay threshold of $23,600 \nand eroded the value of an honest paycheck for millions of hard-working \nAmericans. This means a worker earning only $23,600 gets paid the same \nwhether they are working 40 hours or 60 hours in a week. That is simply \nunacceptable. This is not a fair wage, and it is not the American dream \nwe fought to secure for generations.\n  If we are truly committed to building a strong American economy, then \nwe have to make sure American families can thrive. Raising the salary \nthreshold for overtime pay will help nearly 5 million workers across \nthe country and as many as 100,000 workers in Michigan earn better \nwages for their hard work.\n  The pillars used to build and grow our middle class and support our \ndemocracy are in jeopardy of crumbling if we do not stand up and \nprotect them. The American middle class and those who aspire to be in \nit are the heart and soul of our country, and we have an obligation to \nhelp every family nationwide realize their version of the American \ndream.\n  My home State of Michigan is the birthplace of our Nation's auto \nindustry, where American workers and their families helped build the \nmiddle class and make the American dream a reality for millions of \npeople. We owe it to our future generations to preserve this legacy.\n  I know there are some who do not believe we should update the \novertime pay rules. They will oppose this rule saying it is a harmful \nattack on our Nation's business community. Well, I strongly disagree \nwith that position.\n  Prior to coming to Congress, I worked in business for more than 20 \nyears and I hired many people. I found that paying employees a fair \nwage is the best way to ensure a happy and productive workforce. It is \ngood business, and it is the right thing to do. Providing a fair \npaycheck to hard-working Americans so they can build their family and \nown a home and help save for their children's college education as well \nas enjoy a secure retirement is good for business and it is good for \nour country. Workers who are paid fairly for their work are able to \nspend their hard-earned money in their communities, creating new \ncustomers for local businesses and in the process help our economy \ngrow. If we invest in American workers--the best and brightest in the \nworld--we will get a strong return on that investment.\n  Enforcing the Fair Labor Standards Act gives American workers a fair \nwage for a fair day's work, and it will help keep the possibility of \nthe American dream alive. We must do what is right for our workers. \nUpdating the overtime pay rule will give millions of Americans a wage \nincrease that they have earned and provide economic stability and \nsecurity for hard-working families, while boosting our economy.\n  I am proud to support these efforts, and I urge my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                      Nuclear Agreement With Iran\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I wish to begin by taking a few moments to \ndiscuss the nuclear deal with Iran that was announced this morning. \nWhile I am still reviewing the intricacies of the deal, right now I am \ndeeply skeptical that this agreement will prevent Iran from acquiring a \nnuclear weapon.\n  The Obama administration appears to have capitulated on almost every \nredline it established at the outset, and I have strong doubts about \nwhether the final provisions requiring inspections and curtailing \nenrichment and research and development are strong enough to be \neffective.\n  Another significant concern is the fact that removal of sanctions \nwill give Iran access to billions of dollars and other resources to \nfund its campaign for increased regional influence, which includes \nproxy wars and material support for terrorist organizations. In fact, \nif we look at almost anywhere in the Middle East, whether it is \nHezbollah in Lebanon or Hamas in the Gaza Strip or the Houthis in Yemen \nor the Shia militias in Iraq, they all trace their lineage back to and \nare proxies for Iran.\n  I am deeply concerned about the fact that the deal creates a timeline \nfor lifting the embargo on conventional and ballistic weapons without \nrequiring Iran to change its behavior in any meaningful way. Given that \nIran is the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism and is already \nintervening in conflicts in the region, the last thing we should be \ndoing is expanding Iran's access to weapons.\n  In the lead-up to this agreement, Members of both parties expressed \ntheir concerns about the direction this deal was headed, and the \nrelease of the final document has confirmed many of those fears. \nUnfortunately, the President is apparently unwilling to listen to \nMembers of either party, and in his speech this morning he threatened \nto veto any legislation that would prevent his deal from going into \neffect. Well, that is very disappointing, and it lends credence to the \nconcern that the President is more worried about securing his political \nlegacy than he is about actually preventing Iran from acquiring a \nweapon.\n  Regardless of his veto threat, Members of both parties will carefully \nexamine this deal and continue to do everything we can to ensure Iran \nnever acquires a nuclear weapon.\n  Mr. President, I wish to speak as well this week about what the \nSenate is currently doing. The Senate is taking a huge step forward on \neducation.\n  Nearly 8 years after No Child Left Behind expired, Congress is \nfinally taking up legislation to reauthorize Federal K-12 education \nprograms. While the law's focus on improving education for our students \nwas laudable, No Child Left Behind must be updated. The Every Child \nAchieves Act--the legislation we are considering this week--will \nrestore control of education to the people who know students best: \nteachers, parents, and local school boards.\n  Just 10 percent of education funding each year comes from the Federal \nGovernment. Despite this, the Federal Government has a huge oversight \nrole in education. Every day, teachers and administrators and students \nhave their day shaped by a host of Federal mandates, from testing \nrequirements to precisely what to do if a school is deemed ``failing.''\n  Federal control of education has reached its peak in recent years, \nwith the Federal Government going so far as to coerce States into \nadopting its preferred curriculum and educational standards.\n  No Child Left Behind demanded that schools meet a number of \nbenchmarks to be judged as adequate. Failure to meet these requirements \nwould result in a school being labeled as failing. Unfortunately, the \nrigid nature of these standards meant that many schools\n\n[[Page S5051]]\n\nwere at risk of being labeled as failing. In response, States have made \nit a habit to apply to the Federal Government for waivers from the \nterms of the law so they can avoid the burdensome requirements that \ncome along with the ``failing'' label. The Obama administration has \ngenerally complied--but with Federal strings attached. Essentially, the \nadministration informs States that it is happy to grant them waivers as \nlong as they agree to implement the Federal Government's preferred \nacademic standards, adopt the Federal Government's preferred method of \nevaluating teachers, and take the steps the Federal Government believes \nare the appropriate steps to address failing schools.\n  Neither Congress nor the administration should be telling States and \nlocal communities what to teach in their schools. Decisions about \neducation should be made by those who actually educate students, not by \na group of bureaucrats or politicians in Washington, DC.\n  As any teacher will tell us, education is not a one-size-fits-all \nproposition. Even within a single classroom, students are likely to \ncome from a wide variety of backgrounds and experiences and have \ndifferent learning styles. Teachers are constantly adapting their \nmethods and material to meet the needs of the particular students they \nhave in front of them. That is a lot harder to do when Washington is \ndictating those methods.\n  The legislation we are considering today--the Every Child Achieves \nAct--will revoke the Federal Government's authority to dictate \nstandards to the States. Specifically, this legislation explicitly \nprohibits the Federal Government from tying Federal funds to a State's \nadoption of specific educational standards. In other words, the Federal \nGovernment will no longer be able to blackmail States into adopting its \npreferred academic criteria.\n  This is a huge victory for students and for teachers. Thanks to this \nlegislation, States and localities will have much more freedom to adopt \nthe standards and curricula that will help their students achieve.\n  Another one of the problems created by No Child Left Behind, as any \nparent or teacher will tell you, is the phenomenon of overtesting. I \nhave received hundreds of letters this year from teachers and parents \nconcerned about the effect overtesting is having on students' \neducation.\n  While NCLB only required two or three tests per year, the law made \nthese tests the primary indicator of a school's performance, which \nresulted in many schools deciding to teach to the test. The result? Not \nsurprisingly, instead of teachers deciding what is important material \nbased upon their knowledge of their subject, teachers' instructional \npriorities are often dictated by the material they think will be on the \nrequired tests. As a result, students may never receive instruction in \nimportant topics or concepts simply because they are not covered on the \ntests. In addition, instead of one or two yearly tests required by law, \nstudents are subject to months of preparatory testing in order to make \nsure the school maintains its ranking by gaining acceptable average \nscores on the mandated tests.\n  It is undoubtedly true that the tests, including standardized tests, \ncan be incredibly useful in the teaching process both as a diagnostic \ntool and as a measurement of student progress, but problems arise when \ntests become the only measure of progress.\n  The Every Child Achieves Act keeps the testing requirements of No \nChild Left Behind but gives States the option to give a single \ncomprehensive test, as they do now, or break up the assessment into \nsmaller components that can be given throughout the school year.\n  Most importantly, the Every Child Achieves Act removes test results \nas the primary indicator of a school's performance. In fact, it takes \nprogress measurements out of the hands of the Federal Government \nentirely and gives them to the States. Under this bill, States, not the \nFederal Government, will be the ones developing accountability systems \nto measure schools' effectiveness. Instead of a one-size-fits-all \nFederal standard, each State will be able to identify the best ways to \nchart the progress of its schools and measure student performance.\n  In addition, the Every Child Achieves Act removes the Federal \nGovernment's national teacher evaluation requirements and allows States \nto decide whether and how to measure the effectiveness of their \nteachers.\n  I have offered several amendments to the Every Child Achieves Act, \nincluding two very important measures to address the tragic rash of \nstudent suicides that has beset Indian Country over the past several \nmonths. The first of these amendments would require the Secretary of \nEducation to coordinate with the Secretary of the Interior and the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to report on their Federal \nresponse to these suicides, compile and analyze available Federal \nresources, and make recommendations for improving Federal programs. The \nsecond measure would strengthen the Project School Emergency Response \nto Violence Program--or Project SERV--to help schools prevent tragedies \nsuch as youth suicide. I am hopeful that the Senate will pass both of \nthese measures.\n  I am also pleased that the underlying bill contains important \nimprovements that I championed to the Federal Impact Aid Program--a \nprogram that provides districts with revenue to make up for nontaxable \nFederal activity in school districts.\n  The reforms contained in the Every Child Achieves Act have been a \nlong time coming, and they have been greeted eagerly. This bill is \nsupported by everyone from the school superintendents organization, to \nthe National Governors Association, to Teach for America. And, of \ncourse, this legislation is strongly supported by both Republicans and \nDemocrats in the Senate.\n  One big reason a No Child Left Behind reauthorization has moved from \nlegislation no Member of Congress wanted to touch to the bipartisan \nbill that is before us today is Republicans' commitment to restoring \nregular order to the Senate. We have restored the committee process and \nensured that Members of both parties are able to make their voices \nheard through amendments. The result is legislation like the Every \nChild Achieves Act--a bill with strong bipartisan authorship and strong \nbipartisan support. I hope we will have many more achievements like \nthis in the Republican-led Senate this year.\n  We need to get control out of the hands of Washington bureaucrats--\npeople who have never been to South Dakota, much less a South Dakota \nschool. They shouldn't be telling South Dakota teachers what to teach. \nThe legislation before us today will help strengthen education in this \ncountry by putting decisionmaking about education where it belongs--in \nthe hands of State and local school districts. I look forward to the \nSenate passing this bill later this week.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from South Dakota for \nhighlighting the real benefits of doing away with No Child Left Behind, \nbreaking down the national school board, and saying to States and \nlocalities across this country: We ought to put you in charge of K-\nthrough-12 education.\n  That is where the responsibility needs to be. That is where we will \nhave decisions closer to students. And I don't think there is \ndisagreement among Members of the Senate or Congress or Republicans or \nDemocrats or people from the North or the South--we want to make sure \nK-through-12 education works. Every child should get across the goal \nline to graduation, and every child with a diploma should be marketable \neither to higher education or to a job with a skill that has a \npaycheck.\n  I will say that the Federal Government's role is not to micromanage \nthe education system; it is to be a financial partner to K-through-12 \neducation, to be a partner without strings, and to be a partner that \nprovides equity across the board.\n  So I am here to talk about the Full Education Opportunity Act of \n2015, which I hope will be an amendment to this bill. Title I-A is the \nFederal Government's central financial assistance to 21 million poor \nchildren in America. They attend school districts with high levels of \npoverty, and the kids come from low-income families. They define \nexactly what the Federal Government\n\n[[Page S5052]]\n\nshould be focused on. It has served as the cornerstone of the Federal \nGovernment's education funding for K through 12 since elementary and \nsecondary education was first signed into law in 1965. At the bill \nsigning, President Lyndon Johnson said that the assistance provided \nunder ESEA would serve to assist in the ``full educational \nopportunity'' of low-income students and to provide ``financial \nassistance to school districts serving areas with concentrations of \nchildren from low-income families.'' That summed it up in two \nsentences. That is what the Federal Government's funding source was \ndesigned to meet.\n  So what has happened since 1965? Like every other funding formula in \nthe Federal Government, as the population shifted somewhere else in the \ncountry, money never seemed to follow it.\n  We had this debate several years ago on HIV-AIDS when we woke up one \nday and realized how much we were investing in the war against HIV-AIDS \nto keep people alive and find a cure, and we found towns like \nWashington that were getting a phenomenal amount of money but their \nHIV-AIDS population had gone down, and throughout rural America, we had \nan explosion of HIV-AIDS, primarily in African-American women. We \nworked and we worked and we worked, and we finally changed the \nlegislation to reflect what the intent was so that the money followed \nthe population it was intended to help. Today, there are individuals \nacross this country in rural America who are now getting the drugs they \nneed to either hold in check the disease or in hopes to slow its \nprogression.\n  Well, I am here today because in 1965 Lyndon Johnson said that is the \nFederal Government's role--to make sure we target low-income families, \nkids in poverty.\n  Despite recognizing that these formula funds were not fully targeted \nat high-poverty areas, Congress has simply taken the easy route and \nadded more formulas to title I-A in hopes that by putting more formulas \nout there, eventually it would help the people who were affected. Well, \nwhat it has done is it has compounded the problem.\n  The inadequacies in how we target poverty today just aren't right. My \namendment attempts to end this practice and creates a simple, highly \ntargeted program toward poverty with a new formula.\n  First, what does it do? It is important to make clear that this \namendment only addresses title I formulas. It is not the overall \nfunding--that is for appropriators to determine--but it is to structure \nthe formula.\n  I am a strong supporter of title I funding, and I believe, regardless \nof the amount at which title I is funded, it should be distributed \nfairly and targeted to its intended population, which is kids in \npoverty, low-income families. Simply adding more funds still allows the \ninequities in the formula to persist. That is why I am attempting to \nfix the formula once and for all.\n  This amendment consolidates all of title I's formulas into one simple \nformula called equity grants. Let me say this. It simplifies I-A so \nthat the calculation, put very simply, is equity grants equal the \nState's number of poor children times the national average of educating \neach child. It ends the policy that awards a wealthy State with title I \nmoney simply because they are able to spend more on education and \ntherefore they get a higher allotment as a result. For decades, this \nhas penalized poorer States that spend high shares of their tax revenue \non education but don't spend as much in absolute terms as wealthier \nStates. This change ensures that poor children born in a poor State \naren't penalized because of their ZIP Code and for not living in a \nwealthy State elsewhere in the country.\n  Why will equity grants work and where are they targeted? Very simply, \nthis formula takes the number of low-income children in a State, \nmultiplies that by how equitably a State spends its own money on \nhelping low-income children, and then sends the amount to the school \ndistrict in the State, while placing heavy weights on the school \ndistricts that exhibit the highest levels of poverty--embraced in the \n1965 initiative of President Johnson.\n  Current law rewards States that spend a much higher amount of money \non their students than poorer States that, despite spending large \nshares of their overall budget on education, cannot compete with \nwealthier States in absolute dollars. Essentially, as long as you are \nabove the national average in spending, you get a very large title I \nbonus payment. For example, the national average per-pupil education \nspending in the country is $11,014. For States such as Pennsylvania, it \nis $13,864; Massachusetts, $14,515; and Connecticut, $16,631 per pupil. \nThis has been a pretty good deal for them. For States such as \nMississippi, it is $8,130; North Carolina, $8,090; and Utah spends \n$6,555--not so good a deal. Who gets cheated? The kids in poverty, kids \nfrom low-income families.\n  Rewarding wealth over poverty is also contrary to the original \npurpose of title I-A funding. This has a real impact on how much a \nformula child will receive based upon the State in which he or she \nlives. For example, a child in Guilford County, NC, is only worth \n$1,128. A poor child in Albuquerque, NM, is only worth $1,158. A poor \nchild in Seattle is only worth $1,240. On the other hand, a poor child \nin Philadelphia is worth $1,986. A poor child in New Jersey is worth \n$1,838. A poor child in Boston, MA, is worth $1,847. This is a highly \ninequitable and unfair formula to the poor children in most States. \nBecause of the changes in this amendment, these disparities go away. \nThey are almost completely eliminated.\n  Eliminating this provision has been suggested by organizations like \nthe Center for American Progress, the Formula Fairness Campaign, the \nRural School and Community Trust, and others. These are not \nconservative groups. These are very left-of-center groups who said \nequity is important.\n  No States should get a bonus payment just because they spend more or \nthey are wealthy. The focus since 1965 was supposed to be kids in \npoverty. If you have more kids in poverty, you should receive a larger \nFederal share.\n  This amendment also addresses the bonus that very large districts \nthat might have small numbers of poverty have enjoyed. Under the \ncurrent law, a district must meet a $6,500 formula child threshold to \nreceive concentration grants. This has typically resulted in purely \nlarge and not necessarily high-concentration impoverished districts \nreceiving large grant awards. This hurts smaller, mostly rural \ndistricts with large percentages of poverty but not necessarily high \nnumbers. To fix this, we impart a 20-percent poverty test within the \nequity grant for large districts to show that they have a concentration \nof poverty.\n\n  Now, this is a novel approach. We have a formula that is targeted to \nbe a Federal partner in money, targeted at kids in poverty, and all of \na sudden we are asking them: Show us that you have that population. \nUnder the current law, districts also receive title I-A dollars for \nmerely meeting a small threshold of 10 formula kids or just 2 percent \nof their overall population being poor.\n  This has meant that schools in Loudoun County, VA--I am sure there \nare some in here who might have graduated from Loudoun County schools \nor have kids in Loudoun County schools--have only 3 percent poor \nchildren. It is one of the wealthiest counties in America. It receives \nabout a $1 million as part of an overall nearly $1 billion budget. This \nis about half the entire spending of the State of South Dakota, which \nthe previous speaker is from.\n  Now, should he be cheated because they do not spend as much as \nVirginia, though he has kids in poverty, low-income families, \nindividuals to whom in 1965 the Congress and the President said: This \nis who we should target--we the Federal Government on behalf of \ntaxpayers. Well, this hurts smaller, rural districts with large \npercentages of poverty but not necessarily high numbers.\n  Under current law, it is not going to change. We should do our best \nto send the money to districts in States that are truly in need by \nfocusing the formula on poverty. Now, sometimes it is easier to see \nthan it is to listen. This is the amendment--the Full Educational \nOpportunity Act. What do we do? It treats all low-income children the \nsame. I think that is what the Federal Government is supposed to do--to \ntarget the poorest communities. That was the spirit of the 1965 law--to \nprioritize equity, meaning everybody should be\n\n[[Page S5053]]\n\ntreated equal, that you should not disadvantage a poor child in one \narea to advantage a system in another area.\n  Is it fair? A title I child versus a title I child? Denver, CO, \n$1,218; Boston, MA, $1,847; Miami, FL, $1,212; Philadelphia, PA, \n$1,986; Albuquerque, NM, $1,158; New Haven, CT, $1,717; Portland, OR, \n$1,292; Camden, NJ, $2,083; Seattle, WA, $1,240; New York City, \n$1,839--if I am over here, I think this funding formula is awfully good \nbecause we are getting rewarded whether we have poverty kids or not.\n  Over here, who is being hurt? It is not the States. People have come \ndown to the floor, and they have beaten me up on this amendment for the \nlast few days. Oh, how could you do this? How could you take away \nsomething that we have already got? It is real simple. You don't have \nlow-income poverty kids or at least you don't have as much as here. If \nyou did you would qualify under the new formula.\n  But it gets worse. Fair? Florida has the same number of low-income \nstudents, 690,000, as New York, 686,00. What is the distribution of \ntitle I funds? It is $774 million, $1.1 billion--the same population \nbut New York receives $400 million more than the State of Florida. How \ncan that be fair? Now, you can be greedy and say: We deserve it; that \nis what the formula said. You cannot punish us because this is not \nequitable.\n  Well, maybe we can. But for once, Congress can do the right thing and \nfix the formula. That is all I am on the floor attempting to do with my \namendment--to fix it. Since 1965 we have not had the backbone to do it \nwhen we figured out it was wrong. Well, when we see this, if it is \ntargeted for low-income kids and they have the same numbers, they ought \nto get the same money. But no, some believe that $400 million is worth \nit because they have always gotten more.\n  Here is New Mexico versus Massachusetts. There are 107,000 low-income \nstudents in New Mexico and 80,000 low-income students in Massachusetts. \nNew Mexico receives $116 million. Massachusetts receives $116 million. \nIt is the same amount of money, but there are 27,000 more low-income \npoverty kids in New Mexico. What do you say to a child in New Mexico \nthat just happened to grow up in a poor family? You don't get to get as \ngood an education. You should be have been born in Massachusetts. This \nis the Federal Government doing it with taxpayer money, and we don't \nhave a problem with this.\n  My God, this is at the heart of what the Federal Government is \nsupposed to do. There are individuals who come down here and talk about \nequitable treatment all the time. This is the most unequal thing that \ncan exist. Yet some would block this amendment from coming to the \nfloor. Is this fair? This is title I-A allocation per poor child: \nFlorida, $1,284; New York, $1,611; Minnesota, $1,189; Massachusetts, \n$1,453; Oregon, $1,149; Maryland, $1,585; Washington, $1,127; \nConnecticut, $1,447; New Mexico, $1,093; Pennsylvania, $1,517. It does \nnot matter how you slice it. They get more. They get more if they do \nnot have the population to support it.\n\n  So who is getting more than their fair share? Boy, pictures speak \nlouder than words. Look at that. The green States get more money. The \nwhite States, even though they have kids in poverty, they do not get an \nequitable distribution of Federal money through the title I-A program. \nIt is embarrassing. It is embarrassing to Congress that we did not \nchange this a long time ago.\n  For poor children who lose under the current formula, this is the \nreverse. Now, it is the kids who live in the States that are red that \nget cheated. They get cheated based upon the 1965 initiative under \nLyndon Johnson, signed into law after Congress passed it--the Early \nChildhood Program, elementary and secondary education. I do not think I \nhave ever seen an issue that broadly affects America where there was \nthis much disparity in equitable distribution of Federal dollars. As a \nmatter of fact, I would say it could not happen. But not only did it \nhappen, people argue that this is fair. Well, all I can say is that if \nyou say this is fair, then you are not focused on what this formula was \ndesigned to do, and that is to target low-income kids in poverty.\n  But you know it does not stop there. Let's go further. Let me take my \nState of North Carolina, with 391,000 low-income students. We get $417 \nmillion in title I-A money. Pennsylvania has 357,000 low-income \nstudents. They get $542 million in title I money. So I have 34,000 more \nlow-income children, but I am asked to be satisfied with $125 million \nless in money to target low-income kids in poverty.\n  Now, I think I am being pretty diplomatic when I come down here and \nshow things like this. This is what America hates. This is what makes \nthem sick. This is what they think is a great example that we don't \nhave a sense of reality. What do you say to a kid in North Carolina who \nstruggles through K-through-12 education when you say: You are worth \n$125 million less if you are in poverty than the investment we are \ngoing to make in Pennsylvania.\n  Well, it is only appropriate that the Presiding Officer would be from \nColorado, which has 143,000 low-income students and receives $150 \nmillion. Maryland has 124,000 low-income students and receives $196 \nmillion. There are 19,000 more low-income students in Colorado, but you \nget $46 million less. I am sure the Presiding Officer has the same hard \ntime I do going back to Colorado and saying: Don't worry; this is fair. \nThis is fair because it has been this way for 25 years.\n  The money is supposed to follow the population we are targeting to be \ninvested in. In this particular case, it is the most at-risk in our \ncountry, from getting the tools they need to getting a job that has a \npaycheck. Fair?\n  Nevada, the minority leader's State has 102,000 low-income students. \nThey get $116 million. Connecticut has 80,000 low-income students. They \nget $116 million. Well, if I were from Nevada, I would be furious at \nthis. You would think that if you get the same amount of money, you \nshould at least have the same amount of kids in poverty, because that \nis what the formula was designed to do.\n  But no, wealthy States have found ways to game it by getting bonus \npayments. Fair?\n  Indiana, the State of the previous Presiding Officer before this one, \nhas 235,000 low-income students. They get $256 million in Indiana. \nThere are 228,000 low-income students in New Jersey. They get $331 \nmillion--7,000 more low-income students in Indiana and somehow New \nJersey gets $75 million more than Indiana. This is sort of \nembarrassing. Some find no shame in this: We are just out for as much \nmoney as our State can get.\n  Let me say to my colleagues that I don't know what the outcome of \nthis amendment is going to be. But let me ask you for 1 minute to put \nthe windfall your State is getting aside and ask yourself this: Do we \nhave an obligation, based upon how elementary and secondary education \nwas perceived and conceived in 1965, to actually make sure that the \nmoney follows where kids in poverty are?\n  If not, don't come down here and talk about equity on every other \nfunding formula. Don't say that money should follow people, when you \nhave the most at-risk population, kids in poverty, and we are talking \neducating them to where they can function in society, to where they can \nget a job and a paycheck and not be a ward of anybody, where they can \nbe independent and enjoy every opportunity this country has to offer.\n  Well, you cannot be for that and be against this amendment. You \ncannot be for those kids and not fund them where every State is red. It \ncannot happen. But over history, just like other things, this creates \nwinners and a lot of losers. But let me suggest to you that you take \nthese lines away, and you just see the United States of America. Who \nshould be the winners? Every kid in poverty.\n  Every kid born into a low-income family should be the recipient of \ntitle I-A money in an equal capacity because they should have as good \nan opportunity and a future--an economic future--regardless of the \nState they live in, regardless of the ZIP Code. Regardless of whether \nthey are in rural America or urban America, there shouldn't be a \ndiscrepancy. This rights a very bad wrong. This makes it work for all \nkids in poverty--not some kids, not school districts that are wealthy, \nbut all kids in poverty.\n  Let me just say for my colleagues that it is not going to happen \nunless we\n\n[[Page S5054]]\n\nhave a backbone that is strong enough to actually bring an amendment up \nand vote on it. I am willing to do that. I am willing to roll the dice.\n  Look at the number of States that benefit from this--and I said that \nwrong. Look at the number of kids that benefit from this change. This \nis not about States, and it is not about parties. This is about kids. \nIt is what this act was created for in 1965, and I can't find the \nreason as to why Congress didn't fix it before 2015. But the fact is \nthat we are talking about reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act. It happens about once every 10 years. We have an \nopportunity to fix this inequity now.\n  I don't want to look back and say: I had an opportunity to fix it, \nbut, you know, that was hard. It was difficult. It meant that there \nwere winners and losers.\n  Everybody cannot be a winner when some take advantage of the system \nlike this has. Well, there is only one way to make everybody a winner, \nand that is to fix the formula. Regardless of how long it takes us to \nwork out of it, we can fix it from this point forward.\n  I urge my colleagues, if given the opportunity to vote on the Burr-\nBennet Full Educational Opportunity Act, to support it. I can't believe \nI am in the Senate saying ``if, if, if'' we are given an opportunity to \nactually bring up a germane, relevant amendment that affects every kid \nin poverty in the United States. I can't imagine the Senate is not \nwilling to debate and vote on that amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am not sure what the intentions are \nof the chairman of the energy committee. As chairman, I would be \ndelighted to yield to her if she is going to take some time on the \nfloor, and I would need about 10 minutes for my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it was my understanding that I was next \nin the queue. If I am incorrect, I would be happy to get this squared \naway. I, too, have about 15 minutes.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am happy to yield. I thought we went \nback and forth from side to side ordinarily, but I am very happy to \nyield. I have a chairman who is a very busy person.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I thank my colleague from Rhode Island, and I thank \nhim for the opportunity to speak directly to this bill this afternoon.\n  Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly about the measure we have on \nthe floor today, the Every Child Achieves Act, the bill where we have \nall been waiting for about 15 years to fix the flawed one-size-fits-all \nNo Child Left Behind Act.\n  I begin my comments by thanking Senator Alexander, who is the \nchairman, as well as Senator Murray, the ranking member, for how they \nhave managed this legislation from the very beginning.\n  I think we know there is a little bit of inside baseball that goes on \naround here that perhaps isn't interesting to many. But I think it is \nimportant to note that Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray \nhave led this bill in a way that has fostered consensus building and, I \nthink, very constructive negotiations.\n  More importantly, in the process they allowed the voices of the \nAmerican people--of Alaskans--to be heard. I think that was one of the \nreasons why we saw this legislation move unanimously through the HELP \nCommittee in April, and I think that is one of the reasons that you are \nseeing us move through a series of amendments on issues that are \nconsiderable but in a very constructive manner and certainly respectful \nof one another. So I wish to acknowledge and recognize the masterful \nwork they have done in guiding this bill forward.\n  I also wish to recognize the work of my staff. Karen McCarthy on my \nstaff has done yeoman's work in working with so many Alaskans, \neducators, administrators, and the like. That has been an effort that I \nthink has yielded benefit to folks in my home State. But I also wish to \nrecognize the work of those on both Senator Murray's staff as well as \nSenator Alexander's--very hard-working professional staff who are a \ncredit to their Senators and their State.\n  So why am I standing today before you in support of the Every Child \nAchieves Act?\n  When Alaskans are visiting about the education bill that we know as \nNo Child Left Behind, it is clear that to a number--whether you are an \neducator, whether it is students, parents, tribes; it didn't make any \ndifference--nobody was happy. The one-size-fits-all mandate, poor \ntribal consultation, and the lack of State and local control over our \nchildren's education clearly were not working.\n  I say that one of the first immersions into politics I had was when I \nwas a PTA president at my son's elementary school. That, for me, was my \nfirst introduction to what the mandates meant that were coming out of \nNo Child Left Behind when our school was deemed as a failure because we \nfailed to meet AYP because of the 31 different ways to fail. We \ncertainly made it by not having sufficient subgroups taking the test on \nthe day that the test was required. Our neighborhood school was a \nfailure. It didn't seem to me that it made sense and still does not.\n  So I make sure to take that experience as a mom, as a PTA president, \nand as one for whom No Child Left Behind was not just some theoretical \nexercise. It was Federal law imposed in my town and in my schools, \nwhich had a negative and a direct impact on those who were part of our \nschool.\n  So my top priority was to make sure that any rewrite of No Child Left \nBehind gave more power to make decisions about Alaska's schools to \nAlaska and to our local communities.\n  The failed experiment of adequate yearly progress had to go. Under \nthe Every Child Achieves Act, that is done.\n  The failed highly qualified teacher mandates that made little sense \nand also did not work had to go, and they are gone. States will again \nbe able to decide what qualifications and skills to demand of teachers \nand principals, whether to have a statewide evaluation system, and, if \nso, whether those evaluations consider growth in student proficiency.\n  Now, I am very aware that some across the country--in fact, I have \nheard from some in Alaska--are concerned that the Every Child Achieves \nAct does not do enough to return local control to schools, that it \nperpetuates, somehow, the common core standards. In fact, the Every \nChild Achieves Act specifically and expressly prohibits the Secretary \nfrom having any authority to ``mandate, direct, control, coerce, or \nexercise any direction or supervision over any of the challenging State \nacademic standards adopted or implemented by a State.''\n  Now I have also heard that some are concerned that the bill maintains \nsecretarial approval of State plans, with the implication then that the \nSecretary will be able to change or deny elements of State plans, \nwhether it is State standards, assessments or accountability systems, \nas somehow a condition of approval. But the Every Child Achieves Act \nalso places a number of limitations on the Secretary's authority over \nthe State's plans.\n  The act prohibits the Secretary from requiring a State to include or \ndelete any element of its State standards from the State plans, use \nspecific assessment instruments or items, set goals, timelines, weights \nor significance to any indicators of student proficiency, include or \ndelete from the plan standards, measures, assessment, student growth \nbenchmarks or goals of student achievement for school accountability, \nas well as any aspect of teacher or principal quality, effectiveness or \nevaluations systems, or require any data collection beyond current \nreporting requirements. There are similar prohibitions that are \nscattered throughout the Every Child Achieves Act.\n  In short, I am confident that the act returns control of State \nstandards, curriculum, instruction, assessments, educator \nqualifications, and school accountability to the State of Alaska, and \nthat is where I want it to be.\n  I also have other reasons for supporting the act that will directly \nimpact students, parents, educators, and communities across Alaska in a \npositive way and with provisions that Alaskans ask for most \nspecifically.\n  I acknowledge the work that I was able to do with Senator Boxer. \nTogether we worked to craft the support\n\n[[Page S5055]]\n\nfor the Afterschool for America's Children Act. She and I worked on \nthis bill to update and strengthen the 21st Community Learning Centers \nafterschool program across the country. We worked with a number of \nother Members in the Senate to make sure that this important program--\nthe program that keeps our children safe and engaged after school and \nduring the summer--works for all of our States.\n  We worked with the chairman and ranking member, and after a lot of \ngood negotiation, the Afterschool for America's Children Act, with some \namendment, was included in the Every Child Achieves Act, and this was \ndone by unanimous consent in the HELP Committee, which I appreciate.\n  On the issue of how we ensure that our Native children are cared for \nand addressed in a real and meaningful way, there were several \nprovisions that we were able to include in the act to better meet the \nneeds of Native children.\n  At my request, the act requires the States and school districts, \nwhere applicable, to consult and engage with the American Indian, \nAlaska Native or Native Hawaiian tribes and parents in creating State \nand local plans and in implementing Federal education programs that \nserve Native students in order to meet their cultural language and \neducation needs. These are our Nation's first peoples, with whom the \nUnited States has a constitutionally mandated responsibility to \ninteract with on a government-to-government basis. So I think it is \ntime that our tribes and our Native organizations throughout the \ncountry were part of designing the plans and shaping the programs used \nto improve schools that serve our Native students.\n  Senator Franken and I, working with Senator Tester, were able to \ninclude a new program in the Every Child Achieves Act to help our \nNation's first peoples maintain and revitalize their Native languages \nthrough the schools. This is a new grant program that will support the \ncreation, the improvement, and the expansion of Native language \nimmersion schools in which Alaska Native, American Indian, and Native \nHawaiian students learn their lessons through ancestral languages. This \nopportunity will help preserve the fast-vanishing Native languages of \nour first peoples.\n  So what we worked to do within the program was that the Native \nAlaskan language immersion schools and programs will help Native \nlanguage immersion schools develop curriculum and assessments, provide \nprofessional development to teachers and other staff, and carry out \nactivities that will promote the maintenance and revitalization of \nthese endangered languages.\n  This is a provision where I really am quite proud of what we have \nbeen able to do, working with our colleagues to make sure that we do \nnot lose that focus in this important act.\n  We also eliminate some technical redtape that makes it nearly \nimpossible for Alaska's rural school districts to claim impact aid \ndollars to which they are entitled just because NCLB and the Alaska \nNative Claims Settlement Act didn't play well together. While it is \nmore complicated to explain, I just leave it by saying that many rural \nAlaskan school districts are no longer going to have to bang their \nheads against a brick wall of illogical and contradictory Federal rules \nafter this provision is enacted. And that is always a good thing.\n  I would point out that fixing this problem started because a handful \nof schools, business officials, and superintendents took the time to \nreach out to me to let me know: We have a problem here. This is really \none of those examples where working together we are all building \nlegislation.\n  I am also quite proud to have helped move strong improvements to the \nAlaska Native Education Equity Program. We call it ANEP in this \nlegislation. For some years now, Alaska Native leaders have asked: Why \ndo schools get all of the title VII Indian education money and most of \nthe ANEP funding. They explained that they are more than ready to take \non responsibility to help their children achieve in school. Alaska \nNative leaders have a valuable and, indeed, indispensable role to play \nin designing and implementing programs to help our children succeed. \nThese are sound arguments.\n\n  While Alaska receives no funding from the Bureau of Indian Education, \nand our schools receive the title VII, part A funding, the government-\nto-government relationship between the Federal Government and Alaska \ntribes and Native organizations has not been fully honored under ANEP.\n  Under the amendments we include in the act, ANEP funds will either go \ndirectly to tribes and Native organizations that have expertise running \neducation programs or the funds will go to tribes and Native \norganizations without such experience that partner with school \ndistricts. In addition, tribes and tribal organizations may partner \nwith the university and other Non-Native entities if they so choose. \nThis will not only honor our constitutional relationship to Alaska \nNatives but ensure that they can take on more responsibility for \nhelping their children succeed, which, again, is the right thing to do.\n  In closing, I wish to say that the Every Child Achieves Act is a good \npiece of legislation, and it is getting better with each day as we \nconsider additional amendments. It is far better than what we ever had \nwith No Child Left Behind.\n  While I am positive that each of us will have more thoughts about how \nthis could be a better bill, be a more perfect piece of legislation if \nonly one or two more changes were made, on the whole this is a sound \nimprovement over the current, failed law. I certainly intend to be \nsupportive as we move through the end of this process.\n  With that, I appreciate the courtesy of my colleague from Rhode \nIsland in deferring, and know that when I have a similar opportunity to \nyield to the Senator, I shall do so.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I wish to join Chairman Murkowski in \nexpressing my satisfaction and pleasure with this bill we are on and \njoin her in commending the leadership of Ranking Member Patty Murray \nand Chairman Lamar Alexander. As a result of their work, we have a \nsignificant piece of legislation before us. It received bipartisan \nsupport in the committee, and I think the secret of their success was \nthat they knew how to let Senators be Senators and work on a bill, \nreally on the merits of it, without a lot of partisan gunslinging. As a \nresult, the legislation before us creates a tremendous improvement in \nK-2 education over the failed No Child Left Behind Act. The process \nthat led to this was bipartisan, substantive, and thorough. They really \nlistened to a wide array of viewpoints. The result is this strong \nbipartisan proposal. As one of my senior colleagues on the committee \nsaid, this is what happens when you have committee leaders who really \nknow what they are doing.\n  By now, most Americans--certainly my constituents--are familiar with \nthe failures of No Child Left Behind. It overemphasized a peculiar form \nof testing, a form of testing in which the student took the test but \nwasn't graded on it. The subject of the test really was the performance \nof the school itself. Schools became frantic to heap up student \nperformance to protect themselves. As a result, there was a lot of \ndrama in the schools around these tests. If you did not do well, that \npitched you into a narrow, one-size-fits-all approach to fixing the \nlow-performing school. That combination served neither students nor \ncommunities well.\n  The Every Child Achieves Act is based on a very simple idea that I \nthink has broad support in the Senate: Less classroom time spent on \nthis frantic test preparation for the high-stakes exams means more time \nactually learning. The Every Child Achieves Act allows States to take a \nwhole range of factors into account to gauge how students are doing and \nhow the schools are doing, not just one test. I call that the data \ndashboard. It can include things such as graduation rates, college \nperformance rates afterwards, how many students are taking AP classes \nand SAT tests, incidents of violence or bullying, and even working \nconditions for teachers. It is something we have worked on in Rhode \nIsland through something called the InfoWorks Program. It is a \ncommonsense way of understanding school and student performance without \ncreating this massive distraction and drama.\n  Less emphasis on this peculiar high-stakes testing regime means more \ntime for teachers to teach a more balanced,\n\n[[Page S5056]]\n\nwell-rounded curriculum, giving attention to important subjects such as \nhistory and the arts, which, because they weren't covered under these \nhigh-pressure standardized tests, fell out of the curriculum. So what \nparents ought to see after we pass this bill is a much richer \ncurriculum for their kids and one that some kids simply need in order \nto stay interested in school. If arts are your passion as a child and \nif that has fallen out because of this testing regime, you really have \nbeen hurt. If history and the stories of what happened in the olden \ndays are what really gets you excited about education and if that gets \nsqueezed out so you can do the math and the reading test better, you \nreally have been hurt as a student. So that has changed. I am glad we \nhave language in this bill that supports civics and American history \neducation so that beyond reading and math--the tested subjects--\nstudents who graduate from public education have a real understanding \nof what it means to be an American citizen. It means something to be an \nAmerican citizen. They need to understand the trajectory of this \ncountry so that they can fill that role as American citizens better.\n  The bill supports school libraries, which is an issue my senior \nSenator, Jack Reed, has long championed and which I was proud to \nsupport in committee.\n  It includes an initiative I supported that was led by Senator \nMikulski to provide support for gifted and talented students, \nparticularly those who are in high-poverty schools. It can be hard to \nkeep a high-ability child engaged and motivated if they are not \nchallenged. I believe Senator Mikulski's language will be a big help to \nthese kids, their teachers, and their parents.\n  When a school does fall short, the Every Child Achieves Act rejects \nthe overly punitive interventions of the No Child Left Behind Act. \nInstead, it allows communities, parents, and teachers to work together \nto improve their school in ways that make sense for the students and \ngive them the tools to succeed.\n  In my experience, I have learned that the greatest unmet area--at \nleast in Rhode Island--is in middle schools. When I talk to people from \nother States, they see the same thing. Those middle grades are a \ntipping point in the lives of many students, especially those at risk \nof dropping out.\n  When I was Rhode Island's attorney general, I saw hundreds of \njuvenile cases that had a common thread, which was catastrophic levels \nof middle school truancy. In order to get a better handle on what was \nhappening in the middle schools, I adopted one--the Oliver Hazard Perry \nMiddle School in Providence. We worked hard to create a real \nrelationship between the police department and the school. We helped \nget truant kids back in classrooms. We began a mentoring program \nbetween students and the attorneys in my office. We brought in \ncommunity groups to start afterschool programs. We did a lot of \ndifferent things.\n  Those years of working with middle school stakeholders helped me \nrealize how much the middle grades bear on a child's future. It is an \nage when the child is beginning to make his or her own decisions, which \ncan be dangerously bad ones at that time. But they can still be \ninfluenced by positive adults and by enriching experiences in their \nlives.\n  Many students who fail in high school showed the warning signs in \nmiddle school. We need to be reaching back into middle school to help \nthem stay on track. That is why I am so glad to have partnered with our \nfriend Senator Baldwin on a measure that requires States to identify \nand support students at risk of dropping out in middle school and not \nwait until they are in serious trouble in high school.\n  I am also proud that the bill includes key elements of the Community \nPartnerships in Education Act, the House version of which was \nchampioned by my House colleague Congressman David Cicilline.\n  The outstanding success in Rhode Island of the Providence After \nSchool Alliance shows that schools and their students can thrive with \nhelp from strong community partners focused on sustainable and \ncoordinated afterschool learning opportunities. PASA is really a model. \nCommunity-based afterschool has long been underappreciated, and I am \nglad it is on an even basis in this bill with school-based afterschool.\n  The Every Child Achieves Act also makes progress in educating \nstudents who have become involved in the criminal justice system. As \nwith the juvenile justice reauthorization that I am working on with \nChairman Grassley in the Judiciary Committee, this bill tries to break \nthe cycle of troubled kids who enter the juvenile justice system, who \nget marginalized, who fall further behind in their education, leading \nto more trouble and ultimately to crime. This phenomenon is referred to \nas the school-to-prison-pipeline, and it is tragic and it needs to end.\n  I have also seen and heard how Federal, State, and local regulations \ncan get in the way of innovative reforms. Over the last 2 years, I have \nworked closely with Rhode Island educators, who have told me time and \ntime again that they could achieve much better results if not for the \nlayers of professional education bureaucracy stifling innovation at \nmultiple levels.\n  I am working to include an amendment to establish an innovation \nschools demonstration, giving teachers, parents, and school leaders, \nwho have a unique understanding of the students and communities they \nserve, the flexibility to turn those ideas into action.\n  In Rhode Island, I have heard from school leaders who would like to \nextend the school day for struggling students, reboot their curriculum, \ntake ownership over their school's budgeting and financing, or better \nmanage their school's human resources. But they can't because existing \nrules and regulations get in the way. They are often daunting because \nif you try to get after the local regulations, you still have the State \nregulations. If you try to go after the local and the State \nregulations, you still have the Federal regulations. So they give up.\n  My amendment establishes a fast-track process to give public schools \nrelief from barriers to school-level innovation--relief from local, \nState, and Federal regulations.\n  Here is what Victor Capellan, superintendent of the Central Falls, \nRI, School District, told me: ``As a leader, having more flexibility to \ndesign the learning around the needs of my students and teachers and \nwithin the local context that exists--and not based on old and fixed \nconditions--makes all the sense in the world to me.''\n  Overall, the Every Child Achieves Act returns more decisionmaking \nauthority to public schools, gives them tools to help every student \nsucceed, and promotes greater flexibility in achieving high standards.\n  As I prepared at home for this bill, I worked with a lot of Rhode \nIslanders to learn what was needed. I am grateful to the groups who \ngave me so much time. Many of us met over and over to work through \nthese issues and lay the foundation, particularly for the middle school \npart of the bill and for the innovation schools part of the bill. There \nwas a lot of good Rhode Island work that went into those, and I \nappreciate it.\n  I believe this bill responds to the needs and concerns of the many \nRhode Island teachers, reformers, students, school administrators, and \nunion officials I worked with. I am proud to support it.\n  I will close by saying one last thing. There are many issues we deal \nwith where we experience a lot of confrontation. Often we come into a \nsituation thinking we know what the confrontation is. Before we even \nget to it, we anticipate the confrontation. What I learned from sitting \ndown and spending real time with teachers who are in teachers unions, \nwith reformers who are determined to make schools better and able to \ninnovate, administrators who work in public schools and the \nadministrators who work in charter schools, you put them all together \nand they agree on so much of what is in this bill. If you treat people \ninvolved in this system with the respect they deserve individually, and \nif you listen to them, the agreement is far greater than the \ndisagreement.\n\n  I will close where I began. What Chairman Alexander and Ranking \nMember Murray did was to create a process where we could be Senators, \nand as a Senator I was able to bring those voices from Rhode Island \ninto this process in a meaningful way. My ability to bring that voice \nin a meaningful way empowered me to be able to\n\n[[Page S5057]]\n\nbring those voices together back in Rhode Island and find the kind of \nagreement that has enabled these successes, so I am very grateful to \nthem as well.\n  With that comment, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I just want to briefly say a few words \nabout today's Senate passage of S. 1300, the Adoptive Family Relief \nAct. The issue this bill addresses is of particular importance to me, \nand I am proud to be a cosponsor of the legislation.\n  More than 400 American families--approximately 20 of them from \nKentucky--have successfully adopted children from the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo or the DRC. However, due to the DRC Government's \nsuspension of exit permits--which has been in place for close to 2 \nyears now--many of these families have been unable to bring their \nadoptive children home to the United States.\n  For example, although I was pleased to be able to help the Brock \nfamily from Owensboro, KY, with the return of one of their adopted sons \nlast Christmas, their other son still remains in the DRC. To make \nmatters worse, many of these families have been financially burdened by \nthe cost of continually renewing their children's visas while they wait \nfor the day the DRC decides to lift the suspension.\n  In an attempt to help these families, the Adoptive Family Relief Act \nwill provide meaningful financial relief by granting the State \nDepartment the authority to waive the fees for multiple visa renewals \nin this and other extraordinary adoption circumstances.\n  The bill builds on Congress's bipartisan efforts on this adoption \nissue, including a provision in this year's congressional budget \nresolution to encourage a solution to the stalemate in the DRC.\n  I strongly urge the DRC Government to resolve this matter. I truly \nhope there is a solution to it soon, but until then I urge the House \nand President Obama to help us enact the Adoptive Family Relief Act. \nThe passage of this bill through the Senate today will help bring \nneeded assistance to so many loving families across our country who \nwant nothing more than to open their homes to a child in need.\n  I wish to thank the bill's sponsors, Senators Feinstein and Johnson, \nthe 17 other bipartisan cosponsors, and the Judiciary Committee for \ntheir hard work and truly bipartisan commitment to solving this \nheartbreaking issue.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am sorry. I withhold.\n\n[[Page S5058]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/14/senate-section/article/S5058-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5058-S5059]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n              EVERY CHILD ACHIEVES ACT OF 2015--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 10 minutes as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n          5th Anniversary of Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, next Tuesday, July 21, is my wife's \nbirthday, and it is also the 5-year anniversary of the Dodd-Frank Wall \nStreet Reform Act becoming law.\n  Nearly two decades before that, Barings, an international bank, was \ndestroyed by fraud committed by a single one of their traders. In \nreality, there were no profits, unbeknownst to many at the time, just \nbig losses that this trader managed to conceal until the firm \ncollapsed.\n  When writing about his actions later in his memoir, the trader said:\n\n       Luckily for my fraud, there were too many chiefs who would \n     chat about it at arm's length but never go further. And they \n     never dared to ask me any basic questions, since they were \n     afraid of looking stupid about not understanding futures and \n     options.\n\n  This helps illustrate how we got to that financial crisis.\n  Wall Street so often speaks its own language--one most Americans \ncan't understand and one that prevented consumers and taxpayers and \nsometimes even participants from asking questions and from challenging \nWall Street.\n  September 2008 was preceded by a decade of deregulation, after \nfurious lobbying by the financial industry--lobbying buttressed by \nobfuscation and deceit, always underscored by greed. Risky behavior was \nrewarded with gargantuan profits for the firms and multimillion-dollar \nbonuses for the traders and the executives. Questions were not asked. \nPeople often looked the other way. So many were confused and tricked, \nif you will.\n  Regulators didn't do their jobs. Congress was too--putting it \nmildly--bought and sold by Wall Street, and look what happened to the \nAmerican public. Most Americans didn't fully appreciate the connection \nbetween Wall Street and our lives until 2008. That is when the biggest \nbanks' recklessness led to the loss of 9 million jobs. The unemployment \nrate reached 10 percent, 5 million Americans lost their homes, and $13 \ntrillion, with a ``T''--that is 13,000 billion; that is what a trillion \nis, 13,000 billion dollars--in household wealth was erased.\n  My wife and I for 2 years have lived in the city of Cleveland in ZIP \nCode 44105. I mention the ZIP Code because that ZIP Code in 2007, I \nbelieve--it was around that time--that ZIP Code had the highest rate of \nforeclosures of any ZIP Code in the United States of America. It wasn't \nbecause people in Slavic Village, Cleveland, OH, in my neighborhood \nwere trying to game the system. It was not because there were all kinds \nof con men and women in the neighborhood. It was mostly because of job \nloss due to the decline in manufacturing. It was also because firms \nthat were rewarded by turning over homes and fees came into those \ncommunities offering something more than people could really think they \nwould get, and so foreclosure after foreclosure after foreclosure \nhappened.\n  The financial crisis created 9 million people who wanted to work for \na living, contribute to society, and support their families but could \nnot. And behind the millions of foreclosures were 5 million painful \nconversations.\n  Think about this. We in this body talk about numbers, we talk about \nstatistics, we talk about foreclosures, we talk about derivatives, we \ntalk about banks, we talk about fees, we talk about all of this, but \nthink about what a foreclosure means. We don't dress the way we do, \nmaking good salaries and benefits, hanging out more with people of \nmeans rather than people without much means; we don't think a lot about \nwhat a foreclosure might mean to a family. Think about this: A mother \nand father both have sort of middle-income jobs, working-class jobs. \nThey have a daughter who is 12 and a son who is 13. The mother comes \nhome one day and says: I lost my job. The family scrapes things \ntogether, figures they can keep going. Six months later the father \ncomes home and says he lost his job. The kids and the father have a \nconversation.\n  It is pretty clear they are going to have to move out of their house \nbecause they are going to be foreclosed on. They sit down with the son \nand daughter and they try to explain what this is going to mean.\n  The daughter says: What school are we going to go to?\n  The parents say: I don't know. We are going to have to move out of \nthis house and leave our school district.\n  The son says: What happens to our friends?\n  And the parents say: We don't know because we are going to move.\n  Then they have another painful conversation.\n  What happens to our dog?\n  We don't have the money to feed the dog, and in that new apartment we \nare not going to be allowed to have a pet.\n  Think about that. They lose their home and their neighborhood and \ntheir friends. They even have to give away their family pets. They are \ncutting back.\n  These are the stories that aren't really told around here--what \nactually happens to these families when they are foreclosed on. Those \nconversations happened--I don't know how many conversations, but I know \nthere were 5 million homes foreclosed on where conversations took place \nsuch as that night after night after night, as parents explained to \ntheir children what was happening to their way of life. Parents were \nsometimes telling their children, We are going to have to share a house \nwith relatives. Families leaving neighborhoods, leaving schools, \nleaving friends behind, parents trying to find a new home for the \nfamily dog that the child had grown up with since the child was 3 or 4 \nyears old, that is why we passed Wall Street reform.\n  Despite doomsday predictions from the Republicans--almost all of whom \nopposed Dodd-Frank reform, almost all of whom opposed Dodd-Frank \nbecause Wall Street opposed Dodd-Frank reform--despite those \npredictions, it has been a huge success.\n  In 2011, as the law was beginning to be implemented, we heard \nRepublicans running for President, people such as Newt Gingrich, a \nhistorical figure who has, by and large, been forgotten now, who used \nto be the Speaker of the House down the hall, who used to be one of the \nmost powerful people in Washington, who stood toe-to-toe with President \nClinton and shut down the government in the 1990s. He said Dodd-Frank \nwill kill small banks, kill small business, kill the housing industry. \nHe was wrong.\n  Since Dodd-Frank has been implemented over the past 5 years, the \nprivate sector has created 13 million new jobs, household wealth has \ngrown by $13 trillion, exceeding precrisis levels, and business lending \nhas climbed 30 percent. Wall Street reform didn't ruin the economy, \nWall Street reform stabilized and strengthened it.\n  Polling that Americans for Financial Reform released last week shows \nthat Americans agree with this assessment. They overwhelmingly support \nstrong financial regulations and they overwhelmingly support the goals \nof the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n  But this month--and for the rest of the year--we have seen \nRepublicans try to undermine Wall Street reform, try to do the bidding \nof Wall Street itself, and try to do all they can to weaken the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau. We have seen it in the Budget \nCommittee and in the Agriculture Committee and in the Banking Committee \nand in the appropriations process.\n  Last week, in the Senate Banking Committee, Republicans held another \nhearing with representatives from the financial industry advocating for \nlegislation to undermine parts of Dodd-Frank. Week after week, it \nseems, we hear from people who come in front of the Banking Committee--\npeople who seem oblivious to the fact that Wall Street caused this \ndamage to our society, people doing the bidding for Wall Street banks, \npeople who have excused the greed and the overreach of Wall Street and \nwhat Wall Street has done to the men and women, done to children, done \nto families, done to neighborhoods in our society.\n  My ZIP Code is doing better than it was, but we can still see the \nruin and\n\n[[Page S5059]]\n\nthe devastation brought to ZIP Code 44105, in part, because of Wall \nStreet greed. We can see it all over this country.\n  Tomorrow, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Rich Cordray, \nwho I can proudly say is from my State of Ohio, will testify again in \nCongress. This will mark his 54th appearance--either him or someone \nelse from the CFPB. As Republicans claim, the CFPB is unaccountable to \nCongress--hauled in front of Congress one, two, three, four-plus dozen \ntimes, and they still say it is unaccountable. Figure that out. It is \nall about the politics. Again, they are doing Wall Street's bidding.\n  This past weekend, two Republican Commissioners on the Securities and \nExchange Commission and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission--\nagencies whose job it is to police Wall Street, to prevent another \ncrisis--these two Republican Commissioners wrote an op-ed denouncing \nregulation. They wrote: ``One of the greatest potential risks to the \nfinancial markets is the work of the regulators themselves.'' They are \nnot saying regulators should have been tougher on Wall Street. They are \nsaying these regulators are overreaching and not doing what they \nshould. In fact, these regulations shouldn't have existed many times. \nThis is the attitude we are up against. We know they will keep fighting \nto tear down this law just as hard as they fought to keep it from \npassing.\n\n  Now, when Dodd-Frank was passed back in July 5 years ago, in 2010, \nPresident Obama signed the bill only a few hours later. The chief \nlobbyist for the top financial services, the top lobbyist in \nWashington, proclaimed: ``Now it's halftime.'' What did he mean by \n``now it's halftime''? It was that, Wall Street lost that battle in \nCongress on Dodd-Frank, and now it was time to turn to the agencies and \nto try to weaken, obfuscate, blunt these rules, delay, and do whatever \nthey could. There were 3,000 lobbyists during the Dodd-Frank act--6 \nlobbyists for every Member of Congress. Even then they couldn't win \nbecause enough of us here had the guts to stand up to Wall Street and \ndo the right thing. Many of those 3,000 lobbyists are back.\n  In 2012, lobbyists for banks outnumbered consumer protection \nadvocates 20 to 1--1 consumer advocate to 20 bank lobbyists spending \nhundreds of millions of dollars trying to weaken the law. We must stand \nfirm. We must push back on efforts that roll back the reforms. We \nshould stand up for the CFPB. Nobody is arguing that we can't improve \nand strengthen Dodd-Frank. We want to do that. But if improve and \nstrengthen means doing Wall Street bidding, that is not what improve \nand strengthen should mean.\n  There are enormous challenges we have to tackle. Today's typical \nAmerican consumer obviously has no union to demand a defined pension or \na fair wage and no dependable retirement savings account. The average \nborrower has left college with a diploma and $33,000 in student loan \ndebt. Nearly 60 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds now live with their \nparents, largely due to staggering student loan debt and stagnant \nwages. Five million Americans have mortgages that are under water, \nmeaning they owe more than the house is worth, which represents nearly \n$350 billion of negative equity. That means if you total up all of the \ndebt of those 5 million Americans--how much they owe on their homes--\nand subtract what their homes are worth, it would amount to $350 \nbillion of negative equity.\n  One in five Americans has an error on her credit report that might \nprevent her from accessing a traditional banking system. It is not due \nto a mistake they made, but they have an error on their credit report \nthat they, for whatever reason, have not been able to fix. One in three \nAmerican adults has debt in collections, the majority of which is \nmedical debt. Fifty-seven percent of Americans say they are not \nfinancially prepared for the unexpected. A financial crisis only makes \nthese trends worse.\n  Where do we go? Some sectors of our economy have done better than \nothers. When times are good, we return to discussions about regulatory \nrelief, which I support, for small banks and credit unions. I think we \nneed to make some changes in the midsized regional banks, such as the \nHuntington in Columbus or the Fifth Third Bank in Cincinnati, to help \nmake them competitive, particularly with the large banks.\n  What about relief for the average American? All of us in this body \nneed to broaden our focus beyond so-called regulatory relief. The \nanswer to everything, according to my friends on the other side of the \naisle, is to cut taxes on the rich and deregulate and weaken consumer \nlaws, weaken safe drinking water laws, weaken clean air laws, and \nweaken Dodd-Frank laws. That is their answer to everything.\n  What about relief for average Americans? What about increasing the \nminimum wage? What about helping Americans who are making $30,000 or \n$40,000 but are denied overtime because they have been put in a salary \nor management category even though they are only making $30,000? They \nmay be running the night shift at a fast-food restaurant and have been \nclassified as bosses so as salaried workers, they don't get overtime \neven if they are working 60 hours a week. How about relief for that \naverage American?\n  How about relief for Americans who don't have sick leave and go to \nwork when they are sick and take the chance of infecting somebody else, \nbecause if they stay home, they will not receive any pay?\n  How about if their child is sick? Do they send their child to school, \nbecause they can't take a day off because they don't get a personal \nleave day to take care of their child? So their child may end up going \nto school, doesn't do as well and may get other children sick, which \nmeans less productive students or less productive workers if the parent \nends up going to work sick--all of those things. Why don't we have \nrelief for working-class and middle-class families--minimum wage, \novertime pay when they have earned it and help those families get the \nkind of sick pay and sick leave as the people who work here have who \ndress up and are well paid and have the advantage of working in the \nSenate? Why are we not doing that?\n  We shouldn't be afraid to ask questions that will lead to the reforms \nwe need. We shouldn't be afraid to challenge the status quo, and we \nshould never be afraid to make Wall Street accountable.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/14/senate-section/article/S5059-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5059]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nMORNING BUSINESS\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/14/senate-section/article/S5059-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5059]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n Mr. NELSON.

Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to Joseph Robinette \n``Beau'' Biden III. Beau was a husband, father, son, brother, veteran, \nand friend, who lived a life of service, devoted to his family and his \ncountry. For Beau Biden, family was the center of his life: his father, \nour Vice President, and Dr. Jill Biden, his brother Hunter, his sister \nAshley, and especially his wife Hallie and their children, Natalie and \nHunter. Beau Biden's family and my family have been connected as \nfriends, neighbors, and political allies for two generations. Like Vice \nPresident Biden, Beau was committed to duty, had great political \nskills, and lived his daily life with joy.\n  Inscribed on the front of the Finance Building in Harrisburg, PA, is \nthe following quotation: ``All public service is a trust, given in \nfaith and accepted in honor.'' As a soldier and a public official in \nDelaware, Beau Biden's work was a testament to that inscription. He \naccepted the trust he was given by serving with honor and distinction. \nBeau Biden served in the Delaware Army National Guard as a major in the \nJudge Advocate General, JAG Corps, which included a tour in Iraq. \nGrowing up with a father who was a United States Senator, Beau Biden \ncould have\n\n[[Page S5060]]\n\ntaken an easy road to elected office, but that was not his way. He \nwanted to earn the trust of the people. He turned down an appointment \nas attorney general of Delaware, preferring to run for the position on \nhis own. He won and served two terms as a faithful public servant. He \nwas on track to become the next Governor of Delaware when his life was \ntragically cut short.\n  As attorney general, Beau Biden fought every day to protect children. \nAlbert Camus once said: ``Perhaps we cannot prevent this world from \nbeing a world in which children are tortured. But we can reduce the \nnumber of tortured children. And if you don't help us, who else in the \nworld can help us do this?'' Beau Biden answered that call. He said \nkeeping children safe is why he wanted to be the attorney general of \nDelaware, and during his years in that position, he prosecuted child \npredators and worked to protect children from sexual abuse. In a column \nin the Wilmington News Journal, he wrote, ``As adults, we have a legal \nand moral obligation to stand up and speak out for children who are \nbeing abused--they cannot speak for themselves.'' It is fitting that \nhis family established the Beau Biden Foundation for the Protection of \nChildren to continue his fight.\n  At times like this, people often think about what could have been. A \ndecade after Robert F. Kennedy died, Allard Lowenstein wrote an article \nentitled ``Anniversary of an Assassination.'' In it he wrote, ``And \nanybody who finds himself wishing on this occasion that Robert Kennedy \nwere around knows what Robert Kennedy would be saying if he were here--\nknows that we have dallied long enough, and that it is past time to try \nagain to do better, to make a difference; past time to dream again of \nthings as they ought to be, and ask again why they are not.'' Beau \nBiden would not only want us to do the same thing, he would expect us \nto. He would be telling us to keep up the fight to protect children. He \nwould be reminding us about the honor of public service, and he would \nbe encouraging us to go out and serve our communities and our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/14/senate-section/article/S5060-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5060]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          RECOGNIZING THE HERO CAMPAIGN FOR DESIGNATED DRIVERS\n\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, each year, tens of thousands of lives are \nlost and millions more are injured in collisions on our Nation's \nhighways. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration, about 40 percent of all traffic fatalities involve \nalcohol. This preventable behavior continues to impose a terrible toll \non our families and our Nation.\n  To eradicate drunk driving from our roads, we must change our \nNation's culture around stepping behind the wheel after consuming \nalcohol. A major way to enact this change is to encourage and celebrate \nthe role of designated drivers--those who make a commitment to remain \nsober to ensure that the passengers in their vehicle return home safely \nat the end of the night.\n  For this reason, I rise today to honor the 15th anniversary of the \nHERO Campaign, which works to create partnerships that encourage and \nsupport designated drivers.\n  The HERO Campaign was created in memory of U.S. Navy ENS John \nElliott, a New Jersey resident and a graduate of the U.S. Naval \nAcademy. Ensign Elliott was an outstanding citizen and Naval cadet. In \neach of his 4 years at Annapolis, Elliott was selected by his peers to \nserve as a human education resource officer, or HERO, to mentor fellow \nmembers of his company. At graduation, Elliott was honored as the \noutstanding HERO in his class.\n  On July 22, 2000, Ensign Elliott was driving to his home in Egg \nHarbor Township, NJ with his girlfriend when his vehicle was struck by \nan oncoming vehicle that crossed into his lane. The driver of that \nvehicle was operating under the influence of alcohol. Along with Ensign \nElliott, that driver was killed in the collision.\n  Shortly after Ensign Elliott's life came to its untimely end, his \nparents, Bill and Muriel Elliott, started the HERO Campaign. The HERO \nCampaign is a non-profit organization that brings together schools, \nprofessional sports teams, law enforcement, taverns and restaurants, \nand community groups to recognize and encourage designated drivers.\n  Since its inception, the HERO Campaign has registered more than \n100,000 designated drivers at sports stadiums, concerts, schools, and \ncolleges in 7 States. In New Jersey, the HERO Campaign contributed to a \n35.4 percent decline in alcohol-related driving fatalities in the \ngeneral population and a 65.1 percent decline for those under 21 years \nof age. Truly, the accomplishments of the HERO Campaign are nothing \nless than heroic.\n  But their work is not done yet. The ultimate goal of the HERO \nCampaign is to register one million designated drivers across our \nNation, and to ensure that having a designated driver before stepping \nout for the night becomes as automatic as putting on a seatbelt when \ngetting into the car. As Bill Elliott says, the message is simple: \n``Who's your HERO tonight?''\n  I can safely say that, to me, Bill and Muriel Elliott and their \ncolleagues at the HERO Campaign are my heroes this and every night. I \ncommend their accomplishments and support their efforts to save lives \nby helping others realize their heroic potential as designated drivers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/14/senate-section/article/S5060-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5060]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    TRIBUTE TO BISHOP PAUL S. MORTON\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I wish to honor Bishop Paul S. \nMorton. Bishop Morton was born in Windsor, Ontario, where he graduated \nfrom J.C. Patterson Collegiate Institute and St. Clair College. Despite \nhis northern roots, Bishop Morton was called to New Orleans, LA, in \n1972 to preach and spread the Gospel of the Lord. The Greater St. \nStephen Missionary Baptist Church was Morton's first home, where he was \ninstalled as senior pastor in January 1975. Under the pastor's \nleadership, the congregation grew dramatically, resulting in the need \nto expand to a 2,000 seat sanctuary in 1980 and a 4,000 seat sanctuary \nin 1988. In 1991, Greater St. Stephen Missionary Baptist Church became \nGreater St. Stephen Full Gospel Baptist Church which preaches of the \nmanifestation of miracles, healings, and gifts of the Holy Spirit.\n  With his unique leadership skills and his care for the community, \nGreater St. Stephen Full Gospel Baptist Church grew from 647 members to \nmore than 20,000 members requiring 3 locations in the Greater New \nOrleans area. In addition to this great local accomplishment, Bishop \nMorton is also the senior pastor of Changing a Generation Full Gospel \nChurch in Atlanta, GA, as well as the founding presiding bishop of the \nFull Gospel Baptist Church Fellowship International. The Full Gospel \nBaptist Church Fellowship represents thousands of church leaders and \ncongregations around the world and focuses on cultivating positive \nvalues such as sustainability, holiness, innovation, family, and \ntranscendence.\n  Bishop Paul S. Morton's dedication to his congregation is seen in the \nservices he provides to the community. In 1997, the Greater St. Stephen \nministry purchased a former naval base and converted it into affordable \nhousing for more than 125 families in the New Orleans area. In addition \nto being an accomplished Gospel singer, the bishop hosts ``Changing a \nGeneration,'' a daily radio show and weekly TV broadcast with the goal \nof changing the way people view going to church. Bishop Morton also \nserves as president of the Paul S. Morton, Sr. Scholarship Foundation \nand president of the Paul S. Morton Bible College and School of \nMinistry.\n  I am honored to share the accomplished career of Bishop Paul S. \nMorton, and I thank him for his services to the State of \nLouisiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/14/senate-section/article/S5060-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5060-S5061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:14 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 179.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Syrian War Crimes \n     Accountability Act of 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) March 2015 marks the fourth year of the ongoing \n     conflict in Syria.\n       (2) On December 17, 2014, the United Nations Security \n     Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2191 ``expressing \n     outrage at the unacceptable and escalating level of violence \n     and the killing of more than 191,000 people, including well \n     over 10,000 children'' and approximately 1,000,000 injured in \n     Syria.\n       (3) More than half of Syria's population is displaced as of \n     March 2015, with more than 7,600,000 internally displaced and \n     more than 3,700,000 refugees in neighboring countries.\n       (4) On February 19, 2015, United Nations Secretary-General \n     Ban Ki-moon reported to the Security Council that ``parties \n     to the conflict are failing to live up to their international \n     legal obligations to protect civilians'' and called for \n     action to ensure the unfettered delivery of humanitarian \n     relief, an end to the use of denial of services as a weapon \n     of war, and a response to ``the relentless and indiscriminate \n     attacks on civilians, including through the use of barrel \n     bombs''.\n       (5) On February 27, 2014, the Department of State issued \n     its 2013 Human Rights Report on Syria, which described \n     President Bashar al Assad's use of ``indiscriminate and \n     deadly force'' in the conflict, including the August 21, \n     2013, use of ``sarin gas and artillery to target East Ghouta \n     and Moadamiya al-Sham, suburbs of Damascus, which killed over \n     1,000 people''.\n       (6) The 2014 United States Commission on International \n     Religious Freedom Annual Report states that in Syria \n     ``terrorist organizations espouse violence and the creation \n     of an Islamic state with no space for religious diversity and \n     have carried out religiously-motivated attacks and massacres \n     against Alawite, Shi'a and Christian civilians.''\n       (7) On February 4, 2015, the Executive Council of the \n     Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) \n     adopted a decision expressing serious concern about the \n     findings ``with a high degree of confidence'' of an OPCW \n     fact-finding mission\n\n[[Page S5089]]\n\n     that chlorine had been used as a weapon in some areas of \n     Syria in 2014 and calling for those individuals responsible \n     to be held accountable.\n       (8) The United Nations Independent International Commission \n     of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic reports that pro-\n     government forces have conducted attacks on Syrian civilian \n     populations, and have utilized murder, torture, assault, and \n     rape as war tactics. Anti-government groups have also \n     committed murder and torture, engaged in hostage-taking, \n     attacked protected objects, and shelled civilian \n     neighborhoods. The Commission's February 2015 report states \n     that Syria's civil war ``has been characterized by massive, \n     recurrent violations of human rights and international \n     humanitarian law that demand urgent international and \n     national action''.\n       (9) On March 12, 2015, Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) \n     reported that since 2011, at least 610 medical personnel have \n     been killed and there have been 233 deliberate or \n     indiscriminate attacks on 183 medical facilities in Syria. \n     The Physicians for Human Rights report cited evidence that \n     the Government of Syria committed 88 percent of the recorded \n     hospital attacks and 97 percent of medical personnel \n     killings, and ``has targeted health care and increasingly \n     used it as a weapon of war to destroy its opponents by \n     preventing care, killing thousands of civilians along the \n     way''.\n       (10) Internationally accepted rules of war require actors \n     to distinguish between civilians and combatants and that all \n     parties are obligated to respect and protect the wounded and \n     sick and to take care all reasonable measures to provide safe \n     and prompt access for the wounded and sick to medical care.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       Congress--\n       (1) strongly condemns the ongoing violence, use of chemical \n     weapons, targeting of civilian populations with barrel, \n     incendiary, and cluster bombs and SCUD missiles, and \n     systematic gross human rights violations carried out by \n     Government of Syria and pro-government forces under the \n     direction of President Bashar al-Assad, as well as all abuses \n     committed by violent extremist groups and other combatants \n     involved in the civil war in Syria;\n       (2) expresses its support for the people of Syria seeking \n     democratic change;\n       (3) urges all parties to the conflict to immediately halt \n     indiscriminate attacks on civilians, allow for the delivery \n     of humanitarian and medical assistance, and end sieges of \n     civilian populations;\n       (4) calls on the President to support efforts in Syria and \n     on the part of the international community to ensure \n     accountability for war crimes and crimes against humanity \n     committed during the conflict; and\n       (5) supports the requirement in United Nations Security \n     Council Resolutions 2191, 2165 and 2139 for regular reporting \n     by the Secretary-General on implementation on the \n     resolutions, including of paragraph 2 of resolution 2139, \n     which demands that all parties desist from violations of \n     international humanitarian law and violations and abuses of \n     human rights and calls on the Security Council to establish a \n     committee to investigate past and ongoing gross violations of \n     human rights and war crimes in the Syrian conflict.\n\n     SEC. 4. REPORT ON ACCOUNTABILITY FOR WAR CRIMES AND CRIMES \n                   AGAINST HUMANITY IN SYRIA.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, and again not later than 180 days \n     after the cessation of violence in Syria, the Secretary of \n     State shall submit to the appropriate congressional \n     committees a report on war crimes and crimes against humanity \n     in Syria.\n       (b) Elements.--The report required under subsection (a) \n     shall include the following elements:\n       (1) A description of violations of internationally \n     recognized human rights, war crimes, and crimes against \n     humanity perpetrated during the civil war in Syria, \n     including--\n       (A) an account of incidents that may constitute war crimes \n     and crimes against humanity committed by the regime of \n     President Bashar al-Assad and all forces fighting on its \n     behalf;\n       (B) an account of incidents that may constitute war crimes \n     and crimes against humanity committed by violent extremist \n     groups, anti-government forces, and any other combatants in \n     the conflict;\n       (C) a description of any incidents that may violate the \n     principle of medical neutrality and, when possible, an \n     identification of the individual or individuals who engaged \n     in or organized such violations; and\n       (D) where possible, a description of the conventional and \n     unconventional weapons used for such crimes and, the origins \n     of the weapons.\n       (2) A description of efforts by the Department of State and \n     the United States Agency for International Development to \n     ensure accountability for violations of internationally \n     recognized human rights, international humanitarian law, and \n     crimes against humanity perpetrated against the people of \n     Syria by the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, violent \n     extremist groups, and other combatants involved in the \n     conflict, including--\n       (A) a description of initiatives that the United States \n     Government has undertaken to train investigators in Syria on \n     how to document, investigate, and develop findings of war \n     crimes, including the number of United States Government or \n     contract personnel currently designated to work full-time on \n     these issues and an identification of the authorities and \n     appropriations being used to support training efforts;\n       (B) a description and assessment of Syrian and \n     international efforts to ensure accountability for crimes \n     committed during the Syrian conflict, including efforts to \n     promote a transitional justice process that would include \n     criminal accountability and the establishment of an ad hoc \n     tribunal to prosecute the perpetrators of war crimes \n     committed during the civil war in Syria; and\n       (C) an assessment of the influence of accountability \n     measures on efforts to reach a negotiated settlement to the \n     conflict during the reporting period.\n       (c) Form.--The report required under subsection (a) may be \n     in unclassified or classified form, but shall include a \n     publicly available annex.\n       (d) Appropriate Congressional Committee Defined.--In this \n     section, the term ``appropriate congressional committees'' \n     means--\n       (1) the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate; and\n       (2) the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of \n     Representatives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/14/senate-section/article/S5089-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5089-S5090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NEED-BASED EDUCATIONAL AID ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

EXTENSION RELATING TO THE APPLICATION OF THE \n                   ANTRITRUST LAWS TO THE AWARD OF NEED-BASED \n                   EDUCATIONAL AID.\n\n       Section 568 of the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994 \n     (15 U.S.C. 1 note) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)--\n       (A) in paragraph (2), by inserting ``or'' after the \n     semicolon;\n       (B) in paragraph (3), by striking ``; or'' and inserting a \n     period at the end; and\n       (C) by striking paragraph (4); and\n       (2) in subsection (d), by striking ``2015'' and inserting \n     ``2022''.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate has passed the bipartisan \nNeed-Based Educational Aid Act of 2015, which will extend for another 7 \nyears the anti-trust exemption permitting colleges and universities to \ncollaborate on issues of need-based financial aid. I worked on this \nlegislation with Senators Grassley and Lee. Together we crafted an \napproach to reauthorize this exemption which earned the unanimous \nsupport of the Judiciary Committee just last week. This anti-trust \nexemption allows colleges and universities that admit students on a \nneed-blind basis to collaborate on the formula used to determine how \nmuch families can pay for college. Without congressional action, this \nexemption will expire at the end of September.\n  Congress first enacted this exemption in 1994 and this will be the \nthird time we have acted to reauthorize it. It is important for \nCongress to carefully review anti-trust exemptions to ensure that they \ncontinue to serve the public interest. In this case, our review led us \nto conclude that one particular provision should sunset because it has \nnever been used by colleges and universities. The need for this slight \nmodification underscores why I am skeptical of permanent anti-trust \nexemptions. Requiring those who benefit from exemptions to the anti-\ntrust laws to come to Congress and justify renewal ensures that they do \nnot become a blank check for anti-competitive behavior.\n  I would contrast the limited renewal the Senate has passed today with \nthe McCarran-Ferguson Act, a permanent anti-trust exemption that the \ninsurance industry has enjoyed since 1945. I\n\n[[Page S5090]]\n\nhave worked for years on a bipartisan basis to repeal that law \nprecisely because marketplace conditions can change significantly over \na 7-year period, not to mention the 70 years since McCarran-Ferguson \nwas enacted. We should learn from our experience with today's bill.\n  Our bipartisan and bicameral bill serves an important goal--allowing \ncovered universities to focus their resources on ensuring the most \nqualified students can attend some of the best schools in the country, \nregardless of income. I am proud that Middlebury College in Vermont is \none of those covered schools. I also appreciate the efforts of the \nbill's sponsors in the House, Congressmen Smith and Johnson. I urge the \nHouse to pass our bipartisan bill this week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/14/senate-section/article/S5090-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           WORLD REFUGEE DAY\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

So far, we have considered 22 on the floor \nand adopted--well, we have adopted 22 on the floor.\n  Senator Murray--the ranking member--and I have agreed to another \ncouple of dozen amendments from both sides of the aisle; more of them \nare Democratic than Republican. We are prepared to recommend them to \nthe Senate for adoption by unanimous consent. There are another two \ndozen amendments; more of them are Democratic than Republican, \nincluding several which are important to the Democratic side--the \naccountability amendment, for example; the early childhood amendment, \nfor example--which I think deserve a vote. I don't support them, but I \nthink they deserve a vote. We are prepared to recommend that the Senate \nconsider them. If we were to do that, we could finish the bill.\n  We have one remaining issue. It is an impasse over a formula funding \nquestion, which State gets more money from title I. That is always very \ndifficult. The disputants are two of the most distinguished Members of \nthe Senate. I am confident that they see the larger picture, which is \nthat most Americans expect us to finish this bill and most Senators \nwould expect us to be able to vote on the nearly 50 amendments that I \njust described.\n  So my hope is that we can come to some agreement; that tomorrow \nmorning even before the cloture vote is scheduled we announce that \nagreement and we proceed to adopt by unanimous consent the amendments \nthat remain to be adopted and then we vote on the amendments that \nremain to be voted on, all of which would permit us to finish the bill \non Thursday.\n  So I thank Senators for that. I continue to ask for cooperation. I \nthink an excellent example of that cooperation was the Senator from \nMinnesota, Mr. Franken, who withheld his amendment in committee and \noffered it on the floor in order to make sure the bill passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/14/senate-section/article/S5090-4", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, JULY 15, 2015\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.
