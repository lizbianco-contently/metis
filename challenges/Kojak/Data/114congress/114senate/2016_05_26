God, give our leaders direction and guidance. I ask You to unify \nthe hearts of the men and women serving in this body, for unity is \nwhere You commanded the blessing. May every Member remember the goal is \nmore important than any role, and our Lord teaches us that the greatest \nof all is the one who serves, and anyone can be great because anyone \ncan serve.\n  We pray this prayer, respecting all faiths, but we pray this prayer \nin the Name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.\n  Until You come, we pray. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/senate-section/article/S3231-2"}, {"day": "26", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  The President pro tempore led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:\n\n       I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of \n     America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation \n     under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heller).

Mr. President, I want to take just a moment today to \nrecognize Dr. Benny Tate of Rock Springs Church in Milner, GA, for \nbeing here with us to deliver this morning's opening prayer.\n  Benny is my personal pastor, my dear friend, and inspiration for both \nmy wife and me. He offered us constant prayer and support as I entered \nthis political journey and continues to do so today.\n  Before I was sworn in to the Senate, we joined Benny on a personal \nmission trip to Haiti. It was a life-changing trip. We went to a \ncommunity that had been stricken by the earthquake in 2010. We saw kids \nwho were still sleeping and eating on the ground in tents. Yet we saw \nhope, and that is hope I will carry with me the rest of my life because \nof this man, Benny Tate.\n  Thank you, Brother Benny, for your faith, your life, and your \nservice.

Mr. President, here is the headline too many \nKentuckians had to wake up to this morning: ``Health insurance rate \nhike requests average 17 percent in [my home State].''\n  The story noted that these double-digit premium increases continue a \nnational trend of hefty hikes as insurers adapt to a market reshaped by \nPresident Obama's signature health care law--in other words, more \nunaffordable premium increases, thanks to ObamaCare.\n  It was unfortunate to hear some of ObamaCare's defenders try to \npretend otherwise and blame these rates on something like uncertainty \nover Kynect's future. As the story notes, ``the only company that will \noffer plans statewide on the exchange next year said the requested rate \nincrease has nothing to do with the end of Kynect.'' Yesterday I shared \nstories from Kentuckians who continue to suffer under this law.\n  Thanks to what we learned last night, I am afraid we will be hearing \neven more. ObamaCare's defenders need to own up to what their partisan \nlaw is doing to the middle class and not waste another moment trying to \ndeflect attention elsewhere. They need to work with us to relieve the \npain of ObamaCare and start over with real care.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/senate-section/article/S3231-6"}, {"day": "26", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3231-S3232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the men and women who sign up to defend \nour Nation don't ask for much, but our Nation certainly asks a lot of \nthem. They sacrifice on our behalf every day. They deserve the kind of \nsupport that the National Defense Authorization Act before us can \nprovide. It will honor commitments to veterans, servicemembers, and \ntheir families. It will authorize raises, support Wounded Warriors, and \nimprove military benefits and health care. We need to pass it. The \nDemocratic leader needs to stop preventing us from doing so.\n  Yesterday in his opening remarks, he claimed he was holding up the \nbill because he hadn't had the chance to read it--then talked about a \nnew book he is reading.\n  Today in his opening remarks he will surely make more excuses for \nDemocrats not to do their jobs--then head to a press conference titled \n``Do Your Job.''\n  You can't make this stuff up. But it is not funny.\n  Look, we get it. Democrats want to run TV ads claiming the Senate \ncan't\n\n[[Page S3232]]\n\nget anything done. They know that is a really tough sell. They know the \nonly chance to make it work is by slow-walking bills they actually \nsupport.\n  Democrats don't actually want to be on record opposing our troops \nbefore Memorial Day, so they support the bill in public then bog it \ndown in private and cover with one embarrassing excuse after the next: \nWe haven't read it. It was written in secret. The dog ate it. It is \njust embarrassing.\n  As the chairman of the Armed Services Committee said, ``We need to \nmove forward with this legislation. We need to move forward with it \nnow, for the sake of our men and women who are serving and defending \nthis Nation and putting their lives on the line.'' He is right.\n  So here is an idea. How about Democrats skip talking about doing \ntheir jobs at a press conference and actually do their jobs instead? \nThey can follow the lead of this Republican majority--a majority that \ncontinues to do its job--and show how important things can be \naccomplished for the American people as a result. So no more needless \ndelays, no more embarrassing excuses, and no more blocking benefits for \nthe men and women of our military. Let's work together to get this \ndone. We have already seen what is possible in the Republican-led \nSenate when we do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/senate-section/article/S3231-7"}, {"day": "26", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE REPUBLICAN-LED SENATE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, so much has changed since the American \npeople elected a new Republican majority to get the Senate back to \nwork. Americans have told us to break through the gridlock and get the \nSenate focused on real solutions again. We have, and we are.\n  This doesn't mean our colleagues across the aisle will always \ncooperate; we have certainly seen an unfortunate example of that this \nparticular week. But what is clear is how the underlying fundamentals \nhave changed: Committees are now functioning; legislative processes are \nnow working; we now continue to get important things done for the \npeople who sent us here.\n  It all started with a simple philosophy: Give Senators and the people \nthey represent more of a say in the legislative process, and they will \ntake more of a stake in the legislative outcome, regardless of party. \nSo we did, and the results have been encouraging. This is how we have \nbeen able to transform gridlock into progress and dysfunction into \nsolutions.\n  To give an example of what I mean, we recently took as many rollcall \nvotes on one bill, the Energy Policy Modernization Act, as the Senate \ntook in all--all--of 2014 under the previous majority. It is remarkable \nhow far we have come in such a short time.\n  Consider what we were able to achieve for our constituents in 2015 \nalone. Some said Congress could never break old traditions of short-\nterm fixes and patches and punts, but we repeatedly proved them wrong \nwith meaningful and substantial reforms instead.\n  That is certainly true of the new education reform law we passed. It \nreplaced No Child Left Behind with ``the largest devolution of federal \ncontrol to the states in a quarter-century.'' It is a hugely important \nreform that empowers parents and prevents Washington from imposing \nCommon Core. That is a notable conservative achievement.\n  The same could be said of the decisive action we took to enact \npermanent tax relief for families and small businesses or to bring an \nend to a job-killing energy embargo from the 1970s or to place on \nPresident Obama's desk a bill that would finally end ObamaCare's cycle \nof broken promises and pain for the middle class.\n  We secured pay raises for our troops, help for our veterans, and hope \nfor the victims of human trafficking. We passed a landmark cyber \nsecurity law that will help safeguard America's personal information. \nWe achieved the most significant transportation solution in years, one \nthat will finally allow us to rebuild roads, bridges, and crumbling \ninfrastructure without raising taxes by a penny.\n  We got a lot done for the American people in 2015. We are continuing \nto get a lot done for the American people in 2016.\n  In just a few months, the Republican-led Senate has passed \nlegislation providing real solutions on a range of issues: Addressing \nthe prescription opioid and heroin epidemic that is ravaging our \ncountry with critical, comprehensive legislation; modernizing American \nenergy with the first broad energy bill since the Bush administration; \nimproving airport security and consumer protections with the most pro-\npassenger, pro-security FAA reauthorization in years; deterring North \nKorea's growing aggression with comprehensive sanctions; keeping the \nInternet open and accessible by permanently banning government from \ntaxing your access to the Internet; supporting American manufacturing \nby reducing tariffs that make it harder for American businesses to \ncompete and to grow; defending American innovation and entrepreneurship \nprotections against the theft of intellectual property; and just this \nweek, combating sexual assault and human trafficking with new \nprotections for victims and enhanced tools for law enforcement.\n  These are just some of the things we have been able to accomplish the \npast few months alone. But we are not finished. None of this would have \nbeen possible without functioning committees and capable leaders to \nguide them. Those chairs often choose to focus on ideas where \nRepublicans and Democrats can agree, not just where the two parties \ndisagree, and we have gotten some really important legislation passed \nas a result.\n  We have seen some truly notable anecdotes, too, like the fact that \nthe Finance Committee has approved more bills to date in the 114th \nCongress ``than any single Congress since 1980''; like the fact that we \ngot the appropriations process started this year at the earliest point \nin the modern budgeting era--in other words, in about 40 years; like \nthe fact that we passed the first of these three appropriations bills \nat the earliest point in the modern budgeting era as well.\n  It is good to see the appropriations process finally getting back on \ntrack after so many years of dysfunction. It is incredibly important \nfor the Senate, it is definitely healthy for the democratic process, \nand it will certainly allow us to address a variety of funding issues \nin a more thoughtful and deliberative way.\n  Take Zika, for instance. Combating the spread of the Zika virus has \nbeen a priority for both parties, so Republicans and Democrats \ndeliberated and forged a compromise in committee. Senators debated that \ncompromise out here on the floor and voted to pass it. Now Members of \nthe Senate and the House are preparing the process of going to \nconference so we can get this measure down to the President. That is \nhow you get good legislation to the President. That is what is known as \ndoing your job around here.\n  Of course, it will not be easy to get the appropriations process back \non track completely after so many years of dysfunction, but we are \ncommitted to doing all we can. We have clearly demonstrated strong and \nsteady progress already, and that is something that benefits both \nparties. It means more Members get a say. It means more scrutiny is \nbrought to bear on the funds that are spent. It means more regular \norder and more of a Senate that functions even better for everyone.\n  I am proud of all we have accomplished in such a short time. We have \nput the Senate back to work, we have continued to get our jobs done, \nand that has allowed us to pass important legislation for the American \npeople who, after all, sent us all here.\n  I thank Senators from both sides who have worked with us to restore \nthis Chamber to a place of higher purpose. I know there is more we can \naccomplish together, so let's keep working to ensure that we do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/senate-section/article/S3232-1"}, {"day": "26", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is not necessary to go into great detail \nabout the past, but it is important to talk about the past so we \nunderstand what is going on now and what the future holds.\n  The biggest change coming from the Republican majority is what the \nDemocratic minority has done. We have cooperated. We are not in the \nbusiness of\n\n[[Page S3233]]\n\nfilibustering everything. During the first 6 years of the Obama \nadministration, the Republicans initiated more than 600 filibusters. \nThey filibustered everything. As an example, we tried to do the Energy \nbill for 5 years. Each time we tried, it was brought to a standstill by \nthe Republicans.\n\n  We have a Republican bill that we worked on. It is the same bill we \ndid with Senator Shaheen in the past with some additions to it. What \nhappened to that bill is that it has gone to the dark hole in the \nHouse. They have stripped everything out of it that we had done. It is \ngone. We have done our utmost to cooperate.\n  For my friend to talk about this Republican Senate that has done so \nmuch, he would have tremendous difficulty finding any one thing that we \ndidn't try to do--any one thing. I talked about energy. It doesn't \nmatter what it was, it was filibustered--I repeat--more than 600 times. \nThe record will never be broken, I hope, as it has been a real \ndetriment to our country and the U.S. Senate. For my friend to come and \ntalk about how great the Senate is, is really absurd.\n  I don't know if he is taking the pages from Donald Trump--if you say \nenough that is wrong, people will say: Well, maybe it is not that bad. \nThis Republican Senate is a do-nothing Senate. He talked about opioid \nlegislation. There isn't anyone--not anyone from the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, any of the public health agencies \naround the country--who thinks what happened in the Senate helped them. \nWhy? Because there is no money. They shuffled things around. There is \nno money. Opioid legislation needs money. They have refused to fund it.\n  I don't know how long it has been, but it has been at least 4 months \nsince the people of Flint, MI, came to the realization that they had \nbeen poisoned--their children had been poisoned with lead. We tried so \nmany different ways to get the Republicans to help that beleaguered \ncity, but, no, not a chance. The people of Flint, MI, are still \ndrinking and bathing with bottled water. The children are still \nsuffering the awfulness of lead. It is so detrimental to little brains.\n  He talks about the Zika virus. How sad that he would think that \ngiving no money to this program is a good deal. I will talk about that \nin a little more detail. The Zika virus is extremely serious. It could \naffect as many as 39 of our United States. There is no money. The \nPresident has said, and I will say right now, we should not go on \nrecess while there is no money for Zika. The way things are set up \nunder his great plan, the Zika virus will be funded sometime this fall. \nThe mosquitoes will be dead or gone home--wherever that home is--by \nthat time, and the American people will be infected.\n  There was a mistake made by his staff dealing with renewable tax \ncredits, which is so important to the Presiding Officer's State and \nother States, and there have been efforts made to correct that mistake. \nThat hasn't been done yet.\n  The House of Representatives, led by the Republicans, can't pass a \nsimple budget. This great Senate that he talks about couldn't pass a \nbudget. We don't have a budget. We have no district court nominations. \nWe have emergencies all over the country because there are too many \npeople in trouble who want to litigate, and there are no judges to do \nthat. No, we are not going to move on judges because Barack Obama, in \ntheir mind, is an illegitimate President, and they have created Donald \nTrump--what has happened the last 7\\1/2\\ years, the Republicans \nopposing anything that President Obama tried to do. They have created \nDonald Trump. They are not only failing us on district court \nnominations, circuit court nominations, we have a Supreme Court that \nhas been bare. We don't have a full complement of Supreme Court \nJustices. For my friend to stand here and say we are doing our job is \nabsurd.\n  If he wants to talk about the Defense authorization bill, we will be \nhappy to do that. Here is a quote from Mitch McConnell, which is \nbasically what today's vote on the Defense authorization bill is all \nabout: ``The Defense authorization bill requires 4 to 5 weeks to \ndebate.'' That is what he said. Now he is changing his tune. I am not \nsaying it is 4 to 5 weeks, but this bill is almost 2,000 pages, which \nwe received the night before last at 5 o'clock. Shouldn't Members and \ntheir staff be able to read these 2,000 pages before we dive into \nlitigating and offering amendments?\n  I will say, again, the chairman of the committee, the senior Senator \nfrom Arizona, has said: I am going to violate the budget agreement we \nhave by bringing in $18 billion more for defense. The budget agreement \nsays he can't do that unless you equally fund nondefense. Shouldn't we \ntake a look at that? Shouldn't we take a look at a 2,000-page bill--\nactually, 1,660 pages, not counting the annex that came on board \nWednesday night as part of the bill? Shouldn't we take a look at that? \nThere are all kinds of earmarks, little goodies in that bill. We need \nto take a look at it. Is there anything wrong with that? I don't think \nso.\n  We look forward to considering this legislation. We did much better \nthan the Republicans. If you want to go back, another little insight \ninto history--they not only fought going onto the bill, once we went on \nit, they wouldn't let us get off the bill. That is not where we are \ncoming from.\n  We have a lot of things to do. We have to do TSCA. I hope he would \nfind time in his busy schedule, his great accomplishments, to work on a \nbill we have been trying to complete. I worked on this bill for the \nfirst time 28 years ago in the Senate. I was chairman of the \nsubcommittee in the Senate. I did my best to take on the chemical \nindustry, and I am sorry to report they won and America lost, but now \nwe have an opportunity to have the American people winning for a \nchange. What is the holdup in doing that bill? It is a conference \nreport.\n  Four weeks ago, I stood on the floor and said we shouldn't go on \nbreak without having giving President Obama the $1.9 billion he needs \nto fight the Zika virus. Four weeks later--we are still off next week--\nwe are not going to worry about those pesky mosquitoes. The Senate is \ngoing to recess for another week. We are going to come back for 4 weeks \nand then we are out for 7 weeks. This great plan of my friend, the \nRepublican leader, is somewhat misleading. Anything he has been able to \nget done and tried to boast about are things they held us up from doing \nfor 6 years.\n  Last Friday President Obama said we should not leave today without \nhaving given public health officials the resources they need to combat \nthe spread of Zika in the United States. Researchers, doctors, and \nhealth officials--not only in the United States, all over the world--\nneed this money. This money will be spent in America, but there will be \na lot of effects around the world. There will be a lot of problems in \nCentral and South America that we will be able to help. If we do it the \nright way, they can develop a vaccine at NIH, the Centers for Disease \nControl. They can't do it without money. Again, there is no money. They \nshift things around. They say they have a plan. Don't worry about \nEbola, which was 18 months ago--a ravaging fear in the American people. \nIt is still there, once that disease pops up again, that condition pops \nup again in Africa, because it infects Americans who are there. But \nthey have taken most of the money from Ebola, and the House is going to \ntake all of it in this great plan he has. They need this money. They \nneed it to prepare for this public health threat, which is here.\n  To leave now without putting an emergency spending bill on the \nPresident's desk is the height of irresponsibility. No matter how you \nboast about that, that is a fact.\n  As was reported by the Washington Post this morning, the New England \nJournal of Medicine released findings from the study of the Zika virus. \nHere is what they found: Women infected with Zika early in their \npregnancies may have as high as a 13-percent chance of having a baby \nwith microcephaly. What is that? The brain doesn't grow. The skull \ncaves in. It is a devastating birth defect, involving very small heads \nand incomplete development of the brain.\n  Mosquitoes have caused problems in the world for generations--many \ngenerations--but we have never had a report that the mosquito would \ntransmit a virus that would cause 13 percent of pregnant women to have \nthese deformed babies.\n  The Republican leader only needs to keep the Senate in session next \nweek\n\n[[Page S3234]]\n\nso we can pass a stand-alone Zika funding bill that gives our country \nwhat it needs now, not this fall. We need to act before local \ntransmission starts occurring in the continental United States. That is \ngoing to be soon. Late this fall will not do the trick. This fall is \ntoo late. It is time to act, not take a break. The Republican leader \nshould not send the Senate out of session until we have done all we can \nto protect the American people from the threat of this horrible virus.\n  It doesn't take into consideration the other things we are just \nleaving: Flint, MI, opioids. There are so many things we are walking \naway from in this institution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/senate-section/article/S3232-3"}, {"day": "26", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3234]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               OBAMACARE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am so happy to have my friend talk about \nObamaCare. I am happy to have him talk about that because he is making \nhimself not look very good, and that is a gross understatement. \nYesterday the Commonwealth Fund released its fourth survey of \nObamaCare. Here is what they found: Since the enactment of the \nAffordable Care Act, 28 million people have gained coverage either \nthrough marketplaces or Medicaid. In the last 3 years, the number of \nuninsured Americans have been reduced by 13 million people. Those are \n13 million more people who have insurance now than they had 3 years \nago, and 82 percent of American adults enrolled in private plans or \ngovernment coverage said they were satisfied with their plans.\n  Those numbers are further evidence the Affordable Care Act is helping \nthe American people. It is getting people insured, many for the first \ntime in their lives. Yesterday a woman came to me and said: Thank \ngoodness. I--a diabetic--have been able to buy insurance because of \nObamaCare.\n  It is giving families important subsidies so they can afford the plan \nthey need, and it is providing options, allowing Americans to cater \ntheir health insurance plans to their needs. Much has been made \nrecently about premiums. My friend has made a big deal about premiums, \nespecially by Republicans looking for any opening to spread \nmisinformation, falsehoods. They love to come and talk about ObamaCare, \nhow horrible it is for the American people. Allow me to set the record \nstraight again. At this point, we are all looking at proposed \nincreases. This, of course, is preliminary information.\n  Let's consider Arkansas as an example. I picked Arkansas because one \nof the Senators from Arkansas is usually presiding, and I want him to \nhear this. Three out of the four companies that offer policies on \nArkansas' health insurance marketplace proposed high premium increases \nfor their enrollees. All of these increases were hikes of at least 10 \npercent. Fortunately, for the people of Arkansas, the Affordable Care \nAct helps. For starters, the vast majority of enrollees in Arkansas are \nprotected from premium increases. Why? Because ObamaCare tax credits \nactually cap health insurance premiums for 85 percent of consumers. In \nArkansas, 87 percent of consumers receive tax credits that help make \ncoverage affordable; 62 percent of Arkansas enrollees had the option to \nselect plans as low as $75 per month after tax credits. There are other \nObamaCare provisions that safeguard against these rates that are out of \nline. Thanks to a provision within the law, State leaders have the \nresources to conduct a thorough review of the proposed rate increases. \nIn Arkansas' case, the State received $9.2 million to study proposed \npremium increases. Now it is up to Arkansas' Governor and insurance \ncommissioner to do the job and examine their rate proposals. State \nleaders have until August 23 to approve final rates for the 2017 \nexchange plans.\n  The Arkansas insurance commissioner, Allen Kerr, already made it \nclear that he and the Governor are opposed to the hikes. Governor \nHutchinson is a well known, fine man. I served with his brother and him \nin Congress. His brother was in the Senate.\n\n  Allen Kerr said:\n\n       Governor Hutchinson and I do not believe there is \n     substantive justification for these rate increases. For that \n     reason, we expect to take action to deny the requested rate \n     increases until there is sufficient justification to properly \n     consider any rate increase.\n\n  Before we passed the Affordable Care Act, Americans in the individual \ninsurance market were hit with double-digit health premium increases \nevery year without any exception. Back then, if the insurance company \nsaid you need to pay more, you either paid up or lost your insurance. \nConsumers had no recourse. And they were charged more because they had \nan illness the previous year. They were charged more for all kinds of \nreasons. And insurance companies could deny covering certain conditions \nall together--one is if you were a woman.\n  Now that Americans have ObamaCare in their corner, insurers can no \nlonger charge more because you are sick or deny coverage to someone who \nhas a certain illness. All conditions are covered, period. When \ninsurance companies want premium increases, States have resources to \nfight back just like Arkansas, and when consumers decide that a plan is \nno longer working, they can--and should--shop around. In fact, everyone \nshould do all they can to ensure that they are getting the best deal \npossible. That is what these marketplaces are for--to give the American \npeople options.\n  The Republican leader should be embarrassed by what he said this \nmorning. For all this misinformation said on the Senate floor almost \nevery day, the truth can't be hidden: The Affordable Care Act is \nkeeping Americans insured and providing them options to find health \ncoverage that meets their needs.\n  I say to my friend the Republican leader, that is why today America \nhas the lowest uninsured rate in the history of the country. The \nuninsured rate is at 9.1 percent. That is the lowest rate ever. The \nfacts are undeniable. The Affordable Care Act is working.\n  Will the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/senate-section/article/S3234-1"}, {"day": "26", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3234]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds).

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Wasteful Spending\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am back here for the 44th edition of \n``Waste of the Week.'' I am starting to enjoy this, and I hope someone \nelse is, but what we don't enjoy is the fact that the government is \nwasting taxpayer money. We have been documenting this for 44 weeks now, \nand we have come up with a significant total that is approaching $200 \nbillion of waste.\n  People get up every morning, go to work--put in a hard-day's work if \nthey have a job--try to save money so they can get the mortgage paid \neach month, get the insurance covered, get the gas tank filled up in \nthe car, and hopefully save a little money for their kids' education. \nBut every time they get a paycheck at the end of the week, they look at \nit and see deductions for this, that, and everything, such as State \ntaxes, Federal taxes, sales taxes, excise taxes, such as the tax at the \npump, and on and on it goes. You can't go to a grocery store, clothing \nstore, or any retail store without getting a tax slapped on everything \nyou buy. That money comes to Washington as a Federal tax, and at the \nvery least, the taxpayer is due\n\n[[Page S3235]]\n\ncareful use of their hard-earned tax dollars to fund the Federal \nGovernment. There are essential functions that the Federal Government \nand only the Federal Government can deal with--States participate with \nthe payment of interstate highways, along with some Federal support--\nand one of those functions is national defense.\n  The minority leader was just talking about delays, delays, delays, \nand how we are not getting anything done. My colleagues and I have been \nstanding around here all week waiting to move on to one of the \nessential functions of government that has to be done every year, and \nthat is funding for our national security and national defense. Through \nthe use of parliamentary maneuvers, the minority leader, who was just \ntalking about not getting anything done, is the reason we are not \ngetting it done.\n  I can understand that there is an issue that the other side doesn't \nthink should go forward and they want to use senatorial privileges and \nprocedures to stop it from going forward. I mean, that happens on both \nsides of the aisle. But national defense is something for which we have \nbipartisan support. In the end, this bill will probably pass 98 to 2 or \n100 to nothing.\n  What the minority leader didn't say is that every Democrat on the \ndefense committee, after spending hundreds of hours putting this \ntogether, supported it.\n  The minority leader comes down here and says: We don't know what is \nin it. His own people wrote this legislation, along with Republicans, \nand in the end, the committee sanctioned it by voting for it. Every \nDemocrat on the committee voted for this bill, and now the minority \nleader comes down to the floor and says: We don't know what is in it. \nWhy don't you talk to your own people? Why not talk to the people you \nhave assigned to this committee?\n  I can understand why he doesn't want to read every word of this \nbill--I don't think he reads every word of any bill--but I don't \nunderstand why he is using that tactic to keep us from going forward \nwith something the Federal Government must provide for--our defense--at \na time when threats are as high as we have ever seen. The world is on \nfire, and we need a strong national defense. Both Democrats and \nRepublicans understand that, and yet we have wasted an entire week \nbecause the minority leader has used procedural motions to keep us from \neven talking about the bill. This isn't passage of the bill; this is \nnot amending the bill; this is about the ability to come here and start \ntalking about the bill.\n  I didn't come down here to discuss this particular issue; I came down \nhere to talk about how money that is sent here by taxpayers is used and \nthe waste and misuse of that money. But you can't sit here very long \nand listen to the minority leader without some response to his \nnonsensical approach on this issue. The only good news is that very few \npeople were watching, so what difference does it make? I am here to \ntalk about the waste of the week. I hope the pages enjoy this one. You \ncan't make up some of this stuff.\n  The Government Accountability Office has the accountability of what \nwe do with taxpayer dollars, and they keep pouring stuff out of here \nthrough the inspectors general, whose job it is to make sure the \ntaxpayer dollars are spent accordingly for what they need to be spent \nfor, and they have a category called waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  I have just been scratching the surface of the waste, fraud, and \nabuse of hard-earned taxpayer dollars. Those dollars ought to go into \nthe savings of our taxpayers and not sent here to Washington to be \nwasted. I have been down here 44 times talking about separate wastes of \nthe week, and it is outrageous. If this body does anything, we should \ntake the word of those in the government who have pointed at agencies \nthat have incorporated waste, fraud, and abuse and deal with it.\n  Here we go with ``Waste of the Week'' 44. It is called the solar \nfield of death. It sounds like a movie--solar field of death. This week \nwe are looking at a solar powerplant that puts taxpayers on the hook \nfor $1.5 billion.\n  Here is the history. In 2011 the Department of Energy provided a $1.5 \nbillion loan guarantees for the development of a solar thermal field in \nCalifornia called Desert Sunlight. We all know there is a lot of \nsunlight in the desert. It is one of the largest solar fields in the \nworld. But most of us understand--and we see these solar fields and \nsolar panels on top of some houses and commercial buildings--that these \nsolar panels absorb sunlight and turn it into energy, and that is an \nalternative energy to what we usually get from a powerplant burning \ncoal, gas, or whatever.\n  Environmentalists like this because it doesn't use coal. There has \nbeen a war on Coal and a war on fossil fuels, but what really surprises \nme is the war on natural gas, which has just a fraction of the carbon \nemissions that come out of fossil fuel. Nevertheless, alternative \nenergy is something the government has been pursuing, but we would like \nthem to pursue that in a way that is economically feasible and doesn't \nput the taxpayer at such great risk.\n  Well, the Obama administration essentially, in its war on coal, has \nsaid: Look, go on out there, and we will put up loan guarantees. Do \nyour thing. Experiment, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, and if it \nfails, don't worry--the taxpayer will back it up because we have given \na guarantee to some of these companies with ideas.\n  Some of the ideas have worked, some have been cost-effective, but \nmany fewer than people thought. This one was supposed to be the \nultimate. They said: Let's go out in the desert. The Sun shines all the \ntime, and we will not put solar panels out there, but instead we will \nput out mirrors.\n  Here is a picture of it out in the desert. There are literally \nhundreds of thousands of mirrors out there all directed at this tower. \nThis tower then reflects the heat bouncing off the mirrors all directed \nin here toward the tower, which then boils water and then it produces \nthrough a steam turbine that energy and send it out over the wires to \nlight up homes, factories, and provide electricity for people in \nCalifornia.\n  That sounds pretty straightforward. Maybe it is a good idea. It \nprobably would have been good if they tested it out before they put the \nmirrors out there. If they had done that, maybe they would have learned \nsome things.\n  What was the first thing they learned? Nobody seemed to factor in \nthat the Sun doesn't always shine in the desert because sometimes there \nare clouds. As it turns out, one-third of the power they thought they \nwould get they don't get because it is cloudy. You would think somebody \nwould have said before the government offered a $1.5 billion guarantee: \nWhat about the cloudy days? They projected how much energy can be \ngotten to light up and provide electricity for California when the Sun \nis shining, but they are operating on the basis that the Sun is always \ngoing to be shining.\n\n  How about nighttime? How much light or heat are we going to get \ndirected toward those mirrors from the Moon? Not very much, if \nanything. Clouds came to be a factor, and what we found out is that the \nplant is producing only about a quarter of the energy that was \noriginally envisioned.\n  I am not a scientist, and I am not somebody who has a specialty in \nalternative energy, but I think I would have had the gumption to say: \nHow about clouds? Are these projections that you have made regarding \nthe kind of energy that is going to be produced going to be cost \neffective so that the taxpayer is not on the hook? Apparently, somebody \ndidn't figure that out because we are only getting a quarter of what we \nthought we were going to get out of it.\n  What the company did is say: OK. We are not getting what we wanted, \nbut we need an extension. We need extensions on payments to the Federal \nGovernment because the plant isn't generating the kind of energy needed \nand therefore not getting the kinds of profits from the users of \nelectricity for us to pay back the loan. So the Obama administration \nsaid: Yes, we are for alternative energy. Go ahead. We will extend \nthis. They did extend the payments. Earlier this year, the California \nPublic Utilities Commission gave the plant a lifeline, giving it 1 more \nyear to fix the problems.\n  Another problem was that while production improved, the average price \nfor a megawatt hour of electricity from the plant was $150. Compare \nthat with the price for a megawatt, the same amount of energy, on \nnatural gas, which is $35. The customers said: Wait\n\n[[Page S3236]]\n\na minute. I am paying a utility bill at the rate of $150 per megawatt \nhour of electricity, and if we were using natural gas, we would only \npay $35. So what is the deal here? It turned out that alternative \nenergy, while it is alternative, also is not cost effective.\n  The assumption is that we are saving on carbon emissions. OK. Well, \nthat didn't work either. For starters, it takes the boilers that they \nhave to heat up because, of course, it is nighttime and the mirrors \naren't reflecting any Sun that reflects heat that causes the water to \nboil and then to be used to turn the turbines to produce electricity. \nIt takes 4.5 hours every day to get up to speed. Guess how they do \nthat? They have to use natural gas to get it to the point where then \nthe Sun can add more to it. Maybe somebody didn't figure that out, \neither.\n  In 2014, the plant emitted 46,000 metric tons of carbon--nearly twice \nthe amount of carbon that power plants can emit under California State \nlaw. So the State said: Here's the limit of what you can emit in \ncarbon, but thank goodness we have this solar field because that \ndoesn't issue any. Well, it issues twice as much as what they were \ngetting out of natural gas. That apparently didn't get figured in.\n  People say: Well, there is an environmental advantage here. This \nenvironmental advantage means we don't have to put carbon in the air, \nand it is going to be a much cleaner source of energy, and there will \nnot be any adverse effects on the environment. They have to also factor \nin that there are birds that fly in the air--a lot more birds than you \nmight think. The heat has killed over 3,500 birds each year. They fry \nto death because there is so much heat reflected from those mirrors, \nand it is a huge field. The birds are probably attracted to the light, \nand by the time they get into this field, it is like going into a deep \nfat fryer.\n  In Indiana there is a saying that if you can fry it, you can eat it. \nI have seen pictures of these fried birds. Trust me, we don't want to \neat them. But $1.5 billion in taxpayers' money has been spent for a \nsolar field of death that kills thousands of birds each year, doesn't \nproduce much energy, and then, finally, sets itself on fire. I am not \nmaking this up. They had the mirrors redirected the wrong way, so it \nhit the cables that were providing the source for the energy to go \ndown, and the cables caught on fire. I had a picture with the tower on \nfire, but we didn't bring it down here.\n  What a boondoggle. I mean, look, is this interesting? Yeah. Is this \nfunny? Yeah, but this is taxpayer money. This is a waste of $1.5 \nbillion of taxpayer-guaranteed money. This is money that people send to \nWashington after a hard week's work. So, while it is interesting to \ntalk about fried birds and mirrors redirecting the energy to the tower \nthat catches on fire, the clouds coming over, and so on and so forth, \nthe serious issue here is it is yet another waste of taxpayer money.\n  Think what this $1.5 billion could be used for if it could be left in \nthe hands of the taxpayer for whatever use--to pay the mortgage, send \nthe kids to school--or if it could be used for common defense, \nprotecting the American people from terrorist attacks or essential \nfunctions or repairing bridges or paving some roads.\n  It is like driving in a third world country here in Washington, DC. \nThere are potholes one wouldn't believe--cracks in the roads. Bumping \nalong, I see people's hubcaps flying off cars and people pulled over to \nthe side because their tire is blown out. I blew out two tires a year \nago for the same reason.\n  No environmental activist, fiscal conservative, or rational person \nshould continue to support solar field of death. So I am labeling this \nas a waste of the week. The Obama administration continues to refuse to \nadmit any of these half-baked--in this case fully fried--ideas that \ndon't succeed. They are continuing to advocate for the solar field of \ndeath rather than put taxpayer money to better use.\n  So here we go, adding $1.5 billion to a waste of taxpayer money, \nputting us to $172 billion of accountable money spent through \ngovernment agencies' waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is postcloture on the motion to \nproceed.\n  Mr. HELLER. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor up to 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Memorial Day\n\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, every day that I drive into Washington, \nDC, coming here to work, I pass by the Iwo Jima Memorial and Arlington \nNational Cemetery. It is a humbling reminder of the valiant men and \nwomen from across this Nation who have answered the call of duty in two \nworld wars, the wars in Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf, Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and numerous other conflicts waged to keep America free. \nIt constantly reminds me that the ongoing fight to care for our \nNation's veterans is my duty and my responsibility as a Member of the \nU.S. Senate.\n  These fearless warriors had moms and dads of their own. They had \nsons, daughters, loved ones, neighbors, and friends, but they \nselflessly made the ultimate sacrifice for all of us.\n  They stood against tyranny, fought oppression and injustice, defended \nliberty with the highest measure of honor, valor, and courage. They \ndemonstrated the greatest love a person can have by laying down their \nlives for our country.\n  The greatest honor we can bestow on our men and women in uniform and \ntheir families is to remember their immeasurable sacrifice. While we \ncarry on the tradition of Memorial Day, let us never forget that every \nday is a chance to thank and honor our patriots in uniform.\n  Last week I had the honor of attending the final sendoff for two of \nNevada's very own at Arlington National Cemetery. I would like to speak \nabout one of them. His name is Bob Wheeler.\n  Bob Wheeler was a patriot in every sense of the word. He joined the \nU.S. Air Force in November of 1962, serving in the pararescue career \nfield. He was recognized as a true innovator in his leadership \nposition, opening the door for free-fall parachuting and combat \ntactics. He led by example, working diligently and earnestly to help \nthose around him and to protect our country.\n  Bob was credited with saving 28 lives throughout his career, \nincluding vulnerable aviators who had crashed and distressed seamen in \nthe Vietnam war.\n  He received the Distinguished Flying Cross for Valor, the Airman's \nMedal, numerous commendation medals, 17 Air Medals and SEA Service \nribbons. His 20 years of service and bravery will never be forgotten.\n  These are the types of men and women our armed services are made up \nof, and they live across this Nation in each and every State \nrepresenting us in this body.\n  I had the pleasure of working with Bob Wheeler personally. He served \non my Nevada Veterans Advisory Council. We worked as a team along with \nthe rest of the council to help improve resources for Nevada's veterans \ncommunity. His firsthand knowledge of combat and veterans' needs cannot \nbe replicated. He was one of a kind, and I am thankful to have had him \nas an ally helping Nevada's veterans.\n  That is why I am disappointed to hear the head of the VA, Secretary \nRobert McDonald, comparing the wait times veterans experience at the VA \nfor health care appointments to the wait times at Disney theme parks. \nIt is totally inappropriate, and it is inexcusable. It shows there is \nstill a culture and attitude inside the VA that needs to be changed. \nThe mission of the VA should be serving the veterans, not finding ways \nto avoid accountability.\n  With the words ``To care for him who shall have borne the battle and \nfor his widow, and his orphan,'' President Lincoln affirmed the \ngovernment's obligation to care for those injured in war and to provide \nfor families who gave the ultimate sacrifice. Congress will do this by \nworking diligently on behalf of those who served and survived, which is \nwhy one of the greatest privileges of serving Nevada in this body is \nthe opportunity to sit on the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee.\n  Recently I joined my colleagues to introduce the Veterans First Act. \nIt focuses on improving the delivery of care and benefits to our \nNation's veterans and their families. Specifically, I championed causes \nthat reform the VA disabilities claims process and create a\n\n[[Page S3237]]\n\nsystem that can withstand surges in disability claims without \ngenerating another claims backlog.\n  I also sought to implement a new, voluntary 5-year pilot program to \nhelp reduce the large backlog of appeals at the Veterans Benefits \nAdministration. I want to establish a new channel whereby veterans can \nexpedite their appeal instead of having to wait 2 to 4 years for a \ndecision by the Board of Veterans Appeals.\n  Finally, I want to ensure that all those veterans and their families \nare cared for, which is why this bill includes provisions to reimburse \nVA-funded shelters for the care of children of homeless veterans.\n  On behalf of the State of Nevada, the U.S. Senate, and the United \nStates of America, I express my sincere gratitude to the families of \nall Nevadans who have given their lives in the line of duty. I assure \nyou that your loss will never be forgotten, and I thank and commend \neach of the brave Nevadans currently serving in our Armed Forces, as \nwell as their families, for their sacrifice. But my gratitude extends \nacross the Nation to all veterans and their families. We owe all of you \na debt of thanks that can never be repaid.\n  May God bless our troops, and may He continue to bless this great \ncountry.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n     Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Bill\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we are working behind the scenes to allow \na vote on H.R. 2576, the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the \n21st Century Act. My understanding of the status of this vote is that \nwe are fine on the Democratic side, but there is an objection to moving \nto it on the Republican side. I am hopeful this can be resolved because \nthis bill has been the most complicated, difficult, and emotional \njourney that I have ever had in the Senate.\n  The fact that we have reached agreement--the vast, vast majority of \nus--showed in the House vote, where I think there were only about 1 \ndozen ``no'' votes. I think it is ripe for a vote. When you talk about \nregulating chemicals--toxic chemicals--it is not just an academic \ndiscussion. It has real-life consequences. When you name a bill after \nSenator Frank Lautenberg, who fought for the environment all of his \nlife, it better be a bill worthy of his name.\n  The cost of toxic chemicals to society is enormous. It is not only in \nterms of dollars but in terms of pain and suffering. They have \nextracted a very, very high cost on our people.\n  Let me give you a few examples, because sometimes we talk in \ntechnicalities. I want to talk in realities. Asbestos is one of the \nmost harmful chemicals known to humankind. It takes 15,000 lives a \nyear. It is linked to a deadly form of lung cancer called mesothelioma. \nThat is when microscopic asbestos fibers, which are invisible and stay \nsuspended in the air, get deep into the lungs of so many people, \nincluding children. They breathe these fibers deep into the lungs, \nwhere those fibers cause serious damage.\n  Another example brought to me by my brave firefighters in San \nFrancisco is flame retardants. That is another category of dangerous \nchemicals that has been linked to a wide array of serious health \nproblems, including cancer, reduced IQ, developmental delays, obesity, \nand reproductive difficulties. These harmful chemicals have been added \nto dozens of everyday items such as furniture and baby products.\n  Now, we know there are flame retardants that are way safer. We know \nwe can do better than we have done so far. Again, I want to say that \nthe San Francisco firefighters who gave testimony in my EPW Committee \nwhen I was chairman about the cancer rates they are experiencing \nbelieve it is directly related to flame retardants.\n  So, again, reforming TSCA, which is the Toxic Substances Control Act, \nis not about a theory. It is about our families. It is about being a \npart of a cancer epidemic that we have to get under control.\n  Now, we know that the TSCA bill, as it was written so many years \nago--in the 1970s--was very weak. It was impossible for the EPA really \nto regulate any chemical because the standard was so weak. They could \nnot prove that it needed to be regulated.\n  Therefore, that bill has needed to be reformed for so many years. \nWhen the Federal Government, in essence, had no program or very little \nprogram, the States stepped in to fill the void. My State, thankfully, \nwas one of the States that stepped in to fill the void. Several States \ndid so. About a dozen States, roughly, had strong programs to regulate \nthese chemicals.\n  So I knew that these States were doing a good job. I knew if we were \nto pass a Federal bill, we had to allow the States to continue their \ngood work. But when the Lautenberg-Vitter TSCA bill was first \nintroduced, shortly before Frank Lautenberg passed away in 2013, \nsomething was terribly wrong. There was total preemption of State \naction.\n  The standard for the Federal bill was so weak that we would just have \nnothing going on. We would have a bill in name only, a law in name \nonly. Nothing would be able to be regulated. Now, I had worked \npreviously with Frank Lautenberg on four TSCA bills dating back to \n2005. Every one of those bills before that 2013 Lautenberg-Vitter bill \nwas strong and took the side of the American people, not the chemical \ncompanies. It never preempted the States.\n  What it basically said is that we will set a floor, as we do in most \nenvironmental laws. If the States want to do more to protect their \npeople--whether your State is California, North Dakota, South Dakota, \nWashington, Massachusetts, or New York; it does not matter--the States \nwould be free to do more if they felt a particular chemical was harming \ntheir population.\n  I always thought that States' rights were big around here. Well, when \nyou read that bill, in 2013, I will tell you, it looked like it was \nwritten by the chemical companies. I could never support it. That bill \nwas a travesty. It was a disaster. I fought it every step of the way. \nAgain, there was sweeping preemption of my State's ability and every \nState's ability to protect citizens from harmful chemicals.\n  Again, it was a very weak standard for evaluating chemicals. The way \nit worked was really incredible. If a chemical was just being looked at \nby the EPA, States were out of the picture--out of the picture. So, S. \n1009, in my opinion and in the opinion of many experts who helped me \nthroughout all this--the nurses and doctors who cared, all kinds of \nwonderful environmental groups, and the Breast Cancer Fund; and I will \nlist those later--they helped me. I realized again that that bill--that \noriginal bill--would have had no controls whatsoever and given the \nchemical companies the green light to do whatever they wanted \nregardless of its impact on the health of our people. Again, the States \nwere left completely out of the picture the minute the EPA announced \nthey were looking at a chemical. That situation, I could never have \nallowed to continue.\n  I stopped the bill from moving forward while I negotiated to get rid \nof its flaws. Now, this is the first time I have ever stood here and \nsaid I stopped a bill. I am known as a legislator. I want to find the \nsweet spot. But we didn't find the sweet spot until just recently, I am \nhappy to say. But it was a very lonely battle at times--just a couple \nof people working with me here. One person even said I was the most \nunpopular person because I was not getting out of the way. But that is \nnot why I am here. I can't get out of the way of a bad bill.\n  Now, when the Republicans took the gavel of EPW, the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, a new bill, S. 697, was introduced by Senators \nUdall and Vitter. I looked at that bill. I swear, I said it looked like \nit was written by the chemical companies. Again, I was heartbroken. \nSure enough, a story broke in the Hearst newspapers entitled: \n``Questions raised on authorship of chemicals bill.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Hearst Newspaper, Mar. 16, 2015]\n\n            Questions Raised on Authorship of Chemicals Bill\n\n                          (By David McCumber)\n\n       Washington.--It's certainly well-known in Washington that \n     when it comes to the making of the sausage, lobbyists \n     frequently have their thumbs in the pork. But usually, they \n     don't actually leave their electronic signatures on bills.\n\n[[Page S3238]]\n\n       The elaborately titled Frank Lautenberg Chemical Safety for \n     the 21st Century Act makes its debut at a Senate Environment \n     and Public Works Committee hearing Wednesday. It's a high-\n     stakes bill: If it becomes law, it would be the first update \n     in 39 years of federal regulation of toxic substances like \n     asbestos, formaldehyde and hundreds of other chemicals.\n       In recent days, a draft of the bill--considered the product \n     of more than two years of negotiation and collaboration \n     between Sen. David Vitter, R-La., Sen. Tom Udall, D-N.M., and \n     both chemical industry and environmental groups--was \n     circulated by Udall's office ahead of the hearing. The draft \n     bill, obtained by Hearst Newspapers, is in the form of a \n     Microsoft Word document. Rudimentary digital forensics--going \n     to ``advanced properties'' in Word--shows the ``company'' of \n     origin to be the American Chemistry Council.\n       The ACC, as the council is known, is the leading trade \n     organization and lobbyist for the chemical industry. And \n     opponents of the Vitter-Udall bill have pounced on the \n     document's digital fingerprints to make the point that they \n     believe the bill favors industry far too much.\n       ``We're apparently at the point in the minds of some people \n     in the Congress that laws intended to regulate polluters are \n     now written by the polluters themselves,'' said Ken Cook, \n     president of the Environmental Working Group, who will \n     testify against the bill at Wednesday's hearing.\n       ``Call me old-fashioned, but a bill to protect the public \n     from harmful chemicals should not be written by chemical \n     industry lobbyists. The voices of our families must not be \n     drowned out by the very industry whose documented harmful \n     impacts must be addressed, or the whole exercise is a sham,'' \n     Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said Monday.\n       Boxer, who chaired the committee when the Democrats held \n     the majority, and Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., have \n     introduced an alternative version of the bill with much more \n     stringent regulatory provisions.\n       Udall's office was a little indignant and somewhat \n     embarrassed Monday. ``That document originated in our \n     office,'' said Udall's communications director, Jennifer \n     Talhelm. ``It was shared with a number of stakeholders \n     including at least one other senator's office. One of those \n     stakeholders was the ACC.\n       ``We believe that somebody at the ACC saved the document, \n     and sent it back to us,'' Talhelm said, accounting for the \n     digital trail. ``Sen. Udall's office has been very, very \n     engaged with bringing various stakeholders to the table as \n     part of the process of writing the best possible bill,'' \n     Talhelm added. ``This is just one example.''\n       Earlier this month, a New York Times story detailed Udall's \n     alliance with the chemical industry on the bill. In that \n     story, ACC President Cal Dooley, a former California \n     Democratic congressman, said ``the leadership (Udall) is \n     providing is absolutely critical'' to the industry.\n       On Monday, ACC spokeswoman and vice president Anne Kolter \n     said, ``It doesn't mean the original document was generated \n     here. Anyone could have put that (digital signature) in \n     there. You could change it.''\n       Asked if that meant she was denying ACC wrote the document, \n     she said, ``I have no idea. . . . There's no way for anyone \n     to tell.''\n       ``You're not the first reporter to ask about this,'' she \n     said. ``We've been able to raise enough questions'' that \n     nobody else has written about it, she added.\n       Cook of the Environmental Working Group said the copy of \n     the draft he received bore the same electronic signature, and \n     a Boxer staffer on the committee confirmed that their copy \n     did as well. A Senate IT staffer told Boxer's office, ``We \n     can confidently say that the document was created by a user \n     with American Chemistry Council. Their name is specified as \n     Author and their Organization is specified as American \n     Chemistry Council.''\n       The Vitter-Udall version of the bill is expected to gain \n     enough bipartisan support to pass out of committee to the \n     Senate floor.\n       The bill's fate from there is uncertain, and some of the \n     Boxer-Markey provisions could possibly be included in the \n     final bill.\n       In its current form, the bill is opposed by many \n     environmental, health and labor organizations and several \n     states, because it would gut state chemical regulations.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. According to this story:\n\n       [T]he draft bill, obtained by Hearst Newspapers, is in the \n     form of a Microsoft Word document. Rudimentary digital \n     forensics . . . shows the ``company'' of origin to be the \n     American Chemistry Council.\n\n  Imagine: The bill that was being circulated came right out of the \ncomputer of the American Chemistry Council. How could anyone believe it \nwas a fair and just bill that protected the public? That document was \nnot simply a set of comments by the chemical industry. It was \ncirculated as the most current draft of the bill at the time. Everyone \nwill see the story, and I commend the reporter for doing this deep \ninvestigation. But I never gave up on the bill. I continued to \nnegotiate with my colleagues.\n  I commend Senators Whitehouse, Merkley, and Booker. They went forward \nand negotiated some significant fixes to that disastrous bill as it \nmoved through the EPW Committee. Their improvements were very important \nbut still many serious flaws remained. My State of California and other \nStates that had programs to regulate chemicals and all these public \ninterests--probably 450 public organizations that protect the health of \nour children, of our families, of our elderly, of our disabled--were \nall strongly against it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na list of letters from States and many organizations demonstrating the \nopposition to and concern with the bill.\n  You can see what the opposition was, and still colleagues said: No, \nno, no, Senator Boxer, you are unreasonable. Well, really, was I \nunreasonable when we had letters against the bill and letters \nexpressing concern from the Massachusetts attorney general; letters \nfrom the attorneys general of New York, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Oregon, \nand Washington; a letter from the Office of the Attorney General of \nCalifornia; the California Environmental Protection Agency; the \nWashington State Department of Ecology; the Vermont attorney general; a \nletter from Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families; the American Association \nfor Justice; the Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization; a letter from \nthe Breast Cancer Fund; the American Sustainable Business Council \nAction Fund; the Environmental Working Group, which opposed it; 25 law \nprofessors; health care organizations; the Union of Concerned \nScientists; the Environmental Health Strategy Center; Safer States; \nEarthjustice; Seventh Generation; a reproductive health letter; and a \nletter from the Center for Environmental Health? They are all in here.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                      Letters of Concern on S. 697\n\n       Letter from Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey\n       Letter from the Attorneys General of New York, Iowa, Maine, \n     Maryland, Oregon, and Washington\n       Letter from Brian E. Nelson, General Counsel, Office of \n     California Attorney General\n       Letter from the California Environmental Protection Agency \n     (Cal EPA)\n       Letter from Washington State Department of Ecology\n       Letter from Vermont Attorney General's office\n       Letter from Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families\n       Letter from American Association for Justice (AAJ)\n       Letter from Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization\n       Letter from the Breast Cancer Fund\n       Letter from the American Sustainable Business Council \n     Action Fund\n       Letter from the Environmental Working Group\n       Letter from 25 Law Professors\n       Letter from Health Care Organizations on S. 697\n       Letter from the Union of Concerned Scientists\n       Letter from Environmental Health Strategy Center\n       Letter from Safer States\n       Letter from Earthjustice\n       Letter from Seventh Generation\n       Reproductive Health Letter\n       Letter from Center for Environmental Health.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. The history of this bill must be made permanent in the \nrecord. It started out as a disaster, and it got to a point where it is \nbetter than current law. That makes me very happy. The negotiations on \nthe bill continued. Again, several Members helped us, and we still had \nproblems with the bill.\n  We tripled our efforts to improve it. I want to say that the 450 \norganizations that were part of the Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families \ncoalition worked with me. They were the wind at my back.\n  My staff, the EPW staff director and chief counsel, Bettina Poirier, \nand my senior policy adviser, Jason Albritton, were incredible.\n  I also thank the Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization.\n  As I said before, asbestos is one of the most dangerous chemicals in \nexistence today. It is the poster child for the failure of the old TSCA \nlaw that we are reforming.\n  These organizations and States stood strong despite enormous \npressure. They took a lot of heat. I am so grateful to them for their \npersistence because--let's be clear--without their persistence, without \njust a few lawmakers who had the courage to stand up to the special \ninterests, we never ever would have been able to negotiate\n\n[[Page S3239]]\n\nimprovements to this bill--so many improvements to this bill.\n  I want to be clear that a lot of these organizations still think the \nbill is too weak and still would like to see it stronger, and so would \nI.\n  If I could write this bill myself, I would use the usual formula we \nhave for environmental laws. We set a standard. We set a floor. People \nhave to abide by it. But if the States feel they can do more, they \nshould be able to.\n  In this bill, although the States now have a tremendous amount of \nleeway, they don't have 100-percent leeway. That is why there is still \nopposition--not so much in the Senate but with some of the \norganizations. But I have to say to them that this is a bill that I \nbelieve is better than current law.\n  There was a 24/7 commitment from my staff. They worked Friday nights, \nSaturdays, Sundays--constantly. They constantly worked well with \nSenator Inhofe's staff to get the best bill we could.\n  My staff, as do all of us, have strong family obligations and \nresponsibilities. So I just wish to take a minute to thank their \nfamilies for sharing them with us, because they missed family time. \nThey did it for the good of all of the children in the country, because \nwhen we control these toxic chemicals and we protect our children, it \nis going to help everybody.\n  I am for this bill because we made amazing improvements to it, and I \nam going to highlight these improvements.\n  No. 1, the first major area of improvement is in the preemption of \nStates. I said before that if I had written the bill, I would have no \npreemption. I would set the floor and let the States make it even \nbetter. We were unable to get that. But here is what the facts are. The \nStates are free to take whatever action they want on any chemical, and \nthere are many--thousands, tens of thousands. The States are free to \ntake whatever action they want on any chemical until the EPA has taken \na series of steps to consider a particular chemical. That is the first \nthing. They are free on any chemical they want until the Federal \nGovernment announces that they are studying certain chemicals.\n  No. 2, when EPA announces the chemicals they are studying, the States \nare still not shut out. They have up to a year and a half to take \naction on these particular chemicals to avoid preemption until EPA \ntakes final action. So if there is no chemical being studied, they can \nstudy any chemical in the States, and they can control any chemical. \nWhen EPA announces steps, they still have a year and a half to ban that \nchemical until we see the results of the Federal Government.\n  No. 3, even after EPA announces its regulation, the States can still \nhave a waiver so they can still regulate the chemical. They will have \nto make the case. For example, if the EPA decides to do very little \nregulation of a chemical that is very present in one of our States \nbecause of perhaps the oil industry or fracking or something and if the \nState has a reason to do more, it can go get a waiver. We made that \nwaiver a lot easier for States than when it originally came to us.\n  The first 10 chemicals that EPA evaluates under the bill are also \nexempted from preemption until the final rule is issued. This is very \nimportant because the EPA is already studying about 10 chemicals. State \nor local restrictions on a chemical that were in place before April 22, \n2016, will not be preempted. So if any one of your States took action \non a chemical before April 22, 2016, they will not be preempted.\n  The second area of improvement concerns asbestos. I fought hard to \nensure that dangerous substances like asbestos are prioritized to get \nthe attention they deserve from regulators. I talked about asbestos as \none of the most harmful substances known to humankind. I believe it \nshould have been banned a long time ago. I support an immediate ban and \nwill introduce a standalone bill to do just that. But the \nprioritization in this bill is a start.\n\n  The third area of improvement includes cancer clusters. We added a \nprovision--which was based on my bill with Senator Crapo, the Community \nDisease Cluster Assistance Act, or Trevor's Law--that provides \nlocalities that ask for it a coordinated response to cancer clusters in \ntheir communities.\n  I wish to say to Trevor, who may be listening: Thank you, Trevor. He \ncame forward and he told his story.\n  Fourth, persistent chemicals that build up in the body are a priority \nin this legislation.\n  Fifth, the bill ensures that toxic chemicals that are stored near \ndrinking water are prioritized. Remember that in 2014 West Virginia \nlost their drinking water supply because there were chemicals stored \nright near that drinking water supply, causing havoc and disruption.\n  I thank the two Senators from West Virginia for supporting me on \nthat.\n  Sixth, the bill enables EPA to order independent testing if there are \nsafety concerns about a chemical, and those tests will be paid for by \nthe chemical manufacturer. The EPA, if they have concerns, regardless \nof their program, can go into a chemical company and say: We see that \nyou have been using this chemical more, and we are worried about it. We \norder you to provide for us a very unbiased, independent analysis of \nwhether it is safe.\n  I thank Members in the House for working hard with us on this \nimportant improvement, and that is Members on both sides of the aisle.\n  Finally, even the standard for evaluating whether a chemical is \ndangerous is better. The bill requires EPA to evaluate chemicals based \non risk--not cost, risk--and considers the impact on vulnerable \npopulations. This is very critical because the old law was useless. It \nwas thrown out in court.\n  All of these fixes make the bill better than current law.\n  Looking forward, I think it is important to note that the new TSCA \nlaw--which I am so hopeful will pass today, if we can--will only be as \ngood as the EPA is good. With a good EPA we can deliver a much safer \nenvironment for the American people, safer products, less exposure to \nharmful toxics, and better health for our people.\n  With a bad EPA that does not value these goals, not much will get \ndone. But if there is no action--I want to underscore this--States will \nbe free to act and that is a very important point. My message to the \nStates is this: Do not dismantle what you have going. Rev it up because \nyou still have the ability to be leaders on protecting your citizens \nfrom toxic chemicals.\n  Compared to where we started, the improvements in this bill provide a \nmuch better balance between the States and the Federal Government. But \nlet me be clear again, in case I wasn't clear enough. If I had written \nthis bill on my own, I would have modeled it after other environmental \nlaws, such as the Clean Air Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act, where \nthe Federal Government sets a floor and the States are free to set a \nhigher bar. The bills that I worked on with Frank Lautenberg did not \nput an unprecedented ceiling on how much we could protect the people. \nHaving said all of that, there are so many chemicals out there that are \nnot being looked at or studied.\n  I believe a good EPA, working with the States, can make a major \nimprovement if this bill is carried out with a sense of purpose and \ncommitment. The journey to this moment has been the most difficult \njourney I have ever had to take on any piece of legislation.\n  I see the majority leader on the floor. He and I worked hard on the \ntransportation bill, and that was a long and winding road. This one was \nmuch more difficult.\n  But I can honestly say to you today that there were so many committed \npeople in the Senate and House--Members of both parties. I really do \nhave to give a shout out to Leader Pelosi, the Democratic leader, to \nSteny Hoyer, to Frank Pallone, and to all of those on the House side \nwho worked so hard, and to their counterparts in the Republican Party. \nIn the Senate, there is Senator Inhofe, and there are Senators from my \ncommittee from both sides of the aisle without which we would not be \nhere. To the staffs, to the public interest organizations, and to the \nStates, we have scored a significant step forward for the American \npeople.\n  I hope this bill will come before us today. If it does, I will vote \nyes. If it comes to us after recess, I will vote yes.\n  But I really wanted to make this statement because I think the \nhistory of this bill is clear to me. I think that history is being \nrewritten by some about this bill. And I wanted to make sure I put into \nthe Record all the problems we had at the beginning and all\n\n[[Page S3240]]\n\nthe improvements we obtained at the end.\n\n  I thank the Chair for his patience, and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rubio). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, recently we have had some very welcoming \nnews out of the House of Representatives on the Toxic Substances \nControl Act. The House passed that in the last several days 403 to 12--\na wonderful, large, bipartisan majority--and I am glad we are going to \nproceed to TSCA sometime soon and deal with the legislation on the \nSenate floor.\n  Mr. President, most Americans believe if they buy a product at the \ngrocery store or a hardware store, the government has tested it and \ndetermined it is safe. Until now, that has not been true. We are \nexposed to hundreds of chemicals in our daily lives. In countless ways \nwe can breathe, eat, and drink chemicals. They can be absorbed through \nour skin, even from common household items. Some are toxic, but almost \nnone are regulated.\n  Let me cite now a couple of examples. There are flame retardants in \nyour sofa and in other furniture that get up into the air when pressure \nis put on the furniture. There is formaldehyde in pressed-wood floors \nand carpets, glues and adhesives even in noniron shirts. There are the \nPFOA compounds from the nonstick coating on your frying pans and \nbakeware. Most water bottles are BPA-free now, but you still find BPA \nin your credit card receipts. Some laser printers give off ultrafine \nparticles like volatile organic compounds that can cause serious health \nproblems. I could go on and on and on with the list of chemicals out \nthere in our society that citizens are exposed to every day.\n  As a result of that exposure, we carry these chemicals around in our \nbodies, even before we are born, but we don't know the full impact they \nare having on our health because in the last 40 years only a handful \nhave ever been reviewed for safety. The EPA lacks the ability to \nevaluate and the authority to regulate, even though some have linked \nmany of these chemicals to various kinds of diseases, such as cancer, \ninfertility, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, and other \ndiseases that are out there.\n  Infants, pregnant women, the elderly, and workers exposed to \nchemicals on the job are particularly at risk for chemical exposure. \nFor example, we have seen an increase in cancer rates among \nfirefighters who get exposed to chemicals from smoldering furniture in \nhouse fires.\n  That is why we must pass the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for \nthe 21st Century Act. It will be a working chemical safety law for the \nwhole country--for our families, for our children. We will, for the \nfirst time, have a cop on the beat when it comes to safety and \nprotecting our children and our communities from dangerous chemicals. \nFor the first time in 40 years, we are going to have that cop out there \nworking hard to make sure our families are safe.\n  Getting here has taken years--years of negotiations and \ncollaboration, working with stakeholders across the country. Now, \nCongress can send the President a strong, bipartisan environmental \nreform bill, and he will sign it into law. There is no doubt about that \nfrom the statement put out by the administration on this bill. In fact, \nI think they called it landmark reform by the Congress.\n  The EPA has commented on the bill. They stated:\n\n       [This bill] is a clear improvement over current law and is \n     largely consistent with the administration's principles for \n     TSCA reform. Critically, the bill would address the \n     fundamental flaws that have hindered EPA's ability to protect \n     human health and the environment from chemical risks.\n\n  The administration has also put out a statement of policy saying that \nit ``strongly supports'' this legislation.\n  Americans have been calling out for this reform for decades. They \nunderstand we need a national solution to our broken chemical safety \nlaw because they have seen the impacts firsthand, like Dominique \nBrowning, who works with Moms Clean Air Force. She survived kidney \ncancer and now wants a safer place for her kids. When she asked her \ndoctor what caused her illness, he said:\n\n       It's one of those environmental ones. Who knows. We are \n     full of chemicals.\n\n  And Lisa Huguenin. Lisa is a Ph.D. scientist who has done work on \nchemical exposure at Princeton and Rutgers and at the State and Federal \nlevel, but it isn't what she saw at work that motivated her to work for \nreform. It was what she saw at home. Lisa's 13-year-old son Harrison \nwas born with autism and other autoimmune deficiencies. Five years ago, \nLisa testified before Senator Lautenberg's subcommittee on the need for \nreform. Since then, her husband Marc has undergone tests for a rare and \nnewly discovered disease that wasn't even known to exist when she \ntestified. So she is eager to see TSCA reform be signed into law.\n  Lisa recently wrote to me and said:\n\n       The concerns I expressed 5 years ago remain today. I have \n     no way of knowing if the household products that I use or the \n     toys my son plays with are really safe because the chemicals \n     that make them up are not rigorously tested and there is \n     little or no information regarding them. And if I, a person \n     well educated in the field of human exposure to chemicals, \n     cannot be confident that I am keeping my family safe, then \n     neither can the average person.\n\n  My office has appreciated Lisa's emails and photographs of Harrison \ndressed as a broccoli for Halloween and of Marc playing his favorite \nguitar. They have inspired us to keep going, to recognize that this \nlegislation has a tremendous impact on real people. Thanks to Lisa and \nDominique and the many others who care about a safe environment, \nhealthy kids, the safety of the clothes we wear, the pots and pans we \ncook with, and the substances we breathe, we finally have an \nopportunity to pass a law that will keep our kids safe from dangerous \nchemicals.\n  TSCA was enacted in 1967 and was one of the major laws of the 1960s \nand 1970s. That was when Rachel Carson and environmental leaders who \nworked with her opened our eyes. They showed us how air pollution, \nwater pollution, and chemicals in our environment were affecting our \nhealth and changing ecosystems right in our backyards. TSCA was \nsupposed to protect American families, but it didn't.\n  Since 1976, thousands of chemicals a year have been manufactured and \nreleased onto the market without a safety evaluation and without \nmeaningful regulation. In over four decades, the EPA has been able to \nrestrict just five chemicals and has prevented only four chemicals out \nof tens of thousands from going to market. It took 40 years to fix this \nbroken system. Now we have historic reform--decades in the making and \ndecades overdue.\n  Here are some of the ways we are reforming this broken law and \nreplacing it with a working safety program:\n  Under the old TSCA, reviewing chemicals was discretionary. This new \nlaw requires that EPA methodically review existing chemicals for \nsafety, starting with the worst offenders.\n  The old TSCA required that the EPA consider the costs and benefits of \nregulation and then study the safety of chemicals. This new law \nrequires that the EPA consider only the health and environmental \nimpacts of a chemical, and, if they demonstrate a risk, the EPA must \nregulate it. This new law states that when it considers the safety of a \nchemical, the EPA must evaluate how it would impact the most \nvulnerable--pregnant women, infants, the elderly, and chemical workers.\n  The old TSCA put burdensome requirements on the EPA. To test a \nchemical, the EPA had to show it posed a potential risk, and then it \nhad to go through a long rulemaking process. Our new law gives the EPA \nnew authority to order testing without those hurdles.\n  The old TSCA allowed new chemicals to go to market without any real \nreview. An average of about 750 new chemicals flowed onto the market a \nyear. This new law would require the EPA to determine that all \nchemicals are safe before they go to the market.\n  The old TSCA allowed companies to hide information about their \nproducts, claiming it is confidential business information even in an \nemergency. This new law will ensure that companies can no longer hide. \nStates, medical\n\n[[Page S3241]]\n\nprofessionals, and the public will have access to this information. It \nensures that businesses must justify when they keep information \nconfidential, and that will expire after 10 years.\n  The old TSCA underfunded the EPA, so it never had the resources to do \nthe job. This new law creates a new, dedicated funding stream that \nrequires industry to pay its share--$25 million a year.\n  In addition, this new law ensures victims access to the courts if \nthey are hurt, minimizes unnecessary testing on animals, and ensures \nStates can continue to take strong action on dangerous chemicals.\n  We have spent a great deal of time on the right of States to act. My \ncolleague, Senator Boxer, has said this is one of the hardest pieces of \nlegislation she has ever worked on. I agree with her. Finding the right \nbalance between State and Federal was not easy; there is no doubt about \nit. But we stayed at the table, we worked hard, and I believe we have a \ntrue compromise. It is a compromise that creates stronger Federal tools \nto test, review, and regulate chemicals, that ensures States can act \nwhen the EPA is not acting, that protects the work that States have \nalready done, and that allows States to get a waiver when there is \noverlap with the EPA.\n  Some of our colleagues have said that, while they will support this \nbill, it isn't a bill they would have written. I agree. If it were up \nto me, I would have written a different bill. But, if it were up to me, \nit also wouldn't have taken 40 years for us to get to reform. And it \nisn't up to me. It isn't up to any one of us. Legislating, especially \non complex and difficult issues--issues that affect all aspects of \nhealth, environment, and commerce--takes work, it takes patience, and \nit takes compromise. This bill took all the hard work, patience, and \ncooperation we had. The end result is a stronger regulatory program to \ntest and assess chemicals, a stronger program to ensure that our most \nvulnerable children and loved ones are protected, and a stronger \nprogram that ensures the public has access to important health and \nsafety information on chemicals.\n  Our colleagues in the House supported this bill, as I said earlier, \n403 to 12. That is two more votes than the Clean Air Act amendment got \nin 1991, so it shows strong bipartisan support. This is the largest \nmargin for a major environmental bill in decades. I believe the Senate \nvery soon will follow suit.\n  This probably isn't the place to do it. I have a long list of people \nI would like to thank in terms of the staff effort. One of the things \nthat is absolutely clear is our staff--all of our staff that were \ninvolved in this--worked very hard and helped us reach that perfect \nspot where we had a good compromise, so I will do some of those thank-\nyous at a later point.\n  But I want to say, it is very important that we realize why we named \nthis law after Frank Lautenberg. He started us on this path. It was \nFrank Lautenberg. I have a picture of him here with his grandchildren. \nThe picture was taken by his wife Bonnie Lautenberg, who is a wonderful \nphotographer.\n  Frank was always motivated. He was always motivated by his children \nand grandchildren. He used to sit in committee, and I will never forget \nhim asking questions very specifically: How does this impact future \ngenerations--children, grandchildren? What impact is this going to \nhave?\n  He became very frustrated with the gridlock, with the problems that \nwe were having in terms of the Environmental and Public Works \nCommittee. So he teamed up with Senator Vitter, and almost immediately \n12 Democrats and 12 Republicans joined in on that bill. I was one of \nthe 12 Democrats.\n  Shortly thereafter, we lost Frank, so I decided this is something \nthat should be picked up and continued. Frank had set such a great \nexample, and we had some good bipartisan momentum. So Senator Vitter \nand I had dinner, and we decided we were going to see this through.\n  One of our greatest partners--and, really, our inspiration in helping \nus see this through--was Bonnie Lautenberg. She took her pain and agony \nand wanted to get something done; she plowed it into something \npositive. She has been absolutely terrific in terms of working with all \nof us in the House and in the Senate. I know Representative Shimkus in \nthe House has said some very flattering things about her, all of which \nare true.\n  One of the things she did is help hold together Frank Lautenberg's \nstaff, who had worked on the legislation for close to 15 years. They \nhad various drafts over the years of chemical legislation. They knew \nthe facts, they knew the evidence, and they knew what was out there and \nthe dangers to the children and the grandchildren. So she worked with \nthem, and she helped keep us on track.\n  It is wonderful to have her with us today in Washington, being able \nto see this happen hopefully today, maybe a little bit later in the \nday. I want to thank her so much and have her know that she really \ninspired us, kept us focused, and kept us on track.\n  I am hopeful that we are going to act very soon. I urge all of my \ncolleagues to support this legislation. I urge the President to sign \nit. If we do that, we are going to be in a much better place as a \ncountry and as a society.\n  Mr. President, I see that my good friend Senator Inhofe, chairman of \nthe committee, is here. They always say around here--and I know my good \nfriend, Patty Murray, told me this: You don't get a bill through this \nCongress without having a strong chairman, and there couldn't have been \na stronger chairman than Chairman Inhofe.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield? Before he leaves the floor, I \nwant to get in on this because the Senator said a lot of really great \nthings.\n  I don't recall at any time someone from the private sector like the \nLautenbergs coming in and participating the way that she has. I really \ndo appreciate it. I know she is around here somewhere.\n  But let me say this to the Senator: You came in when we lost Frank \nand where we all were at that time. I have to say publicly that you are \nthe guy who jumped in there and filled the vacuum that was created by \nhis loss. We could not have done it.\n  When I stop and think about all the people who are supporting this, \nin the years I have been here--I am talking about 22 years here in the \nSenate--I have never seen this happen before, where we have so much \nunanimity, not even on the highway bills or things we have done \ntogether. I want to make sure everyone knows that you are very much the \nreason where we are today. I hope we can finish this up today and make \neveryone happy.\n  I was talking to a group yesterday. In talking about this, we haven't \nreally used the issue of jobs as we should have. They were talking \nabout how many--I will not name the companies--that are right now \nemploying in places such as China, India, and other places because of \nthe uncertainty of the definitions that we have in this country. This \ncompletely solves that. I don't think anyone has ever put pencil to how \nmany jobs can be immediately recreated in this country, along with \nother things, that will be coming in the future. This could end up \nbeing the greatest jobs bill, not of the year, but of the decade.\n  Does the Senator agree with that?\n  Mr. UDALL. I very much agree with that. When it comes to innovation, \nwhen it comes to moving in the direction of creating products that are \ngoing to be sustainable over time, I don't have any doubt that this \nbill is going to have a huge impact. I think the thing that the \nSenator, as chairman, helped us do is--we always kept everybody at the \ntable. Industry was at the table, environmental groups, public health \ngroups. The EPA was giving us technical advice. We had the States and \nothers. We stayed at the table and worked through the problems and \ncreated a piece of legislation that I think, when it becomes law, will \nend up helping to create jobs, make a safer environment, and protect \nour families and our children.\n  I will never forget when Senator Vitter and I came to you when you \nbecame the chairman at the beginning of this Congress. We told you of \nthe bipartisan support we had, and you said right then: We are going to \nget on this. We are going to do this.\n  You have been true to your word. You have worked very hard on this. \nIt has been an inspiration for me to work in a bipartisan way and have \na strong chairman. We ran into bumpy times with the House for a while, \nbut having\n\n[[Page S3242]]\n\na strong chairman really made a difference on this. So I thank the \nSenator so much.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I appreciate that--and personalities also. We had the far \nleft and the far right. Everybody realized that this is something we \nall can agree on.\n  Do I understand from the Senator that Bonnie Lautenberg is here \ntoday?\n  Mr. UDALL. Bonnie Lautenberg is here with the Congress. We don't want \nto violate any of the rules. I think she is in the room with us here \ntoday. She came down today. As the Senator knows, we have a First \nLady's Luncheon, and all the spouses attend that luncheon. Then in the \nnight, all the Senators get together for the annual dinner. Bonnie \nLautenberg has been here ever since then. She has been down here \nnumerous times, as the Senator knows.\n  I don't know if the Senator was here earlier. I was remarking on what \na great photograph this is of Frank Lautenberg. Look at the \ngrandchildren. They all have wonderful smiles. As the Senator knows, he \nalways talked in committee about his grandchildren. She is a pretty \nincredible photographer. She took this picture.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Frank and I used to talk about that. I have 20 kids and \ngrandkids. We used to compete with each other in exchanging pictures, \none of the many things that we had in common.\n  I look forward to visiting. I look forward to making this a major \naccomplishment. It is so important to do it today because we have a \nrecess coming up, the House has a recess coming up, and there are a lot \nof people and companies out there who are making decisions now as to \nwhat they are going to do, all predicated on their certainty that this \nbill is going to pass. So we will join together and just do the best we \ncan to make that happen for the sake of a lot of jobs around the \ncountry.\n  Mr. UDALL. We sure will.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               Zika Virus\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, it has now been months since President \nObama first put forward a strong emergency funding proposal to respond \nto the Zika virus. We now know that more than 1,400 cases of Zika have \nbeen reported in the United States and territories. Just today, the \nWashington Post reported that according to a new study, the odds of \nhaving a child with microcephaly as a result of a Zika infection could \nbe higher than even previously thought--as high as 13 percent for women \nwho are infected early in their pregnancies.\n  The researchers who conducted the study urged health care systems to \n``prepare for an increased burden of adverse pregnancy outcomes in the \ncoming years.'' The CDC is already monitoring almost 300 expecting \nmothers for possible Zika infections. Those numbers are unfortunately \nonly expected to grow. This is a public health emergency, and it \ndemands action.\n  While it shouldn't have taken so long, Democrats and Republicans have \nbeen able to agree on a bipartisan downpayment on the President's \nproposal, which would get emergency funding into the hands of first \nresponders and researchers right away. We passed that agreement last \nweek and, unfortunately, it hasn't gone anywhere.\n  Senate Democrats have urged our Republican colleagues to work with us \non sending our bipartisan agreement to the House for a vote, but they \nhave said they will only agree to do that if we agree to Affordable \nCare Act cuts. This is no time for quid pro quo politics or hostages. \nThis is a time to protect our families. I am going to ask again that \nour Senate Republicans reconsider and join us to get this bill to the \nHouse. There, I hope that House Republicans will drop their partisan, \nunderfunded billing and give our bipartisan agreement a vote. Then, I \nhope the President can sign it and we can get a serious response to \nthis emergency underway.\n  Families and communities are expecting us to act. Parents are \nwondering whether their babies will be born safe and healthy. In \nCongress, we should be doing everything we can to tackle this virus \nwithout any further delay.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, sometimes I feel like our Democratic \ncolleagues will not take yes for an answer. As the distinguished \nSenator from Washington knows, we have passed a $1.1 billion \nappropriation to combat the Zika virus. It is something we all agree \non, on a bipartisan basis.\n  What the Senator from Washington objects to is the fact that it \nhappens to be attached to another appropriations bill, but the process \nis that now gets reconciled with the bill passed by the House and then \nsent to the President. The good news is, there is already $580 million \nin unexpended Ebola funds that can be used as a downpayment to deal \nwith the Zika virus.\n  The Presiding Officer and I have come from States where the mosquito \nwhich carries the Zika virus is present. We all appreciate the \nseriousness of this, and we are determined to act on a bipartisan \nbasis. The Senator from Washington knows that, but that doesn't stop \nher and her colleagues from coming to the floor and making demands that \nwe do this instantaneously.\n  Mr. President, to give you a sense of what is going on, we have been \ntrying to get our Democratic colleagues to allow us to pass the Defense \nauthorization bill all week. What we have been told is, no, they need \nmore time to review it. Every Democrat in the Armed Services Committee \nvoted for the Defense authorization bill. It has been posted online for \nsome time now. Anybody who cares about what is in the bill has had \nplenty of time to read it. Even though the Senate voted unanimously \nyesterday to proceed to the legislation--which is not a word you hear \noften around here, ``unanimous''--the bill has been stopped in its \ntracks by our Democratic colleagues. It is shameful because this is our \nprimary vehicle to make sure our men and women in the military get the \nresources and equipment they need in order to defend the country. That \nis why Congress has been able to pass a defense authorization bill \nevery year for 50 years-plus. Taking care of our national defense is \nour No. 1 job in the Federal Government, but the Democratic leader and \nhis colleagues, apparently with their complicity, have been doing \neverything they can to slow down this legislation. They know we are \ncoming up on a weeklong Memorial Day recess, so they have delayed it \nanother week before we can take it up when we return.\n  This also gives our men and women in uniform a pay raise, but \napparently they are being used once again as a political pawn or \nfootball. It is shameful, and it is unnecessary. Somebody said: Well, \nit is just politics. It is one of the reasons the American people look \nwith such disdain at what happens in Washington these days because \nthese sorts of things--politics, partisanship--get put ahead of our \nduty to protect those who defend the Nation.\n  We will have a vote later on today to get on the bill. I know Senator \nMcCain, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, is eager to get \non this bill, to deal with the amendments. The majority leader has said \nthe week we come back, we will not leave until we complete our work on \nthe Defense authorization bill.\n  I think one of the reasons our friends across the aisle are dragging \ntheir feet on this legislation is because they are getting a little \nworried at the contrast between the productiveness of the 114th \nCongress compared to the 113th Congress when they were in charge. We \nknow what happened then, after a disastrous election, which many \nincumbent Democrats lost the election because they didn't have anything \nto point to as a record of accomplishment because of the failed \nstrategy of the then-majority leader from Nevada. Even Senators in the \nmajority party didn't have records of success they could point to, to \ncommend them to the voters for their own reelection. It was a \ndevastating loss. The majority became the minority, and new management \nwas put in charge.\n  Senator McConnell, the majority leader, said he thinks it is \nimportant for the Senate to return to its regular\n\n[[Page S3243]]\n\nrole, considering and building consensus to pass bipartisan \nlegislation, and that is exactly what we have done. Ironically, many of \nour Democratic friends, who are now in the minority, have had a greater \nopportunity to participate in passing legislation as Members of the \nminority more so than they did when they were in the majority, \nessentially when Senator Reid shut down the U.S. Senate.\n  We have seen a productive Senate this year and last, notwithstanding \nthe efforts to shut down the Defense authorization bill. For example, \nlast week the Senate passed three bills. It passed an appropriations \nbill, it passed the POLICE Act--to make sure our law enforcement \nofficials get the training they need to, to deal with active shooter \ntraining--and we passed a bill called the Justice Against Sponsors of \nTerrorism Act. They all had strong bipartisan support. That last bill \nis making sure families who lost loved ones in 9/11 get justice--the \njustice they deserve, wherever the facts may lead.\n  The bottom line is, we are doing our dead-level best, despite the \ndead weight of the other side, on occasion--such as the Defense \nauthorization bill--to stop us from making progress. I think it is \npretty clear what is going on, so I will not dwell on that any longer, \nbut my response to them is to simply stop playing politics with our men \nand women in uniform and drop the stall tactics. It is blatant, it is \nobvious to everyone with eyes in their head, and it is absolutely \nshameful.\n\n\n                               Coast Act\n\n  Mr. President, in less than a week, hurricane season will be upon us. \nThe Presiding Officer knows that well, coming from Florida. Residents \nalong the gulf coast will be preparing for all that a major storm might \nbring, including flooding, storm surges, and high winds. The hundreds \nof miles of Texas coast and the State's location along the Gulf of \nMexico make it particularly vulnerable to hurricanes and storms. That \nwould be Texas. Because the area is so densely populated--Houston, TX, \nfor example, right there in the middle of the Texas gulf coast--and \nincludes one of our Nation's busiest ports and energy hubs, the \npotential for major damage along the Texas coast could have significant \nramifications, not just for the region but for the rest of the country \nas well.\n  When Hurricane Ike made landfall in 2008, we got a glimpse of how bad \nit could be. The storm caused a tremendous amount of damage as it made \nits way through the Caribbean, from Haiti to the Dominican Republic and \nCuba. Storm surges in parts of Texas were estimated to be as high as 20 \nfeet. Ike was the second costliest U.S. hurricane on record, causing \nbillions of dollars' worth of damage. Sadly, it took the lives of \ndozens across the Caribbean and the United States.\n  As the hurricane season gets underway, I know many Texans have been \nreminded of that terrible storm and many worry about the potential \ndamage another big storm coming through our coastline would bring. It \nis not a question of if, it is a matter of when that is going to \nhappen. We need to make sure we are doing what we can to protect those \non the coast and to protect our economy from the next Hurricane Ike.\n  I have been encouraged to see many efforts underway at the State and \nlocal level in Texas on how to develop the best plan to approach the \nproblem. Several groups in the State are currently studying the \ncoastline and determining where Texas is most defenseless against a \nmajor storm.\n  In Congress, I have joined with other members of the Texas delegation \nto authorize the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to assess the \nvulnerabilities and to propose how we can best mitigate future damage, \nbut there is room to do more because we know this process is simply too \nslow. It is not as fast as it needs to be, which is why I introduced \nsomething I call the COAST Act, which stands for the Corps' Obligation \nto Assist in Safeguarding Texas. It is pretty straightforward.\n  This legislation would require the Corps of Engineers to use the data \nin other studies that are sound science and already completed for their \nplanning at the State and local level. In that way, the Corps of \nEngineers is not just duplicating efforts and burning the clock when we \ncan't afford to do that. So we can speed up the process so the Texas \ncoast can get the protection it needs sooner. It would also let the \nfinal recommendations of the Corps proceed without going through \nnumerous and unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles. In other words, once the \nCorps determines the best course of action to keep Texans on the coast \nsafe, they will not have to wait for another congressional approval to \nauthorize it. The COAST Act is a lesson in streamlining the Federal \nGovernment--something we could use more of--so that folks who may be in \nharm's way can get what they need faster. I want to particularly \nexpress my appreciation to Congressman Randy Weber on the other side of \nthe Capitol, who has introduced a similar bill as well. I hope that as \nwe prepare for the upcoming hurricane season, we can get this \nlegislation passed.\n\n\n              Calling for Appointment of a Special Counsel\n\n  Mr. President, on one final matter, yesterday the inspector general's \noffice at the State Department released a 70-plus-page report telling \nus what many people suspected all along. That report criticized then-\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton's use of a private, unsecured email \nserver while she was our Nation's top diplomat and having access to and \nprocessing highly classified information--some of our Nation's most \nconfidential and classified secrets. Some people have wondered why \nrecent poll numbers have not been kind to Mrs. Clinton when it comes to \nher trustworthiness. A Washington Post-ABC News national poll found \nthat just 37 percent of the people who responded to that poll believe \nHillary Clinton is honest and trustworthy, while 57 percent said they \ndon't think she is. This is a serious problem, not just for Mrs. \nClinton but for the country.\n\n  There are those who wonder why people are so upset with Washington. \nWhat they see is a culture of corruption that doesn't address some of \nthese fundamental issues. Well, time and again we have heard Secretary \nClinton and her allies say that her use of a private email server was \nwholly consistent with State Department policy. But, of course, the \nreport that was just released by the inspector general yesterday says \notherwise and revealed a host of other inconsistencies.\n  First, the report indicates that Clinton's email use was not in \naccordance with State Department standards, and, more than that, the \nformer Secretary of State neglected to get the formal approval she \nneeded in order to use her private server.\n  Second, Secretary Clinton and her supporters, including the \nPresident, have maintained that her server was not a security risk, \nwhile others, such as former Secretary of Defense Bob Gates, said they \nwere confident that our Nation's adversaries--China and Russia, well \nknown for their cyber attacks--were taking full advantage of an \nunsecured server and using and gaining access to classified information \nwhich was now--in the words of Representative Pompeo, who serves on the \nIntelligence Committee in the House--like putting intelligence on \nTwitter. In effect, that is what Mrs. Clinton did. But, of course, the \nreport from the inspector general calls all of this into question and \nasserts that when some of Clinton's staffers raised concerns about a \npotential breach to the system, the relevant security officials at the \nState Department were not alerted. They just weren't alerted in \naccordance with State Department policy. Even though Secretary Clinton \nhas maintained that she has been fully complying with every request \nrelated to an investigation of her use of the private server, the \ninspector general report makes clear that the Secretary and her staff \nrefused to be interviewed. That is not cooperating with the \nauthorities. She can't refuse to talk to the FBI, and a number of her \nstaffers have been, and she said she will make herself available. I bet \nshe will because she really doesn't have any choice. But to say she is \ncooperating with an investigation by the inspector general at the State \nDepartment and then refusing to be interviewed is just--well, let's \ncall it what it is--a lie.\n  Similarly, the report reveals that Secretary Clinton didn't turn over \nall of her work-related emails upon leaving office, like she said she \ndid. She only did so almost 2 years after leaving, and the State \nDepartment basically had to demand it, even then we know she deleted--\nshe told us this--\n\n[[Page S3244]]\n\nthousands of emails before turning over those she deemed work related. \nI suspect the forensics experts at the FBI have been able to recover a \nlot of the emails that she deleted. We all know if you delete emails, \nthey remain on the server in a digital format. The truth will come out \nsooner or later, but I just have to say the conduct of the former \nSecretary demonstrates why people just don't trust her. Of course, the \nrecent contradictions are just outrageous and indicate that rather than \ncooperation, her intention has been to obstruct the public's right to \nknow.\n  This report underscores why I believe we need an independent \ninvestigation into this matter. I called for the appointment of a \nspecial counsel because it is clear that the Attorney General, who \nserves at the pleasure of President Obama, is going to have very little \nincentive or intention to pursue the appropriate investigation. So I \nhave asked Attorney General Lynch to appoint a special counsel to \nprovide some modest level of independence so the public can know that \nwe have gotten to the bottom of this despite Secretary Clinton's \ndenials and obfuscation and statements of untruth. We need to get to \nthe bottom of it. It is absolutely critical that we do so.\n  I hope Attorney General Lynch reconsiders my call for a special \ncounsel.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                            Opioid Epidemic\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, we have come to a crisis point in our \ncountry. In 2014, 18,893 people died due to a prescription opioid \noverdose. On average, 51 people die every day. What we are talking \nabout is legal prescription drugs that are basically produced by \npharmaceuticals, which are great companies. They are approved by the \nFood and Drug Administration, which is supposed to look out for the \nwell-being and welfare of all the citizens of this great country. They \nare prescribed to us by our doctors, the most trusted persons outside \nof our family. Now it has become an epidemic. It is doing more harm to \npeople than anything I know of right now.\n  When I talk about an epidemic, we have lost over 200,000 people since \n1999, and not to raise this to the level that we should so we can fix \nthis is ridiculous, and the trend is still going in the wrong \ndirection. Some 16 percent more people died in 2014 than died in 2013. \nWe have lost almost 200,000 Americans to prescription opioid abuse \nsince 1999, as I said, and we must take action to stop the epidemic. \nUnfortunately, a major barrier that those who are suffering from opioid \naddiction face is inefficient access to substance abuse treatment.\n  There is not one of us in the Senate or in our States, who doesn't \nhave somebody in their immediate or extended family or a close friend \nthat has not been affected either by legal drug abuse or illicit drugs. \nIf you talk to those without any means, you know they have nothing. \nThey have nowhere to go. There are no treatment centers, and we haven't \nstepped up to the plate.\n  All of the States' budgets are taxed, if you will. Every time we do \nsomething with the Federal Government's budget, we have to have a pay-\nfor. We have been looking for ways to do something to make sure that \nevery State has a sufficient amount of treatment centers to help those \nwho need it. In fact, between 2009 and 2013, only 22 percent of \nAmericans suffering from opioid addiction participated in any form of \naddiction treatment. We talked about addiction treatment. For so many \nyears, we all looked at any type of drug use as being the crime, and we \nput them away. We put them in jail. We spent $450 billion in the last \n20 years for incarceration. Not one time did we look at this issue and \nsay: This might be an illness, and an illness needs treatment, and a \ntreatment can actually cure somebody. We haven't thought along those \nlines, and it needs to change.\n  In 2014, in my State of West Virginia, 42,000 West Virginians, \nincluding 4,000 children, sought treatment for legal drug abuse but \nfailed to receive it. They needed treatment. They said: Please help us. \nThink about this. A family who has done everything, including \nexhausting all of their resources, has to have their child arrested and \nconvicted with a felony so that child can go to drug court and get the \ntreatment he or she needs. Isn't that a sad scenario? The largest long-\nterm facility in West Virginia with more than 100 beds is Recovery \nPoint, in Huntington. It has a waiting list that is 4 to 6 months long. \nThis is the most successful treatment center, and it is run by former \naddicts. These are people who hit rock-bottom. They know what it takes. \nThey have all come back and have been keeping themselves clean and \nmentoring other people. They have more of a success rate than anyone I \nknow of in my State.\n  In 2014, about 15,000 West Virginians received some form of drug or \nalcohol abuse treatment, but nearly 60,000 West Virginians were \nidentified as in need of substance abuse treatment and couldn't find \nhelp.\n  Based on conversations with West Virginia State Police, 8 out of 10 \nof all of their calls are drug related. Imagine if the Presiding \nOfficer, who is from the beautiful State of Florida, should ask his law \nenforcement how many calls they get that are drug related. It is \nunbelievable. The costs are prohibitive as far as what we are spending \nnow and how much is being taken out of our economy. These are people \nwho have recognized they needed help and were turned away because there \nwere not enough facility beds or health care providers in their \ncommunity or they couldn't afford the pricey high-end facilities out \nthere.\n  That is why I joined my colleagues this week to introduce the \nBudgeting for Opioid Addiction Treatment Act. This Life BOAT Act would \nestablish a steady, sustainable funding stream to provide access to \nsubstance abuse treatment. This is a difficult thing for a lot of my \ncolleagues and friends on the other side of the aisle. Somehow, we have \nto step up to the plate and not worry about this being a tax. There are \nthose who have said that we can't take out another tax and have \npledged: I won't go for a new tax.\n  How about voting for treatment? How about voting to help people? How \nabout voting to put people back in the economic mainstream to be a part \nof this great country of ours? How about taking them out of the prisons \nand not incarcerating people who don't have violent or sexual crimes \nand can basically be rehabilitated? We have a tax on cigarettes because \nwe know it is harmful to you. We have a tax on alcohol because we know \nit is harmful for you. We have nothing on opioids. I have a piece of \nlegislation--and we are looking for more and more sponsors all the \ntime--that would tax 1 penny for every milligram of opioid that is \nprescribed. We know opioids are addictive. We were led to believe that \nthey weren't addictive.\n  When opioids first came out in 1980, the pharmaceutical companies \nsaid this is a wonder drug with 24-hour relief from severe pain, and it \nis nonaddictive. Guess what. The genie is out of the bottle, and we \nlost 200,000 citizens. But we have doctors prescribing them.\n  We prescribe more opioids than anyone in the world. We consume more \npainkillers than anybody in the world. I am talking about the entire \nworld. There are only 330 million in our country. When we look at the \npopulation of the world, which consists of 7 billion people, and we \nconsume over 80 percent of all opioids produced in the world. We only \nhave 5 percent of the world's population. Something is dead wrong. That \n1 penny will generate--if you can believe this--$1.5 to $2 billion a \nyear. This is what we call the penny of gold. We can help people. We \ncan go back to every community and every State in this great country of \nours and help people get their lives back. We can help people get clear \nand clean and working again.\n  Every week I come to the floor and read a letter. I read letters from \nall over the country. I read letters of those from my State who have \nbeen affected. The legal drug abuse of opioids has been a silent \nkiller. We haven't talked about it enough. We have had someone in our \nfamily--whether it is your child, mother, father, aunt, uncle, or \ncousin--and we were ashamed. Guess what. We continue to lose more and \nmore people. Now they are coming forward.\n  I want to read another letter. These letters have a common theme. \nThey mention how hard it is to get themselves or their loved ones into \ntreatment. Sometimes it takes months, and sometimes it never happens. \nThis problem stems from our lack of systems to\n\n[[Page S3245]]\n\nhelp those who are looking for help. We need permanent treatment \nfacilities to help people get clean and stay clean.\n  I say to all of my colleagues: This is not a Democratic or Republican \nproblem. This is an American epidemic, and I don't believe one person--\nwhether Democrat or Republican--can argue against voting for 1 penny to \ntry to help cure people who have been affected by this epidemic. It \nwon't cost anybody one vote--not one vote. I hope they will consider \nthat.\n  Today I am reading an anonymous letter from a veteran in West \nVirginia about his struggle to get his sons into one of the treatment \nfacilities they desperately need.\n  He says:\n\n       I'm sure many have heard my story before. I have a 34-year-\n     old son that first got addicted to Oxycontin while residing \n     in Wyoming County. He had been in trouble with the law for \n     stealing everything from ATVs or whatever he could get his \n     hands on.\n\n  Most addicts, as you know, basically commit a felony. First, they \nsteal from their families or friends of their family. When they run out \nof people who won't turn them in, they steal from anyone's home they \ncan break into--anything they can do to get the money that gives them \nthe fix they need for their addiction. Then they end up with a felony, \nand the system basically spirals down.\n  This young man stole everything he could get his hands on. They went \nto a methadone clinic. They have methadone and Suboxone. These are \nwonder drugs that are supposed to help an addict wean off drugs, but \nthey never do. Methadone and Suboxone still have the heroin effect in \nthem. And people get on those and they can't get off of them either.\n\n       Well then a Methadone Clinic was opened in Beaver, WV. He \n     went to this clinic. I'm not sure what dosage he started at \n     but I know till here recently he was on 120 milligrams a day.\n\n  And 120 milligrams a day is a lot.\n\n       He had lost his take homes--\n\n  Which is what they give him to self-medicate.\n\n     --so he had to drive from Mercer County to Beaver, WV, \n     everyday. He had trouble holding down jobs, so if he didn't \n     have the money he couldn't go or get dosed. The clinic there \n     only takes cash or credit card.\n       I helped my son finance his home, cars, and lots of time I \n     wasn't getting paid, I would pay these to protect my credit \n     but I might not get my money back.\n\n  This is the father's and mother's credit.\n\n       So here recently I started to stop paying things.\n\n  Cut him off cold turkey.\n\n       Now he has pawned most of what he had in his house for \n     cocaine, he says it's to help him with methadone withdrawals, \n     I'm not sure. But his wife is getting ready to leave him, \n     their son has been living with me since November of 2015.\n       My wife and I called and tried to find him a detox and \n     inpatient treatment, but since he hasn't weaned down at the \n     clinic they say he don't meet their criteria. My son hasn't \n     had methadone to the best of my knowledge since May 8th, \n     2016.\n       I have told him he can't live in his house if he can't pay \n     the bills. He says he will accept treatment at a detox, the \n     only place I found that may take him is a behavioral health \n     at Appalachian Regional in Beckley for his depression and \n     bipolar and they will help him to be safe while going through \n     withdrawals.\n       We don't have the money to afford private care, he is on WV \n     Medicaid. Most places he can go is out of state and WV won't \n     pay for it. I'm so afraid that I'm going to lose my 34 year \n     old son to this dilemma. I hope there is someone out there \n     that can hopefully get him free of his addictions, so he can \n     live and prosper.\n\n  He said that is only one son.\n\n       That's one son, my other son, is 30 and he too has some \n     addictions and mental health issues. I paid his rent for 2 \n     months to remove him from my home because he was so \n     disruptive and searching for alternatives, such as he has \n     been going to southern highlands for over 4 years for [his] \n     bipolar [treatment].\n       He has been seeing the same physician. He has checked \n     himself into the Pavilion in Mercer County several times but \n     checks himself out he says its [be]cause they won't give him \n     his medications that he wants.\n\n  This is another problem we have. A lot of people who go to the \nhospitals or clinics, if they don't get what they want, they give a bad \nreport to the doctor or medical facility, and it hurts them on their \nreimbursement for Medicare and Medicaid. We have a piece of legislation \nto change that also.\n\n       He has been prescribed clonopins and Neurontin's. He \n     prefers to either take them all at once per day or more than \n     prescribed, since I moved him out of his apartment, I hear he \n     diverts them for other drugs. He hasn't had a job in years.\n       I don't know what to do to help my two sons. I know the \n     system hasn't seemed to benefit them at all but they still \n     get their medications and etc.\n\n  It kind of keeps their addiction going on.\n\n       If they don't get the prescribed ones they search for \n     street drugs and they will sell their own soles and [even] \n     mine to get them. What is a parent to do?\n       For mothers it's hard to see your child in pain and maybe \n     more willing to give them money and so forth but I have \n     learned that is only enabling them. But there is so many ones \n     out there it's too easy for them to get the drugs or divert \n     them.\n       I feel we need to do a few things. One, we must either put \n     strict controls on methadone clinics--\n\n  And I can assure that methadone clinics do not work and shouldn't be \nprescribed to everyone, and there should be professionals who prescribe \nmethadone and it should be closely regulated--\n\n     and not let them keep our families hostage for their life.\n\n  What they mean by that is that once they go to these clinics, they \nnever let them go. They are with them for life.\n\n       Two, counselors and physicians need to try and understand \n     what is a success in treatment or failure. If our children \n     can't function in normal society, hold down a job, take \n     medications as directed, that plan of treatment isn't \n     working, let's do something else . . . don't keep doing the \n     same thing to get them out of the office.\n\n  Why keep them in the same type of program to give them the fix they \nare looking for when they are never going to be cured? Don't keep going \nto the same thing and expect a different result. Let's get them out of \nthis type of situation.\n\n       It's not working, what is next?\n\n  People are asking and begging for help. They truly are, in West \nVirginia, in the Presiding Officer's beautiful State, and every State. \nIt is atrocious what is going on.\n  We have legislation, and I think we can put our politics aside. This \nis not Democratic or Republican. I have said it over and over. This \ndoesn't have a home. This is a killer. It is epidemic--200,000 have \ndied. In my State of West Virginia last year, 630 West Virginians died \nof legal prescription overdoses--legal. This is not counting illicit \noverdoses--legal prescription overdoses.\n  So I am committed to fighting this with every breath I have in my \nbody. I hope we will consider legislation we can work on, that is \nbipartisan and that will help every person in every State in America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, we are on a motion to proceed to the \nNational Defense Authorization Act, and there are so many different \naspects of national security and defense that we touch upon. The \nSenator from West Virginia actually touched on one of them. A lot of \npeople may not consider it that way, but the threat posed to the United \nStates by transnational criminal groups operating out of Mexico and \nother parts of the hemisphere are a direct threat to the security of \nour people.\n  We had a hearing earlier today in our subcommittee, the Western \nHemisphere Subcommittee, and we heard testimony from government \nofficials and the administration talking about the threats being posed.\n  Here is the bottom line. You have these multibillion dollar, \nmultinational entities operating south of our border. We all heard \nabout El Chapo Guzman and the Sinaloa Cartel, but there are others as \nwell, and they are both growing poppy opiates, but they are also \nmanufacturing synthetic fentanyl. There is a prescription version of \nfentanyl, but this is a synthetic, nonpharmaceutical version, and all \nof it, basically 100 percent of the stuff they are growing, is being \ntrafficked directly to the United States. There is not a State in the \nUnion or territory in our country or jurisdiction represented by any \nMember of the Senate which has not been deeply impacted by this war \nthey are waging against us. So it was an insightful hearing and I think \nreminds us that on the one side we need to deal with treatment aspects \nbecause people who are dependent on an opiate substance are sick and \nthey need help as if it is a disease, not a crime.\n\n[[Page S3246]]\n\n  The other aspect of it is the people pushing the stuff into our \ncountry, deliberately targeting us. They are murderers. They are not \njust killers because they kill each other and innocent people, they are \nkillers because they know the people they are selling these drugs to, \nthey are deliberately trying to hook them on these drugs and they read \nand know the overdose deaths we have seen. There is an extraordinary \ngrowing military-to-military relationship between the national defense \nparts of our government and our partners in Mexico and other countries \nand will continue to be. There has to be because these groups need to \nbe defeated or they will continue to spread their poison and death into \ncities, towns, and our States.\n\n\n                              Human Rights\n\n  Madam President, another aspect of national defense that people don't \nthink about when people think about national defense is the issue of \nhuman rights. So much of the instability that is happening around the \nworld that we have to respond to militarily out of our national \nsecurity interests are driven by the violation of human rights.\n  Oftentimes our soldiers, sailors, our service men and women, when \ncalled to engage militarily or be present militarily in any part of the \nworld, are also having to deal with the consequences of what is \nhappening from a human rights perspective. Where it gets difficult is \nin many cases some of the countries that are violating the human rights \nof their people and others happen to be military allies of ours. It is \nalways a balance that people argue, but no matter what our arrangements \nmay be with any potential military partner anywhere in the world, we \nshould never back away from the cause of human rights, for not only is \nit the right thing to do, which speaks to our values as a people and \nnation, but human rights is also a leading cause of instability. The \nviolation of human rights leads to this instability. It is what causes \npeople to take to the streets to try to get rid of their governments \nand their leaders.\n  So I come to the floor today to bring to your attention an ongoing \nhuman rights issue that weighs heavily on me and should weigh heavily \non all of us. Every day people are unjustly detained, tortured, \npublicly shamed, and murdered, often at the hands of their own \ngovernment. Here is what their crimes are: simply disagreeing with the \ngovernment--disagreeing through journalism, blogging, peaceful \norganizing, or for simply being in a different religion. In jail cells \nall around the world, there are innocent men and women who wanted \nnothing more than to freely express themselves in the society in which \nthey live.\n  The vast number of political prisoners held by repressive regimes is \na sobering reminder of how much work remains to uphold basic human \nrights and advance democratic values. From Cuba to China, from Turkey \nto Saudi Arabia, people are suffering for exercising freedoms that our \nCreator gave them.\n  I say the phrase ``political prisoners,'' but I remind you that these \nprisoners oftentimes are ordinary people like us--people who dream of a \ngreater future for their country, people who envision a better life for \ntheir families and loved ones. They are journalists, bloggers, many are \nhuman rights activists, educators. Some are politicians. We also have \npastors, mothers and fathers and students.\n  America traditionally has been a voice for those oppressed. We as a \ncountry and as a people have engaged in what Ronald Reagan once \ndescribed as ``the age-old battle for individual freedom and human \ndignity.'' It is unacceptable for America to forsake this legacy today, \nto turn its back on our fellow human beings who are losing their lives \nor being imprisoned for exercising their fundamental, God-given \nfreedoms.\n  This is why last September my office launched a social media campaign \nwe call hashtag ``expressionNOToppression.'' Each week we highlight a \ndifferent political prisoner or prisoner of conscience in an effort to \nput a human face on the many who suffer from oppressive regimes around \nthe world.\n  Today I come to share the stories of some of the people we have \nchampioned in the past year.\n  In 2014, Tibetan writer and blogger Dawa Tsomo was detained for \nbreaking China's cyber laws by publishing articles that the government \nconsidered ``politically sensitive.'' To this day, she is missing. \nToday, China is one of the most repressive countries in the entire \nworld.\n  In Cuba, matters are just as serious, if not worse. Beatings, public \nacts of shame, and termination of employment are well-known \nconsequences of disagreeing with the Castro regime. The Castro regime \nhas rearrested almost all of the 53 political prisoners it released as \npart of the supposed normalization of relations that President Obama \nundertook at the end of 2014.\n  Remember the 53 names on the list of people they were going to let go \nas part of the normalization? Virtually all 53 of them have since been \nrearrested.\n  The Cuban people know they deserve better. Groups throughout the \nisland have continuously stood up against oppression. One of the most \nprominent is the group the Ladies in White or, in Spanish, Damas de \nBlanco. Many of those who make up this group are the wives and \nrelatives of jailed dissidents protesting the unlawful imprisonment of \ntheir husbands, sons, brothers, and fathers. So each Sunday following \nCatholic mass, the Ladies in White take to the streets in a silent \nmarch. They are often harassed, arrested, and even beaten by the Cuban \nGovernment.\n  In fact, this last Sunday, the leader of the Ladies in White was \narrested. She will soon be placed on trial and can face between 3 \nmonths and 5 years in prison, but this sort of treatment hasn't stopped \nthem. Week after week, these women continue to protest the Castro \nregime and fight for the freedom of their nation and of their loved \nones.\n  In the disaster that has become Venezuela, due to its incompetent \ntyrant leader, Nicolas Maduro, a tyrant who is an incompetent clown, we \nhave seen one of the most prominent opposition leaders, Leopoldo Lopez, \narrested and sentenced to 13 years 9 months in prison on charges of \nterrorism, murder, and grievous bodily harm and public incitement--\nsounds like pretty serious charges. Here is the reality. Leopoldo \nLopez, who was the Governor of a prominent state in the country, was \nimprisoned for advocating for a constitutional democratic and peaceful \nchange in the Venezuelan Government. That is why he is in jail.\n  Since the Venezuelan Government's crackdown on opponents began in \nFebruary of 2014, dozens of innocents have been killed, thousands have \nbeen beaten and targeted for intimidation, and hundreds more have been \njailed, not to mention that most of these political prisoners in \nVenezuela are men.\n  Do you know what happens to the wives of these men in jail when they \ngo visit their spouses in prison? They are often stripped-searched by \nmale guards in front of their families as the act of ultimate \nhumiliation. This is what we are dealing with in Venezuela.\n  In late March of this year, the Venezuelan National Assembly passed a \nlaw that would extend amnesty to more than 70 prisoners in Venezuela \nbecause they had an election. Even though the Maduro government always \nsteals the elections in Venezuela, the loss was so overwhelming they \ncouldn't steal this election. So the opposition won control of the \nVenezuelan National Assembly, and they passed a law that extended \namnesty to more than 70 political prisoners who are in Venezuelan jails \nsimply because they opposed Maduro, not because they committed a crime.\n\n  To no one's surprise, the tyrant Nicolas Maduro promised to block it. \nHe claimed it was unconstitutional. Only a few weeks later, he sent a \nlaw to the supreme court and urged them to overturn it. Four days after \nhis request, the supreme court--a supreme court which is illegitimate \nbecause it is completely stacked with his cronies--granted him his wish \nand declared the law unconstitutional.\n  So that is why there has been a coup d'etat in Venezuela. That is why \ndemocracy has been canceled and why there is now tyranny. You have an \nelected national assembly being ignored, and you have a supreme court \nbeing stacked with cronies who are basically a rubberstamp for the \ntyrant. The result is the gross violation of human rights, most \nprominently of Leopoldo Lopez.\n  In Pakistan, we have seen proponents of religious freedom murdered \nfor criticizing blasphemy laws. In March of\n\n[[Page S3247]]\n\n2011, Shahbaz Bhatti, Pakistan's Federal Minister of Minority Affairs--\nand, by the way, the only Christian to serve in Pakistan's Cabinet--was \nshot to death by the Pakistani Taliban outside of his mother's home. \nFive years have passed. The Pakistani Government has failed to bring \nhis murderers to justice and have failed to reform the blasphemy law \nthat continues to encourage violence, murder with impunity, and the \nmarginalization of religious minorities. As a result, numerous other \nprisoners of conscience in Pakistan suffer behind bars.\n  Finally, as President Obama visited Vietnam this week, a Vietnamese \nblogger and human rights activist named Nguyen Huu Vinh was languishing \nin a state prison for having voiced the wrong opinions about his \ngovernment.\n  These example are just a tiny window into the world of political \noppression that exists today. Their cases are only a few that we have \nhighlighted in our hashtag ``expressionNOToppression'' campaign.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a list of \nadditional political prisoners we have featured.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The list is as follows: Danilo Maldonado of Cuba, Jason \n     Rezaian of the United States--held in Iran, Bao Zhuoxuan of \n     China, Sawan Masih of Pakistan, Raif Badawi of Saudi Arabia, \n     Ko Htin Kyaw of Burma, Arif and Leyla Yunus of Azerbaijan, \n     Luaty Beirao of Angola, Atena Farghadani of Iran, Ismail \n     Alexandrani of Egypt, the Todos Marchamos group in Cuba, \n     Eskinder Nega of Ethiopia, Erdem Gul of Turkey, Can Dundar of \n     Turkey, Vladimir Kara-Murza of Russia, Mikhail Kasyanov of \n     Russia, the SOS Venezuela group in Venezuela, Sombath \n     Somphone of Laos, Boris Nemtsov of Russia, who was murdered, \n     the Ladies in White in Cuba, Zainab Al-Khawaja of Bahrain, \n     Osvoldo Rodriguez Acosta of Cuba, Mohammed Zahir al-Sherqat \n     of Turkey, Waleed Abu Al-Khair of Saudi Arabia, Khadija \n     Ismayilova of Azerbaijan, Nguyen Van Dai of Vietnam, and \n     Youcef Nadarkahni of Iran.\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. They span the globe from Angola to Laos, from Iran to \nBurma. All of these men and women were seen as a threat to the leaders \nof their nations. But I--and I agree the Presiding Officer as well--see \nthem as heroes. Just because they aren't fighting on a battlefield \ndoesn't mean they aren't putting their lives on the line for the \ngreater good of their people and their nation.\n  In a country where we are free to express ourselves, it is hard to \ngrasp this risk. It is difficult to imagine a prominent journalist in \nthe United States fearing for his or her life solely for doing their \njob or to fathom a popular blogger facing the death penalty solely for \nexpressing their thoughts. Well, this should be just as unimaginable, \nto jail independent journalists in the rest of the world.\n  The families of the prisoners I mentioned today have also paid a \nprice. Most of these families spend their days and nights unsure if \nthey will ever again see their loved ones. There are no visiting hours. \nThere are no phone calls. In the cases of many on death row, their \nfamilies often find out they have been executed on the state-run media. \nChildren are being left to grow up on their own, wondering where their \nmother or their father has gone, wondering if they will ever feel their \nembrace again.\n  But there are reasons to be hopeful, for when free people speak out, \nit can make a difference in the lives of the oppressed. As a result of \nnumerous international efforts, including our hashtag \n``expressionNOToppression'' campaign, some prisoners of conscience have \nbeen released from jail and reunited with their families, although they \nmay not be able to return to their home country. We saw it in the case \nof the Cuban street artist known as El Sexto, who was freed last \nOctober after 10 months in prison. We saw it in the case of prominent \nAzerbaijani human rights activist Leyla Yunus and her husband Arif, who \nwere released from jail only on the grounds of deteriorating health but \nhave since been allowed to travel to the Netherlands for medical care \nand to be reunited with their daughter. Once released, many have agreed \nthat our advocacy on their behalf was a great encouragement to them and \ntheir families and, by the way, likely resulted in better treatment or \neven a speedier release.\n  A few years ago, famed Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky testified on \nCapitol Hill. He said of himself and fellow prisoners of conscience in \nthe USSR that ``we could never survive even one day in the Soviet Union \nif our struggle was not the struggle of the free world.'' We should \ntake to heart this sentiment he expressed and embrace the struggle of \npolitical prisoners who languish unjustly as I speak.\n  We must do everything we can to raise awareness of the brutality \ntaking place in repressive regimes around the world. We must not forget \nthe hundreds of people who are being tortured or being deprived of \ntheir lives for trying to bring freedom to their land while \nillegitimate governments desperately cling to power.\n  Even with our strategic allies, such as Saudi Arabia, we can never \nstop insisting that they show respect for women, for all human life, \nand for the God-given fundamental rights of all people.\n  Oppressed peoples do not stay oppressed forever. Oppressive \ngovernments do not stay in power forever. Inevitably, the human \nyearning to be free and to achieve a better life for one's self and \none's family eventually cannot be restrained.\n  Today, I pray for those who are victims of their own government. I \npray for the release of prisoners of conscience and their families. I \npray that our own country stands firmly by its principles by calling \nfor the sacred right of every man and woman and child to be free.\n\n\n                      Tribute to Maggie Dougherty\n\n  Lastly, Madam President, on a point of personal privilege, I would \nlike to take a moment to thank Maggie Dougherty, who has been a \nvaluable member of my legislative team for the past 5 years and \nspecialized in issues of human rights around the world.\n  Her expertise and, just as importantly, her passion on these issues \nhave been invaluable to me and to my staff. Her service to our country, \nto the people of Florida, to the Senate, and to many individuals and \nfamilies like the ones I just mentioned who suffer around the world \nwill not be forgotten.\n  I thank you for your service, Maggie. I wish you the best of luck in \nyour future endeavors.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n     Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Bill\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, today I rise to discuss the Frank R. \nLautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act. This is landmark \nlegislation that will honor the legacy of our dear colleague Frank \nLautenberg. I had the privilege to serve with Frank for a number of \nyears and know how passionately he wanted to undertake this challenge \nof the toxic substances that are in our everyday products, our \nhousehold products, that are causing cancer and causing other diseases \nbecause we have completely failed to regulate them. I so much \nappreciate that Frank Lautenberg took on this cause, pushed it forward, \nand presented it in a bipartisan fashion--a fashion that continued \nfollowing his death.\n  In this Congress, this bill is the equivalent of a unicorn, as the \nphrase goes, a bipartisan, bicameral compromise that majorly reforms a \nbadly broken law. It has brought Democrats and Republicans together to \ntake action to protect public health. I felt honored and privileged to \nbe a part of this coalition that has worked toward a final bill for \nover a year. This process has not been easy, but things that are worth \ndoing rarely are easy.\n  I think it is important to recognize some of the champions in this \nprocess. Of course I recognize Frank Lautenberg and all he did to put \nthis in motion.\n  Following his death, Senators Tom Udall and David Vitter deserve a \ntremendous amount of credit for having the bold vision to come together \nand to carry the torch of bipartisan compromise after his passing. \nTheir persistence and their dedication in this effort through thick and \nthin have been remarkable.\n\n[[Page S3248]]\n\n  Chairman Inhofe also deserves a great deal of credit for his work to \nshepherd this bill through the Environment and Public Works Committee.\n  Hopefully, we will get it through the floor of the Senate. Certainly \nthe result of the bicameral negotiations that have been completed--the \nbill has now gone through the House and is coming back over here.\n  I commend Ranking Member Barbara Boxer for her leadership and her \ndetermination to make this the strongest bill it could possibly be. Her \ndetermination to make sure of the ability of States to act was not \ncompromised, knowing that her State, California, has been a major \nleader--one of the few States that really have gone after toxic \nchemicals and set an example for the country. Her tenacity \nunquestionably has led to a stronger bill.\n  Senator Markey, as the subcommittee ranking member, brought enormous \ndepth of knowledge and leadership to this process and was instrumental \nin the negotiations.\n  Finally, I especially want to thank Senators Whitehouse and Booker, \nwho teamed up with me to push for important changes before the markup \nin committee and who have been tremendous partners through the process.\n  There are many others, of course, in the Senate and in the House, on \nthe Republican side and the Democratic side, who have played a role in \ngetting this bill to where it is now--a few small steps from being \nsigned into law.\n  I would like to specifically thank the Environmental Defense Fund. On \nany project like this, you need forces inside the building, but you \nalso need forces outside the building marshaling expertise, creating a \nconversation among grassroots proponents, and bringing their expertise \nand their insights to bear. Their lead senior scientist, Richard \nDenison, played an instrumental role in the preparation of this bill.\n  Many Americans don't know that the chemicals in their household \nproducts are completely unregulated. It has been 40 years since the \nlast major reform to our Federal chemical laws took place. There has \nbeen absolutely no action of any kind since 1991, when there was a \nfailed effort to regulate asbestos, which, again, citizens believe must \nsurely be regulated given its incredible impact on the public health of \nour Nation.\n  But for 40 years the law has been badly broken, and for 40 years \ngenerations of Americans have been exposed to unsafe chemicals and the \nFederal Government has been powerless to act. That is four decades too \nlong.\n  The most powerful Nation on the Earth should not be powerless to \nregulate toxic chemicals in our everyday products. Now we are on the \ncusp of passing a historic bill that will change all of that.\n  How bad is this problem? Last year I partnered with the Environmental \nDefense Fund and with researchers at Oregon State University to find \nout just that. The Oregon State University researchers developed a \nsmall silicone wristband that picks up toxic chemicals that each of us \nis exposed to every day, in the air and water around us, in our \nfurniture, and in our household products. Twenty-five participants wore \none of these silicone wristbands for a week, and then the wristbands \nwere taken to a laboratory to analyze what the individual had been \nexposed to. The results were sobering. Each participant had been \nexposed to at least 10 potentially dangerous chemicals.\n  Beth Slovic, a reporter for Willamette Week who wore one of the \nwristbands, described scouring labels in her household after her \nresults came back, trying to find out which products were the culprits \nso she could get rid of them, but largely she couldn't find the source.\n  She wrote:\n\n       Even if I had [found the source], I wouldn't have been safe \n     from worry. You can try to avoid certain synthetic chemicals \n     in your own home, but try avoiding them at work or on the \n     bus. Products with industrial chemicals, such as those \n     sprinkled in carpets and cushions supposedly to keep them \n     from bursting into flames, break down and are in our dust.\n       As the information packet for the [wristband] experiment \n     explained, ``You can't shop your way out of the problem.''\n\n  Beth mentioned the issue of industrial chemicals that are put into \nour carpets, supposedly to keep them from bursting into flames. There \nis quite a story behind these flame retardants in our carpets, in our \nupholstery, in our foam cushions, and it is not a story that will make \nany of us feel good. It will make all of us feel we need to have this \nbill passed, however.\n  Here is the challenge: These flame retardants are cancer-causing. The \nchemical industry got a bill passed requiring them to be put into \nhousehold products such as foam, upholstery, and carpets.\n  Imagine that you are a new mother or a new father and your little \nbaby is down there on the carpet, their nose 1 inch from the floor, and \nthen you read about the fact that carpet is permeated with cancer-\ncausing chemicals, that those chemicals cling to the dust that comes \nfrom the carpet as it is worn out, walked on and so forth, and that \nvirtually every child gets exposed in this fashion, increasing their \nrisk of cancer. Wouldn't you as a mother or father say: That is \noutrageous. Why doesn't Congress do something about that?\n  We are now poised to do something about that, to regulate cancer-\ncausing toxic chemicals in our household products. It is way past time, \nbut we have to seize this moment and make it happen.\n  Right now Americans are powerless to protect themselves from \nchemicals that hurt pregnant women, chemicals that hurt young children, \nchemicals that can hurt their child's development, and chemicals that \ncould cause cancer.\n  Since TSCA passed in 1976, over 4 million babies have been born with \nbirth defects and 15 million babies have been born preterm. Since 1976, \n21 million people in the United States have died of cancer. And just \nsince the Fifth Circuit case that struck down the Environmental \nProtection Agency's ban on asbestos in 1991, about 375,000 Americans \nhave died from mesothelioma, a disease directly linked to asbestos \nexposure.\n  Clearly we need to change our law and replace a dysfunctional law \nwith one that will work. This bill is set up in a fashion that it will \ntake on the most serious, high-risk products that are already in our \nenvironment--the high-risk molecules--and have a thorough process for \nstudying them and then acting appropriately in the cases where citizens \nare exposed to those products. This bill provides a process for looking \nat future chemicals before they are put into our products, before they \ncause health problems for Americans, before they cause disease, before \nthey cause cancer, before they cause birth defects, and before they are \nattached to dust that gets into the lungs of our little babies crawling \non carpets. That would be a tremendous improvement. We will make sure \neveryday products are safe before they are in our classrooms, before \nthey are in our workplaces, and before they are in our homes.\n  Because of this bill, the EPA will have the tools and resources \nneeded to evaluate all of the dangerous chemicals that are already in \nthe market, and they will have the muscle to eliminate unsafe uses. \nThere is nothing more important than helping the health and well-being \nof Americans now and for generations to come.\n  One key element of this dialogue has been on whether it compromises \nthe ability of States to act when they detect chemicals they are \nconcerned about. This bill has been specifically constructed to make \nsure States have that power. Any law written before April 22 is \ngrandfathered. Certainly any bill that was written to control lead \npipes in homes, that was written in the past, is grandfathered. You \ndon't have to worry about any sort of pause or preemption of State \nauthority.\n  Anytime the Federal Government says there is a high-priority \nchemical--one they are going to take a close look at--there is a period \nof time called scoping. In that period of time, any State that proposes \na rule--all action on that rule is grandfathered; it can go right \nahead. If the State has passed a law in that period, the law is \ngrandfathered.\n  Then, during the period of time which is referred to as risk \nevaluation following the scoping and determining what particular forms \nof exposure are ones that create a risk, during that time, the only \nthing that would cause a State to be unable to act is if it was exactly \nthe same chemical in exactly the same use out of the hundreds of \nthousands of chemicals in the world.\n\n[[Page S3249]]\n\n  Furthermore, even then, there is a waiver that says the State can act \nif they show there is a scientific paper that shows that chemical is a \nrisk, if they are not violating the supremacy clause of the \nConstitution and if they are not violating the commerce clause of the \nConstitution. So, in fact, States have full power to operate throughout \nthese phases as a result of these various clauses.\n  The bipartisan team that has worked on this has run a marathon \ntogether. Now, after many miles, innumerable meetings, and late nights, \nwe are just inches from a momentous improvement over current law. \nCurrent law has been completely, 100 percent dysfunctional for decades, \nleading to the exposure of our children, our babies, ourselves, and \neveryone in America to a huge list of toxic chemicals.\n  Senators in this Chamber will get a lot of attention for their work \non this bill, but I wish to note that behind the scenes, the staff has \nlabored day and night--a bipartisan team of staff. They worked many \nlate nights and they had many sleepless moments while trying to figure \nout and finesse good policy and a path that would keep this bipartisan \neffort rolling forward.\n  I especially wish to thank my staffer who has taken the lead on this \nissue. Adrian Deveny has done a tremendous job. He has put in an \nenormous amount of time contributing substantial expertise and has \nworked hard to reach out to other staff members and other offices to \nlisten and understand the challenges and the many perspectives and find \na way forward. He made sure that when things were tense, lines of \ncommunication stayed open.\n  Because people stayed in the room and listened to each other, the \nstaff and the Senators, on a bipartisan, bicameral basis, remained \ncommitted to the vision laid out by Frank Lautenberg that we will no \nlonger allow Americans to be routinely exposed to toxic chemicals in \ntheir household products. That means taking on the existing chemicals, \nand that means having a process for new chemicals before they are \nintroduced and making sure they do not pose a new challenge, a new \ndisease, a new risk.\n  The finish line is within sight, and it is up to all of us to get \nthere for the safety and health of every American. Let's get it done.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are postcloture.\n  Mr. WICKER. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, let me congratulate my friend from \nOregon for his remarks and simply point out to the Chair and to my \nfellow Members that this is another example of bipartisan \naccomplishments in the Senate and in the House. This represents a lot \nof work on both ends of the building, Republicans and Democrats coming \ntogether. As my friend said, it is about to get done.\n  When we put this on top of a number of accomplishments, including \neducation, including dealing with the Zika virus, including dealing \nwith the drug problem and so many other things, we have actually been \nable to get legislation done and sent to the President and signed into \nlaw to help make our country better, stronger, and better protected.\n  I appreciate what my friend said about the TSCA bill. I am also \noptimistic about it.\n  Madam President, switching gears to the National Defense \nAuthorization Act, I am also optimistic about that. Obviously, we had \nhoped to pass the bill before Memorial Day as a tribute to the people \nwho have gone before us and paid the ultimate sacrifice for the freedom \nwe enjoy as Americans. Obviously, the bill has taken longer than I \nhoped it would and for reasons that are hard for me to understand. \nNevertheless, we are going to get to it. We are on the bill now, and we \nare going to hopefully finish it the week after the Memorial Day \nrecess.\n  I very much appreciate the fact that we are going to pass another \nbipartisan NDAA bill, which will be signed by the President. It is \ngoing to give our troops the opportunity to have the tools and \nresources they need in a very dangerous world.\n  It funds the Defense Department at $602 billion. Our friends should \nknow and the public should know that this $602 billion is the figure \nrequested by the President of the United States, so we are coming with \na bipartisan number. We have had some questions on the part of our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle about spending elsewhere, but we \nshould be clear--and there is no question about it--the President \nrequested $602 billion for defense, and this bill gives our troops and \nthe President that $602 billion. It deals with such important issues as \npreserving the progress we have made in Afghanistan, continuing our \nfight against the Islamic state, bolstering readiness against an \naggressive Russia, standing up on behalf of one of our most important \nallies, the state of Israel, in a very troubling time.\n\n  Earlier this year, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper \nsaid it correctly. He reiterated the reality of unpredictable \ninstability. And that is what we are facing, Madam President. So this \nbill is designed to address that.\n  Also, I would mention it is designed to alleviate some of the \nshortages caused by the Budget Control Act when it was passed in 2011. \nThe world is a lot different today than it was in 2011. As a last \nresort, the law put in place across-the-board defense cuts that were \nreally never intended to take place. Collectively, we should have \naddressed the mandatory programs where the spending problems actually \nare, but instead, over the past 6 years, the Budget Control Act has \nrequired almost $200 billion in defense cuts. Sequestration remains the \nlaw of the land and will return unless Congress acts in 2018.\n  The Army now has 100,000 fewer soldiers than it did 4 years ago. The \nMarines will be nearly 5,000 below their optimal force. Our Air Force \nis the smallest it has ever been in the history of the Air Force. And \nwith 272 ships in the fleet, the Navy is well below its requirement of \n308 ships.\n  I am pleased to serve as chairman of the Subcommittee on Seapower of \nthe Committee on Armed Services. As such, I was happy to work with \nother members of the subcommittee on the Navy and seapower title to \nthis bill. I want to thank my colleague Senator Hirono of Hawaii, the \nranking Democratic member of the subcommittee, for her leadership.\n  As I said, we are years away from achieving the Navy's ship \nrequirement of 308 ships. There is also no plan to meet the National \nDefense Panel's recommendation for more ships--either 323, at a \nminimum, or up to 346 ships. So we are well away from where we really \nneed to be to protect America and our freedom of movement around the \nglobe. Meanwhile, the Navy has significant budget constraints. Its 2017 \nrequest is $8 billion less than the 2017 value presented in last year's \nbudget.\n  Nonetheless, we worked on a number of items to do the best we can \nwith the money we have. First, we looked at the viability of the 30-\nyear shipbuilding plan. Secondly, we worked to ensure that limited \ntaxpayer dollars are used wisely. Thirdly, we looked forward to the \nfuture and what should be required of our future surface combatant \nships and what costs might constrain the budget. And fourthly, we \nworked to ensure that the Navy and Marine Corps can continue to provide \nforce protection around the world.\n  So thanks to the members of my subcommittee and my ranking member \nSenator Hirono for that.\n  But seapower is only one part of the bill. It may be the one I have \nworked on more carefully, but there are other parts of the National \nDefense Authorization bill. As you know, Madam President, there is no \nauthorization in the bill for another round of base closings. I very \nmuch support that provision and believe that no further base closing \nrounds should be authorized, and we don't.\n  Also, there is an extension of prohibitions on the closing of \nGuantanamo Bay and a prohibition of the transfer of any detainees from \nthere. There is also support for the recommendation of the National \nCommission on the Future of the Army regarding aviation force \nstructure. I advocated the creation of this commission, along with my \ncolleague Senator Graham, in the wake of unvetted proposals to cut the \nsize of\n\n[[Page S3250]]\n\nthe National Guard and reallocate Apache helicopters. So I am glad we \nhave addressed that problem and are on the way--hopefully week after \nnext--to passing this important bill.\n  It is fitting that Americans will gather on Memorial Day in the next \nfew days, remembering the patriots who made the ultimate sacrifice and \nhonoring the patriots who are today voluntarily stepping forward to \nmake our country strong and great and helping all our citizens enjoy \nthe freedoms we have today.\n  I am glad to be part of this bill. I congratulate the leadership of \nthe committee and the Senate, and I look forward to passing this \nDefense bill without further delay.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that on \nMonday, June 6, notwithstanding rule XXII, following morning business, \nthe motion to proceed to S. 2943 be agreed to and the Senate proceed to \nthe consideration of S. 2943 and Senator Fischer, or her designee, be \nrecognized to offer her amendment No. 4206; further, that the time \nuntil 5:30 p.m. be equally divided between the managers or their \ndesignees, and that at 5:30 p.m. the Senate vote on the Fischer \namendment, with no second-degree amendments in order to the amendment \nprior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Now, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at \n1:30 p.m. today, the Senate proceed to executive session for the en \nbloc consideration of Calendar Nos. 462 and 463; that there be 15 \nminutes for debate only on the nominations, equally divided in the \nusual form; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote \non the nominations in the order listed without intervening action or \ndebate; that if confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made \nand laid upon the table; that the President be immediately notified of \nthe Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative session \nwithout any intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                               Zika Virus\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, we are here just a few days before \nMemorial Day, when all across the country, Americans are going to go to \nparades to pay tribute to troops who made the ultimate sacrifice. They \nwill invite friends and family over and fire up the grill. I think we \nall look forward to those family gatherings.\n  At least that is what Americans usually do over this holiday weekend. \nThis year, they might have second thoughts. I know I am getting asked a \nlot of questions by my family, not because of rain but because of \nsomething more frightening. Since the beginning of the year, public \nhealth experts have been warning us about a severe threat to moms and \nbabies--the Zika virus. It causes severe damage to fetal brains, birth \ndefects, and even death.\n  Zika is not just coming to the United States; it is already here. \nPeople are concerned, and they want us to act. There are already more \nthan 150 pregnant women in the United States who have been infected, \nand we are hearing of more every day. We have four in Michigan so far, \nand the threat is growing.\n  We are fortunate to have doctors and scientists at the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health \nwho have the skills and the knowledge to get Zika under control. I have \ngreat confidence in their ability to create a vaccine, to do what needs \nto be done on testing, and to get the information we don't have right \nnow on the full impact of the Zika virus.\n  These brilliant minds are ready to go to work in the lab to find a \ntreatment, to develop a vaccine that can help protect the health of \nbabies, of pregnant moms, and of women of childbearing age. We are now \nhearing about a different kind of reaction to the Zika virus in men, as \nwell, so we are still learning every single day. But that work will be \ncostly. Specifically, these doctors and scientists asked for $1.9 \nbillion, and they included an extremely detailed action plan for where \nthe money would go and the work that would be done.\n  Unfortunately, we have not yet sent an appropriation to the President \nof the United States to sign so they can get to work. Republicans in \nCongress have said no to the full request. Senate Republicans have \nagreed to $1.1 billion. I am glad we have been able to get agreement to \nmove something forward as a first step, even though it is not what the \nscientists and doctors have said needs to happen. But I signed on \nbecause it was the best we could get at the moment, and we have to get \nstarted.\n  What is incredibly concerning is that the House of Representatives \nwas even more shortsighted. They gave researchers only one-third of \nwhat they asked for--one-third of what they say they need to go into \nthe lab and develop the vaccines that will protect our children, will \nprotect pregnant moms, and protect all of us who may be impacted in \nsome way.\n  On top of that, in the House, they are using gimmicks to disguise the \nfact that they are raiding one public health fund to pay for another. \nSo it is as if there is a fire, and you send a fire engine out. Then \nanother fire starts on the other side of town. And instead of sending a \ndifferent fire engine out, you just take the one and send it to the \nother fire. Well, wait a minute. People wouldn't put up with that in \nthe community, and they certainly aren't going to put up with what we \nare seeing coming from the Republicans in the House. So they are \nplaying games and denying doctors and researchers the money they need \nto keep us safe.\n  Many of these Members talk tough about keeping Americans safe, but \nright now we have a frightening virus that is getting more severe every \npassing day. Yet Republican colleagues, particularly in the House, have \nno sense of urgency. We haven't seen a sense of urgency to take the \nSenate compromise out of an appropriations bill, put it into an \nemergency bill, and send it to the President.\n  Madam President, I can't imagine how scary this must be for a \npregnant woman right now--even for women in Michigan, where the threat \nis far less severe than in other parts of the country. Yet when my own \nfamily members, when others across Michigan--friends I talk to, the \nothers I have had a chance to talk to in the last couple of weeks--turn \non the television, they have to hear from Republicans in Washington who \nrefuse to take this threat seriously.\n  We have to take this seriously. Make no mistake, this is a major \npublic health emergency. These mosquitoes are not picking and choosing \nwhether they are going to bite Democrats versus Republicans. The \nreality is that this is a public health emergency for all Americans, \nand we need to treat it as that.\n  For Republicans to go home for Memorial Day without dealing with this \nthreat is incredibly insensitive and irresponsible. We have work to do. \nThis is another case where we need to make sure we are doing our job. \nWe are here; we are willing to do that. We must equip our doctors and \nmedical researchers with the tools they need to keep our families safe.\n  For a threat of this scale, we should not be delaying in any way, and \nwe can't do this on the cheap. We can't only do part of it. We have to \ndo what needs to be done with the doctors, the researchers, and the \npeople we trust in our country. We have the most brilliant minds in the \nworld. They are telling us what needs to be done, but they need the \nresources to get it done.\n  The richest Nation in the world can't afford to take the steps \nnecessary to defeat the world's most urgent public health crisis. \nReally? I don't think so. It is time to act.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that since \nSenator\n\n[[Page S3251]]\n\nInhofe and I will speak on the same important topic, we speak back to \nback for up to 15 minutes total.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n     Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Bill\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, we rise together with so many other \nMembers of the Senate on a bipartisan basis to strongly support the \nchemical safety bill which passed the U.S. House of Representatives \nwith enormous bipartisan support and is ready to pass here in the \nSenate.\n  This is a long day coming. First, this is an element of Federal law \nthat has been in dire need of updating. All stakeholders--left, right, \nand middle--have said that for decades. Secondly, we have been working \non this specific bill, this solution to that problem, for over 5 years.\n  I started over 5 years ago with what I think we would reasonably \ncharacterize as a Republican proposal, in contrast to a clearly \nDemocratic proposal by then-Senator Frank Lautenberg. We had these \ncompeting partisan proposals for some time, but in early 2013 we made a \nvery determined effort to try to bridge that divide and come up with a \nstrong bipartisan proposal to achieve two absolutely necessary \nobjectives: one, to make sure we fully protect the health and safety of \nall Americans with regard to chemicals that are in products we use \nevery day--that is paramount, and that has to happen--and two, to make \nsure we do it in a way that allows American companies to remain science \nand innovation leaders in this important sector of our economy.\n  I have to say that when we started these discussions in early 2013, I \nthink both Frank Lautenberg and I were very cynical about our chances \nof success. We were miles apart, but we were determined to get this \ndone. We met and negotiated and discussed in good faith. Our staffs did \nas well. That led to a real breakthrough in 2013--a bipartisan bill to \nupdate this area of environmental law with regard to chemical safety.\n  In 2013 we introduced the first bipartisan proposal with regard to \nthat. Sadly, Frank Lautenberg passed shortly after we completed that \nwork and introduced that bill. But I am very happy that many others \ntook up the cause, led on the Democratic side by Tom Udall of New \nMexico. Many others were involved. I see Senator Booker here, Frank \nLautenberg's successor in that New Jersey Senate seat. He has been \ninvolved. Certainly the chair of our committee, Jim Inhofe, has been \nextremely involved and in the weeds in a positive way and supportive. \nOver the 3 years since the introduction of the first version of the \nbill, that led to this strong bipartisan bill we have before us that \npassed the House with overwhelming support.\n  Not many things pass the U.S. House of Representatives with that sort \nof overwhelming support--I think there were a total of 12 ``no'' votes. \nNot many things come to the U.S. Senate with this sort of near \nunanimous or unanimous support. Nothing in the last several decades in \nthe category of major environmental legislation has done that.\n  This is a major achievement, and it is a positive achievement when we \nlook at the substance of the legislation. It ensures the proper \nprotection of health and safety for all Americans because these are \nchemicals in products that we use and touch every minute of every day \nand that enhance our lives and quality of life, and it is a workable \nregulatory regime that does it in a workable way so that American \ncompanies in this sector--and a lot of them, I am proud to say, are in \nLouisiana--can remain science and innovation leaders. That is why it \nhas widespread industry support. That is why it has widespread support \namong many other groups, including environmental groups. That is why it \ngarnered such an overwhelming bipartisan vote in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. And that is why it has overwhelming bipartisan support \nhere in the Senate. The Senate version of this bill passed by voice \nvote. There were no articulated objections to it. It passed by voice \nvote with very strong support. That remains the base of this bill. That \nremains the heart and soul of this bill.\n  The final version--the bill we are considering now--has been posted \nonline for almost a week. Under the House rules, that needed to happen. \nThat happened late last week, and it has been publicly available for \nsome time, certainly enough time for all Members to dissect and digest \nit. So I encourage final positive action on this bill to move us \nforward in a significant way.\n  Madam President, with that, I yield to the chairman of the committee, \nwho has been a great leader to advance this cause.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, first, let me thank the Senator from \nLouisiana. It has been a long fight for a long time. Of course, I \nunderstand that Bonnie Lautenberg--who has been a very significant part \nof the discussion as we have gone along--is here today, and she is \nliving this historic day with us. I say ``historic day'' because the \nSenate can take the final steps necessary to send the Frank R. \nLautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act to be signed into \nlaw. That can happen today. Today the Senate can pass a bill with a \ntremendous amount of support. I think the Senator from Louisiana \narticulated it very well. We had individuals from the far right and the \nfar left all in agreement.\n  I would add to that that we have an impressive list of groups that \nare supporting this: the Obama administration, American Chemistry \nCouncil, Environmental Defense Fund, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Humane \nSociety, National Association of Manufacturers, March of Dimes, \nAmerican Petroleum Institute, National Wildlife Federation, Alliance of \nAutomobile Manufacturers, Americans for Tax Reform, National \nAssociation of Chemical Distributors, and American Fuel & Petrochemical \nManufacturing. Everybody. We are talking about labor unions and \nmanufacturers. It is very rare.\n  I agree with the Senator from Louisiana. I don't recall, in my \nexperience here, ever having the array of support from organizations \nand people that we have with this. I have been working along with that \ngroup since 2012, and then Senator Lautenberg approached me and asked \nfor my help. I think that was the time Republicans became a majority--\nno, we were still a minority at that time. But he wanted to have \neveryone involved in this from the different parties and different \nphilosophical realms, and that is exactly what happened.\n  I know my friend Bonnie Lautenberg, as I mentioned, is here today. I \nhave never seen a bill in process that has garnered the support of \nsomeone like, in this case, the widow of Frank Lautenberg. She is there \nall the time, making sure this proper tribute we are going to make \ntoday becomes reality.\n  I think the key provisions have been covered by my friend from \nLouisiana. Let me join him in thanking all our friends from the left \nand friends from the right for joining together on something that is \nreally good for America.\n  One thing that hasn't been talked about very much is the number of \njobs. I talked to a large group of manufacturers yesterday, and they \nsaid we never talk about jobs. There are jobs overseas today because of \nthe uncertainty here in terms of how we are treating chemicals in this \ncountry. They can't put forth the money and resources necessary unless \nthey know there is certainty that they are going to be able to use \nwhatever chemicals they have to use to produce whatever they are \nproducing. Where are they now? They are in China, India, Mexico--places \nwhere they don't have to deal with this problem. So that is a major \nthing that is happening.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 2576\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be \ndetermined by the majority leader, in consultation with the Democratic \nleader, the Chair lay before the Senate the message to accompany H.R. \n2576; further, that the majority leader or his designee be recognized \nto make a motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate \namendment; that there be no other motions in order and there be up to 3 \nhours of debate equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees on the motion; finally, that upon the use or yielding back of \ntime, the Senate vote on the motion to concur in the House amendment to \nthe Senate amendment with no intervening action or debate.\n\n[[Page S3252]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, reserving the right to object, one of the \npledges I made to the people of Kentucky when I came here is that I \nwould read the bills. This bill came here on Tuesday. It is 180 pages \nlong. It involves new criminalization--new crimes that will be created \nat the Federal level. It includes preemption of States. It includes a \nnew Federal regime which would basically supersede regulations--or lack \nof regulations--in Louisiana or Texas or Oklahoma. I think it deserves \nto be read, to be understood, and to be debated, so I object to just \nrushing this through and saying: Oh, you can't read the bill.\n  I told people--everybody involved in this--I just want to read the \nbill. We have been working on it now for 2 days, looking at the bill. \nWe have been talking to people who worked on the bill. Is it not \nunreasonable to ask that we have time to read a bill?\n  Here is the other problem: Every day in my office, business comes \ninto my office. And what do they say? We are regulated to death. We are \nsick and tired of regulators from the executive branch who are out of \ncontrol.\n  So what does this bill do? It takes the power away from the States \nand creates a new Federal regulatory regime.\n  Here is the whole problem: People are now saying ``Please regulate \nus,'' and when they get overregulated, they say ``Please stop \noverregulating us.''\n  We should think through how we are going to do things around here. We \nshould take the time to read the bills. We should take the time to \nunderstand the bills.\n  I will continue to object until we have had time to look at the bill \nthoroughly. With that, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, let me say that I regret an objection to \nthis very reasonable path forward. No one objects to all Members of the \nSenate reading the bill. I encourage all Members of the Senate to read \nthe bill. There has been and is continuing opportunity to do that.\n  As you heard, that unanimous consent request wasn't rushing through \nanything; it was a 3-hour debate and a rollcall vote.\n  The final version of the bill has been publicly available for \neveryone to read, dissect, and digest for about a week. It is largely \nsimilar to the Senate version that passed months ago and to which there \nwas no objection raised. That passed by voice vote. So there is no \nimpediment to everyone having adequate time to read and digest the \nbill. The final version has been available for that purpose for about a \nweek.\n  I think it is unfortunate that we can't move forward in this sort of \nclear, reasonable, and straightforward way, but we certainly will in \nthe near future, and I look forward to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I regret that the Senator from Kentucky \nhas left the Chamber because the two things he mentioned were the \ncriminal provisions and the preemption. The criminal provisions and the \npreemption have been with us for 6 months--not for 2 days, not for 3 \ndays, but for 6 months. That is exactly what we voted on in December. \nYou can't ask for more time than that to consider the provisions of a \nbill.\n  The other thing is that we are all supporting the two components of \nthe bill--that is, the criminal provisions and the preemption. Again, \nthey have been here for 6 months.\n  I ask that we have a chance to reconsider. We know this is going to \npass. We know that when we get back, it will pass. It will pass because \nwe have to go through all the procedures of a cloture vote on the \nmotion to proceed and all that. So we know it is going to pass. That is \nnot the issue. It is just that if we could do it now instead of 2 weeks \nfrom now. There are people making decisions today as to what they are \ngoing to be doing and what products they are going to be manufacturing \nand where they are going to do it. And to put that off for 2 more weeks \nafter we have been working on this for 6 months is not a fair way to \nconduct business.\n  I hope that later on today we will have an opportunity to get this \ndone. There is no reason not to do it. Everyone is for it. Every group \nI mentioned is for it. Every Democrat, Republican, liberal, \nconservative is all for it. This is our opportunity to get it done. \nThere is still time today to do that. I hope that between now and 1:45, \nwhich is the scheduled time for our vote, that will be a reality.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, I am very grateful that my chairman of \nmy committee, Environment and Public Works, spoke so eloquently about \nthe issues surrounding this bill. I am new to the Senate--at least in \nSenate terms--because I have been here for 2\\1/2\\ years, but I have \nnever seen such a broad-based coalition involved in supporting a bill--\na coalition that extends from the far right to the far left, a \ncoalition that brings industry and activists together, a coalition that \nbrings environmentalists together, as well as those who seek economic \ngrowth. This is a tremendous coalition. But even more so for me as a \nrelatively new Senator, it has been one of the greatest privileges I \nhave had in the Senate to work together in such a cooperative way to \nbring about legislation for which you really could build such a broad \nbase of support.\n  I applaud my colleagues, and I applaud the chairman and the ranking \nmember. I applaud all the members on the EPW Committee and others for \nworking on a bill that does earn, in my opinion, speaking as a man from \nNew Jersey, the right to have the name of my predecessor Frank \nLautenberg on it.\n  Senator Lautenberg was a giant in New Jersey. He served this country \nwith distinction. He was a veteran. He was a public servant. He \nactually ran a business and grew it to be a mighty one in my State and \nbeyond. You cannot truly begin to appreciate the void that was left by \nhim, but the great thing about this champion of transportation, of \ninfrastructure, of consumer safety, of fighting for his fellow \ncitizens, this champion's work, where he began working in partnership \nwith Senator Vitter to try to move this forward and then sadly died--\nthis is one of his great legacies. One of his great contributions was \nhis effort to begin what has now been a multiple-year effort to reform \nthe toxic hazardous chemical law. Senator Lautenberg's efforts were the \ninstigating factor, the ignition of this success that we are having \ntoday of such a broad-based bill, of such broad-based support. It \nreflects his work, his efforts, and his legacy.\n  I am very proud I had the honor of finishing Senator Frank \nLautenberg's term in the Senate last year. During that time and still \ntoday, I see on a daily basis the urgency around his efforts.\n  I know that after Senator Lautenberg passed, his spirit was still \nvery much manifest in this area when his wife, Bonnie Lautenberg, took \nup the important cause and served as one of the fiercest champions in \nstrengthening this bill we are talking about now. She was here working, \nlobbying, nursing, pushing, cajoling, convincing, making sure we got to \nthis day.\n  I am very proud that during my 2\\1/2\\ years, I was able to enter into \nthe work to get this legislation to where it is today. I saw Senator \nTom Udall's leadership, and I want to praise that. I saw how tireless \nhe was working on this. I am grateful for Senator Udall's, Senator \nVitter's, Chairman Inhofe's, and everyone's staff, as they worked \ntogether to get this bill to where it is today.\n  At the beginning of 2015, my colleagues, Senator Whitehouse and \nSenator Merkley, and I began by negotiating with Senators Udall and \nVitter to make what we saw as urgently needed improvements to this \nbill. Working together, I am proud we were able to make those \nimprovements to the preemption provisions that were involved in some of \nthe things my colleague from Kentucky was just talking about--making \nsure that States still have a role in the process, still have power and \nauthority in this process, and have the ability now to co-enforce with \nthe Federal Government around this bill.\n\n[[Page S3253]]\n\n  I was also very proud of a provision in this bill that will \nsignificantly minimize new animal testing and potentially save tens of \nthousands of animals from unnecessary suffering.\n  I am proud that the revised bill passed out of the EPW Committee with \nstrong bipartisan support. I am also proud that since the EPW Committee \nhas improved this bill, Senators Udall and Vitter have stayed at the \nnegotiating table and continued to take input from folks on both sides \nof the aisle, continuing to make this a better bill.\n  Senators Merkley, Durbin, Boxer, the bill's sponsor, and others have \nmade additional changes to make this bill strong.\n  We would never have gotten this strong of a TSCA reform bill if it \nweren't for the work of people on both sides of the political aisle, if \nit weren't for the work of people within industry, if it weren't for \nthe work of advocacy groups, and if it weren't for groups I have come \nto respect a tremendous amount, such as the Environmental Defense Fund, \nwhose early engagement and constant pressure played such an important \nrole.\n  This is one of those rare moments where you have a full court press, \nboth sides of the aisle and individuals who are representing multiple \nsectors all coming together to make a strong bill. They are making a \nstrong bill because everyone was in agreement that the legislation we \nhad--decades' old, the TSCA bill--was broken. It was broken in that it \ndid not protect consumer safety. It was broken in that it did not give \npredictability and certainty to the industry. It was broken because it \nput America's health at risk. Whether it was children or our seniors, \nit created an environment where people could get sick. It had no teeth. \nIt had no strength. When this bill becomes law, it will protect \nAmerican families, it will protect our children from dangerous \nchemicals, and it will give industry the certainty it needs.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass the Frank Lautenberg bill today. I want \nto thank everyone again. This is a result of a tremendous coalition of \nefforts, a symphony of focus and work, of people coming together to do \nsomething that many people think is rare in the Senate--that we all can \nwork together across partisan lines to make good legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                         Tribute to David McBee\n\n  Mr. COTTON. Madam President, I want to recognize today David McBee of \nGassville, AK, as this week's Arkansan of the Week for his charitable \ncontributions to his North Arkansas community. By day, David is the \nregional manager at Arvest Bank's Yellville branch, but he spends much \nof his free time after work and on the weekends volunteering for \nseveral causes in the area.\n  Last year, David's leadership helped his Arvest branch become the top \nfundraiser in the State for the Cotter Backpack Program, a local \ncharity that provides backpacks of food to schoolchildren in need. His \nefforts led to Cotter schools receiving the Spirit of Arkansas Award 2 \nyears in a row.\n  David also spends countless hours organizing the annual Cotter \nWarrior 5K Color Run each fall. Earlier this year, David planned a \ncommunity Feed the Pack Day, where volunteers collected change at \nintersections and various other sites around the Mountain Home and \nGassville area and donated the proceeds to fight hunger in the region.\n  On the weekends, you can find David at the football field, where he \nis one of the voices of the Arkansas Tornados, a local semiprofessional \nfootball team. I think Cotter High principal Amanda Britt said it best \nwhen she wrote in her nomination of David, ``He is always willing to \nstep in and help for anything we need.''\n  David's tireless dedication to his community is Arkansas at its very \nbest, and I am proud to recognize his many contributions in this small \nway.\n  David, on behalf of all Arkansans, thank you for all you do to make \nour home State a better place.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to executive session for the consideration of the \nnominations previously ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/senate-section/article/S3234-3"}, {"day": "26", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3253-S3255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session for the en bloc consideration of the \nfollowing nominations, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read the nominations of Laura S.H. Holgate, of \nVirginia, to be Representative of the United States of America to the \nVienna Office of the United Nations, with the rank of Ambassador; and \nLaura S.H. Holgate, of Virginia, to be the Representative of the United \nStates of America to the International Atomic Energy Agency, with the \nrank of Ambassador.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 15 \nminutes equally divided for the consideration of these nominations.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n               Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Bill\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I rise today to talk about an issue \nthat affects all of us in this Chamber and all of the communities we \nrepresent. I also rise on behalf of the 200,000 Ohioans who are \ncurrently struggling with an addiction to prescription drugs or \nopiates.\n  Heroin and prescription drug addiction has gripped our country. \nUnfortunately, we are facing an epidemic now, and I want to rise today \nto talk about how we can do a better job to address that. This is the \nseventh time I have come to the floor of the Senate to speak on this \nissue since the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act passed the \nSenate on March 10. That vote was 94 to 1, showing that Members from \nevery single State are affected by this and want to address it. The \nComprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, CARA, is a good start and \nwill make a big difference because it is comprehensive and it addresses \nevery aspect of the issue, from education and prevention through \ntreatment and recovery, and helps our law enforcement folks and helps \nget these prescription drugs out of our communities. It is a good piece \nof legislation that I hope we will be able to get to the President's \ndesk for his signature.\n  For the first 5 weeks I came to the floor, I talked about the fact \nthat I hoped the House would act. I urged the House to act quickly on \nthis emergency that is affecting our communities. Last week I came to \nthe floor to say thank you to the House because they did act. They \nvoted on 18 separate bills. Combined, they were a response to this \nepidemic, and I think that was a very important step forward.\n  I am encouraged that now the two Chambers, the House and Senate, are \ntrying to figure out a way to come together with a conference to come \nup with one bill that can be sent to the President for his signature. I \ndo believe the legislation we passed in the Senate is more \ncomprehensive, and I hope the House will be willing to take some of our \nmeasures, particularly in the area of prevention, which was left out, \nbecause I think preventing this addiction in the first place and \nkeeping people out of the funnel of addiction is incredibly important.\n  It has been 77 days since the Senate passed CARA, and we lose about \n120 Americans a day to drug overdoses or about 1 every 12 minutes. This \nmeans we have lost about 9,000 Americans to drug overdoses since the \nSenate passed this legislation back on March 10. About 300 Ohioans have \nlost their lives to heroin and prescription drug overdoses.\n  We were told by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that \nin 2014 Ohio had the second most overdoses of any State in the Union \nand fifth highest, overall, overdose death rate.\n  I have seen the consequences of this every time I go home. I will be \nhome tomorrow and will have the opportunity to visit with some people \nwho are trying to help on this issue, but everywhere I go I hear about \nit.\n  Last night I had a tele-townhall meeting. We have about 25,000 \nOhioans on the phone at any one time at these tele-townhall meetings. \nSomebody called in to talk about our legislation, CARA. His name was \nJoe. He is from Delta, OH, and he was very open about\n\n[[Page S3254]]\n\nhis situation. He said he had been a heroin addict for 15 years. He \nsaid he was 33 years old. He said he had a stroke when he was 25 that \nwas related to his use of heroin. He said he had been in and out of \ntreatment programs. He was clean now, but he was tired of going to \nfunerals. He said he had been a pallbearer at about 20 funerals of \nfriends of his who had died from overdoses. He said he was ready to \nstraighten out his life and get back on track. He also talked about how \ntough that is; that the grip of this addiction is so strong, it is very \ndifficult to go through a treatment program and into recovery and come \nout clean. He said he likes our legislation because he believes there \nshould be more treatment out there. He said many people who want to go \nto treatment cannot get the treatment they need. We also talked about \nthe stigma that is attached to addiction. That many people don't go \nforward to even tell their families, much less get into treatment, \nbecause of the stigma around this disease.\n  Unfortunately, stories like Joe's are in the headlines every day. \nJust since I spoke on the floor last week, more headlines are coming \nout of Ohio. It is everywhere, by the way. It knows no ZIP Code. It is \nin the inner city, it is in your community wherever you live, it is in \nsuburbs, and it is in our rural areas. In fact, the per capita use in \nrural areas may be higher than it is in the inner city.\n  This week the Cleveland Plain Dealer began a series of stories on \nthose whose lives have been cut short by this epidemic, and I applaud \nthem for that. By raising awareness of this issue, I think that will \nhelp in terms of the prevention side of this, and I think it will also \nhelp people to be able to seek treatment.\n  The stories the Cleveland Plain Dealer is featuring includes a \nfentanyl overdose death of an 18-year-old named Nicholas DiMarco, who \nwas an honor student at North Olmsted High School. They include the \nstory of Patrick O'Malley, a bright, young graduate of Ohio University. \nPatrick used prescription painkillers--drugs we all know the names of, \nlike Vicodin and Percocet. He abused them and became addicted. Money \nstarted being missing from his mom's wallet. Laptops, televisions, and \nother items went missing from their home. He told his brother he didn't \nwant to keep using. He wanted to stop. He said he had a disease, and it \nis a disease. He sought treatment and went into rehab at the Free \nClinic in Cleveland, OH. I have been there and have seen the good work \nthey do. Sadly, he relapsed, and just 2 weeks later his brother found \nhim dead in his bedroom with a needle stuck in his arm. He was 25 years \nold.\n  Unfortunately, these stories continue to be told because this is what \nis happening in our communities. Mary Jo Trocano was a grandmother who \nhad chronic pain. She was prescribed painkillers to deal with her \nchronic pain, and like so many others, she became addicted to them. \nWhen she ran out, this grandmother switched to heroin. It is less \nexpensive and more accessible. She fought this addiction for 10 years, \nbut Mary Jo was found dead in the backyard of an abandoned house in the \nwest side of Cleveland recently in her late fifties.\n  These are just stories from one town, Cleveland, but they can happen \nin your hometown. Again, no ZIP Code in the country is safe from this \nstrong grip of this particular addiction.\n  Just last Friday, police in Niles, OH, seized $100,000 worth of \nheroin from one man. Three days later, a prison guard in Athens, OH, \npled guilty to assisting the drug traffickers and getting drugs into \nthe prison system.\n  In Columbus, a mom pled guilty to involuntary manslaughter after her \ndaughter, Annabella, who was just 14 months old, ingested fentanyl-\nlaced heroin at a drug house. Annabella died of an overdose and her mom \nis now facing up to 11 years in prison. Fentanyl, by the way, is a \nsynthetic form of heroin. It has similar qualities except it is much \nstronger--often as much as 50 times stronger than heroin. \nUnfortunately, many of the overdose deaths in Cleveland are due to the \nfentanyl that is often laced with the heroin. In fact, there have been \nmore deaths in Cleveland, OH, in this first quarter than ever. In fact, \nwe are looking at probably doubling the number of overdose deaths if we \ncontinue on this pace in Cleveland, OH, compared to last year. This is \nhow serious it is in my State and your State, wherever you live.\n  On May 9, Ohio State troopers seized $20,000 in heroin on Route 23 in \nMarion County, a rural area. Just 3 days later, three people died of \ndrug overdoses in Marion County in a 24-hour period.\n\n  Every one of these victims had family, friends, or classmates who are \nnow suffering themselves. It shouldn't be this way, but unfortunately \nthat is just the tip of the iceberg. In addition to the 9,000 Americans \nwe have lost since this legislation passed the U.S. Senate--think about \nthis--there are hundreds and thousands more who are wounded. They have \nlost their jobs, been driven to theft or fraud, gone to jail, broken \nrelationships with loved ones because the drug is everything. This is \nwhat I hear and what I heard last night in the tele-townhall. What I \nhear from other recovering addicts is that the drug becomes everything. \nTherefore, the families are torn apart and therefore the job means \nnothing. They turn to theft when they had never before crossed that \nline of committing a crime. That is the status quo today.\n  Getting a comprehensive bill to the President's desk for signature \nand getting it to our communities will help. It has to be comprehensive \nbecause we know it is not going to work if it just addresses one side \nof the issue or another.\n  There has been a debate over funding for this legislation. Some have \nsaid more funding is the answer to all of our problems. Unfortunately, \nsome have tried to politicize this a little bit, and I suggest what \nthey are doing is not going to help because what we need to do is get a \ncomprehensive bill out there that talks about providing funding--and I \nbelieve there should be more funding--that goes to the evidence-based \nprograms we know work, and that is what this legislation does. It is \nbased on 3 years of work. We brought experts in from all over the \ncountry. We had five conferences in Washington, DC. We had conferences \nabout how to help our veterans, pregnant moms, addicted babies, and \nensure that we have more people who are given the right kind of \ntreatment--medication-assisted treatment--to be able to get back on \ntrack.\n  Yes, I have supported more funding, and we should continue to try to \nget more funding to address this problem, but it is not just a matter \nof putting more money into it, it is also a matter of spending that \nmoney wisely. That is what this legislation does. Yes, there is more \nmoney. It has $80 to $100 million in additional funding, but it also \nhas funding that will be used for what we know works.\n  We need to be sure we do this soon because, again, this epidemic is \ngrowing. CARA, Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act, insists that we \nare targeting this funding toward evidence-based education, treatment, \nand recovery programs. There are 130 national anti-drug groups that \nsupport this legislation because of the fact that they were part of \nputting it together. They know what works out there and what doesn't \nwork. This is a national effort. It is one that will save lives and \nwill make a difference in so many other people's lives and will begin \nto actually turn the tide on this epidemic.\n  Again, this legislation is one that 94 Senators supported. Only one \nSenator opposed it. Again, that shows how this has become an issue in \nevery single State that has to be addressed because it is affecting \neverybody in every community. CARA has a number of things on prevention \neducation that are incredibly important to keep people out of the \nfunnel of addiction and help people make the right decisions, \nparticularly for teens, parents, other caretakers, and aging other \npopulations. It does more in terms of making people aware of this \nconnection between prescription drugs and heroin. Probably four out of \nfive heroin addicts in Ohio today started out with prescription drugs, \nand for people to know that, it helps them avoid being in the situation \nthey are, like the grandmother in Cleveland I talked about who was \nexposed to more and more painkillers and became addicted to them.\n  CARA also improves treatment by expanding the availability of \nnaloxone. This is the miracle drug that can actually stop and reverse \nan overdose. Law enforcement agencies and first responders support our \nlegislation because they appreciate the fact that\n\n[[Page S3255]]\n\nthere is more funding for naloxone, also called Narcan, and also \nbecause there is more training in our legislation so people have the \ntraining to be able to save lives and reverse these overdoses.\n  It also expands treatment for prisoners who are suffering from \naddiction disorders. With evidence-based treatments, we can break this \ncycle of addiction and crime. Prosecutors have told me that in some \ncounties in Ohio, more than 80 percent of the crime is now directly \nrelated to this opioid addiction. We are told that 95 percent of the \npeople who are in jail or prison will be released someday and about \nhalf of them will end up back in jail within 2 or 3 years. Much of the \nrecidivism, this revolving door in the prison system, has to do with \nthis drug abuse issue. Families are torn apart when people go back and \nforth in the prison system. One of the reasons for the increase in \ncrime, and why many crimes are committed, is to pay for an addiction. \nBreaking that cycle will help ex-offenders stay out of prison and help \nthem to live out that God-given purpose.\n  CARA also expands disposal sites for unwanted prescription \nmedications to keep them out of the hands of our kids. It would \nstrengthen prescription monitoring programs to allow the States to \nmonitor what goes on in their own State and to also know what is \nhappening in the State next to them. If somebody is monitored for \noverusing prescription drugs in one State but can simply cross the line \ninto another State and get those drugs, that doesn't help solve the \nproblem. This legislation provides the ability to have a drug \nmonitoring program that is inoperable between the States.\n  These are critical policy improvements, and they are part of a \ncomprehensive approach to an epidemic that is devastating communities \nacross the country. Yes, we need more funding, but we also need some of \nthese changes in law to be able to spend the money more effectively.\n  I know these statistics about drug abuse are heartbreaking and can be \nvery discouraging, but there are also many stories of hope we should \nnot forget, and those stories are inspiring. It is about those who are \nstruggling and find a way to get their lives back together.\n  Ashley Bryner of Newton Falls, OH, which is near Youngstown, started \nusing drugs when she was 13 years old. By 16 she had gone to cocaine \nand by 18 she was addicted to painkillers. When she was 24, she \nswitched to heroin when the painkillers became too expensive and too \nhard to get. Again, heroin is less expensive than prescription drugs \ntoday in my State of Ohio.\n  She said:\n\n       When I was in addiction, I was living in hell. It just \n     takes over your mind. . . . Everything I did when I was using \n     was all to feed my addiction.\n\n  The drugs became everything. Then she decided to get help. She was \nready. She didn't want to live like that anymore. She checked into \nTrumbull Memorial Hospital in Trumbull County. It took her 18 months to \nrecover.\n  She said:\n\n       I had to re-learn to walk, talk, everything, without dope. \n     It was like being born all over again.\n\n  Four years later, she is clean and has full custody of her three \nsons. She is working for the Trumbull County Children's Services. She \nis helping others fighting addiction and excelling at her job. She is \nbeating this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I hope we can send this comprehensive \nlegislation to the Whitehouse as soon as possible, to give more people \nhope, to be able to reverse the tide of this addiction and allow those \nAmericans to live out their God-given purpose.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, shortly we will be voting on Laura \nHolgate for the nomination to the position of Ambassador and U.S. \nRepresentative to the Vienna Office of the United Nations and the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for her confirmation. She came through \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee and is strongly recommended by \nthat committee.\n  Ms. Holgate's extensive experience makes her uniquely qualified to \nserve in this position. She has served in senior positions in the \nDepartment of Energy and the Department of Defense for 14 years, \nbuilding and leading global coalitions to prevent States and terrorists \nfrom acquiring and using weapons of mass destruction.\n  She currently serves as the Senior Director for Weapons of Mass \nDestruction, Terrorism and Threat Reduction on the National Security \nCouncil. Having this post filled with a highly qualified nominee has \nnever been more critical. The position of the U.S. representative to \nmultiple U.N. agencies as well as the IAEA includes the U.N. Office on \nDrugs and Crime, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and \nthe International Monetary Money Laundering Information Network, among \nmany others.\n  This position covers a range of other issues at the IAEA, including \nNorth Korea. The International Atomic Energy Agency in the coming years \nwill be responsible for monitoring and verifying the nuclear agreement \nwith Iran, confronting North Korea's continued violations of its \nnuclear obligations, and dealing with a variety of other \nnonproliferation threats. We need Laura Holgate in this position to \nrepresent U.S. interests and for our national security, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support her nomination.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Vote on Holgate Nomination\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the Holgate nomination?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n\n\n                       Vote on Holgate Nomination\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the Holgate nomination?\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Mr. President, I am delighted to be here today with the \nsenior Senator from Maryland, a longtime champion for women in this \ncountry and their access to equal pay, because in our country, women in \nthe workplace--no matter where they live, no matter their background, \nno matter what career they choose--on average earn less than their male \ncolleagues. That wage gap even exists and extends to Olympic gold \nmedalists and World Cup champions who are playing for our U.S. women's \nnational soccer team.\n  Today we are on the floor to show support for the women's national \nsoccer team and to affirm the sense of the Senate that we support equal \npay for equal work for all women in our country.\n  Just last year we all cheered on the women's national soccer team as \nthey beat Japan 5 to 2 to win the World Cup. In the past three \nOlympics, our women's team has brought home the gold, and their team is \nranked first in the world.\n  But despite all of those tremendous successes, these players do not \nget paid on par with their male counterparts. Think about the young \ngirls who are watching who see these players at the top of their game \nvalued less than men. These are some of the most visible athletes in \nthe world.\n  In 2015, 750 million people in the world tuned in to watch the \nWomen's World Cup. Twenty-five million of those viewers were here in \nthe United States. So this isn't just about the money. It is about the \nmessage it sends to women and girls across our country and the world.\n  The pay gap between the men's and the women's national soccer teams \nis emblematic of what is happening across our country. On average, \nwomen get paid just 79 cents for every dollar a man makes. This is at a \ntime when women more than ever are likely to be the primary breadwinner \nof their family. The wage gap isn't just unfair to women. It hurts our \nfamilies, and it hurts our economy.\n  Carli Lloyd is a cocaptain of the U.S. women's national soccer team. \nLast year she scored three of the five goals in the final World Cup \nmatch. A few months ago, she was one of the players who filed a wage \ndiscrimination case with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n  Shortly after the news of that have case broke, Carli Lloyd said: \n``We are not backing down anymore.''\n  I know my Democratic colleagues won't back down in the fight for \nequal pay, but on the Senate floor today, we have a chance to show our \nsupport for women athletes and women in the workforce who get paid less \nthan their male colleagues.\n  Two weeks ago, I, along with 21 of my colleagues, introduced S. Res. \n462 to make clear that pay discrimination is wrong. This resolution \nurges U.S. Soccer to end pay disparities and treat all athletes with \nrespect and with dignity, and it expresses our strong support to end \nthe pay gap and strengthen equal pay protections.\n  We are here to give the Senate the opportunity to take a stand with \nthe members of the U.S. Soccer women's team against the pay gap and \nwage discrimination and to support this legislation.\n  I will offer the resolution in just a minute, but before I do, I turn \nthe floor over to my senior colleague. I hope that once this resolution \nis adopted, if we can get it adopted, we can support the equal pay for \nequal work that she has championed for so many years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to join my distinguished \ncolleague from Washington State, a longstanding advocate for women and \nchildren and, really, fundamental fairness.\n  Today I join her in urging that the U.S. Soccer Federation end the \ngender gap and stop kicking women around. Women across our country are \nstill paid less than men, just 79 cents for every $1 a man makes. This \nwage gap is felt by all women, even champions playing for the U.S. \nwomen's soccer team.\n  These champions won the World Cup last year. They brought in $20 \nmillion more in revenue than the men's team, but they are paid four \ntimes less.\n  When do we reward victory? When do we reward being a champion? How \nabout equal pay for equal work? They belong on the same types of \nplaying fields.\n  Those women are taking action by going to the EEOC Commission, and it \nis time to score one for equality. Equal pay for all must be our goal. \nWe want equal pay for equal work, whether we are U.S. Senators, nurses, \nexecutive assistants, or whether we are professional athletes.\n  I stand with the women's soccer team and women across the United \nStates in their fight for equal wages. They kick the ball around, but \nwe are getting tired of being kicked around. Give us equal pay for \nequal work. Let's change the lawbook--the Federal lawbook--so that they \ncan change their checkbook.\n  Why should our women go to the Olympics and go for the gold when they \naren't paid the gold.\n  Let's pass this resolution. Let's show our support for the U.S. \nwomen's soccer team. Let's set an example for young girls, soccer \nathletes, daughters, nieces, and granddaughters. Let's pass the \nPaycheck Fairness Act, but today let's start with passing this \nresolution.\n  This is a real-world solution in support of them, but it really \nhighlights the fact that we not only adopt resolutions, but we want to \nadopt solutions to finish the job that we started with equal pay.\n  I compliment the Senator from Washington State for bringing this \nresolution to the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Last month, the national women's soccer team filed a \ncomplaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n  The complaint states that women are paid just 40 percent of what men \nare paid--despite the fact that our women's soccer team has long been \none of the best in the world. The team has won four of the last five \nOlympic Gold Medals and three of the last seven World Cups.\n  However, the wage gap between the men and women's team is stark. \nWomen are paid $3,600 per game while men are paid $5,000 per game. \nWomen soccer players are awarded a win bonus of $1,350 per game. In \ncontrast, male soccer players are awarded win bonuses of between $6,250 \nand $17,625 per game.\n  That is up to 13 times more. This differential is so significant that \na woman player who wins all 20 exhibition games would still make $1,000 \nless than a male player who lost all 20 exhibition games.\n  Women soccer players are even given smaller per-diems when they \ntravel. Women receive $50 per day, while men receive $62.50 per day. \nThese examples represent the pervasiveness of wage discrimination in \nthis country.\n  The most successful women's soccer team in the world still earns just \n40 cents for every dollar earned by men, and that needs to change. The \nSenate should stand in solidarity with the national women's soccer team \nand pass this resolution.\n  Of course, what is happening to the women's soccer team isn't an \nisolated event. It is indicative of a much broader, entrenched problem \nin this country.\n  Women are still paid just 79 cents for every dollar earned by men. \nThis means that every woman who works full time is paid $10,700 less--\nevery year.\n  This gap has a significant effect on the economic security of working \nfamilies--40 percent of women are the primary or sole breadwinners in \ntheir families.\n  That means 40 percent of families depend on women's wages to pay the \nbills. Every dollar women lose to the wage gap makes a difference.\n  Here are just a few examples of what the wage gap costs families: \n$10,700 is more than 1 year's worth of groceries for a family of 4, 7 \nmonths of mortgage and utility payments, or 11 months of rent.\n\n[[Page S3257]]\n\n  The wage gap is even bigger for African-American and Latino women. \nAfrican-American women are paid just 60 cents. Hispanic women are paid \njust 55 cents. We can't allow this discrimination to continue.\n  The wage gap is a national problem. It affects all women, and the \nSenate must take action. The Paycheck Fairness Act is a good place to \nstart.\n  I have long supported this bill, which is sponsored by Senator \nBarbara Mikulski. The Paycheck Fairness Act would protect women from \nretaliation if they ask about wages and require employers to justify \npaying women less than men for the same job.\n  Women often don't know they are being paid less than men, and making \nthe system more transparent will help reduce the wage gap. The bill \nwould also make it easier for women to take legal action under the \nEqual Pay Act, including class action lawsuits.\n  Under current law, it is significantly easier to recoup lost wages if \nthey were denied through other discriminatory practices, like failure \nto pay overtime. Lastly, the bill would create a training program to \nhelp women negotiate their salaries.\n  This is a commonsense bill and one that is long overdue. President \nJohn F. Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act in 1963. At the time, women \nmade 59 cents for every dollar earned by men. In 53 years, we have only \nclosed the gap by 16 cents.\n  At this rate, it will not be eliminated until 2059. Women and their \nfamilies deserve better, and they can't afford to wait that long. I \nstrongly urge the Senate to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and the \nresolution before us today.\n  In closing, the Senate has an opportunity to stand up for equal pay \nfor the women's soccer team--and all American women--by adopting this \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the HELP \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. Res. 462 and \nthe Senate proceed to its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 462) urging the United States Soccer \n     Federation to immediately eliminate gender pay inequity and \n     treat all athletes with the same respect and dignity.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I know of no further debate at this time \non this resolution and ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to vote on adoption of the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  If there is no further debate, the question is on agreeing to the \nresolution.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 462) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the preamble \nbe agreed to and the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table with \nno intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  (The resolution, with its preamble, is printed in the Record of May \n12, 2016, under ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the life and \nwork of Mary Babula.\n  For 44 years, Mary was a tireless and passionate advocate for \nchildren and early childhood educators and a valued resource for \npolicymakers.\n  I was fortunate to work closely with Mary throughout my time in local \nand State government and later as a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives. Beyond our professional work together, Mary was a \nfriend and also a mentor.\n  I first met Mary in the 1980s when I was serving on the Dane County \nBoard of Supervisors and concurrently in an appointed position on the \nCommunity Coordinated Child Care board of directors.\n  Mary was at once an advocate for children and for the predominantly \nfemale professionals who teach and care for them. She understood that \nour children would only have safe, stimulating, and nurturing \nexperiences in childcare settings if we invested in their training, \ncredentialing, and adequate compensation.\n  Those who are entrusted with the care of children while their parents \nare engaged in work or study deserve that high value. Mary was a \npassionate leader in that regard.\n  Mary Babula organized early childhood educators to be effective \nvoices on their own behalf. Whether it was lobbying for tuition \nassistance funding for low-income parents to be able to be afford high-\nquality childcare or rallying for worthy wages, Mary wanted early \nchildhood educators to be seen, heard, and respected.\n  A Wisconsin native, Mary Babula attended the University of Wisconsin-\nMadison and graduated with a degree in social work, later receiving a \ngraduate degree in continuing and vocational education. She began her \nwork with children as a part-time volunteer at a Madison daycare center \nwhile in college. She later worked as a teacher and director at \nChristian Day Care Center in Madison.\n  In 1971, Mary began working with the Wisconsin Early Childhood \nAssociation, otherwise known as WECA, and later became the \norganization's executive director. During her years at WECA, Mary led \nthe organization through a wide variety of instrumental changes. The \nestablishment of the Federal child care and development block grant \nsignaled new opportunities for WECA to increase its direct impact on \nchildhood education and development. Through this program, WECA managed \nquality-improvement grants and established the Wisconsin Child Care \nImprovement Project. This project spurred the development of Child Care \nResource and Referral agencies throughout Wisconsin, which provided \nparents a clear and responsible guide when selecting child care.\n  In the 2000s, WECA began to administer the REWARD Wisconsin Stipend \nProgram, supported a mentoring program, and led efforts that resulted \nin the development and beginning of YoungStar, an important program \nthat continues to serve as Wisconsin's childcare quality rating and \nimprovement system. Her efforts and initiatives at WECA continue as her \nlegacy.\n  Mary's passion for her children, caregivers, and educators extended \nwell past the walls of WECA. She was eager to work with elected \nofficials at the State, local, and Federal level to lend her expertise \nand knowledge. I had the privilege of working closely with Mary on \nnumerous occasions and often sought her input on childcare issues as \nimportant legislation advanced through Congress.\n  Beyond her work with children, Mary brought her energy and dedication \nto numerous community groups, including Womonsong, Friendship Force, \nand the Wisconsin Women's Network.\n  I am fortunate to have known Mary as an advocate, as a friend, and as \na mentor. I never let her small stature fool me. She had a soft yet \npowerful voice when it came to ensuring that the youngest and most \nvulnerable members of our community received a very strong start in \nlife. Thousands of Wisconsin families can trace the early education of \ntheir children directly back to her advocacy. She leaves behind a huge \nand powerful legacy.\n  Mary Babula passed away late last year. She is survived by her life \npartner, Mary Mastaglio, her mother Miriam, and three sisters. Many \nfamily members and friends join in celebrating her life and legacy.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/senate-section/article/S3257-1"}, {"day": "26", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3257-S3258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORT ON SECRETARY CLINTON'S NONGOVERNMENT SERVER \n                         AND EMAIL ARRANGEMENT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the State Department inspector general \nhas released findings regarding the State Department's email practices \nfor\n\n[[Page S3258]]\n\nthe last five Secretaries of State. This report makes clear that \nSecretary Clinton has not told the truth to the American people about \nher nongovernment server and email arrangement.\n\n  As I have noted many times before, Secretary Clinton's nongovernment \nserver arrangement prevented the State Department from complying with \nthe Freedom of Information Act. She used the private server to avoid \nthe law that requires archiving Federal records. It was designed to \nwall her email off from the normal treatment of a government official's \nemail communications.\n  The inspector general found that Secretary Clinton failed to \nsurrender all official emails to the Department prior to leaving \ngovernment service.\n  The inspector general found that Secretary Clinton's email practices \n``did not comply with the Department's policies that were implemented \nin accordance with the Federal Records Act.'' In other words, she \nviolated the law. The inspector general has made clear that Secretary \nClinton neither sought nor received any permission to maintain her \nnongovernment server arrangement. Moreover, the report says that if she \nhad, that permission would have been denied.\n  These findings directly conflict with her many misleading public \nstatements.\n  Secretary Clinton said on July 7, 2015, ``Everything I did was \npermitted. There was no law. There was no regulation. There was nothing \nthat did not give me the full authority to decide how I was going to \ncommunicate.''\n  That statement is false.\n  Her staff also failed to comply with Department policy and records \nlaws. They routinely conducted State Department business on personal \nemail accounts.\n  After the controversy broke, they eventually turned over 72,000 pages \nof work related emails from those private accounts. These emails were \nnot preserved in Department recordkeeping systems as required by \nDepartment policies and Federal records laws. In other words, her staff \nalso violated the law.\n  Documents in those 72,000 pages were systematically withheld from \nFreedom of Information Act requestors and congressional oversight \ncommittees, including the Senate Judiciary Committee, which I chair. \nBased on the inspector general report, it appears that the Department \nfailed to produce key documents to Congress from these personal email \naccounts.\n  For example, according to emails cited by the inspector general, we \nlearned that Secretary Clinton's nongovernment server was attacked by \nhackers. One email the Department failed to turn over said that ``we \nwere attacked again so I shut the server down for a few minutes.''\n  It is disturbing that the State Department knew it had emails like \nthis and turned them over to the inspector general but not to Congress.\n  In another email the Department failed to turn over, the director of \nSecretary Clinton's IT unit warned her that ``you should be aware that \nany email would go through the Department's infrastructure and subject \nto FOIA searches.'' Clearly, Secretary Clinton wanted to avoid the \nFreedom of Information Act at all costs.\n  That IT director who warned her about the transparency laws for State \nDepartment emails is named John Bentel. He has since retired from the \nState Department, and thus, the inspector general could not require him \nto testify.\n  He refused to speak with the inspector general. In fact, Former \nSecretary Clinton and several of her aides also refused to speak to the \ninspector general.\n   Mr. Bentel also refused to speak with the Judiciary Committee. \nAccording to his attorney, Randall Turk, Mr. Bentel knew nothing about \nthe server at the time. In refusing to participate in a voluntary \nwitness interview with the committee, Mr. Bentel's attorney claimed \nthat his client only learned of the controversial email arrangement \nafter it was reported in the press.\n  He said another congressional committee ``spent its entire interview \n. . . focusing on what the Committees' letter says you want to ask him \nabout.''\n  In a January 14, 2016, email to my staff, Mr. Turk noted that Mr. \nBentel had ``no memory or knowledge of the matters he was questioned \nabout.''\n  The inspector general report says otherwise. According to the report, \ntwo of Mr. Bentel's subordinates separately raised concerns back in \n2010 about Secretary Clinton's private email usage, including concerns \nthat it was interfering with Federal recordkeeping laws. That is 5 \nyears before the news broke publicly.\n  Both of these State Department staff independently told the inspector \ngeneral about similar conversations they had with Mr. Bentel about \ntheir concerns. According to these new witnesses, Mr. Bentel told them \nnever to speak of Secretary Clinton's personal email system again.\n  It seems unlikely that two witnesses who told such similar stories \nindependent of one another would be making it up. Plus, they knew they \nwere under a legal obligation to tell the truth to the inspector \ngeneral.\n  Without having spoken to these witnesses directly, the circumstances \nmake their statement seem credible. And although Mr. Bentel has been \ngiven the opportunity to provide his side of the story, he has refused \nto cooperate.\n  But if what these two witnesses said is true, it is an outrage, and \nit raises lots of serious questions. Good and honest employees just \ntrying to do their job were told to shut up and sit down. Concerns \nabout the Secretary's email system being out of compliance with Federal \nrecordkeeping laws were swept under the rug.\n  If those State Department employees had not been muzzled 5 years \nearlier, perhaps Secretary Clinton could have avoided this entire \ncontroversy.\n  Are these statements evidence of an intent to cover up Federal \nRecords Act violations? Were the representations to the committee by \nMr. Bentel's attorney that he didn't know about the private server \nfalse?\n  It seems from the inspector general report that Mr. Bentel in fact \ndid have knowledge of Secretary Clinton's email arrangement, contrary \nto his attorney's assertions.\n  Not only that, he also was reportedly warned that it raised legal \nconcerns about compliance with Federal records laws.\n  Secretary Clinton and her associates have refused to cooperate with \nthe inquiries into this controversy. But it is becoming more apparent \nwhy she is not. The inspector general report makes clear that Secretary \nClinton and a number of other former Department officials have not been \ntruthful with the American people.\n  And in pursuit of constitutional oversight on these very important \nissues, the Department of State is continuing to fail to provide \nrelevant documents to Congress.\n  I will follow up to get to the bottom of these discrepancies because \nmisrepresenting the facts to Congress is unacceptable. Simply said, the \nAmerican people deserve better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/senate-section/article/S3257-2"}, {"day": "26", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3258-S3259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL\n\n  Mr. PETERS.

I \nwould like to thank my colleagues, Senators Daines, Tillis, and \nGillibrand, for joining me in filing this important bipartisan \namendment.\n  We are a nation that takes care of our own, and we owe our veterans \nthe highest possible level of care and support.

The improvements in medical \ntechnology have saved the lives of wounded warriors, who will receive \nthe benefits and care these heroes deserve.\n  While scars, lost limbs, and other injuries are readily apparent to \nthe eye, there are thousands of veterans coping with the invisible \nwounds of war. We have far too many servicemembers who are suffering \nfrom trauma-related to conditions such as post-traumatic stress \ndisorder or traumatic brain injury. Unfortunately, many of these\n\n[[Page S3259]]\n\nhave received a less-than-honorable discharge, also known as a bad \npaper discharge. These former servicemembers often receive bad paper \ndischarges for minor misconduct--the same type of misconduct that is \noften linked to behavior seen in those suffering from PTSD, TBI, and \nother trauma-related conditions.\n  The effects of traumatic brain injury can include cognitive problems, \nincluding headaches, memory issues, difficulty thinking, and attention \ndeficits. It is not difficult to see how these effects could lead to \nbehaviors like being late to a formation or missing scheduled \nappointments--behaviors that can be the basis for a bad papers \ndischarge.\n  In addition to combat-sustained injuries, PTSD and TBI can also be \nthe result of military sexual trauma. Bad paper discharges make former \nservicemembers who are suffering from service-connected conditions \nineligible for a number of benefits that they need the most. This \nincludes GI benefits and VA home loans which they otherwise would have \nearned and which can significantly help them transition to civilian \nlife. These discharges also put these servicemembers at risk of losing \naccess to VA health care and veteran homelessness prevention programs.\n  This is completely unacceptable. We have a responsibility to treat \nthose who serve their country with dignity, respect, and compassion.\n  Last year I introduced the Fairness for Veterans Act, which will help \nprovide these servicemembers with a path toward obtaining these \ncritical benefits. The Peters-Daines-Tillis-Gillibrand amendment is a \nmodified version of this bill.\n  This amendment builds upon the policy guidance issued by former \nDefense Secretary and Vietnam veteran Chuck Hagel. The 2004 Hagel memo \ninstructed liberal consideration to be given when reviewing discharge \nstatus upgrade petitions for PTSD-related cases at the military \ndepartment boards for correction of military and naval records. The \nPeters amendment would codify the commonsense principles of the Hagel \nmemo, ensuring that liberal consideration will be given to petitions \nfor changes in characterization of service related to PTSD or TBI \nbefore discharge review boards.\n  In addition to codifying the Hagel memo at the discharge review \nboards, the Peters amendment clarifies that PTSD or TBI claims that are \nrelated to military sexual trauma are also included.\n  Our bipartisan amendment is supported by a number of veteran service \norganizations, including Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, \nDisabled Veterans of America, Military Officers Association of America, \nthe American Legion, Paralyzed Veterans of America, and Vietnam \nVeterans of America.\n  We also have bipartisan support in the House of Representatives, and \nI appreciate the work being done by Representatives Mike Coffman of \nColorado and Tim Walz of Minnesota, who have introduced a companion \nstand-alone bill in the House and are supportive of this amendment.\n  Servicemembers who were subject to a bad paper discharge and are \ncoping with wounds inflicted during their service should not lose \naccess to benefits they have rightfully earned. That is why we must \nensure that they get the fair process they deserve when petitioning for \na change in characterization of their discharge. Peters amendment No. \n4138 will do just that. This is not a Democratic issue or a Republican \nissue; this is about doing what is right and about taking care of our \nown.\n  I appreciate Chairman McCain's and Ranking Member Reed's leadership \non the National Defense Authorization Act, and I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with them on this critical issue. I hope to see a \nvote on the Peters amendment No. 4138 as we continue the work on the \nNDAA, and I urge my colleagues to join us in fighting on behalf of our \nNation's servicemembers.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/senate-section/article/S3258-1"}, {"day": "26", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3259-S3261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE BOARDS OF TRUSTEES\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about pending \nnominees for the Social Security and Medicare Boards of Trustees.\n  As most of us know, under the law these two Boards consist of the \nSecretaries of Treasury, Labor, HHS, Commissioner of Social Security, \nand two public trustees, one from each party.\n  One purpose of the Boards is to provide yearly reports on the \noperation of the trust funds and their current and projected status. \nSince 1983, when the two public trustee positions were established in \nthe statute, the trustee reports for both trust funds have largely been \ndevoid of partisanship or political influence. That, to me, has been a \ngood thing. It means that the process generating the reports is free of \npolitical influence. It also means that the public can have confidence \nthat the statements and assessments made in the reports--including \nthose dealing with current and future financial conditions of the trust \nfunds--are objective and not made to serve a particular agenda.\n  The inclusion of public trustees on the Boards is an important part \nof the structure that provides this type of certainty. Yet, by the time \nPresident Obama is out of office, the two Boards will have issued more \nreports with vacant public trustee positions than have been issued \nunder any President since these two positions were created.\n  In a recent hearing, the Senate Finance Committee, which I chair, \nheard testimony from President Obama's nominees for the currently \nvacant public trustee positions, Dr. Charles Blahous and Dr. Robert \nReischauer, both of whom have been renominated after serving one full \nterm on the Boards.\n  Some members of the Finance Committee, as well as a few others in \nthis Chamber, have questioned whether having public trustees serve more \nthan one term is beneficial. Their argument seems to be that the \nprocess of producing the trustees' reports should have ``fresh eyes'' \nevery 4 years. However, to me, this argument is not all that \npersuasive. As the trustees go through the process of producing \nreports, there are many inputs and many participants, including a \nnumber of ``fresh eyes.'' For example, there are numerous technical \npanels, composed of actuaries, economists, demographers, and others, \nwho review the assumptions and methods used in the trustees' \nreports. Since 1999, 50 different people have served on these technical \npanels, weighing in on the reports and providing both fresh \nperspectives on the trustees' reports as well as a much needed check \nfrom what could otherwise be outsized roles played by various others, \nincluding the Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration in \nguiding the contents of the reports.\n\n  In my view, there is value to having continuity in the public trustee \noversight of the trust funds, particularly since the process that gives \nrise to trustee reports takes time to learn. For the most part, public \ntrustees are unlikely to have fully learned the ropes until well into \ntheir 4-year terms, and their terms very likely expire very shortly \nafter they have a complete understanding of this whole process. \nUltimately, while there are probably some tradeoffs associated with \nterm limits for public trustees, there is no real evidence to \ndemonstrate that a single term is inherently superior or that the \nbenefit of having public trustees with ``fresh eyes,'' outweighs the \ncost of inexperience.\n  Whatever the case, Members are entitled to their individual \npreferences regarding term limits for public trustees, and if the issue \nis as important as some of my colleagues on the other side claim, a \nbill to impose those kinds of term limits would seem logical. However, \nsuch a bill has not recently been offered, and if the recent Finance \nCommittee hearing on the current nominees is any indication, my friends \nhave a different agenda altogether. If term limits were the real issue \nwith these nominations, the committee could have had a reasoned debate \nand each Member could have weighed in on the matter and Members would \nobviously be free to base their vote on the substance and outcome of \nthat recent debate.\n\n[[Page S3260]]\n\n  Sadly, a reasoned debate is not what occurred in our committee. What \nwe got instead was a coordinated attack--pretty much from the ranking \nmember all the way down the Democrats' side of the dais--focused \nsquarely on the Republican nominee, Dr. Blahous. Throughout the course \nof the hearing, the Democrats never claimed that Dr. Blahous lacked the \nappropriate credentials to be a suitable trustee. They never provided \nany evidence that he had acted inappropriately or exercised some kind \nof nefarious influence in the process of compiling reports. Instead, my \ncolleagues attacked the nominee for expressing policy views they happen \nto disagree with. He has never worked to change any Social Security or \nMedicare policies in his capacity as a public trustee because, given \nthe very specific mission of the boards of trustees, he doesn't have \nany real opportunity to influence or enact any policy changes in any \nofficial capacity.\n  The Democrats' current position seems to be that if a nominee has \never said anything they happen to disagree with--even if the statements \nrepresent reasoned policy views and are supported by objective \nanalysis--they are unfit to serve as public trustees. During the course \nof our hearing, not only did the Democrats publicly subject its nominee \nto this preposterous standard, they did so with comments and arguments \nthat were misleading, inconsistent, and in some cases blatantly false. \nIn the end, their onslaught amounted to little more than partisan \ncharacter attacks.\n  The Republican nominee was referred to as ``hyperpartisan,'' even \nthough you would be hard-pressed to find any credible and reasonable \nSocial Security and Medicare analyst from either party who would agree \nwith that label. He was accused of being the ``architect of \nprivatization'' of Social Security because he happened to work in the \nBush administration. He has been attacked for his involvement in \nPresident Bush's Commission to Strengthen Social Security as though \nthat were something nefarious, even though Senator Daniel Patrick \nMoynihan, a figure long revered by Democrats everywhere and me, was \nalso a cochair of that Commission.\n  There have been other attacks made--in the hearing and elsewhere--and \nall of them add up to one single and obvious conclusion, which is that \nanyone who expresses a view about the future of Social Security that is \nnot a recommendation for more taxes and higher benefits will be subject \nto partisan attacks and deemed unfit to serve in any capacity relating \nto Social Security. This is, of course, the demand of leftwing interest \ngroups that have virtually declared ownership of all things Social \nSecurity and who are unwilling to do anything about solving the \nproblems of Social Security. All they want to do is throw more money at \nit when there is no more money to throw.\n  For this crowd, even arguments in favor of slowing the benefits for \nupper earners seem to be off limits, even when they are made by the \nDemocratic nominee for public trustee. In other words, even proposals \nthat would make Social Security more progressive--something a \nreasonable person would assume Democrats would not fight--is seemingly \nunacceptable because slower benefit growth, even for the very rich, is \nconsidered a ``cut'' to the leftwing activists who try to take \nownership of this debate. I am talking, of course, about organizations \nlike Social Security Works, the Strengthen Social Security Coalition, \nvarious unions, and ``democratic socialist'' groups that have made \nintransigence and unreasonableness on Social Security a hallmark of \ntheir efforts over all of these years. For these people, the only \nallowable discussion on Social Security is one limited to talk of \nhigher benefits and higher taxes on the American people. Anyone who \ndisagrees will not only be refuted or opposed, they will be publicly \nmaligned and their character will be called into question.\n  Indeed, for many of these groups--and sadly for some of my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle--these efforts are not about winning \npublic policy debate, they are about silencing and trying to censor \nanyone who dares express a contrary opinion.\n  In even-numbered years, Republicans have more or less gotten used to \nhearing that we want to see Social Security ``slashed'' and \n``privatized'' or ``turned over to Wall Street.'' Leftwing activists--\nand, yes, even a number of our colleagues--base a huge portion of their \nfundraising efforts on scaring Social Security and Medicare \nbeneficiaries with those kinds of over-the-top attacks. For once, when \nit comes to Social Security, I wish we could look at all the facts. For \nexample, everyone knows we made some changes to Social Security last \nyear in order to prevent imminent and legally required cuts to \ndisability benefits. We did so based on the projections of the Social \nSecurity trustees--these very people who are being treated in this \nimproper way.\n\n  Did we ``slash'' benefits? Did we privatize anything? Did we turn \nanything over to Wall Street? Of course not. What we did was make \nreasonable and needed changes to the program, but that didn't stop many \non the other side from sounding the privatization alarm and raising \nmoney by scaring beneficiaries, even if they were as aware as we were \nthat the cuts to disability benefits were, absent changes, an absolute \ncertainty. We got precious little help from the Democrats in our \nefforts to avoid benefit cuts because, as is too often the case around \nhere, complaining about a problem and blaming the other side for it \nmakes for better politics than finding a solution. That same strategy \nand those same attacks have now permeated the effort to confirm two of \nPresident Obama's nominees. By the way, I am arguing for President \nObama's nominees.\n  As I said, the Republican nominee for public trustee has been accused \nof being many things. More than anything, some of my colleagues have \ntried to link him to some kind of effort to try to privatize all of \nSocial Security and hand everything over to Wall Street--never mind the \nfact that he has already served in the very same position for 4 years \nand Social Security is no closer to being in the hands of Wall Street \nthan it was before, never mind the fact that he was already confirmed \nto the very same position once before without any opposition on the \nSenate floor, never mind anything that has happened in the past. Here \nand now, according to my colleagues, he is controversial. Here and now, \nletting him serve as a public trustee would be like having a fox \nguarding the henhouse or some such nonsense. By the way, that phrase, \n``fox guarding the henhouse,'' is an actual quote from one of our \ncolleagues describing Dr. Blahous. Apparently, he became a ``fox'' \nsometime in the last 6 years because in 2010 no one in the Senate \nobjected to his confirmation, but here in 2016, there are apparently \nsome Democrats who feel they need to use this nomination and their \npartisan rants against it to raise money for their campaigns and \nperhaps in a case or two boost their prospects for higher office. Of \ncourse, none of this is entirely surprising because years ago, probably \nin some Democratic war room, my friends on the other side discovered \nthat terms like ``privatization'' and ``Wall Street'' and ``cuts'' poll \nwell with their political base, even though no such thing is taking \nplace.\n  As an aside, this favorable polling data explains why we heard their \nparty's Presidential frontrunner back in February make this claim:\n\n       After Bush got reelected in 2004, the first thing he said \n     was, let's go privatize Social Security. . . . And you know \n     what, their whole plan was to give the Social Security trust \n     fund to Wall Street.\n\n  My gosh. There are at least three or four poll-tested buzzwords in \nthat quote. If nothing else, Secretary Clinton deserves at least some \npraise for focus group efficiency with that statement no matter how \nfalse the statement is or was at the time. Of course, in dissecting \nthat claim, the Washington Post assigned it three Pinocchios, \nconcluding that it was false, as only they could conclude. In fact, the \nWashington Post reminded us that the Clinton administration was the \nfirst to consider investing Social Security trust fund resources into \nsomething other than low-yielding government bonds. So, in a sense, the \nreal ``architect of privatization'' was President Bill Clinton, not \nPresident George W. Bush, and certainly not the current Republican \nnominee for public trustee. Furthermore, if simply considering \nalternative investment strategies for trust fund dollars means \n``privatization,'' then the growing list of guilty\n\n[[Page S3261]]\n\nprivatizers has recently included a Democrat in the House, the AARP, a \nNobel prize-winning economist, and many others, and not all of them are \nRepublicans.\n  Let me return to the debate on the public trustee nomination because, \nquite frankly, the Democrats made so many misleading claims with regard \nto Social Security that I could not begin to address them all in a \nsingle floor speech.\n  A recent article in POLITICO outlined the plan devised by top Senate \nDemocrats to engage in ``an election-year battle'' over Social Security \nand the general public trustees in particular. In relation to Dr. \nBlahous, the article says: ``Democrats point to several instances in \nthe trustees' reports released after Blahous joined the board that they \nsay suggest the Social Security trust fund is less solvent than it \nreally is.''\n  That almost sounds like a legitimate policy argument, provided you \ndon't think about it for longer than 30 seconds. There are, quite \nsimply, countless reasons why that argument is entirely baseless. First \nof all, no one in the Obama administration has corroborated a single \none of these claims in any way, shape, or form. On top of that, this \nclaim seems to suggest that one public trustee, a Republican, has had \nsuch a persuasive and misleading influence that he has been able--for \nmore than 4 years--to hoodwink five Democratic trustees, including Dr. \nReischaure, the other current nominee, along with Treasury Secretary \nLew, Labor Secretary Perez, HHS Secretary Burwell, and Acting Social \nSecurity Commissioner Colvin, all of whom also signed on to those \ntrustees reports. Does anyone believe that for a second?\n\n  I am going to give my friends some advice: If a political attack \nrelies on an assumption that the sitting Secretaries of Treasury, \nLabor, HHS, and the Acting Commissioner of Social Security, along with \ntheir staffs, are so impotent in the face of the cunning sophistry of a \nsingle public trustee from the opposing party, it is best to leave that \nparticular conspiracy theory on the shelf because it doesn't even pass \nthe laugh test. That is, of course, unless you assume at the outset \nthat members of President Obama's Cabinet, along with their staffs, are \nincompetent or just plain dumb.\n  Aside from being based on foolish assumptions, the claim that recent \ntrustee reports have been biased is verifiably false, given that the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has reached similar conclusions \nabout the solvency of Social Security. In fact, CBO's projections are \neven bleaker.\n  Perhaps my Democratic colleagues believe that Dr. Blahous's dastardly \ninfluence has extended to CBO as well, although, to be fair, I haven't \nheard any of them claim that such is the case.\n  Mr. President, all of this political bluster over the public trustee \nnominations--every single word of it--is a political sideshow. The \npublic trustees do not have the power or ability to slash or privatize \nSocial Security or to turn a single penny of any public funds over to \nWall Street. They serve a limited but important role in monitoring and \nreporting on the system. That is all.\n  Any reasonable observer will tell you that both of President Obama's \nnominees for public trustee have solid reputations as being fair, \nobjective, balanced, and most importantly, highly competent.\n  I don't personally agree with all the policy positions that the \nDemocratic nominee, Dr. Reischauer, has put forward over the years, but \nhe has always conveyed his ideas in a temperate and respectful manner \nwithout partisanship or ad hominem attacks. Quite frankly, I also may \nnot even agree with all the positions that the Republican nominee, Dr. \nBlahous, has put forward, but he has similarly conducted himself in a \nrespectful and nonpartisan manner.\n  The fact is, whether certain Democratic Senators like it or not, the \nlaw requires that one of the public trustees be from the Republican \nParty. If someone wants to put forward legislation to change that or to \nimpose term limits on trustees or even start a public debate on these \nissues, they are free to do so. Similarly, if a Senator disagrees with \na prospective trustee's positions on policy or with something they have \nwritten outside of their public trustee functions, that Senator is also \nfree to vote against that nominee on that basis.\n  However, in my opinion, it is shameful for Members of Congress to \nengage in unreasonable and false character attacks in order to \nreinforce the Presidential candidate's talking points or to raise money \nfor leftwing activists or to help themselves on their political races. \nUnder any circumstances, it is wrong to impugn someone's character and \nprofessionalism by false association.\n  While this may be par for the course during an election year, there \nis more than politics at stake here. If Democrats truly have an \ninterest in the integrity of Social Security and Medicare, and their \ntrust funds, then politicizing public trustee nominations is an \nextraordinarily odd strategy. If we turn these nominations into just \nanother political battleground, the trustee reports will eventually be \nviewed as political documents, having no unique seriousness or \ncredibility. In the end, that will mean less transparency, objectivity, \nand integrity for Social Security and Medicare.\n  This would be terrifically unfortunate.\n  To conclude, I would just say that, despite some insinuations to the \ncontrary, my plan all along has been to hold votes on the Finance \nCommittee on the President's nominees for the public trustee positions \nas soon as possible. I look forward to filling the existing vacancies.\n  The trustee reports for Social Security and Medicare have \nhistorically been void of politics, to the credit of the current and \npast administrations as well as the public trustees from both sides of \nthe aisle. This has been the case until now, when politics has entered \nin. My sincere hope is that we can keep it that way.\n  I am getting a little tired of the Social Security arguments that \nDemocrats wage every election, such as Republicans are going to destroy \nSocial Security. My gosh, we believe in it as much as they do--in fact, \nI think, a little bit more. We believe we should strengthen that fund. \nWe should keep it alive. We should make sure it is going to be there \nfor your children, my children, grandchildren and, in my case, even \ngreat-grandchildren and beyond. But it is not going to be there if we \nhave these kinds of idiotic policy disagreements based surely on \npolitics and how one party might benefit in a political campaign or how \nany individual might benefit. It is time for us to get rid of all the \npartisanship and work together to resolve some of these problems. The \nnext time I hear another Democrat say that Republicans are against \nSocial Security, I am going to take that creature on. I call them a \ncreature because they certainly do not deserve to be in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/senate-section/article/S3259-1"}, {"day": "26", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3261-S3265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to highlight a number of important \nprovisions in the fiscal year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act. \nThis is the measure in its entirety. It comes with this report. It is \nabout 1,664 pages for the actual bill and another 642 pages for the \nreport. It is no wonder, as it deals with national security issues as \nwell as the Department of Defense and many other agencies. It is \nclearly the product of many hours and months of work by the members of \nthe committee, as well as the staff.\n  We consider it on the floor of the Senate and have a special \nresponsibility to look at it very carefully. This bill, of course, will \ntake some time to be digested and analyzed. We have been in that \nprocess this week. Many of us count on our professional staff whom we \nhave work for the defense appropriations committee. They also look at \nthis measure to see how it squares up with the actual spending bill. I \ndon't serve on the defense authorization committee; I am on the \nspending part of it, the defense appropriations subcommittee. We \napproved our measure\n\n[[Page S3262]]\n\ntoday and reported it from the full Appropriations Committee. It will \nbe coming to the floor in a few weeks.\n  What is the most pressing concern when it comes to our national \ndefense? Most Americans would rightly say it is terrorism. Terrorism is \na real threat to America and to our families. We have to do everything \nin our power to prevent terrorism from reaching our shores and to \ndismantle it and destroy it overseas. It is a large undertaking.\n  The United States leads the world in dealing with global terrorism. \nThis bill we are considering has elements in it that address that \nchallenge. I take the threat seriously, and as vice chairman of the \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee, I have worked with the senior \nSenator from Mississippi, Republican Senator Thad Cochran, to try to \nmake sure our troops have the funds they need to wage the fight \noverseas.\n  To defeat ISIS, we should defeat them on the ground in Iraq and Syria \nand dismantle their international terror network. We also must continue \nto prevent the spread of terrorism here at home through stronger \nhomeland defenses and work with our allies to strengthen their \nintelligence-gathering. To win, we have to mobilize the full force of \nthe U.S. Government against ISIS and ensure that every national \nsecurity agency has what it needs to keep us safe--at not just the \nDepartment of Defense but at all of the intelligence agencies: the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, \nthe State Department, and the Treasury Department. It is not DOD's \nfight alone.\n  This Defense authorization bill contributes to that strategy to stop \nthe spread of terrorism. It authorizes funds for the fight against Al \nQaeda, the Taliban, and ISIS, and also includes $1.7 billion to build \nthe capacity of our allies in Iraq, Syria, and the broader region.\n  Finally, like this year's Defense appropriations bill, this bill also \nconsolidates a lot of duplicative programs in order to make the fight \nmore effective. It streamlines the authorization for funding for DOD \nefforts to train and equip our top partners. It will mean better \noversight. It will mean more fighting time against ISIS and Al Qaeda \ninstead of more time fighting among the bureaucracy in the Pentagon.\n  There are several other good provisions in the committee bill which \nrepresent a bipartisan consensus between the chairman and the ranking \nmember. I commend the chairman and the ranking member for refraining \nfrom budget gimmickry, as we have seen in the other body across the \nRotunda.\n  Our House colleagues recommend authorizing and appropriating only \nhalf of what our men and women in uniform need to keep us safe--half an \nappropriation--through April of 2017. Testifying in front of my Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter called \nthis House ``gambling with warfighting money at a time of war, \nproposing to cut off troops' funding in places like Afghanistan, Iraq, \nand Syria in the middle of the year.'' I am glad we have refrained from \nthose tactics in the Senate.\n  The bill also authorizes a well-deserved pay increase for our \nuniformed and defense civilian workforce. It rejects a request by the \nDepartment of Defense to authorize a future Base Realignment and \nClosure, or BRAC, Commission. Many of us have lived through a lot of \nthese BRAC Commissions. I am not optimistic that if we embark on \nanother one, it will have positive results.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I strongly oppose Russian President \nVladimir Putin's reckless invasion of Ukraine, so I also appreciate \nthis bill's authorization for additional military assistance for \nUkraine.\n  There are several issues which are not addressed in this bill which I \nhope we can address on a bipartisan basis. Unlike previous years, the \nbill contains no extension for the Afghan special immigrant visa \nprogram so that we may continue to keep faith with those foreign \ntranslators who risk their lives to help American troops. Senator \nShaheen and others have championed this effort, and I hope we can deal \nwith it appropriately.\n  There are several provisions in this bill that are controversial. I \nwould like to address a few.\n  The closure of Guantanamo Bay in Cuba is an issue that I think is \ntimely and extremely important. This bill once again blocks the \ntransfer of detainees from Guantanamo Bay to the United States. Some of \nmy colleagues are threatening amendments to tighten these restrictions \nfurther.\n  The reality is, every day Guantanamo stays open, it weakens our \nalliances, inspires our enemies, and calls into question our commitment \nto human rights. Time and again, our most senior national security and \nmilitary leaders have called for the closure of Guantanamo.\n\n  The troops--the service men and women who are responsible for \nmaintaining Guantanamo--have an almost impossible assignment. I have \nbeen down to Southern Command in Florida. I have talked to them. They \nare doing their level best to make sure Guantanamo Bay meets standards. \nI don't hold against them the reputation Guantanamo has in many places \nin the world, but the fact is, we should look at Guantanamo in honest \nterms.\n  In addition to our national security costs, every day that Guantanamo \nremains open, we are wasting taxpayer dollars. Many colleagues come to \nthe floor and make speech after speech against wasteful Federal \nspending. So let me give a classic example at Guantanamo Bay. According \nto this authorization bill, we are now spending $5.5 million a year for \neach of the prisoners at Guantanamo Bay.\n  What if those prisoners were put in the most secure Federal prisons \nin America, supermax facilities where no one has ever escaped? How much \nwould it cost us? Would it cost $5\\1/2\\ million like Guantanamo? No. It \nwould cost $86,000 a year. Why, then, would we waste millions of \ndollars on Guantanamo when we know these detainees can be held safely, \nsecurely, and without any fear of escape for a fraction of the cost? \nBecause this has become a political symbol, a symbol which the other \nparty is willing to fight for even if it means wasting almost $500 \nmillion every single year to keep Guantanamo open.\n  All of us are committed to preventing terrorist attacks. Terrorists \ndeserve swift and sure justice and severe prison sentences. But holding \ndetainees at Guantanamo Bay does not administer justice effectively. It \ndoes not serve our national security interests. It is inconsistent with \nour country's history as a champion of human rights.\n  There are convicted terrorists being held safely in Federal prisons \nin more than 20 States, including my own. At the Marion Federal \npenitentiary in Southern Illinois, we are holding convicted terrorists. \nHow many people from Southern Illinois have come to me and objected to \nthe fact that terrorists are incarcerated at the Federal prison in \nMarion? Exactly none. Not a one. They trust the men and women in the \nBureau of Prisons to hold these prisoners safely, even if they are \nconvicted of terrorism. Why, then, do we continue the charade of \nmaintaining Guantanamo for some bragging rights in some places in this \nworld? I don't understand it. If you want to save $500 million for the \ntaxpayers of America, here is a place to start.\n  There are also some troubling provisions on guns, including on the \nreimportation of military firearms for sale. Now, listen to this one. \nOne section of the bill would circumvent State Department restrictions \non reimporting surplus military weaponry back into the United States \nfor sale to the public--military weapons for sale to the public in the \nUnited States. This is an item that has long been on the gun lobby's \nlist--a wish list that hopes that hundreds of thousands of M-1 \nmilitary-grade rifles that the United States supplied to South Korea \ndecades ago will come back into the United States, be put in the hands \nof gun companies, and be sold back in our country. How many people \nthink that bringing in these items--hundreds of thousands of military-\ngrade weapons--and selling them will make us a safer nation? I don't.\n  Section 1056 of the bill would have the U.S. Army basically serve--\nlisten to this--as a free shipping service to bring these weapons back \ninto the United States, thus bypassing State Department restrictions on \nthe reimportation of these guns by private companies. The bill would \nthen direct the Army to make these guns available to the companies so \nthey could sell\n\n[[Page S3263]]\n\nthem to the public at large--military-grade weapons.\n  There is also a provision giving military-grade firearms to museums. \nAnother section of this bill would authorize the Secretary of the Army \nto transfer up to 4,000--4,000 military-grade firearms to public or \nprivate military museums, but there is nothing in the bill requiring \nthat the guns be rendered inoperable. There is nothing to prohibit \nthese museums from reselling them to the public as well.\n  We should be very careful in importing and selling military-grade \nfirearms in the United States of America.\n  I will defend Second Amendment rights. I will defend the right of \nindividuals to own, use, and store guns safely for sporting purposes \nand for self-defense. But the notion that we need to bring hundreds and \nthousands of military weapons back into the United States and put them \nin circulation--do you really believe that will make us a safer nation? \nI don't.\n  The bill also includes a provision affecting Department of Defense-\noperated schools and school districts that regularly receive impact \naid. We need to ensure that our kids are safe as they step onto the \nbus, walk through school hallways, and enter the classroom each day. \nWhen we entrust teachers, administrators, bus drivers, librarians, and \nothers to watch over and care for students, we should have confidence \nthat they are individuals who will actually protect our kids. Indeed, \nthe vast majority of school employees are hard-working, caring \nindividuals dedicated to ensuring that students learn in a safe, \nnurturing environment. However, we unfortunately have read too many \nrecent headlines about predators who, instead of teaching and \nprotecting kids, ultimately harm and abuse them.\n  I agree with my colleagues that we need to put in place a \ncomprehensive background check system that will close loopholes and \nestablish zero-tolerance policies for sexual misconduct by school \nemployees. That said, I have serious concerns with section 578 in this \nbill. This provision fails to provide adequate due process and civil \nrights protections for innocent individuals. I am also concerned that \nthis provision is overly broad and could potentially allow schools to \ndismiss highly qualified individuals who pose no risk to any children. \nWe need to strike the appropriate balance to make sure there is a just \nprocess before we make the final determination.\n  Another troubling provision is Section 829H, which states that the \nExecutive order on fair pay and safe work places would not apply to all \ndefense contractors; rather, just to those who have previously been \ndebarred or suspended as a result of labor law violations. The \nExecutive order simply requires transparency about a contractor's \nability to follow long-established labor law. The American people \ndeserve to know why DOD decides to task billions of dollars' worth of \nwork to these people. We should ensure that the President's Executive \norder is implemented fairly and consistently across the Federal \nGovernment.\n  The bill also contains three related troubling provisions relating to \nthe issue of how to best protect Americans' national security as it \nrelates to the launching of national security payloads into space. I \nwill have more to say about that as this debate progresses, but I would \nnote at the outset that the provision in the bill which I am pointing \nto has been addressed at the highest levels by our Department of \nDefense.\n  The Secretary of Defense, Ash Carter; the Director of National \nIntelligence, James Clapper; and the Secretary of the Air Force, \nDeborah James, all disagree with the chairman of this authorization \ncommittee on this issue--every one of them. They all agree that this \nSenator's proposal would cost taxpayers across America billions of \ndollars more than the current strategy.\n  In times of tight budgets, when America, its taxpayers, and certainly \nthe men and women in uniform need every dollar we can save them, you \ncan't explain or defend the position taken by the committee.\n  The disagreement is over how to best get the United States off the \ndependence of Russian-made rocket engines for the launching of national \nsecurity payloads into space. The proposal coming out of the committee \nfrom the chairman last year and again this year continues to suggest a \nrash and abrupt halt to the purchase of these Russian-made engines. Let \nme make it clear. I want to move away from these Russian engines \nquickly. I want American engines, built by Americans, to propel those \npayloads into space. But it takes time. For 2 years we have been \nappropriating money to achieve this goal. It will take at least 2 or 3 \nyears more for us to reach that goal and have an American-made engine.\n\n  This chairman of this committee ignores that reality and says we will \njust stop when it comes to these Russian engines and take the \nconsequences. Well, the consequences, sadly, are going to be an \nextraordinary expense for American taxpayers.\n  As chairman and now vice-chairman of the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee, I am committing to an American-made engine. We have \nappropriated even more funds for this effort than this authorizing \ncommittee has authorized over the last several years. The Air Force is \nusing these funds to liberate us from Russian-made rockets as quickly \nas possible. But Secretary Carter, Director Clapper, and Secretary \nJames have all testified publically that the proposal from the senior \nSenator of Arizona is dangerous to national security and costly.\n  Secretary Carter, testifying in front of the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee on May 6, 2015, said:\n\n       We want to get off of that dependency on Russia, but it \n     takes some time to do so. And in the meantime, we don't want \n     to have a gap. . . . We can't afford to have a gap because we \n     need to be able to launch national security satellites.\n\n  Earlier this year, Air Force Secretary James testified in front of \nthe senior Senator's own committee--from which we are now considering \nthe bill--making the same case, noting that the chairman's proposal \n``would add anywhere from $1.5 billion to $5 billion in additional \ncosts.''\n  That is a lot of money. I have heard the chairman of this committee \ncome to this floor over and over and over again, suggesting wasteful \nspending. According to the Secretary of the Air Force, his proposal \nwill end up costing us $1.5 billion more than we should have to pay for \nthis important part of our national defense. That is a waste of \ntaxpayers' dollars.\n  I hope my colleagues will pay attention to this issue, and I hope we \nhave time to debate it in detail. There is simply too much at stake for \nour national security, for our troops, and for the taxpayers to accept \nthe senior Senator's proposal on this matter.\n  This is a lengthy bill, as I mentioned at the outset. I am sure there \nare going to be additional measures that we uncover as we go through it \npage by page, and we will take the time to actually do so.\n  In the meantime, I thank the chairman and ranking member of this \ncommittee for their work to present this body with their committee's \nproduct. I look forward to a meaningful debate on the many issues this \nauthorization bill presents.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, tomorrow President Obama will make a \nhistoric visit to Hiroshima, the site of the first atomic bombing. He \nwill become the first sitting President of the United States to do so, \nand I commend him for this long overdue Presidential recognition.\n  Having traveled to Hiroshima in 1985 to witness the commemoration of \nthe 40th anniversary of that atomic bombing, I know from personal \nexperience that any visit there serves as a powerful reminder of \nAmerica's responsibility to reduce the risk of nuclear war. That risk \nremains as real today as it was nearly 71 years ago when we dropped \nthat bomb that killed 140,000 people in 1 day.\n  In the last few decades, important progress has been made to reduce \nthe threat of nuclear war. The United States and Russia have reduced \nthe size of their nuclear arsenals. The beginning of an additional \nchange is going to happen in 2018 when both the United States and \nRussia will have no more than 1,550 deployed strategic warheads after \nimplementation of the New START treaty.\n  But that progress has come at a cost. In exchange for the support of \nSenate Republicans for passage of the New\n\n[[Page S3264]]\n\nSTART treaty in 2010, President Obama promised to fund major upgrades \nto America's nuclear arsenal.\n  Since then, the extent of these upgrades and their costs have \nswelled. Today it is estimated that President Obama's nuclear \n``modernization'' plan will end up costing U.S. taxpayers nearly $1 \ntrillion over the next 30 years.\n  However this modernization plan is little more than a plan to expand \nAmerica's capabilities, its nuclear capabilities. It would create new \nnuclear weapons, including a dangerous nuclear air launch cruise \nmissile that will cost tens of billions of dollars over the next two \ndecades.\n  Nuclear cruise missiles are a particular concern because they are \ndifficult to distinguish from nonnuclear cruise missiles. As a \nconsequence, if the United States used a conventional cruise missile in \na conflict with Russia or China, it could lead to devastating \nmiscalculation on the other side and, as a result, to accidental \nnuclear war.\n  Worse still, the Defense Department has justified this new nuclear \ncruise missile by asserting that it is needed for purposes beyond \ndeterrence. The Pentagon explains that the new nuclear cruise missile \ncould be used to respond ``proportionately to a limited nuclear \nattack,'' meaning that this nuclear weapon becomes more usable in a \nstandoff with Russia, China, or some other country.\n  When President Obama visited Prague in 2009, he pledged to reduce the \nrole of nuclear weapons in our national security. If the President \ntruly wants to make good on this promise, I think it is important for \nhim to stop these nuclear expansion efforts. He should cancel the \nfunding for the new nuclear cruise missile, which would make the \nprospect of fighting a nuclear war more imaginable.\n  In the meantime, Congress can and must act. Rather than plunging \nblindly ahead by spending money on this dangerous new weapon, we can \ncall for a timeout while we evaluate its costs and its risks. That is \nwhy I have submitted an amendment to the National Defense Authorization \nAct that would delay any spending on the nuclear cruise missile for 1 \nyear so that we can have the full debate on this weapon; so that we can \nensure that we understand the consequences of building this new weapon; \nso that we can understand how the Russians and the Chinese might \nrespond to it; so that each Member of the Senate can understand that \nit, in fact, has nuclear war-fighting capabilities.\n  It is not just a defensive weapon; it has the ability to be used in a \nnuclear war-fighting scenario. How do I know this? It is because this \nPentagon, this Department of Defense, says that it is usable and says \nthat it could be used in a limited nuclear war. Do we really want to be \nauthorizing in this Senate that kind of new weapon that makes fighting \na nuclear war more imaginable?\n  I think Americans deserve an opportunity to consider whether tens of \nbillions of dollars of their tax dollars should be spent on a \nredundant, destabilizing, new nuclear missile. They expect that we will \nask the tough questions about the need for $1 trillion in new nuclear \nweapons spending, but they especially want us to ask questions about \nnew weapons that the Pentagon is saying make it possible to contemplate \na limited nuclear war. That is a debate which this body needs to have. \nThat is a weapons system we should be discussing.\n  This new cruise missile with nuclear warheads is the tip of the new \n$1 trillion nuclear modernization program. We should debate that first. \nWe can examine the rest of the modernization program, the new nuclear \nprograms, but we should at least have that debate and that vote out \nhere. We should give ourselves at least 1 year before we allow it to \ncommence so that we can study it. Then next year we can have the vote \non whether or not we want to commence. As yet, I don't think we have \nhad the debate or have a full understanding of what the implications of \nthis weapon are.\n  Plans to build more nuclear weapons would not only be expensive, but \nthey could trigger a 21st century arms race with Russia and China, \nwhich are unlikely--very unlikely--to stand idly by as we expand our \nnuclear arsenal. The result would be a tragic return to the days of the \nCold War, when both sides built up ever greater stockpiles of nuclear \nweapons. As we get closer and closer to the contemplation that both \nsides could actually consider fighting a nuclear war, our goal should \nbe to push us further and further and further away from the concept \nthat it is possible to fight a nuclear, limited war on this planet.\n  The National Defense Authorization Act also contains another \nmisguided provision that would lay the groundwork for a spiraling \nnuclear weapons buildup. Currently, our policy, the U.S. policy, states \nthat we will pursue a ``limited'' missile defense--limited. This \napproach is meant to protect our territory against missile attacks by \ncountries such as Iran and North Korea without threatening Russia or \nChina's nuclear deterrent.\n  As recognized by generations of responsible policymakers, \nconstructing missile defenses aimed at Russia or China would be self-\ndefeating and destabilizing. Dramatically expanding our missile \ndefenses could cause Russia and China to fear that the United States \nseeks to protect itself from retaliation from Russia or China so that \nwe can carry out a preventive nuclear attack on China or on Russia. \nThat plays into the most militaristic people inside of those countries, \nwho will then say that they too need to make additional investments and \nthat cycle of offense and defense continues to escalate until you reach \na point where we are back to where we all started--with those generals, \nwith those arms contractors then dictating what our foreign policy is, \nwhat our defense policy is.\n  They were wrong in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, and they are \nwrong today. That is just the wrong way to go. We have to ensure that \nwe are backing away, not increasing the likelihood that these weapons \ncan be used. We don't want to be empowering those in our own country--\neither at the Pentagon or the arms contractors--because they will have \nthe same people in the Kremlin and their arms contractors who will be \nrubbing their hands and saying: Great. Let's build all of these new \nweapons, both offensive and defensive. They would love this. That is \nwhy we have to have the debate on the Senate floor.\n  This generation of Americans deserves to know what its government is \nplanning in terms of nuclear war-fighting strategy. That is what a \nlimited war is all about. That is what this new cruise missile with a \nnuclear bomb on it that is more accurate, more powerful, more likely to \nbe used in a nuclear war is all about. That is why the Pentagon wants \nit; that is why the arms contractors want to make it. But it is just a \nreturn to the earlier era where every one of these new nuclear weapons \nsystems that had blueprints and were on the table over at the Pentagon \nare over and the defense contractor has the green light to build it.\n  What happened every single time is the Soviet Union said: We are \nbuilding the exact same counterpart system. Was that making the world \nmore or less safe? Was that bringing us closer or further away from a \nnuclear war? Which was the correct direction for our country to be \nheaded?\n  Well, thank God, we began to talk at Reykjavik--President Reagan and \nPresident Gorbachev. Thank God, we now have a New START Treaty. But as \npart of the New START Treaty, there was a Faustian deal, and that \nFaustian deal was that we are going to build a new generation of \nusable, war-fighting nuclear weapons in our own country. And that \nFaustian deal is one that would then be lived with by this next \ngeneration of Americans and citizens of this planet.\n\n  So we need to ensure we can have this debate. The fears that I think \nare going to be engendered into the minds of those in China and Russia \nwould result in a new dangerous nuclear competition that would have our \nnew defenses be responded to by their building new additional nuclear \nweapons and by putting them on high alert. You would have to be on high \nalert, if you were in Russia or China, if you thought we had a \ndefensive system that could knock them down, and if our planning \nincluded attacking them.\n  We don't want either country to be on high alert for a nuclear war. \nWe don't want that. That is where we were in the 1980s. That is where \nwe were in the 1970s--both sides with their finger\n\n[[Page S3265]]\n\non the button. It is unnecessary, it is dangerous, it is a repetition \nof history, and it is something we should be debating out here. It just \ncan't be something that is casually added without a full appreciation \nin our country for what the consequences are going to be long term.\n  So we have an incredible opportunity. It is timely. The President is \nvisiting Hiroshima. It should weigh on the consciences of every one of \nus that we have a responsibility to make sure we are reducing and not \nincreasing the likelihood of nuclear war occurring.\n  I have filed an amendment to strike the provision from the NDAA. I \nurge all of my colleagues to support it. I think that second amendment \nis also one that deserves a full debate on the Senate Floor. If we want \nother countries to reduce their nuclear arsenals and restrain their \nnuclear war plans, the United States must take the lead instead of \nwasting billions of dollars on dangerous new nuclear weapons that do \nnothing to keep our Nation safe.\n  President Obama should scale back his nuclear weapons buildup. \nInstead of provoking Russia and China with expanding missile defenses \nthat will ultimately fail, we should work toward a new arms control \nagreement.\n  As President Obama said in Prague in 2009, let us honor our past by \nreaching for a better future. The lesson of the past and the lesson of \nHiroshima is clear. Nuclear weapons must never be used again on this \nplanet.\n  President Obama did an excellent job in reaching a nuclear arms \ncontrol agreement with Iran. That was important, because if Iran was \nright now on its way to the development of a nuclear weapon, there is \nno question that Saudi Arabia and other countries in that region would \nalso be pursuing a nuclear weapon. We would then have a world where \npeople were not listening to each other, where people would be \nthreatening each other with annihilation, with total destruction.\n  Here is where we are. We are either going to live together or we are \ngoing to die together. We are either going to know each other or we are \ngoing to exterminate each other. The final choice that we all have and \nthe least we should be able to say--if that point in the future is \nreached and those missiles are starting to be launched that have \nnuclear warheads on board--is that we tried, that we really tried to \navoid that day.\n  That is our challenge here on the Senate floor--to have this debate, \nto give ourselves the next year to have this question raised as to \nwhether we want to engage in a Cold War-like escalation of new \noffensive and new defensive nuclear weapons to be constructed in our \ncountry, which for sure then would trigger the same response in Russia \nand China. By the way, for sure it is saying to Pakistan, India, Iran, \nSaudi Arabia, and to any other country that harbors its own secret \nmilitary desire to have these weapons that they should not listen to \nthe United States because we are preaching nuclear temperance from a \nbar stool. We are not, in fact, abiding by what we say that the rest of \nthe world should do.\n  So we should be debating that right now. We should have this \nchallenge presented to us and to have the words be spoken as to what \nthe goals are for these weapons. If the Defense Department says to us \nthis year that this leads to a capacity to use nuclear weapons in a \nlimited nuclear war--and they were saying that to us in the last 6 \nmonths--do we really want to have these weapons then constructed in our \ncountry? Is that really what we want to have as our legacy?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/senate-section/article/S3261-1"}, {"day": "26", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3265-S3266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     FRANK R. LAUTENBERG CHEMICAL SAFETY FOR THE 21ST CENTURY BILL\n\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I also wish to spend a couple of minutes \ntalking about another issue that is a relic of the Cold War era, and \nthat is TSCA, the legislation that deals with toxic chemicals within \nour country.\n  There was a law passed 40 years ago to deal with toxic chemicals in \nour country, but ultimately that law never worked. When we look back, \nit is like a political, environmental Edsel, still sitting in the \ngarage 40 years later but not useful in protecting American families \nfrom the chemicals in our society--asbestos and hundreds and thousands \nof others. It is just not usable.\n  Congress stands ready right now, thank God, to reform the last of the \n``core four'' environmental statutes that have yet to be modernized. I \nhope we will do so with a stronger bipartisan vote than on any major \nenvironmental statute in recent American history, and that we do so \nsoon.\n  This historic vote to comprehensively reform the Toxic Substances \nControl Act comes after years of hard work by many Senators on both \nsides of the aisle. We worked for some months to reconcile the two \nbills, and all of us were driven by the same reason. Since it was \nwritten four decades ago, TSCA has sat there untouched. It is a statute \nthat simply does not work to protect anyone. Ever since industries \nsuccessfully challenged EPA's proposed asbestos ban, EPA has not been \nable to effectively use the authority Congress intended it to have.\n  In conference, we truly did take the best of both bills. We made sure \nEPA will have industry fees to do its chemical safety work. We made \nsure there will be enforceable deadlines for EPA to write chemical \nsafety rules and for industry to comply with them. We fixed the legal \nproblems in the law that caused the asbestos ban to be overturned and \nthat paralyzed EPA and prevented them from regulating some extremely \ntoxic chemicals. We ensured that when EPA studies a chemical, it \nconsiders only the environmental or health effects of that chemical, \nand that it only considers the potential cost of regulation when it is \nwriting a rule to regulate it. We made sure that EPA would act more \nquickly to regulate the most dangerous chemicals, and that vulnerable \nsubpopulations, such as children, pregnant women, and workers would be \nprotected. We made sure the industry could not continue to improperly \nkeep information about dangerous chemicals secret any longer.\n  In some of the last negotiations that I helped to lead, we made sure \nthat States could continue with the work they are already doing to \nprotect their residents. I am particularly proud that I was able to \nprotect Massachusetts's pending flame-retardant law in these last few \nkey changes to the bill that were agreed to in the last few days.\n  The fact that we have a bill that has the Humane Society and the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce both urging a ``yes'' vote tells you something. The \nfact that the bill is supported by the EPA, the chemical industry, many \nenvironmental stakeholders, and the trial lawyers tells you something \nabout this bill.\n  This is like a political Halley's Comet. When you have Jim Inhofe and \nDavid Vitter agreeing with Ed Markey on a piece of legislation, you \nshould take note of that moment in the history of passing legislation. \nThat is where we are. We have something that is historic. The \nenvironmental bill of a generation is about to pass.\n  The fact that 403 Members of the House of Representatives voted yes--\n403 voted in support of this bill--tells you something. It tells you we \nrolled up our sleeves and we worked together on a bipartisan, bicameral \nbasis to compromise in the way that Americans expect us to.\n  I thank all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and both \nsides of the Capitol, and I look forward to watching the President sign \nthis important legislation to protect the health and well-being of all \nAmericans. This is a bill that does protect us from the dangers that \nAmericans are exposed to--whether they are Democrats or Republicans, \nliberals or conservatives.\n  This is the way the Chamber should operate. This is the way we should \nalso consider nuclear warfighting policy. We should have the same kind \nof attention, the same kind of respect for the consequences for \ngenerations to come in our country. We should give it the same kind of \nrespectful, bipartisan, bicameral attention that the public can \nunderstand.\n  I thank the Chair for this opportunity.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S3266]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/senate-section/article/S3265-1"}, {"day": "26", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n      HONORING NEBRASKA'S SOLDIERS WHO LOST THEIR LIVES IN COMBAT\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise to continue my tribute to \nNebraska's heroes and the current generation of men and women who lost \ntheir lives defending our freedom in Iraq and Afghanistan. Each of \nthese Nebraskans has a special story to tell.\n\n\n                         Corporal Adrian Robles\n\n  Today I will share the story of the life of Marine Cpl Adrian Robles \nof Scottsbluff, NB. Adrian was known throughout Scottsbluff for his big \nsmile. His older sister Beatriz remembers it this way: ``As soon as he \nsmiled, even if you were mad at him, you would stop and have to \nsmile.''\n  Behind that big smile, though, was a tough young man. More than \nanything, Adrian wanted to be a marine. This longing to serve his \ncountry was a point of pride and tradition in Adrian's family. His \ngrandfather, Pedro Torres, served as a fighter pilot in World War II. \nPedro's stories of service and adventure inspired Adrian's quest to \nbecome a marine, and their bond was a source of joy throughout the \nfamily.\n  As Adrian's father Cesar recalls, ``He loved his grandpa so much. He \nwas a hero to him.''\n  When he was 16, Adrian approached his parents and told them he wanted \nto be a marine. He didn't want to wait. He even prepared a waiver for \nthem to sign, which would have allowed Adrian to join the Corps when he \nturned 17. While they admired the passion in their young son, Adrian's \nparents stood firm. They wanted Adrian to focus on completing his high \nschool education.\n  Deterred but not discouraged, Adrian decided to join the high school \nsoccer team. Soccer became an outlet for him, not only as an athlete \nbut as a way to train and get in shape for the Marines. Adrian \ngraduated from Scottsbluff High School in May of 2005. As expected, he \nimmediately enlisted in the Marine Corps.\n  In the year that followed, Adrian completed basic training and served \na full tour in Iraq by the end of 2007. His determination impressed his \nfellow marines. GySgt Trent Kuhlhoof served with Adrian during a tour \nin Iraq. Adrian was the kind of person who naturally bonded with \neveryone. As Sergeant Kuhlhoof remembers, ``It was hard for me to get \nmad at him--for anything.''\n  Adrian had discovered his calling. He worked toward excellence, and \nhe loved being a marine. A marksman is the centerpiece of every Marine \ncombat team, and Adrian was a good one. By the age of 21, he had earned \nthree Good Conduct Medals, a rare feat in the military.\n  In the spring of 2008, Cpl Adrian Robles deployed to Afghanistan as \npart of the 2nd Battalion, 1st Marine Division. Their mission was to \ntrain local Afghan military forces, but by the fall this changed to a \nsecurity mission as tensions rose in the dangerous territory of Helmand \nProvince.\n  A few months later, on October 22, 2008, Adrian was on patrol when \nsuddenly his vehicle was hit by an improvised explosive device. \nCorporal Robles was killed instantly. His unit was scheduled to leave \nAfghanistan 2 months later.\n  On November 2, 2008, hundreds of friends and neighbors from \nScottsbluff lined the streets from the church to the cemetery. An honor \nguard and horse and carriage team transported the casket to its final \nresting place.\n  In a career of 3 short years, Corporal Robles earned three Good \nConduct Medals, two Sea Service Deployment Ribbons, the Afghanistan \nCampaign Medal, the Iraq Campaign Medal, the Global War on Terrorism \nService Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, and the Purple \nHeart.\n  Adrian's mother Yolanda recalls that his life's passion was to serve \nhis country. She notes that he hated war and knew the dangers, but he \nloved being a marine. A brave, disciplined, and joyful young man, \nAdrian lived a short life, but his imprint is felt by the countless \npeople who knew and loved him. Perhaps his devotion is summed up best \nby the tattoo on his left arm, which read: ``Your Freedom. My Life. \nWithout Complaint.''\n  Adrian embodied the strength and determination that Nebraskans are \nknown for all over the world.

Madam President, we are about to begin the Memorial \nDay state work period and many of us will be traveling in our home \nstates next week. I am blessed because I am going home to Alaska. \nTomorrow I will be in Haines. This is a magnificent community in truly \na magnificent State. But when I arrive in Haines, something will be \nmissing, and that is the absence of two of Haines' most prominent \ncitizens--John and Erma Schnabel.\n  John Schnabel passed in March at the age of 96 years old, and Erma, \nhis wife of 65 years, passed shortly thereafter at the age of 87. John \nwas regarded by his family and the people of Haines as a living legend. \nIf you don't believe that is true, or if you say all of us have living \nlegends in our community, no less of an authority than People Magazine \nreferred to John as a ``living legend'' in an article which noted his \npassing. He was not just a local legend. He was known the world over as \n``Grandpa.'' He was the patriarch of the Discovery Channel series \n``Gold Rush: Alaska.'' But to us Alaskans, he was simply one of the \nmany exceptional people who populate our exceptional State. John was \nborn in Kansas in 1920. He was the son of a wheat farmer. His father \nfirst moved to Alaska to seek a better life away from the Depression. \nHe served in the military during World War II. He was a proud member of \nthe American Legion. He married Erma in 1950 and they raised five kids.\n  Returning to Haines, John entered the timber business. He owned a \nlumber mill in town. He was one of the region's first industrialists. \nHe was involved in everything. He operated a hotel, a lumberyard, a \nhardware store. He built four downtown commercial buildings. He was one \nof Haines' largest landowners. But changing political attitudes toward \ntimber harvest in Southeast Alaska and the regulations that followed \nput John out of the timber business. Those powerful forces, however, \ndid not put John down. He placer mined for fun and invested in small \nbusinesses. He was the mayor of Haines. He was an outstanding bridge \nplayer. He was an avid reader. I understand that David McCullough's \nbiography of Harry Truman was one of his favorites, even though he was \na loyal Republican.\n  It was only after John was recuperating from heart surgery that he \nentered the mining business in a big way. Think about it, most people \nrehabilitate from a heart surgery by doing more walking or going to the \ngym. John Schnabel decided he was going to work a mine. He worked the \nmine to remain active. He said it was doctor's orders. He did this \nuntil 2 years ago. Effectively, until the time he was 94, he was \nworking the mine.\n  The Discovery Channel folks wandered by and found John Schnabel an \ninteresting man. By 2010, Grandpa was a global celebrity--a reluctant \ncelebrity but a celebrity nonetheless; the star of a reality TV show \nthat ran for six seasons before he passed away.\n  John and Erma were friends of mine. I respected John's business \nacumen and his political leadership, but I really respected the \nrelationship he had with Erma. The last time I visited with John and \nErma was 2 years ago in August. I was there at the Haines Assisted \nLiving Center. I came in and visited with John. John was talking \npolitics with me and with anybody else who was listening, chatting \naround the room. Then, he left to go sit in the corner of the dining \narea, sat next to Erma. He didn't say anything for probably half an \nhour, 45 minutes. He just sat quietly with her, holding her hand. That \nreally moved me when I saw them. Sixty plus years of marriage and still \nholding hands. John had always been the builder. Erma was known as the \ncarer. She took care of the family. She took care of the community. \nLegend has it that there wasn't a person in Haines who had not dined at \nher table at one time or another.\n  They are both gone from Haines, but they are certainly together in \nHeaven.\n\n[[Page S3267]]\n\nAlaska is clearly better for their contributions, and I know I will \ncertainly be thinking of them when I visit Haines tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/senate-section/article/S3266-2"}, {"day": "26", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3267-S3269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          VETERANS HEALTH CARE\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, there are 2 days every year when this \nNation focuses special attention on those who served--Memorial Day and \nVeterans Day. I plan to approach this Memorial Day by expressing \ngratitude to those who have served and honoring the memory of those who \nsacrificed their lives for our freedom.\n  When you serve in the military, supporting your buddy is everything. \nSo as we honor the memory of those lost in action, we know they would \nwant us also to care for their buddies who came home. Advances in \nmilitary medicine since the Vietnam war have made it possible for many \nto survive the wounds of war that they would not have otherwise been \nable to do in earlier conflicts. But these veterans still do not return \nas they left, and many more return to the scourge of post-traumatic \nstress disorders.\n\n  I will see a lot of veterans this Memorial Day weekend. I would like \nto be able to tell the veterans of Alaska that their Federal Government \nis doing right by them, but when it comes to the matter of health care, \nand particularly the failings we see with the Choice Program, I can't \nin good conscience tell them things are better in Alaska.\n  It has been a while since I have been to the floor to speak in \nrelatively bleak terms about the care our veterans receive in Alaska \nbecause for some while things had been improving. They had been \nimproving for much of the last 8 years, but now it seems as if this \npendulum is swinging the other way.\n  When I came to the Senate 13 years ago, Alaska veterans who lived \nsomeplace other than the metropolitan area of Anchorage or Fairbanks or \nthe Kenai Peninsula really didn't think about the VA health care. Those \nwho lived in those three communities were able to gain their care at \nthe local VA clinic, and it worked for them. But if they didn't live in \na community where the VA was located and if they weren't eligible for \nbeneficiary travel, the VA just didn't mean much to them. That was the \nstatus quo, and it really didn't show much sign of changing.\n  Alaskans really began to challenge the status quo during the second \ngulf war. Operation Iraqi Freedom resulted in a large-scale deployment \nof Alaska National Guard members from throughout the State. At one \npoint, 89 different Alaska communities were represented in the Middle \nEast, and it was fully apparent that when these heroes returned home \nand were released from Active Duty, the VA was not prepared to meet \ntheir needs.\n  When then-VA Secretary Nicholson visited Anchorage in 2006, he heard \nthe message loud and clear from Alaska's veterans service organization, \nand that created a groundswell to turn the Alaska VA in a more veteran-\ncentric direction. It wasn't easy.\n  The familiar slogan that ``it doesn't matter who wins an election; \nthe bureaucracy always wins'' was a way of life in the Alaska VA health \ncare system, but we developed a pretty strong ally when Secretary \nShinseki came on board. During his tenure as Secretary, we saw three \nsignificant changes from the status quo.\n  The first thing that happened was that the VA began contracting with \nAlaska's tribal health care providers to care for both our Native and \nnon-Native veterans who lived outside the reach of any VA facilities. \nIf you are a veteran living in Bethel, it didn't make any difference if \nyou were Native or non-Native--you could receive care through the \ntribal health care provider, and they were compensated by the VA at the \nsame encounter rate the Indian Health Service paid them.\n  The second thing we saw with Secretary Shinseki--I had commissioned \nan inspector general's inquiry into allegations that the VA was sending \nour Alaska vets to Seattle and other points even farther than Seattle \nfor care that could be purchased from community providers in Alaska. \nThere were situations where a veteran dealing with cancer and needing \nradiation or chemotherapy treatment would be sent to Seattle for a \nseries of treatments when that same treatment could be provided in \nAnchorage or Fairbanks. Secretary Shinseki brought an end to that \npractice.\n  Third, the VA hired a creative executive with deep experience in the \nAlaska health care market to lead the Alaska VA health care system. \nEven better, the VA senior leadership actually empowered her to do the \nright things for Alaskan veterans. So when that director began to see \nwaiting lists forming for primary care and behavioral health services \nin Anchorage, she took the initiative and she enlisted non-VA providers \nto come in and work with them to solve the problems. We were in a \npretty unique situation. We didn't suffer the wait list that veterans \nin the lower 48 saw because we had somebody who was at the helm, saw \nthe problem, and said: We can be creative; we just need a little bit of \nflexibility so we can address our veterans' needs.\n  The model was pretty simple. If a veteran needed to see someone \noutside the VA, they were placed with that outside provider by VA \nstaff. And those VA staffers who matched the veteran with a local \nprovider actually lived in Alaska. They knew Alaska's geography. They \nknew it wasn't possible to drive from Bethel to Anchorage. They knew \nthe breadth and limitations on services available within our State.\n  Also, the bills for services were sent to the VA; they were not sent \nto the veteran. If for some reason a provider wasn't paid on time, the \nveterans were insulated. They were protected from collection agency \ncalls.\n  It wasn't a perfect system and it wasn't without complaints, but on \nbalance this was the best Alaskan veterans were ever treated.\n  Then came the Phoenix scandal. We hoped that what had happened \nthere--the spotlight that was shown on the VA as a result of a horrible \nscandal--would not affect the good things we were doing in Alaska.\n  Two years later, I can tell you that things have changed profoundly \nand unfortunately, not for the better. The Choice Act seems to have \nbeen the catalyst for unraveling the VA reforms in our little corner of \nthe world. Let me explain why.\n  When we were presented with the Choice Act, I looked at it as having \nanother tool that the VA could use to help expedite care to veterans \nwho couldn't get their care in a timely fashion. If this is another \ntool in the toolbox, this is going to be good for our vets. But the VA \ndidn't view the Choice Act simply as another tool; they viewed the \nChoice Act as the single right answer to care outside the VA. To this \nday, the VA seems to almost resent the fact that a variety of other \npurchase care programs coexist with the Choice Act, and they worked to \nundermine them through a hierarchy of care policies that make it \nimpossible for our local VA officials to use community providers with \nwhom they have built these relationships.\n  That whole unraveling was enough to send our creative, innovative \nAlaska VA director into retirement, and unfortunately that position has \nbeen vacant ever since.\n  By the way, when veterans asked ``What happened here? We had a good \nsystem. It was working. What has happened?'' the VA talking points said \n``Blame the Congress. They gave us the Choice Act, and there is nothing \nwe can do about it.'' That is an entirely disingenuous response given \nthat all of the purchased care authorities that were on the books \nbefore the Choice Act remained on the books after the Choice Act became \nlaw. The VA had the flexibility before the Choice Act to craft local \nsolutions, and they had the same flexibility to do so after the Choice \nAct. The decision not to support local flexibility was a deliberate \nchoice, and it was a choice of the bureaucracy, not a choice that was \nmandated by the Congress.\n  How has the Choice Act been working out in the State of Alaska? I \nspend a lot of time back home. I spend a lot of time visiting with our \nveterans, and I am listening hard. Every now and again, I do hear a \nveteran say: Yeah, I think things are OK. I think I am getting the care \nI want. But more often than not, what I am hearing from our vets is \nthat instead of calling it the Choice Act, it is called the ``bad \nChoice Act'' or ``no choice at all.''\n  For a while, it seemed that the Native partnerships would be subsumed \nin Choice, and we pushed back on that and we won. But for the veterans \nwho\n\n[[Page S3268]]\n\nneeded specialty care, the Choice Act has been a tough road to hoe, and \nI have a couple of examples.\n  There was an elderly Tlingit Indian gentleman from southeast Alaska. \nHe was sent to Seattle for a form of cancer therapy that was not \navailable in Alaska. In the middle of his episode of care, he was told: \nYou will have to return to Alaska. It was only after days on the phone \nwith the VA and the Choice contractor--each whom was pointing the \nfinger at the other--and then my office that the problem was resolved. \nMeanwhile, this veteran was telling his family to prepare for a \nfuneral. It was that dire.\n  Then there was the veteran who was scheduled for neurosurgery. This \nveteran was told that her referral from the Anchorage VA was rescinded \nand she would need to go to the Choice Program for another one. She \ncalled the Choice contractor's hotline and was referred not to \nneurosurgeons but to behavioral health providers. Evidently, the \nindividual on the other end of the line didn't know what neurosurgery \nwas. When the particular problem was resolved, the neurosurgeon was no \nlonger available and the veteran was stuck on painkillers until her \nsurgery could be rescheduled. That is not a good outcome.\n  Another example is when a veteran living in Juneau, our capital city, \nwas under the ongoing care of an ophthalmologist, but that doctor \ndidn't take Choice. The veteran called the 800 number for Choice to get \nanother referral. He was told that he could drive to Sitka and see \nsomeone there. If you lived in Alaska, you would be laughing because \nyou would know there is no road from Juneau to Sitka. They are both \nislands. Another reason you might raise an eyebrow is because not only \ncan you not drive there, but the Choice participant was an optometrist. \nThink about how this veteran feels after calling the 800 number and \nthen being told to just drive down to the next town. You can't drive \nthere, and oh, by the way, that specialist doesn't exist there.\n  The VA and the Choice contractor claim to have fixed these problems, \nbut for every problem that is fixed, there is still a veteran with a \nnew one, a veteran who has lost faith with the Choice Program or a \nprovider who no longer wants the hassle of taking Choice.\n  One provider told me that the amount of time his staff has to spend \non the phone with the Choice Program is disruptive to his practice. He \nsaid it is unfair to the other patients who aren't getting the \nattention they need from the office staff.\n  I don't want to stand here and complain without offering solutions. \nThere is a solution to Choice's problems in the State of Alaska, and \nthat solution is to go back to the way we had it, with the local VA \npartnering local providers with local patients.\n  The Senate Appropriations Committee has urged the VA to reinstate \nthis model in Alaska through language that is included in the fiscal \nyear 2017 report, but I am really not sure where it is going, given the \ncurrent VA leadership. The rapport, unfortunately, is just not there.\n  Toward the end of Secretary Shinseki's tenure, members of the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee in the other body berated the VA for its \npoor congressional relations.\n  I will say that when I needed to talk to the Assistant Secretary for \nCongressional and Legislative Affairs or, for that matter, Secretary \nShinseki, they were right there. And even if the results didn't come as \nquickly as I would have liked them to, that team was clearly delivering \nfor our folks in Alaska, but I cannot say the same for the current \nteam.\n\n  Through the fiscal year 2016 VA appropriations bill, I demanded a \nreport on how the VA would serve Alaskan vets under the consolidated \nChoice Program that told the VA to formulate last summer, and we still \nhaven't seen that report.\n  During the recent appropriations hearings, I raised concerns about \nhow personnel vacancies and management issues in the Alaska VA were \naffecting performance, and Dr. Shulkin took issue with that \ncharacterization. He offered to show me some metrics. We are still \nwaiting.\n  Last week he sent a young doctor from Philadelphia, whom he has \ncharged with running purchased care, up to Alaska. The report back is \nthat he was tone-deaf to criticisms of Choice lodged by our veterans \nand providers, and he suggested that the rate being paid to the Native \nhealth system to do work that the VA should be doing themselves was \nunjustifiably high. This is very troubling.\n  So we learn that VA is hiring a bunch of new executives to help this \nindividual manage a nationwide community care program out of the VA \ncentral office. I remain very concerned. Long before the Phoenix \nscandal, the VA was purchasing community care using a decentralized \nmodel. Now it seems to be moving abruptly to a centralized model. I \ndon't know how well centralized models work in other parts of the West \nor rural communities in other regions, but I can state that they just \ndo not work in a place such as Alaska. One-size-fits-all is not the \nmodel that best serves our veterans, but this seems to be the direction \nwe are moving toward.\n  To make matters worse, we are not even debating what we want \ncommunity care in the VA to look like. We have 100 Members who have a \nstake in the outcome, but only a few seem to be involved in that \ndiscussion. The votes always seem to be pretty much straight up or \ndown, with no opportunity for amendments. We have done that now twice--\nin the first instance with the Choice Act itself and then again last \nyear when we had to bail the VA out because its health care programs \nwould have gone insolvent during the August break if we hadn't done so.\n  We need to address this. We can't keep writing a blank check to the \nVA. We have to have reform, and that reform needs to work.\n  Last week the Senator from Arizona proposed a 3-year extension of the \nChoice Program, but the amendment included some changes in the way the \nVA pays providers in the purchased care arena. There was some \nproblematic language, so I wasn't able to support his amendment at that \ntime. Since then, he has worked with us, which I greatly appreciate, \nand the leaders of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee worked with us \nto resolve those problems. So I can now support the 3-year extension in \nthe Choice Program that he proposes which I expect will include the \nlanguage changes we discussed.\n  But even if we approve that 3 year extension that's not the end of \nour interest in the Choice program or VA purchased care. I think it is \nimportant to take the time; let's get this right. I think we need to \ncome to terms with what we want care outside of the VA to look like. I \nthink there are still some huge problems in the implementation of the \nChoice Program that we need to address, and, unfortunately, these \nproblems are profound in the smaller and harder to get places like \nAlaska.\n  I think it is high time that we give the VA clear direction about the \nvalue we place on access to veterans' health care in those smaller and \nhard to get places. In many cases we know the dynamics of the local \nhealth care markets better than the folks in a central VA office. \nFixing purchased care begins with directing the VA to collaborate with \nMembers of this body to get it right--not allowing the VA to play \nmembers off one another so that, once again, the bureaucracy wins. We \ncan't sit quietly by while the VA blames us for failings that they need \nto own--failures that might have been avoided through collaboration \nwith those who know their localities best.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to spend a few minutes on the floor this \nevening talking about how we make things right for who have served us. \nMemorial Day is but once a year. Veterans Day is but once a year. But \nevery day--every day we need to be honoring and thanking those who \nserve us, and when we say thank you for their service, let's show them \nthat we mean it. Holding the VA's feet to the fire on results is one \nway to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S3269]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/senate-section/article/S3267-1"}, {"day": "26", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3269-S3270]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO FEDERAL EMPLOYEES\n\n\n                               Oscar Peru\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, as the Presiding Officer knows, he is \nstuck with this Senator on the floor on many late afternoons. It seems \nthat when everybody is packing up and heading for home, the Presiding \nOfficer has to listen to this Senator, hopefully waxing eloquently, \ntalking about some of the very good people who work for the Department \nof Homeland Security.\n  When looking at people who do important work for our country, there \nare a lot of valuable agencies, a lot of very valuable and hardworking \npeople. But some of the best and brightest folks work for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, trying to protect us and our families \nand our businesses and our country.\n  I have come regularly to the floor now for a couple of years to \nhighlight some of the great work being done by the men and woman who \nserve us at the Department of Homeland Security. As you may recall, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security was sort of cobbled together roughly a \ndozen years ago. We took 20 different component agencies with over \n220,000 employees stationed all over the world and said: We are going \nto make you the Department of Homeland Security.\n  It has not been easy, but I think it is a work in progress. But when \nyou consider that the Department of Defense was created right after \nWorld War II and they still struggle at times to function as \neffectively as we would like, we should not be surprised that the \nDepartment of Homeland Security has gone through some growing pains, if \nyou will, in learning how to work together.\n  We are proud of the work they do and grateful for the work they do. \nBut they have some of the toughest jobs of the folks who work in \nFederal workforce. From stopping drugs from crossing into our borders \nto protecting our cyber networks from hackers to securing nuclear and \nradiological materials, the Department of Homeland Security has a \ndiverse, complex, and a difficult mission--really, a combination of \nmissions.\n  Each and every day, tens of thousands of Department of Homeland \nSecurity employees quietly and diligently work behind the scenes. They \nwork to achieve the mission, the core of which is keeping over 300 \nmillion Americans safe as we go about our daily lives.\n  It is easy to forget that despite all it achieves each day keeping \nAmericans safe around the world, the Department of Homeland Security is \nstill a teenager. I said earlier that it came together in 2002, almost \n14 years ago, following the attacks on 9/11, when it became clear that \nwe needed a centralized agency to pool and share information--about \nwhat?--about the threats to our country and to coordinate the efforts \nto keep these threats at bay.\n  In 14 years, the Department of Homeland Security has done an \nexceptional job, integrating nearly 20 agencies from across from the \ngovernment, with different histories, different cultures, and different \ncapabilities and expertise. Senior leaders in the Department--chief \namong them now are Secretary Jeh Johnson and Deputy Secretary Ali \nMayorkas--work each day and every day to make the Department of \nHomeland Security more than the sum of its part. They stand on the \nshoulders of those who came before them as Secretaries and Deputy \nSecretaries of this Department.\n  I am proud that just yesterday the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee, on which I serve as the senior Democrat, approved \nbipartisan legislation to support the Department's efforts by \nauthorizing its Unity of Effort Initiative. That initiative \nsuccessfully brought agencies within the Department together to pool \nresources, to deepen coordination, and more effectively to tackle their \njoint missions together. I like to say that if you want to go good \nfast, go alone. If you want to go far, travel together. What we see \nhappening at the Department of Homeland Security is the creation of a \ncohesive unit of what were very many different disparate agencies.\n  One component agency within the Department of Homeland Security that \nnot only serves a critical mission today but has a long and storied \nhistory is called U.S. Customs and Border Protection. In 1789--1789--\nbefore some of our pages were born, the U.S. Customs Service was \nestablished, and a fleet of vessels set out patrolling our shores to \nprevent the shipment of illegal goods--1789.\n  Then in 1924, nearly 92 years ago to the day, the U.S. Border Patrol \nwas established. Later in 2003, the Customs Service and the Border \nPatrol merged to create the modern Customs and Border Protection agency \nthat operates within the Department of Homeland Security today. Today, \nCustoms and Border Protection performs a number of duties on the \nfrontlines of the battle against threats such as terrorism, drugs, and \nhuman trafficking. They work to secure thousands of miles of border and \ncoastline around the country.\n  They work to facilitate travel, to inspect ships and cargo at our \nports of entry. They work to stop illegal drugs and other contraband \nand violent criminals from entering into our country. Today alone, its \n60,000 employees are hard at work welcoming nearly 1 million visitors \nto our country--just in 1 day--screening more than 67,000 cargo \ncontainers for hazards and customs violations, and stopping more than \n12,000 pounds of illicit drugs from entering our country.\n  I am not talking about what they do in a year, or a month, or even a \nweek. That is what they do in a day. Think about that--in one day. The \nkey resource that our Customs officials on the frontlines count on is \nthe support of CBP's Air and Marine Operations. Air and Marine \nOperations uses a fleet of 256 aircraft and 286 marine vessels to \ndetect, to track, and to apprehend criminals in places that agents \ncan't reach on foot or in cars.\n  From fast interceptor boats to Huey helicopters to P-3 aircraft, like \nthe one I flew in during most of my 23 years in the Navy, Air and \nMarine Operations provides critical support to CBP agents. They often \ndo important and dangerous work. Air and Marine agents are also key in \nhelping to find and rescue people on our borders who may be in danger, \nsaving countless people who are found lost or injured in some of the \nmost remote parts of the country.\n  One CBP Air and Marine Operations agent who goes above and beyond to \nhelp secure our borders and keep people safe looks a lot like this \nfellow. His name is Oscar Peru, like the country. He is pictured here \nto my left. Oscar Peru is a CBP aviation enforcement agent based out of \nTucson, AZ. He was raised in Tucson.\n  Oscar joined the Arizona Army National Guard after college. He served \nhis State and his country as a guardsman for 10 years, including by \nfighting in Operation Iraqi Freedom. After working for the State of \nArizona on their Joint Counter Narcotics Task Force, he joined the \nBorder Patrol as a senior patrol agent in 2003.\n  After 5 years as a Border Patrol agent, Oscar joined the Border \nPatrol Search, Trauma, and Rescue Unit. As a trained emergency medical \ntechnician, Oscar was able to provide lifesaving care to countless men, \nwomen, and children who were lost or injured in some of the harshest \nenvironments along the southwestern border of our country.\n  At all hours of the night, Oscar has conducted searches to find and \nsave those in need. Oscar also performed the difficult and--I am sure--\nheartbreaking task of retrieving the bodies of those who have perished \nso they can be returned to their families and given a proper burial.\n  Since 2008, Oscar Peru has served as an aviation enforcement agent, \ncoordinating efforts across Federal agencies. Working with State and \nlocal law enforcement, Oscar conducts operations to identify and stop \ncriminal activity along the border, from drug smuggling to human \ntrafficking to rescue operations.\n  Oscar's work has saved countless lives, arrested countless criminals, \nand kept countless pounds of drugs from ever reaching our communities.\n  Oscar, I would say that is one impressive day's work. We are grateful \nto you for doing it.\n  Those who know Oscar routinely describe him as a man who shows \nincredible compassion for everyone that he encounters, both in his \npersonal life and in his work.\n  Through his years of dedicated service, Oscar has earned the trust of \nhis\n\n[[Page S3270]]\n\npeers, who rely on him as a leader during risky operations and \ndangerous missions. As a certified master and instructor in helicopter \nropes and suspension techniques, Oscar uses his experience to train \nothers in skills necessary to operate safely in a dangerous \nenvironment, often leaning out of the door of a helicopter hundreds of \nfeet up in the air. It is no wonder his colleagues describe Oscar as \ncourageous and as an inspiration to those around him.\n  So, Oscar, my friend, we say thank you. Thank you for your remarkable \nand continued service to our country and to your community in Tucson. A \nspecial thanks for all of the lives you have saved and will continue to \nsave through your heroic work.\n  To Oscar's wife and four children, we say thank you for sharing with \nus a good man, your husband and your dad, for letting him do the \nimportant work that he does every day to keep Americans safe along the \nsouthern border and really around our country.\n  To the 1,200 men and women of the Air and Marine Operations and the \n60,000 employees at Customs and Border Protection, thank you for your \ncontinued service to our country and for your dedication to the safety \nand security of so many others.

Mr. President I want to take another few minutes--I think \nI have the time. I don't see anybody waiting to speak. I want to take a \nminute and say something about a fellow named John Koskinen. John \nKoskinen is the Commissioner of the IRS. In 2013, at a time of great \ntumult at the IRS, President Obama turned to John Koskinen to lead the \nIRS because of his reputation in the public and private sectors as a \ngo-to manager of troubled enterprises.\n  He was 74 at the time. He agreed to take this on. He did not need to \ndo this. He needed to do this job like he needed another head, but he \nsaid that he would do it. He agreed to do it because the President \nasked him to serve our country, and they needed a strong leader at the \nIRS.\n  Prior to his service at the IRS, he held the position of Non-\nExecutive Chairman at Freddie Mac from September 2008 to December 2011. \nDuring that time he served as the interim CEO at Freddie Mac--that was \na tumultuous time, a very difficult time for our country--and as the \nprincipal financial officer after the death of Freddie Mac's acting CFO \nin April of 2009.\n  He retired from the Freddie Mac board in 2012. I want to mention \nanother thing or two about John Koskinen's service prior to coming on \nboard in the last decade to help us in the public sector. Prior to \nserving on the Freddie Mac board, Koskinen served as the president of \nthe U.S. Soccer Foundation from 2004 to 2008. He also previously served \nas deputy mayor of the District of Columbia, the Deputy Director for \nManagement at the Office of Management and Budget, and the Chairman of \nthe President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion.\n  Prior to entering government service, John Koskinen worked for 21 \nyears for the Palmieri Company, as vice president, president, CEO and \nchairman, working in the realm of turnarounds--a person helping to turn \naround large failed enterprises. Earlier in his career, he served as \nthe administrative assistant to then Senator Abraham Ribicoff, \nlegislative assistant to Mayor John Lindsay, and Assistant to the \nDeputy Executive Director of the National Advisory Commission on Civil \nDisorders.\n  He practiced law with the firm of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher and clerked \nfor Judge David Bazelon, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe District of Columbia.\n  He got his bachelor's degree from Duke University and his law degree \nfrom Yale. I mean, what a resume.\n  At the age of 74, as somebody who helped turn around a lot of failed \nenterprises, our President reached out to him and probably said: I know \nyou are 74, an age where a lot of people are more interested in slowing \ndown and taking life easy. He took on one of the toughest challenges of \nall.\n  He is one of the finest people I know in public service. There are \nsome folks in the Congress who have been asserting that he is unfit for \nservice. I just want to say: They could not be more mistaken. This a \ngood and decent man. I was raised to treat other people the way I want \nto be treated, to figure out the right thing to do, and to treat others \nthe way I want to be treated.\n  Given the sacrifices that he has made with his life at this stage of \nhis life, rather than taking brickbats, he should be taking bouquets. \nSo I would say to you, John Koskinen, if you are out there listening: I \nknow you have other things to do rather than listen to wrapups here in \nthe Senate before we begin the Memorial Day break, but I want to say \nthank you for a lifetime of service, and thank you especially for your \nservice as our leader in the IRS. God bless you and your family. Thanks \nto them for sharing with us a very good human being.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter dated May 23, 2016, from John Koskinen, Commissioner of the \nIRS, whom I was just discussing, to the Honorable Bob Goodlatte, \nchairman of the Committee on the Judiciary in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       Department of the Treasury,\n\n\n                                     Internal Revenue Service,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 23, 2016.\n     Hon. Bob Goodlatte,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter of May 18 \n     inviting me to testify at the Judiciary Committee hearing on \n     May 24 regarding the Committee's inquiry into allegations \n     made against me in my role as IRS Commissioner. I thank you \n     for extending me that courtesy, and for affording me the \n     opportunity to provide the Committee with information in \n     response to the issues raised by some Members of the House. I \n     have the deepest respect for you and for this Committee, and \n     recognize your Committee's responsibility to carefully \n     evaluate these allegations.\n       When the Committee announced this hearing, I was returning \n     from a week in China where I met with the tax administrators \n     of 43 nations to discuss international tax avoidance issues. \n     As a result, since I returned, my schedule has been more \n     crowded than usual, including preparations for a previously \n     scheduled hearing before the House Ways and Means Committee \n     on Wednesday, May 25. Therefore, the short notice provided \n     has left me without sufficient time to prepare to appear in \n     person on Tuesday for what could be a wide-ranging and \n     complex discussion regarding claims that may only become \n     clear after the hearing's first panel. Thus, while I must \n     regrettably decline your invitation, I remain willing to \n     appear before the Committee in the future.\n       In the meantime, if you think it is appropriate and helpful \n     to include in the record at this time, I enclose an initial \n     statement summarizing why the allegations against me lack \n     merit. I think this information may also be useful to \n     witnesses at the second hearing you have announced for June \n     with outside experts.\n       Should the Committee choose to undertake further steps, I \n     hope that it will do so in a manner consistent with the \n     House's longstanding concern for, and provision of, the due \n     process that must attend such a serious course of action. I \n     would be pleased to talk with you further at your \n     convenience.\n           Sincerely,\n     John A. Koskinen.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Written Statement of John A. Koskinen, Commissioner, Internal Revenue \n    Service Before the House Judiciary Committee--for Its Hearing: \n Examining the Allegations of Misconduct Against IRS Commissioner John \n                     Koskinen, Part I May 24, 2016\n\n\n                              InTRODUCTION\n\n       Chairman Goodlatte, Ranking Member Conyers and Members of \n     the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to provide a \n     summary statement for the record in connection with your \n     review of the allegations by some Members of the House \n     Oversight and Government Reform Committee. I hope this \n     summary statement is helpful as you consider whether to \n     initiate a more formal inquiry. I stand ready to cooperate \n     with your Committee with regard to any actions it deems \n     appropriate.\n       I have great respect for our institutions of government, \n     including the United States Congress and each of its Members. \n     When I began my service as Commissioner of the Internal \n     Revenue Service, I took over an agency under investigation by \n     six different bodies\n\n[[Page S3271]]\n\n     and buffeted by ongoing, serious controversy. I regret that, \n     in the period since then, we have not been able to bring \n     these matters to a conclusion satisfactory to all Members of \n     this distinguished Body, including those who are testifying \n     today before you.\n       I believe the allegations you will hear described today, \n     and the related House Resolution are without merit, for \n     reasons summarized below. But I also acknowledge the strong \n     feelings that are held by some Members regarding this matter, \n     as well as their understandable frustration with the document \n     production and retention challenges of our agency during the \n     past several years. I also understand their deep concern \n     regarding the actions that gave rise to these controversies \n     --conduct that ended long before I arrived at the IRS. I am \n     committed to continuing to make improvements and working with \n     all committees and Members of Congress during my tenure as \n     Commissioner, and I sincerely hope that, over time, trust and \n     goodwill on all sides will be restored.\n\n\n                               BACKGROUND\n\n       Let me begin by noting that I never sought the position of \n     IRS Commissioner, which I have held since December 2013. \n     After concluding my work as Non-Executive Chairman of Freddie \n     Mac, having been asked to undertake that role in the wake of \n     the financial crisis by President George W. Bush's \n     Administration, I was happily retired. I served on the boards \n     of two large, publicly-traded companies and tried to keep up \n     with my grandchildren. But I agreed to serve when approached \n     by the current Administration in May 2013, because I have a \n     longstanding commitment to public service, and because I \n     understand the importance of the IRS to the government and \n     the nation. The IRS collects more than 90 percent of the \n     revenue that funds the operations of the Federal government, \n     and the agency's activities touch virtually every American.\n       When I came to the IRS, I knew no one who worked at the \n     agency, and to this day I have never met or spoken to former \n     IRS Director of Exempt Organizations Lois Lerner. By the time \n     I was confirmed as Commissioner in December 2013, six \n     investigations were already well underway in response to the \n     May 2013 report by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax \n     Administration (TIGTA) regarding the use of improper criteria \n     to process applications for tax-exempt status under section \n     501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n       It should be noted that organizations applying for \n     501(c)(4) status at that time did not need a determination \n     from the IRS to undertake their activities. Until last \n     December, when Congress passed the Protecting Americans from \n     Tax Hikes (PATH) Act--which requires 501(c)(4) organizations \n     to advise the IRS when they begin activities--any entity \n     could operate as a 501(c)(4) simply by filing the annual \n     information returns required by the IRS. Nonetheless, those \n     organizations had a right to a determination if they sought \n     it, and the IRS had an obligation to provide that \n     determination promptly and efficiently. Early in my tenure, I \n     apologized to all groups who experienced inordinate delays \n     and complications in the review of their applications.\n       My goal from the start has been to respond as quickly and \n     completely as possible to inquiries from any of the six \n     investigating entities, to help them develop recommendations \n     that would in turn assist us in ensuring that the management \n     failures described in TIGTA's May 2013 report would never \n     happen again.\n       My previous experience in government helped me to \n     understand the importance of complying with such \n     investigations. Earlier in my career, I spent four years as \n     Chief of Staff to former Sen. Abraham Ribicoff, who served as \n     Chairman of a subcommittee of the Senate Governmental Affairs \n     Committee and, ultimately, as Chairman of the Committee. The \n     Committee held hearings on a variety of important issues, and \n     my involvement in those hearings impressed upon me the \n     importance of Congressional oversight of the Executive \n     Branch, and the responsibility of agencies to respond as \n     quickly and completely as possible to requests for \n     information from Congress.\n       In response to the May 2013 TIGTA report, the IRS accepted \n     and implemented all of the Inspector General's \n     recommendations, with one exception. The only recommendation \n     we have not completed involves clarifying how to measure the \n     social welfare and political activities of section 501(c)(4) \n     organizations. Before I became Commissioner, the Treasury and \n     the IRS drafted proposed regulations on this issue for public \n     comment. The regulations proved to be very controversial and \n     provoked over 160,000 comments. I suggested that we start \n     over, taking into consideration the range of comments \n     provided and emphasizing that our goal was not to change the \n     basic, existing rules but, instead, to clarify them as \n     recommended by the TIGTA report. We were instructed by \n     Congress in December to halt our work in this area, which we \n     have done.\n       TIGTA reviewed our actions in response to the May 2013 \n     report, and issued a follow-up report in March 2015 that \n     noted the IRS had taken ``significant actions'' to address \n     their recommendations. We also accepted and implemented their \n     additional suggestions.\n       In August 2015, another of the six investigating entities, \n     the Senate Finance Committee, concluded its two-and-a-half \n     year investigation with an exhaustive report. As I testified \n     to the Finance Committee in October last year, the IRS \n     accepted all the recommendations in the Committee's report \n     that were within our control--those that did not involve tax \n     policy matters or legislative action. They included 15 of the \n     report's 18 bipartisan recommendations. We also accepted and \n     have implemented all of the recommendations within our \n     control in the separate reports prepared by the Majority and \n     Minority of the Committee.\n       In addition to the Senate Finance Committee, the Senate \n     Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, the Department of \n     Justice (DOJ), and TIGTA have concluded their investigations \n     and their work, with the exception of one historical review \n     being done by TIGTA. None of these entities have indicated \n     any further action or activity is necessary or required.\n       Despite that, some Members have urged the House to impeach \n     me. Impeachment is, of course, an extraordinary tool, used \n     very rarely by the House after a careful and deliberative \n     process, including, in previous cases, providing substantial \n     due process and other safeguards to the accused individual. \n     These safeguards, which include adequate time to prepare and \n     the right to call and examine witnesses, are not part of this \n     preliminary inquiry. And as described below, I believe \n     impeachment is a wholly improper tool in this instance.\n\n\n  RESPONSES TO THE ALLEGATIONS IN THE PROPOSED ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT\n\n       As indicated earlier, I believe there is no substance to \n     any of the four charges put forward by some Members of the \n     House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. My responses \n     to these allegations can be summarized as follows:\n\n                           Proposed Article I\n\n       The IRS, under my direction, responded to Congressional \n     requests for information with a massive production of \n     documents.\n       Both TIGTA and DOJ have determined that the erasure of \n     disaster recovery tapes was an accident.\n       No one has even suggested, nor could they suggest, that I \n     was somehow personally involved in the erasure of the tapes.\n       The IRS has taken steps to prevent a repeat of the failure \n     to preserve information.\n       Under my direction, the IRS has responded comprehensively \n     and in good faith to the various subpoenas and document \n     requests from the investigating entities.\n       Despite historically low levels of funding, the IRS \n     incurred more than $20 million in expenses (and devoted more \n     than 160,000 man-hours) to collect, review, and produce \n     approximately 1.3 million pages of documents. As part of this \n     massive document production, the IRS recovered and produced \n     over 78,000 emails that were sent or received by former IRS \n     Director of Exempt Organizations Lois Lerner, including over \n     24,000 emails from the period affected by Ms. Lerner's hard \n     drive crash.\n       The IRS was able to recover such a large number of emails \n     by looking in the places where it believed the emails were \n     most likely to be found: in the email accounts of IRS \n     employees that Ms. Lerner worked with or supervised. The \n     IRS's strategy was to make up for any technical or \n     recordkeeping shortcomings that may have existed by pursuing \n     a broad, even redundant, document collection and review \n     effort.\n       The erasure of 422 disaster recovery tapes at Martinsburg, \n     West Virginia was clearly a failure of the IRS's document \n     preservation protocols. The IRS accepts responsibility for \n     it, and as detailed in its submissions to Congress, has \n     improved employee training and taken other measures to \n     minimize the risk that anything like this could ever happen \n     again. However, both TIGTA and DOJ agreed that the erasure \n     was an accident. As TIGTA stated in its investigative report, \n     its extensive interviews ``provided no evidence that the IRS \n     employees involved intended to destroy data on the tapes or \n     hard drives in order to keep this information from Congress, \n     the DOJ or TIGTA.''\n\n                          Proposed Article II\n\n       I acted in good faith in my efforts to comply with all \n     Congressional requests related to the investigations.\n       I testified truthfully and to the best of my knowledge in \n     answering questions concerning the search for, and production \n     of, emails related to the investigations.\n       The IRS only became aware of the accidental erasure of \n     disaster recovery tapes in 2015, after being notified by \n     TIGTA during its investigation of the Lerner hard drive \n     crash.\n       The allegations that I somehow attempted to deceive \n     Congress are unfounded. On June 20, 2014, I testified to the \n     House Ways and Means Committee that ``since the start of this \n     investigation, every email has been preserved. . . .'' That \n     was my honest belief at the time, as I was not yet aware of \n     the Martinsburg erasure.\n       I only became aware of the erasure in 2015, after TIGTA \n     briefed the IRS on the matter. On June 23, 2014, I testified \n     to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee that \n     ``backup tapes from 2011 no longer existed because they had \n     been recycled,'' and that IRS personnel ``went back and \n     looked and made sure'' of this. This was my honest belief, \n     based on briefings with IRS Information Technology (IT) \n     personnel.\n       On March 26, 2014, in testimony to the House Oversight and \n     Government Reform Committee, I promised to produce ``all of \n     Lois Lerner's emails.'' As detailed in the discussion above, \n     the IRS made great efforts to\n\n[[Page S3272]]\n\n     produce all available Lerner emails, conducting a broad \n     search at substantial expense. The breadth of the IRS's \n     efforts illustrates the good faith underlying the promise to \n     comply with the Committee's request.\n\n                          Proposed Article III\n\n       The IRS went to great lengths to cooperate with and \n     facilitate the various investigations into the determination \n     process for tax-exempt status.\n       The main allegation seems to be that I somehow impeded \n     Congressional investigations by delaying for four months in \n     notifying Congress regarding the Lois Lerner hard drive \n     crash. This is inaccurate. It was never my intent to impede \n     the investigations in any way; to the contrary, the IRS went \n     to great lengths to cooperate with and facilitate the various \n     investigations.\n       It is important to note that the Lerner hard drive crash \n     was by no means purposely hidden from Congress. Emails \n     discussing the hard drive crash were included in the \n     substantial production of emails to the Congress months \n     earlier, in 2013. Documents provided included a series of \n     emails to Ms. Lerner in 2011 from the IRS IT division \n     discussing the computer problems she experienced with her \n     hard drive crash and IT's efforts to resolve them.\n       It was not until February 2014 that agency attorneys \n     discovered a problem with Ms. Lerner's emails. The IRS \n     attorneys also did not discover this from the e-mail \n     exchanges that had been earlier provided to the Congress. \n     Instead, the discovery was made when IRS attorneys, who were \n     producing emails for the Congressional committees, noticed an \n     apparent chronological ``gap'' in the Lerner emails that had \n     already been provided to Congress in 2013. After making this \n     discovery, IRS officials worked to assess what happened, \n     determine whether and how data was lost, and study how the \n     data might be recovered from other sources.\n       I first learned the details of the Lerner hard drive crash \n     in April 2014, and directed IRS personnel to continue the \n     work of determining the extent of the data loss so that a \n     complete description of the problem could be provided outside \n     of the IRS. That work identified 24,000 of Ms. Lerner's \n     emails from the crash period that could be provided to the \n     various investigators. When the IRS completed its assessment \n     of the Lerner email situation in June 2014, we made a full \n     and timely report to the Congressional committees, DOJ and \n     TIGTA.\n\n                          Proposed Article IV\n\n       I oversaw a broad document collection and review to comply \n     with the investigations.\n       The gist of this allegation is that I failed to competently \n     oversee the IRS's response to Congressional investigations. \n     There has been no suggestion that I denied IRS personnel the \n     needed resources nor in any other way impeded their efforts \n     to respond to the varied Congressional inquiries. To the \n     contrary, as detailed above, the IRS conducted a broad \n     document collection and review, producing a comprehensive \n     record of the matters under investigation, notwithstanding \n     substantial technical and resource challenges. I received \n     regular reports on the work to complete this effort by IRS \n     lawyers and other personnel. Much of this work was done \n     during my first months on the job. Our goal was to provide \n     TIGTA, DOJ, and the Congressional committees all of the \n     information that they needed to advance and ultimately \n     complete their investigations.\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n       While the allegations raised by some Members of the House \n     Oversight and Government Reform Committee are serious and \n     relate to acknowledged errors made by the IRS, the \n     Constitution reserves the use of impeachment for ``treason, \n     bribery, or high crimes and misdemeanors.'' None of my \n     actions relating to the issues above, viewed in light of all \n     the facts, come close to that level.\n       I would also note that impeachment has been used only on \n     very rare occasions in the 228-year history of our \n     Constitution. Aside from two Presidents, the only impeachment \n     of a member of the Executive Branch occurred in 1876. If the \n     Committee were to go forward and pursue impeachment in this \n     instance, especially in light of the utter lack of support \n     for the allegations, it would set an unfortunate precedent, \n     diminishing the ability of the Federal government to attract \n     experienced, dedicated people to positions of leadership. \n     Some have suggested that my impeachment would be an \n     appropriate means of holding the IRS accountable for acts of \n     others that occurred before I came to the agency. This \n     approach would make it particularly hard to attract new \n     leaders when they are needed most--when a critical agency is \n     in crisis following serious mistakes, needing both to reform \n     its practices and respond to investigations. That would be a \n     great loss for the government and for the country.\n       I want to be clear that, despite being faced with these \n     unwarranted allegations, I remain honored to serve as the IRS \n     Commissioner, and to lead a group of employees who are as \n     dedicated, skillful, energetic and enthusiastic as any group \n     I have had the privilege to work with.\n       Chairman Goodlatte, Ranking Member Conyers and Members of \n     the Committee, this concludes my statement.\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, our national parks play host to abundant \nanimal life, untouched wilderness, and some of the most breathtaking \nvistas I have ever seen. Anyone who has beheld the pristine perfection \nof a mountain lake or the verdant green of our valleys in springtime \ncan bear witness to the magnificent grandeur of America's natural \nlandscapes. Today I wish to recognize the National Park Service for its \nindispensable role in preserving both the richness and beauty of these \nlands. This year marks the 100th anniversary of the National Park \nService. On the agency's centennial, I would like to thank the \nthousands of men and women who, over many decades, have served \nselflessly to safeguard the majesty of our national parks.\n  In commemoration of the Service's 100th anniversary, I will be \nvisiting the Mighty Five National Parks in my home State of Utah next \nweek. The Mighty Five play a critical role in Utah's economy, driving \nthe tourism industry by attracting millions of visitors to our State \neach year. Today, I would like to pay tribute to the Mighty Five \nNational Parks by recognizing the beauty and unique history of each.\n  Canyonlands National Park--imagine wave after wave of deep canyons, \ntowering mesas, pinnacles, cliffs, and spires stretching across 527 \nsquare miles. This is Canyonlands National Park, formed by the currents \nand tributaries of Utah's Green and Colorado rivers. Canyonlands is \nhome to many different types of travel experiences, from sublime \nsolitude in the more remote stretches of the park to moderate hikes \nthrough the Needles district.\n  Located just west of Moab and a short distance from Arches National \nPark, Canyonlands is wild, wonderful, and diverse in its landscapes. \nDue to the park's massive size, Canyonlands has four separate \ndistricts, including three land districts and the rivers themselves, \neach with their own characteristic landscapes and experiences.\n  The area's earliest known inhabitants were Puebloans. After the \nPuebloans, other groups from the Ute, Navajo, and Paiutes appeared in \nthe area. Ranchers and miners started settling the area in the 1880s, \nand places throughout the park still bear the names of some of these \nearly settlers.\n  In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Bates Wilson, the superintendent \nof Arches National Park, lobbied for a national park to be created in \nthe Canyonlands area. In 1962, Utah Senator Frank Moss introduced the \nCanyonlands Park bill, and 2 years later, President Lyndon B. Johnson \nsigned legislation designating Canyonlands a National Park.\n  Arches National Park--located northwest of Moab, Arches is a 73,234-\nacre wonderland of eroded sandstone fins, towers, ribs, gargoyles, \nhoodoos, balanced rocks, and, of course, arches. The park protects an \namazing landscape that includes the largest proliferation of arches in \nthe world. Over 2,000 arches have been catalogued in Arches National \nPark. Landscape Arch, measuring 306 fragile feet, is the second-longest \nspan in the world.\n  The sandstone formations in Arches National Park define not only the \nlandscape but also its plants and animals. The scarce precipitation--\n8.5 inches annually--extreme temperature ranges, and relatively high \nelevation all conspire to limit life among the rocks to only species \nthat can adapt to such a harsh environment. Elevations at Arches range \nfrom 3,960 feet along the Colorado River to the 5,653-foot Elephant \nButte, the park's high point. A pygmy forest of pinon pine and juniper \ncovers about half the park; scrubby steppe and bare slickrock blanket \nthe rest.\n  The Arches area was first brought to the National Park Service's \nattention by an employee of a railroad company named Frank Wadleigh. \nWadleigh visited Arches at the request of a prospector, who claimed the \narea had high tourist potential because of its scenic views. With the \nsupport of the National\n\n[[Page S3273]]\n\nPark Service, the area was designated a national monument in April \n1929. The park grew in popularity, and on November 12, 1971, President \nRichard Nixon signed legislation designating it a national park.\n  Bryce Canyon National Park--the alpine environment of Bryce National \nPark is home to dozens of species of mammals and birds. Water and wind \nover millions of years of freezes and thaws have carved into the \nplateau endless fields of the park's distinctive red rock pillars, \ncalled hoodoos. By its very nature, Bryce Canyon National Park invites \ndiscovery.\n  Every year, Bryce Canyon awes visitors with spectacular geological \nformations and brilliant colors. The towering hoodoos, narrow fins, and \nnatural bridges seem to deny all reason or explanation, leaving hikers \ngazing around with jaws agape in wondrous incredulity. This surreal \nlandscape is what brings people from around the world to visit the \npark.\n  The Park's hoodoos and fins are formed when rainwater seeps into \ncracks in the rock. The water freezes during Bryce's cold nights, \nexpanding just enough to break apart the rock. The deep, narrow walls \ncalled ``fins'' result from rain and snowmelt running down the slopes \nfrom Bryce's rim. Eventually the fins form holes, called windows. When \nthe windows grow larger, they collapse and create the bizarre hoodoos \nwe see today.\n  The scenic areas of Bryce Canyon were first described to the Nation \nin 1916 in magazine articles published by Union Pacific and Santa Fe \nrailroad companies. As visitations to the area increased, those \nconcerned about the damage being done to the delicate features lobbied \nfor its protection. On June 8, 1923, Bryce Canyon was declared a \nnational monument, and on February 25, 1928, it was established as a \nnational park.\n  Zion National Park--carved by water and time, Zion National Park is a \ncanyon that invites you to participate in the very forces that created \nit. The park's canyons and mesas boast an especially exquisite beauty, \neven in a State known for dramatic landscapes. Breathtaking Zion Canyon \nis the centerpiece of this 147,000-acre parkland that protects a \nspectacular landscape of high plateaus, sheer canyons, and monolithic \ncliffs.\n  Opportunities to see and explore Zion National Park abound for people \nof all ages and abilities, from the scenic byways that slice through \nthe park to the trails that wind through the backcountry. Wildlife \nwatchers can stop at numerous lookouts and search the sky for Zion's \nmore than 200 bird species.\n  The paintings of Zion Canyon done by Frederick Dellenbaugh in the \nearly 1900s, along with previous photographs of the area, led President \nWilliam Howard Taft to proclaim Zion Canyon a national monument on July \n31, 1909. In November 1919, Congress established Zion Canyon as a \nnational park, making it the oldest national park in Utah.\n  Capitol Reef National Park--even considering Utah's many impressive \nnational parks and monuments, it is difficult to rival Capitol Reef \nNational Park's sense of expansiveness; of broad, sweeping vistas; of a \ntortured, twisted, seemingly endless landscape; of limitless sky and \ndesert rock.\n  While Bryce and Zion are like encapsulated little fantasy lands of \ncolored stone and soaring cliffs, the less-visited Capitol Reef is \nalmost like a planet unto itself. In Capitol Reef, you get a real feel \nfor what the earth might have been like millions of years before life \nappeared, when nothing existed but earth and sky.\n  Capitol Reef National Park is an evocative world of spectacular \ncolored cliffs, hidden arches, massive domes, and deep canyons. It is a \nplace that includes the finest elements of Bryce and Zion Canyons in a \nless-crowded park.\n  Ephraim Portman Pectol, a member of the Utah State Legislature, and \nhis brother-in-law, Joseph Hickman, started a promotional campaign for \nthe Capitol Reef area in the early 1930s. In 1937, President Franklin \nD. Roosevelt named the area a national monument. Roads built to the \narea promoted access. In December 1971, President Richard Nixon signed \nan act establishing Capitol Reef as a national park.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/senate-section/article/S3272-1"}, {"day": "26", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO PATRICK P. O'CARROLL, JR.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to offer thanks and appreciation to \na dedicated public servant, Mr. Patrick P. O'Carroll, Jr., who has \nworked to protect taxpayers and beneficiaries at the Social Security \nAdministration and will soon pursue other activities.\n  Pat O'Carroll has served the American people as the third inspector \ngeneral for the Social Security Administration since November 24, 2004. \nManaging over 600 auditors, attorneys, evaluators, and investigators \nnationwide, Mr. O'Carroll has overseen efforts to identify and prevent \nfraud, waste, and abuse of SSA funds and programs. In the past year \nalone, SSA's OIG has reported over $700 million in investigative \naccomplishments through SSA recoveries, restitution, fines, \nsettlements, judgments, and projected savings. Pat's efforts have led \nto around $50 of taxpayer savings for every $1 spent on his office.\n  Prior to his tenure as inspector general, Mr. O'Carroll held several \nsenior positions in the inspector general's office, including assistant \ninspector general for investigations and assistant inspector general \nfor external affairs. Twenty-six years of prior employment by the U.S. \nSecret Service helped prepare Mr. O'Carroll for the rigors of \ninvestigative work at SSA. To show Pat's dedication to the field, I \nwould point out that he attended the National Cryptologic School at the \nKennedy School of Government after completing a master of forensic \nsciences at the George Washington University. Most assuredly, you don't \nwant to try to slip anything by Pat.\n  Pat in many ways personifies the SSA inspector general role. He has \nserved in this position--with distinction--longer than anybody else. \nPat has been very responsive with Congress; he has excelled at \nproviding the information we need to protect SSA programs from fraud, \nwaste, and abuse. It would be hard to find anyone who has worked harder \nto protect the integrity of Social Security's programs than Pat.\n  I appreciate Pat's important work with this legislative body. We wish \nhim all the very best as he moves on to pursue what lies ahead for him \nand genuinely appreciate the work he has done with Congress, for the \nSocial Security Administration, and, of most importance, for the \nAmerican taxpayer. I wish Pat all the very best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/senate-section/article/S3273-1"}, {"day": "26", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3273-S3274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO JANE WINKLER DYCHE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a \ndistinguished Kentuckian who is a leader in her community as well as a \ngood friend. Jane Winkler Dyche is an accomplished attorney in her \nhometown of London, KY, as well as the master commissioner for the \nLaurel County Circuit Court and an active volunteer for many local \ncauses.\n  Dyche, the daughter of educators, originally trained as a teacher, \nearning a degree in home economics education from the University of \nKentucky. She worked for 13 years in food and nutrition across Kentucky \nbefore earning her law degree at UK. She is now in her 21st year of \npracticing law.\n  Dyche is well known in the region for her service on the board of the \nKentucky Bar Association, including a stint as president. She served on \nthe board of the Kentucky Lawyers Mutual Insurance Company and is a \ndedicated volunteer for Kentucky Educational Television. Dyche also \nworks on behalf of the Laurel County Public Library and the God's \nPantry Food Bank.\n  Jane and her husband, Robert, have two children, Robert and John. \nThey currently practice law together in the house that her husband grew \nup in, accompanied by their office dog, Stella.\n  I want to commend my good friend Jane Winkler Dyche for her \ncommitment to her community and to Kentucky. For many years, she has \nbeen a devoted supporter of worthy causes and a fixture in the \nCommonwealth's legal circles. Still an educator at heart, she continues \nto share her wisdom with others every day.\n  An area publication, the Times-Tribune, recently published a profile \nof Jane Winkler Dyche. I ask unanimous consent that the article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S3274]]\n\n  \n\n\n                 [From the Times-Tribune, May 15, 2016]\n\n Tri-County Profiles: London Attorney Considers Herself an Educator in \n                               all Things\n\n                       (By Christina M. Bentley)\n\n       ``As a lawyer, I still teach people,'' said Jane Winkler \n     Dyche, Laurel County attorney and master commissioner, a \n     position in which she assists the Laurel Circuit Court in the \n     enforcement of judgments.\n       ``I'm just teaching the jury, or I'm educating the judge in \n     my version of the case,'' she said.\n       Dyche was raised by educators. Her father, Thomas Winkler, \n     was a teacher and school administrator in the Bell County \n     School System and her mother, Mildred, was a career nurse \n     who, at the request of the Pineville Community Hospital, \n     started the Pineville School for Practical Nursing, which was \n     later absorbed into the Kentucky Community College System. \n     Both the Winklers were WWII veterans--Mildred served as a \n     nurse in the Women's Army Corps--and met when Thomas Winkler \n     was being repatriated from his service in the Army Air Corps.\n       ``They were incredible people,'' Dyche said. ``I was very \n     blessed to have parents who saw the importance of education . \n     . . I think being the child of a forward-thinking woman, \n     someone who actually started this hospital nursing program . \n     . . very little I do could begin to be close to touching or \n     hitting milestones like she did. I mean she was really very \n     forward-thinking, and there was really the expectation of \n     `you need to do the best you can do.' They encouraged free \n     thought and travel. They dragged us about a lot. That's \n     something I think--that wanderlust, the opportunity to see \n     things, new things, it's a huge world. I think sometimes I \n     see that folks' vision is not as wide as it needs to be. It's \n     a big world. It's a BIG world, and if we're too quick to \n     close our eyes or our ears, we're going to miss out on so \n     much.''\n       Dyche herself has been very open to new opportunities in \n     her life. Like her father, she trained as a teacher, getting \n     a degree in home economics education from the University of \n     Kentucky and going on to work for 13 years with the \n     Cooperative Extension Service as an area extension agent for \n     foods and nutrition, a job in which her primary role was to \n     train others.\n       ``I was an area extension agent, which is really different \n     (from being a county extension agent),'' Dyche said. ``I \n     eventually actually worked from Harlan to Harrison \n     (counties). I had no supervisory capacity, but I trained. I \n     taught people how to teach. I taught the paraprofessionals \n     how to teach the material to the low-income families, and to \n     do that I made home visits with every single one of the \n     assistants I taught twice a year, so I went in the homes with \n     them . . . I think that's where we're losing things now. I \n     think that there aren't enough people willing to say, `Okay, \n     if you want to change, how do we help you do that? Tell us \n     what we need.' How do we make that happen? You can't do it by \n     just giving people stuff. We've got to help people do with \n     what they have.''\n       She met her husband, London native and fellow attorney \n     Robert Dyche, during her work with the Extension Service, and \n     said that that's how she made her way to London. The couple \n     have two children, Robert, who has an undergraduate degree \n     from Centre College and an MBA from the University of \n     Cincinnati and now works in Atlanta, and John, who is a 2016 \n     graduate of Georgetown College. The elder Robert Dyche is a \n     former district court judge and also served on the Court of \n     Appeals. She said the law was something she, too, had always \n     been interested in, so she took advantage of the opportunity \n     granted her by the Extension Service to take study leave in \n     1992.\n       ``I grew up in a little town where there were some good \n     lawyers that I admired. It was something I wanted to do. Once \n     Robbie got an 8-year term on the Supreme Court, our family \n     had at least one steady job, and that gave me the freedom to \n     try something new, and he was supportive in that. So I went \n     back to UK and came home on weekends. It was an adventure,'' \n     Dyche said.\n       She is now in her 21st year of practicing law.\n       ``I love to practice law,'' she said, ``It's very \n     interesting. I think sometimes it's sort of like a muscle, \n     you know--the more you use it the stronger it gets. And I \n     think to some degree our energy is the same way. If you don't \n     exercise, you don't feel like exercising. That's how I start \n     my day: do my Bible reading and do my exercises. It's pretty \n     simple.''\n       Dyche's legal career has been very varied and has offered \n     her opportunities to serve her profession outside the \n     courtroom as well.\n       ``I've had a chance to do a lot of different things. I \n     practiced with a firm'' when I first got out of law school \n     ``and I office-shared with a lot of more experienced lawyers \n     because I didn't feel like, especially with a family, that I \n     needed to be by myself, so there were other lawyers who were \n     very instrumental in providing nurture to me during that \n     time'' and I had an opportunity to begin serving on the \n     Kentucky Bar Association board of governors,'' she said.\n       Dyche was asked to take on the unexpired term of a \n     departing board member and went on to serve as the president \n     of the Kentucky Bar Association, shortly after her husband \n     retired from the Court of Appeals and the two went into \n     practice together, occupying as office space the house that \n     Robert Dyche grew up in, which he and his siblings didn't \n     want to part with after his parents' death.\n       ``Robbie came here to practice law as I was beginning my \n     president-elect and president duties with the KBA and he \n     really made it possible for me to take the time that those \n     volunteer positions take because you travel statewide,'' \n     Dyche said. ``And I had the opportunity to meet a lot of \n     people and to preach the gospel of ethical lawyering. Also \n     during that time, I served on the board of directors of the \n     Kentucky Lawyers Mutual Insurance Company, a mutual insurance \n     company formed by Kentucky lawyers to serve Kentucky lawyers \n     for our professional responsibility, or professional \n     malpractice, insurance, and that was very interesting. The \n     things you learn!''\n       In addition to her service to the profession, Dyche has \n     also spent most of her life as a dedicated volunteer to a \n     number of causes, beginning with Kentucky Educational \n     Television.\n       ``(KET) was really my first big volunteer activity as a \n     young bride coming to London, Kentucky,'' she said. ``Leonard \n     Press, who actually started KET, knew my father through \n     Daddy's work with the school system. He could see how public \n     television, especially educational television, could reach \n     into the hills and hollows of southeastern Kentucky because \n     it was such a challenge to bring educational material to \n     people who really needed it, and it was during the time in \n     the '60s of (the Work Experience and Training Program). KET \n     could bring educational programs in where others could not, \n     and my fascination with that program and with the television \n     programs that were offered ``caught my eye as a young adult \n     when they were looking for volunteers here in southeastern \n     Kentucky. I had an opportunity to work for many years as a \n     very active volunteer with them'' I did a lot of Friends of \n     KET activities and was president of that board and then \n     served on their foundation board for a number of years as \n     well, so I guess that kind of got me hooked on how exciting \n     volunteering can be.''\n       Dyche also continues to support the Extension Service and \n     Laurel County Public Library. She served on the Site-Based \n     Councils of both North Laurel High School and London \n     Elementary School when her children were students there.\n       ``There's just all this stuff you get a chance to do if you \n     keep your eyes open to opportunities to serve, and I think \n     that's incredibly important that we keep our eyes open for \n     those opportunities ``If people want to serve, if they want \n     to volunteer, they will find something. There's something out \n     there for you to do,'' she said.\n       Most recently, Dyche's spirit of community service has \n     found its outlet in God's Pantry Food Bank.\n       ``(God's Pantry) picks back up on my interest in people who \n     are at risk nutritionally,'' Dyche said. ``There are hungry \n     people here, especially during the downturn in the economy. A \n     number of years ago, I was contacted by representatives of \n     God's Pantry Food Bank in Lexington, and just the other day, \n     we had a `Business After Hours' at our warehouse here in \n     London that opened in December of 2013. Since July 1 of 2015, \n     over 3 million pounds of food has been distributed from \n     there. Last month, this warehouse distributed more than the \n     Lexington one did. I'm all for God's Pantry. This is an \n     agency that is five-star on Charity Navigator for the fifth \n     or sixth year in a row. I think that's really important that \n     people check to see what they're working on. You give them a \n     dollar, they'll turn it into $10 worth of food ``We're really \n     excited that we continue to grow our agencies in this area.''\n       Dyche sees the common thread between all of her activities, \n     however, to be teaching people, and she said that is both the \n     hardest and the most satisfying part of her work, whether \n     it's in the classroom or the field, the courtroom or the \n     boardroom.\n       ``Teaching people things that they're unfamiliar with and \n     explaining that something may not work out well. That's \n     tough. That's really difficult,'' she said. ``But I like the \n     teaching bit, whether it's teaching about volunteer causes \n     that benefit lots of people or explaining to a client a \n     concept that is new to them. I like smart clients. I like to \n     work with people who are interested in learning how this \n     happened, why this happened, and how we go forward. We've \n     been incredibly blessed to get to work with a lot of \n     interesting folks over time. So I'm still a teacher.''\n       For all her work and community service, however, Dyche \n     still finds time to garden and cook, and she's a voracious \n     reader. She also teaches mahjong to a group every week at the \n     Laurel County Public Library.\n       Hers is a busy life, but she said she feels a \n     responsibility to keep it that way.\n       ``I think if God has blessed us--and I think God has \n     blessed almost everyone--I think we in turn have the \n     opportunity to give back,'' Dyche said. ``God gives us all \n     the same number of hours in a day. It's how we choose to use \n     them.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/senate-section/article/S3273-2"}, {"day": "26", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3274-S3275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING CLARISSA ``T.C.'' FREEMAN\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a \ndistinguished Kentuckian who was a passionate advocate for and \nsupporter of our Nation's military, especially the troops stationed at \nKentucky's Fort Campbell and in the neighboring community of \nHopkinsville, KY. Clarissa ``T.C.'' Freeman, a woman so devoted to our \nmen\n\n[[Page S3275]]\n\nand women in uniform that one chapter of the Association of the United \nStates Army, AUSA, named an award after her, sadly passed away on May \n19. She was 83 years old.\n  Freeman understood the importance of the men and women stationed at \nFort Campbell and worked diligently to ensure that these servicemembers \nand her community got the recognition they deserved. Freeman was one of \nKentucky's civilian aides to the Secretary of the Army since 2008, \nholding a ceremonial rank equal to a lieutenant general. However, her \ncontributions to our servicemembers began long before that.\n  She first became involved as an AUSA volunteer as a young Army wife \nin Fort Hood, TX, welcoming her husband back home from his first tour \nof duty in Vietnam. Freeman felt her husband and others returning from \nVietnam did not get the recognition and appreciation they deserved. \nT.C. was right about this, as she was about so many other important \nissues concerning our Nation's servicemembers.\n  She decided to do something about it personally. She took care of \nwounded soldiers. She coordinated welcome-home events. She advocated on \nbehalf of Army families on housing and quality-of-life issues that \naffected them. The Freemans moved to Hopkinsville and took up the cause \nof soldiers at Fort Campbell after T.C.'s husband, Army COL Bobby \nFreeman, was named garrison commander at Fort Campbell.\n  T.C. Freeman's support for the 101st Airborne Division, headquartered \nat Fort Campbell, was crucial throughout the years, especially in 1985 \nwhen 248 soldiers died in an air crash in Newfoundland while returning \nfrom a peacekeeping mission.\n  In 2009, Freeman was among the first nine honored as a ``champion'' \nof Fort Campbell and saw her portrait installed in the division's \nheadquarters building. She served as chapter president and board member \nof the Tennessee-Kentucky chapter of AUSA. She was also an honorary \nmember of the 327th Infantry Regiment and the 160th Special Operations \nAviation regiments and a distinguished member of the 502nd and 187th \nInfantry regiments.\n  T.C. and her husband, Bobby, raised two sons who served in the \nPersian Gulf and a daughter who was an Army wife. Elaine and I want to \nsend our condolences to the Freeman family and to the many who knew and \nloved T.C. I am grateful for the long friendship I had with her, and I \nknow she will be deeply missed--especially by the brave servicemembers \nshe worked so hard to support and their families.\n  An area publication, the Kentucky New Era, recently published an \narticle detailing T.C. Freeman's legacy. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Kentucky New Era, May 20, 2016]\n\n          T.C. Freeman, Tireless Fort Campbell Advocate, Dies\n\n                          (By Andrew Oppmann)\n\n       Clarissa ``T.C.'' Freeman, known and honored by generals \n     and privates alike as Fort Campbell's Mom for her devoted \n     service and advocacy of the U.S. Army, died at 7 a.m. \n     Thursday at Jennie Stuart Medical Center after a long \n     illness. She was 83.\n       One of Kentucky's civilian aides to the secretary of the \n     Army since 2008, Freeman battled pulmonary fibrosis for more \n     than five years. However, despite the debilitating effects of \n     the disease, her service to Fort Campbell rarely slowed.\n       Her husband, retired Army Col. Bobby Freeman, was a former \n     garrison commander at Fort Campbell.\n       Funeral services will be at 3 p.m. Sunday at First United \n     Methodist Church, Hopkinsville, and burial will be at 1 p.m. \n     Monday at Kentucky Veterans Cemetery-West. Visitation will be \n     from 4 until 8 p.m. Saturday at Hughart, Beard and Giles \n     Funeral Home, Hopkinsville, and from 2 p.m. until the funeral \n     hour at the church.\n       As a civilian aide to the Army secretary, Freeman held the \n     ceremonial rank equal to a lieutenant general. She used her \n     status as a platform to call attention to the service and \n     sacrifice of the soldiers of the 101st Airborne Division (Air \n     Assault).\n       Hopkinsville Mayor Carter Hendricks knew Freeman as a \n     ``tireless, tenacious and caring advocate'' for Fort \n     Campbell.\n       At welcome-home ceremonies, Freeman often was seen handing \n     off her cell phone to a young soldier who didn't have family \n     present but wanted to call home.\n       Freeman was on a Chamber of Commerce committee that hired \n     Hendricks to be the military affairs director in 2004. She \n     became a dear friend and supporter, he said.\n       No task was too small for Freeman, and she always followed \n     through on her promises, the mayor said.\n       U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said, ``T.C. understood \n     the importance of the men and women stationed at the Kentucky \n     (post) and worked diligently to ensure that these service \n     members and her community got the recognition they \n     deserved.''\n       At a 2013 ceremony honoring Freeman, retired Gen. Richard \n     A. Cody, former post and division commander, said, ``T.C. was \n     an Army wife and Army mom and a model for everyone here. She \n     made a difference in the life of me and my family.''\n       In 2009, Freeman and her husband were among the first nine \n     honored as Champions of Fort Campbell, and their portraits \n     were installed on a wall inside the division's headquarters \n     building.\n       She was a life member of the Association of the United \n     States Army, serving as a regional president, as well as \n     chapter president and board member of the Tennessee-Kentucky \n     chapter. The chapter in 2013 named a brigade-level award for \n     membership participation in her honor.\n       Freeman worked as an aide to former U.S. Sen. Jim Bunning \n     and current U.S. Rep. Ed Whitfield and was a member of the \n     Kentucky Military Affairs Commission.\n       She was an honorary member of the 327th Infantry Regiment \n     and the 160th Special Operations Aviation regiments a \n     distinguished member of the 502nd and 187th Infantry \n     regiments.\n       As the wife of a decorated Vietnam aviator, and mother to \n     two sons who served in the Persian Gulf and a daughter who \n     was an Army wife, Freeman told an Army interviewer in 2009 \n     that she knew what other spouses were going through when \n     their husbands and wives were deployed.\n       ``The first Army family I took care of was mine,'' she \n     said.\n       Freeman first became involved as an AUSA volunteer at Fort \n     Hood, Texas, as a young Army wife.\n       She told an Army journalist that when her husband returned \n     from his first tour of duty in Vietnam, she was disappointed \n     and saddened by the reception he received. She vowed to do \n     something about it.\n       ``They didn't understand how important our Army was,'' she \n     said in a 2009 article. ``I always feel the need to give \n     something back to our soldiers and to their families.''\n       And give back she did. She was involved in taking care of \n     wounded soldiers. She planned welcome-home events. She \n     tackled granular issues that troubled Army families, such as \n     ID card and housing problems.\n       She hosted luncheons, consoled families in their grief and, \n     as a champion of Fort Campbell, was a fierce advocate for \n     funding of the post that straddles the Kentucky and Tennessee \n     borders.\n       Cody, quoted by The Eagle Post in a 2013 article on the \n     AUSA award named in her honor, said Freeman was diligent to \n     greet soldiers as they returned or departed for duty \n     overseas.\n       She would look around for a soldier who had no one waiting \n     for him or her and would give him or her a hug and a thank \n     you.\n       ``When they (the soldier's family) can't, I stand in for \n     them,'' she said.\n       Maj. Gen. Jim Myles, at a 2009 ceremony covered by Army \n     journalists, called Freeman ``a national treasure and a \n     hero.''\n       When she was a VIP or special guest at an event, Myles said \n     she would always divert the spotlight to the soldiers.\n       ``I've watched CASAs like T.C. make a difference in \n     soldiers' lives in ways green-suiters couldn't do,'' he said.\n       Cody, in the 2013 article, recalled how Freeman ``wrapped \n     her arms around this great division'' after 248 soldiers from \n     the 101st died in air crash at Gander, Newfoundland, while \n     returning from a peacekeeping mission shortly before \n     Christmas in 1985.\n       The Freemans moved to Hopkinsville when Col. Freeman was \n     named garrison commander at Fort Campbell. They remained \n     there after he retired from the Army.\n       Freeman's passion for the soldiers of Fort Campbell never \n     ceased, even as her illness limited her mobility in recent \n     months. She was active on social media and often sent out \n     messages of support to the division while on bed rest.\n       ``There is a lot that can be done to help our soldiers,'' \n     she told the Army journalist in 2009. ``There are no \n     boundaries to what goodness one can contribute for the \n     benefit of the soldiers.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/senate-section/article/S3274-1"}, {"day": "26", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3275-S3276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR.

After taking \npediatrics specialty classes in Iran, he came to America;\n\n[[Page S3276]]\n\nfirst to Baltimore, MD, and then, in 1965, to Kentucky. He has been a \nproud resident of the Bluegrass State ever since.\n  In his time at Appalachian Regional Healthcare, Dr. Khorram served as \nchief of the pediatric department, chief of medical staff, and \npresident of the board of directors at the Daniel Boone Clinic. In his \ntime as a physician, he has seen many advances in medical technology \nand implemented them in his practice.\n  I want to congratulate Dr. Khorram for his five decades of service at \nthe top of the medical field and wish him well upon the occasion of his \nretirement. I know he will have as much success in whatever endeavor he \nchooses next as he has had in his chosen field. I am sure his wife, \nToby, and their two children are very proud of him, and Kentucky is \nglad to have benefitted from his work and service.\n  An area publication, the Middlesboro Daily News, recently published \nan article highlighting Dr. Khorram's life and career.

Dr. Houshang Khorram has seen it all in his 50 years as \n     a pediatrician.\n       Khorram's story starts during his time as a student at \n     Shiraz Medical Science University in Iran.\n       ``I loved kids. I've always loved kids and that's how I \n     knew what I wanted to do,'' said Khorram.\n       He completed his pediatrics specialty classes in Iran and \n     came to America to work at Johns Hopkins Hospital in \n     Baltimore, Maryland for a couple of years.\n       In 1965, Khorram started working for the ARH in Floyd \n     County, Kentucky and moved to the Middlesboro ARH five years \n     later. He has lived and worked in Middlesboro ever since.\n       ``Actually, I came here to live for just six months, but \n     I'm still here. I love the people and I love the area and I \n     love nature so there are a lot of things that have kept me \n     here,'' said Khorram.\n       He has seen many advances in the medical field, including \n     technology and equipment which he believes have not only \n     benefited pediatrics, but the way in which doctors are able \n     to care for patients.\n       ``So much that we have now, we didn't have it 10 or even 20 \n     years ago. CT scans, MRI's, sonograms have helped a lot and \n     now it's easier to make a diagnosis and it's more reliable,'' \n     said Khorram.\n       Khorram retired from ARH on January 1 and received a \n     special award for his time. Throughout his decades at ARH, \n     Khorram served as the chief of the Pediatric Department, \n     chief of Medical Staff and the president of the board of \n     directors at the Daniel Boone Clinic.\n       If given the opportunity to start all over again, he \n     undoubtedly would.\n       ``I encourage my kids to go into the medical field. It's a \n     great place to be and I would go back, go again to medical \n     school if I could,'' laughed Khorram.\n       He enjoys hiking and reading pediatrics books in his free \n     time. Since retirement, he is looking forward to having time \n     to spend with his grandchildren.\n       Khorram has been married to his wife Toby for 54 years. He \n     acknowledges her sacrifices and support that have allowed him \n     to be a doctor. Together they have two children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/senate-section/article/S3275-1"}, {"day": "26", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3276-S3277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING SUMNER SLICHTER\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I was saddened to learn that Sumner \nSlichter, who for three decades was the chief policy adviser to former \nWisconsin and U.S. Senator Russ Feingold, died May 16 in his home in \nAlexandria, VA, after a battle with brain cancer. He was 62 years old.\n  Sumner Pence Slichter was born August 31, 1953, in Urbana, IL, to \nNini Almy and Charles Slichter. He was the oldest of four children and \nis remembered as being a kind and loving older brother to his younger \nsiblings.\n  As a student attending Dr. Howard Elementary, Edison Junior High \nSchool, and Champaign Central High School, Sumner played viola in the \nschool orchestra. He left for the University of Wisconsin-Madison in \n1970, where he majored in mathematics. Sumner continued to play viola \nin student ensembles and the UW orchestra, where he sat first chair.\n  At the age of 19, Sumner began what would ultimately be a long and \nrich career in politics. His first job was on Ed Muskie's 1972 \nPresidential campaign. Later that year, he worked as an assistant at \nthe Democratic National Committee convention in Miami Beach. From \nthere, Sumner worked for campaigns and offices of State representatives \nin Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.\n  In 1981, an encounter would forever change Sumner's life. That year \nhe met a Milwaukee lawyer named Russ Feingold. At that time, Russ \nFeingold was working as a Democratic Party counsel on a close recall \nelection. Sumner helped convince his new friend to challenge an \nincumbent for the 27th district State Senate seat. Feingold won the \nelection in 1982, and Sumner followed him to the State capital. Sumner \nand Russ would spend the next three decades working side-by-side in \nMadison and Washington, DC.\n  Working in the Wisconsin State Senate, Sumner helped design \nFeingold's trademark progressive initiatives that focused on the aging, \nconsumer-focused banking policies, budget discipline, and tax policy.\n  It was during his time in the State capitol that Sumner met Pam \nRussell, who was working as a legislative attorney. They were married \nin 1990.\n  While they lived in Madison, Sumner had a thriving social life. He \nwas a member of a city intramural league softball team, the Soft Balls, \nand he and his friends and teammates often took advantage of \nWisconsin's beautiful State parks, going on annual camping trips to \nGovernor Dodge and Rock Island, among others. Sumner enjoyed hosting \nfriends at the summer cottage on Lake Mendota built by his grandfather, \nand in fact, it was there that Sumner held Russ Feingold's first \nfundraiser for the 1982 State senate campaign.\n  In 1992, after 10 years in the Wisconsin Legislature, Russ ran for \nthe U.S. Senate. Sumner was there with his boss, playing an important \nstrategic role on the campaign. Many Wisconsinites still remember the \nfunny, light-hearted campaign ads that Feingold ran in that campaign. \nSumner was one of the campaign staffers who crafted those unforgettable \nads.\n  When Russ was elected to the U.S. Senate, Sumner and Pam relocated to \nnorthern Virginia where, on the day after they arrived, their daughter \nSarah was born.\n  Sumner worked for Russ in the U.S. Capitol for 18 years. He was \nRuss's policy director and helped shaped Senator Feingold's progressive \nlegacy. Think about some of the courageous acts that defined Senator \nFeingold's work in the Senate: the McCain-Feingold Bipartisan Campaign \nReform Act, his votes against the Defense of Marriage Act, the Iraq \nwar, and the sole nay vote against U.S.A. Patriot Act. For each of \nthose votes and bills, Sumner was right there alongside Russ, \ncounseling and helping in any way he could. He also helped Feingold \nauthor a resolution to censure President George W. Bush. It is no \nwonder that Russ said of his friend, ``Sumner was at my side for every \nvote I took in 28 years as a legislator, and I didn't vote until I \nsought his wise counsel.''\n  It is one thing to do good work for your boss, but it is another \nthing to treat your peers and colleagues with dignity, respect, and \naffection. Sumner was a great mentor and friend to his fellow staffers. \nFormer Feingold chief of staff Mary Irvine remembers, ``It was quite a \nthing really how many issues Sumner worked on . . . A great solo player \nand an awesome team player. He must have spent hours and hours on the \nSenate floor on any number of issues but was always on duty for the \nentire lengthy budget resolution votes. Sumner was an amazing expert on \nthe Senate budget process and on parliamentary procedure. He was a \ngreat political mind--there was no issue that Sumner couldn't figure \nout and explain to the rest of us.''\n  Outside of the Capitol, Sumner loved to cook for his friends and \nfamily. He was a movie buff who had a penchant for remembering lines, \nmusic, actors, and directors. He never lost his love of music and was \nalways quick to respond to a danceable song.\n  From his Madison days, Sumner brought annual Nixon Resignation and \nDerby Day parties and camping traditions to his family and friends in \nthe D.C. Area. He had a deep love of dogs and was very attached to his \npets.\n  Sumner Slichter's passing is a loss for all of us here in the Senate. \nWe grew accustomed to seeing his smiling face right at this boss's \nside.\n\n[[Page S3277]]\n\n  I, along with the entire U.S. Senate, send our condolences to his \nfamily. Sumner is survived by his wife, Pam Russell, of Alexandria, VA; \ndaughter Sarah of Poughkeepsie, NY; mother Nini Almy of Mitchellville, \nMD; father Charles Slichter and stepmother Anne Slichter of Champaign, \nIL; brother Bill of Minneapolis and his wife Helen; brother Jacob of \nBrooklyn, NY, and his wife Suzanne; sister Ann of Los Angeles; half-\nbrother Daniel of Boulder, CO, and his wife Yolanda; and half-brother \nDavid of Binghamton, NY.\n  I say to his family: Thank you for sharing Sumner with us over the \nyears. Thank you for allowing his bright and radiant personality to \nshine on us. He will be greatly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/senate-section/article/S3276-1"}, {"day": "26", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3277-S3278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ZIKA SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last week, the Senate approved a \ncompromise deal negotiated by Senators Blunt, Murray, and others to \nprovide $1.1 billion in emergency supplemental Zika funding.\n  The White House, Dr. Frieden of the Centers for Disease Control, CDC, \nand Dr. Collins of the National Institute of Health, NIH, told us they \nneeded $1.9 billion to fight this public health crisis, but the \nRepublican caucus disagreed with these infectious disease experts.\n  I am not sure why Republicans do not believe the world's best \nscientists and health officials when they articulate a clear, \ncomprehensive plan to stop Zika. Perhaps they do not appreciate the \nseverity of this public health threat?\n  When we were faced with cases of Ebola within the United States, we \nreacted swiftly and decisively. We funded 87 percent, $5.4 billion, of \nthe administration's request in a total of just 38 days.\n  Well, now the same number of people in the U.S. and U.S. territories \nhave died from Ebola, as have from Zika--one.\n  Yet more than 91 days past the date of the formal Zika request, we \nare debating between just 33 percent, as the House approved, and 58 \npercent of this request? I fear my Republican colleagues are \nunderestimating the threat from the Zika virus on our Nation's pregnant \nwomen.\n  We know that Zika causes microcephaly, a devastating and tragic birth \ndefect that causes babies to be born with serious neurological \ncomplications.\n  And it seems that every day we are learning something worse. Just \nyesterday, a CDC and Harvard University study found that pregnant women \nwho are infected with Zika in their first trimester face up to a 13 \npercent chance of their baby being born with microcephaly.\n  We also know that the CDC is currently monitoring nearly 300 pregnant \nwomen in the United States who have the Zika virus.\n  The CDC estimates that the lifetime costs for a baby born with this \ntragic disease is between $1 million to $10 million, not to mention the \nconsiderable emotional toll of this disease on families.\n  Sadly, it doesn't take many cases of microcephaly to begin costing us \nmore financially than the paltry amount House Republicans are \ncommitting to fight Zika.\n  But Zika doesn't just cause microcephaly. It is also linked to other \nneurological diseases that aggressively destroy brain tissue. It is \nalso linked to Guillain-Bare syndrome, an autoimmune disorder than can \ncause paralysis and death.\n  What about the impact of maternal stress on a baby? I cannot imagine \nthe anxiety that pregnant women, especially those in the southern part \nof this country and in Puerto Rico, must feel right now. Well, through \ngenetics and neuroscience, we know for a fact that a mother's stress \nduring pregnancy can shape her child's gene expression, leading to poor \nbirth outcomes and psychological and physical disorders.\n  If you call yourself pro-life, why would you not want to do \neverything you can to protect these babies from being subjected to \nelevated risk for serious birth defects?\n  This is a train we have seen coming for miles and miles, and \nRepublicans are refusing to step out of the way.\n  It is bad enough that House and Senate Republicans are refusing to \nprovide the funding our health experts say is necessary to fight this \ndisease, but now House Republicans are insisting on cutting Ebola \nfunding to do it.\n  Last week, the House passed a partisan bill that would have provided \na mere $622 million to fight Zika. That is a third of what the experts \nsay they need, and they offset the costs by raiding Ebola money.\n  House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers called it ``excess funding \nleft over from the Ebola outbreak.'' That couldn't be further from the \ntruth.\n  I recently spoke with the CDC Director Tom Frieden who told me some \ntroubling news. Last month, there was another cluster of Ebola cases in \nWest Africa, about a dozen new cases. What they have now found is that \nthe Ebola virus can stay in a man's system for up to 1 year, allowing \nit to be spread to others.\n  Ebola may not be front page news in the United States right now, but \nthat is largely because our CDC disease detectives are on the ground in \nWest Africa, nearly 100 of them, fighting to contain its spread.\n  If we keep stealing the funding that enables them to do their job, \nEbola could soon again be front page news.\n  Since Republicans have been dragging their feet on Zika funding, the \nWhite House was forced, as a last ditch, stop-gap requirement, to \ntransfer $510 million away from the Ebola response to fund the \nimmediate response needs for Zika.\n  As the White House's Ebola czar, Ron Klain, said last week, ``we are \ntaking a fire hydrant out of the ground in one place and moving it \nsomeplace else to fight a different fire.''\n  This Ebola money that was moved was the CDC's funds for the next 2 \nfiscal years, funds that are to be used to build a frontline defense \nfor our own country. It invests in the public health capacity of \npartner nations, so we aren't waiting for local outbreaks to hit our \nshores as global epidemics.\n  These ``leftover'' funds are being used to develop and test vaccine \ncandidates for Ebola, and late-stage clinical trials are moving \nforward, but they need those funds to continue validating these \nvaccines.\n  Now House Republicans want to drain these Ebola funds again.\n  We already know what happens when we have to take money from one \nplace in the public health budget and move it elsewhere. State and \nlocal health departments lost $44 million in CDC preparedness grants \nearlier this year because of a reprogramming of funds that were moved \nto high-risk Zika States. Illinois lost $2 million in total. A recent \nsurvey of State health departments said that this $44 million cut will \nresult in staffing reductions and could hamper Zika preparations by \nforcing a reduction in laboratory services and epidemiological \nactivities. So to be clear, States at lower risk for Zika, like \nIllinois, lost money to States at higher risk like Mississippi, Texas, \nand Florida. And this cut will mean that Illinois and other States that \nlost money are now less prepared for Zika.\n  Public health preparedness is not done with a wave of a magic wand. \nIt requires steady investments in people, lab testing, and epidemiology \nand dedicated research and clinical trials.\n  We did not require our Ebola, H1N1, or avian influenza supplementals \nto be offset, and we certainly should not begin down that dangerous \npath now.\n  As with our response to Ebola here in the U.S., proven public health \nprotocols will work against Zika, but we need to listen to the experts \nand fund the needed response.\n  That means we cannot wait any longer to pass an emergency Zika \nfunding supplemental.\n  Some Republicans have said this money can wait until October 1 when \nour new fiscal year starts. Do you think mosquitos know when the new \nfiscal year begins and will wait to buzz and bite until then?\n  This weekend is Memorial Day weekend. I don't know about you, but in \nmy hometown and across Illinois that means people will be outside and \nhaving barbecues. Then comes the Fourth of July and, soon after, Labor \nDay weekend.\n  We do not have time to wait around. We need to approve the Senate's \nZika supplemental as a down payment, and we need to send it to the \nPresident's desk this week.\n  Over 1,380 people across 44 States, Washington DC, and 3 U.S. \nterritories,\n\n[[Page S3278]]\n\nincluding over 279 pregnant women, have contracted Zika.\n  To my Republican colleagues, I would say: stop playing games, support \nour States and Federal health officials, approve the money, and send it \nto the President's desk. We cannot wait any longer. Pregnant women \ncannot wait any longer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/senate-section/article/S3277-1"}, {"day": "26", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    MANDATORY ARBITRATION CLAUSES IN FOR-PROFIT COLLEGE ENROLLMENT \n                               AGREEMENTS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have not been shy about coming to the \nSenate floor to voice my concerns about the for-profit college \nindustry. This is an industry that enrolls 10 percent of college \nstudents, collects 20 percent of Federal student aid, and accounts for \nover 40 percent of student loan defaults. This industry has a terrible \ntrack record; yet it continues to collect billions each year in Federal \nfunding. If there ever was an industry that needed to face \naccountability, it is the for-profit college industry. But for-profit \ncolleges have long avoided accountability to their students and to \nregulators through the use of mandatory arbitration clauses.\n  For years, mandatory arbitration clauses have been buried in the fine \nprint of student enrollment agreements at for-profit schools. Students \nusually didn't even know that, by signing these agreements, they were \ngiving up their right to a day in court if the school's misbehavior \ncaused the students harm. Mandatory arbitration clauses mean, for \nexample, that, if a student is misled or deceived by a school's \nadvertising and goes into debt as a result, the student can't take the \nschool to court. Instead, the student is forced into a secret \narbitration proceeding where the playing field is tilted against the \nstudent's interests.\n  Mandatory arbitration clauses allow schools to avoid accountability \nto their students--and the secrecy of arbitration proceedings means \nthat misconduct stays hidden from the attention of regulators. \nMandatory arbitration clauses are not used by legitimate nonprofit \ncolleges, either public or private. But these clauses were widely used \namong for-profit colleges--including Corinthian, the now bankrupt for-\nprofit college which for years lied to its students and to regulators \nabout its job placement rates and other data.\n  There is a growing recognition that mandatory arbitration has helped \nhide misconduct in the for-profit college industry. Also, because these \nclauses prevent students from seeking meaningful relief in court from \nthe schools that wronged them, students have had to seek relief from \nthe Federal Government for their student loan debt. This means that \ntaxpayers are on the hook for helping these victimized students, \ninstead of the for-profit colleges that harmed them.\n  I have joined my colleagues in urging the Department of Education to \nissue strong regulations to prevent for-profit colleges that receive \nFederal funds from using mandatory arbitration clauses, and I have \ncalled out for-profit colleges that use these clauses.\n  On April 13, I came to the Senate floor and mentioned three names of \nschools that use these clauses: DeVry, the University of Phoenix, and \nITT Tech. Lo and behold, two of these three for-profit schools--DeVry \nand the Apollo Education Group, which owns the University of Phoenix--\nhave now made commitments to stop requiring their students to submit to \nmandatory arbitration. Apollo made their announcement last week, and \nDeVry officials told my staff that they discontinued the use of these \nclauses a few weeks ago, on May 13.\n  This is good news. These actions reflect the growing consensus \noutside and inside the for-profit industry that mandatory arbitration \nhas no place in higher education enrollment. Also, the decisions by \nApollo and DeVry reaffirm that the Department of Education is on the \nright track in reining in mandatory arbitration. The Department should \nfinish the job by issuing rules that end this practice among all \nschools that receive Federal dollars.\n  Now, one note of caution--the devil is in the details when it comes \nto arbitration clauses. I have heard promises before from education \ncompanies to end mandatory arbitration, only to see those companies add \nnew fine print that finds other ways to block students' access to \ncourt. I will be carefully checking the fine print of the new \nenrollment agreements to make sure these schools are not imposing new, \nmore subtle restrictions on their students' access to court. If the \nfine print does reflect their commitment, I believe Apollo and DeVry \ndeserve credit, but they still have a long way to go to improve student \noutcomes and prove they are going to dump the old for-profit college \nplaybook.\n  ITT Tech, the spotlight is now on you. ITT Tech's executives have \ndemanded their own day in court to respond to investigations and \nallegations of misconduct that were brought by regulatory agencies. At \nthe same time, ITT Tech has continued to force its own students into \nmandatory arbitration. ITT Tech and all for-profit colleges should put \nan end to this practice of mandatory arbitration. They should join the \ngrowing consensus against these clauses that is reflected in the views \nof the Department of Education, student groups, veterans groups, civil \nrights groups, consumer groups, and now even some of the largest for-\nprofit colleges.\n  It is time to stand up for accountability and for putting students \nfirst. It is time to end mandatory arbitration clauses in the for-\nprofit college industry once and for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/senate-section/article/S3278-1"}, {"day": "26", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE EASTER RISING\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last week, the Senate unanimously adopted a \nresolution to commemorate the 100th anniversary of a crucial milestone \nin the history of Ireland, the 1916 Easter Rising rebellion. As a son \nof Ireland through my father's ancestors, I am proud to reflect on this \nimportant moment in Ireland's long march to independence.\n  The relationship between the United States and Ireland is long, it is \nstrong, it is enduring, and it cannot be understated. As President \nKennedy once said in a speech before Ireland's Parliament, ``No people \never believed more deeply in the cause of Irish freedom than the people \nof the United States.'' Both the United States and Ireland have \nhistories rooted in a common set of ideals and goals, and we share \nsimilar principles and beliefs in freedom. A marker of the influence of \nthe United States is the fact that our Nation is the only foreign \ncountry named in the 1916 Proclamation of the Republic, which \nproclaimed Ireland's independence.\n  My relatives on my father's side believed strongly in the promises of \nopportunity in the United States when they emigrated here in the mid-\n1800s. Marcelle and I have visited Ireland and met distant relatives \nwho live there still. It is easy to see and feel the strong connections \nbetween our two countries.\n  Last week's centennial anniversary of the Easter Rising, commemorated \non both sides of the Atlantic, recalls a turning point in Ireland's \nhistory. The influences of freedom, dignity, and prosperity in America \nthat motivated many of the leaders of that rebellion 100 years ago are \nworth fighting to preserve and nurture here in the United States today. \nLike so many lessons of the past, the Easter Rising is a moment to \nreflect on our own freedoms and our own march toward perfecting our own \nUnion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/senate-section/article/S3278-2"}, {"day": "26", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3278-S3279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO RUBY PAONE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I may be dating myself when I say this, but \nI remember when Ruby Paone started work here as a fresh graduate from \nSt. Andrews University. That was April of 1975, just a few months after \nI began my own tenure here in the Senate, and for more than 41 years, \nshe has served in the U.S. Senate as a public servant of the highest \ncaliber. Ruby is a remarkable woman. Throughout her Senate experience, \nshe has befriended future Presidents and legendary legislators. The \nSenate permeates her family. She and her husband, longtime Senate aide \nand now adviser to President Obama, Marty Paone, have raised three \nwonderful children.\n  Ruby is from the small town of Bladenboro, NC, and she brings the \nvery best of small towns to this often\n\n[[Page S3279]]\n\nchaotic city. In true smalltown fashion, she knows everyone, never \nforgets a name or a face, and has a smile and a kind remark for \neveryone she sees. I have often said that Senators are merely \nconstitutional impediments to their staff, and the same can surely be \nsaid for Ruby. Her steadfast service and collegiality are part of what \nmakes the Senate work. Ruby, thank you for all that you have done for \nthe Senate, and we wish you the best in retirement.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, as I have said previously, there are many \npeople who work behind the scenes to help the Senate function. We tend \nto take them for granted, but we shouldn't. I would like to take this \nopportunity to acknowledge one such Senate staffer, Deputy Director of \nDoorkeepers Ruby Paone, who is retiring after more than 41 of steadfast \nservice to the U.S. Senate and to our Nation. Everyone knows and loves \nRuby, who has been here longer than any U.S. Senator currently serving, \nexcept for our esteemed colleague, the senior Senator from Vermont.\n  Ruby Paone, one of Lena and Wilbur Smith's five children, grew up on \na farm in Bladenboro, NC, where she spent her summers pulling peanuts \nand harvesting tobacco. She graduated from St. Andrew's University and \nthen came to Washington, DC. On March 17, 1975, she started working in \nthe Senate as a card desk attendant. Then she became a reception room \nattendant and steadily worked her way up to her present position. Along \nthe way, she met another Senate staffer, Marty Paone. The two of them \nstarting dating, and then they were married in 1983. The Washington \nPost reported at the time:\n\n       Senator Robert Byrd paused in the debate to inform his \n     colleagues that Ruby Grey Smith, who has worked in the Senate \n     Reception Room for the last eight years, had married Marty \n     Patrick Paone, a member of the floor staff of the Democratic \n     Policy Committee. Byrd observed that with all the burdens of \n     the Senate, the marriage shows that `every cloud does have a \n     silver lining.' Quick to agree with the minority leader, \n     Majority Leader Howard Baker rose to add his congratulations, \n     remembering that on the wedding day the press of Senate \n     business almost interfered with the wedding hour. Sen. Howard \n     Metzenbaum rushed out to get Mrs. Paone to hear the words of \n     congratulation and she was there to see the chamber burst \n     into applause. It may have been the best thing done in that \n     Chamber all year.\n\n  As Senator Reid noted yesterday, Ruby has been here for seven \ndifferent Presidential administrations, 10 consecutive inaugurations, \n16 different Sergeants-at-Arms, and 383 different Senators. Ruby's \nhusband, Marty, who currently serves as deputy assistant to the \nPresident for legislative affairs, served as the Democratic secretary \nlonger than anyone else in the history of the Senate. He worked in the \nSenate for 32 years overall, so he and Ruby have devoted nearly three-\nquarters of a century to this institution. Is there any other family so \ncommitted to service in the U.S. Senate? I doubt it. But the family's \nservice is not ending with Ruby's retirement, fortunately. Ruby and \nMarty's daughter, Stephanie, works in the Democratic cloakroom and \ntheir son, Tommy, works at the Senate appointments desk. They proudly \nand ably carry on the Paone family tradition of outstanding Senate \nservice.\n  I believe the U.S. Senate--Senators and staff--is a big family. Like \nany family, we certainly have our disagreements. But I am sure we can \nall agree that Ruby Paone has been a cherished member of the Senate \nfamily for over four decades, and we will miss her here. But we take \nsolace in knowing that she is leaving so she can spend more time with \nher most important family--her husband, Marty, and their children \nAlexander, Stephanie, and Tommie. We have been so fortunate to have \nRuby in the Senate family for the past 41-plus years. The American \npeople are so fortunate to have talented and dedicated public servants \nlike Ruby and Marty and Stephanie and Tommy Paone. I know the entire \nSenate joins me in thanking Ruby for her service and wishing her and \nher family the very best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/senate-section/article/S3278-3"}, {"day": "26", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3279-S3280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUDGETARY REVISIONS\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, section 251 of the Balanced Budget and \nEmergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 establishes statutory limits on \ndiscretionary spending and allows for various adjustments to those \nlimits, while sections 302 and 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act \nof 1974 allow the chairman of the Budget Committee to establish and \nmake revisions to allocations, aggregates, and levels consistent with \nthose adjustments.\n  On May 19, 2016, the Senate agreed to Senate amendment No. 3900, \nfiled by Senator Blunt. This amendment provides funding to combat the \nZika virus. The amendment would increase budget authority by $1,098 \nmillion in fiscal year 2016 and increase outlays by $147 million and \n$508 million in fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2017, respectively. \nThe amendment includes language that would designate its spending as \nemergency pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Balanced Budget \nand Deficit Control Act of 1985. The inclusion of these designations \nmakes this spending eligible for an adjustment under the Congressional \nBudget Act.\n  As a result, I am increasing the budgetary aggregate for fiscal year \n2016 by $1,098 million in budget authority and $147 million in outlays. \nI am increasing the budgetary aggregate for fiscal year 2017 by $508 \nmillion in outlays. Further, I am revising the budget authority and \noutlay allocations to the Appropriations Committee by $1,098 million in \nrevised nonsecurity budget authority and $147 million in outlays for \nfiscal year 2016 and by $508 million in outlays in fiscal year 2017.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables, which provide \ndetails about the adjustment, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    REVISION TO BUDGETARY AGGREGATES\n (Pursuant to Section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and S.\n  Con.

LAUTENBERG CHEMICAL SAFETY FOR THE 21ST CENTURY BILL\n\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, the following information is in response to \nan article entered into the record by Senator Boxer of California \nearlier today.\n  The Hearst News article in question was published in the San \nFrancisco Chronicle and implies that the chemical industry drafted S. \n697, the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act. \nThis implication is false.\n  The bill authors, including myself, wrote this bill. Drafts of the \nbill were circulated to many interested stakeholders throughout the \ndrafting process and returned with comments. This process took over 3 \nyears, and drafts were circulated each step of the way. Reforming the \nToxic Substances Control Act was a very involved and transparent \nprocess.\n  Environmental groups, trial lawyers, industry, State officials, and \nthe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency were consulted at many stages \nthroughout the process.\n  All of their input is reflected in the bill in various provisions, \noften the same ones. This is major comprehensive legislation that has \nreceived wide bipartisan support.\n  The New York Times looked into the allegation that the chemical \nindustry wrote the bill. Their lead reporter, Eric Lipton, wrote on \nMarch 17: ``Lots of players, including enviros, submitted drafts with \nproposed changes.''\n  Again, many drafts of this bill were shared by a variety of Senate \noffices with many stakeholders in a very engaged process over 3 years.\n  It is disappointing that I must refute this allegation in the \nCongressional Record, but it is important to get the facts straight \nwhen explaining the legislative history of TSCA reform.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/senate-section/article/S3280-1"}, {"day": "26", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRUCK DRIVERS' WORKING HOURS RULE\n\n Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I rise to speak on an amendment \nI filed last week to the Transportation appropriations bill. The bill \npassed the Senate last week. I did not offer my amendment for a vote, \nbut it has been willfully mischaracterized by an industry campaign, so \nI wanted to take a few minutes to explain it.\n  My amendment, Blumenthal amendment No. 4002, would improve the safety \nof our roads. America depends on truck drivers to move our goods \naround; truckers and the trucking industry perform a vital service. But \ntruckers who work too many hours in a week, like any other drivers who \nspend too much time behind the wheel, get tired and can't drive safely. \nSo since the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration, there have been \nlimits placed on the number of hours they can work in a week.\n  In 2003, President Bush raised the limit from 60 hours on duty in a \n7-day week, where it had been for decades, to 82 hours in a 7-day week. \nThis increased truck drivers' fatigue. So in 2013, President Obama \nsought to make some changes, bringing the limit back down to 70 hours \nand ensuring that drivers could rest when the body needs it most: at \nnight.\n  The Obama administration's rule was based on sound science, thousands \nof comments, and, most importantly, a prioritization of safety over \nprofits, but it was opposed by many trucking companies, who were \naccustomed to working their drivers to the max, regardless of the \nconsequences for other drivers on the road.\n  Over the past few years, in a process I will not describe in detail \nhere, the trucking industry succeeded in gutting the new rule, not \nthrough legislation in the Commerce Committee, which has both the \njurisdiction and the expertise, but through the appropriations process. \nLanguage on appropriations bills suspended the rule and required \ncumbersome studies before it could return.\n  The bill before us continues this trend, including language to make \nit clear that the Bush administration rules will return after the \nstudy, and it enshrines a statutory cap on truck drivers' working \nhours, one that will be extremely difficult to change even in the face \nof new data or scientific evidence.\n  This is terrible precedent. It encourages truck drivers to put in \nnearly double an average work week behind the wheel of an 80,000-pound \nbig rig, the last place in the world we want someone who is falling \nasleep.\n  My amendment would let us go back to the rules that existed in 2013, \nrather than this mess, masquerading as a solution. It would give us the \nopportunity to debate this issue fully and to put aside the \ncounterproductive language in this appropriations bill.\n  However, while I am not pushing for a vote on this amendment, it is \nsupported by the ranking member of the Commerce committee, Senator \nNelson, and my Commerce colleagues, Senators Markey and Booker. \nUnfortunately, due to a campaign of misinformation, it has become \ncontroversial. And I believe the underlying measure, including critical \nfunding to fight the Zika virus, must not be delayed.\n  But I am pushing for a commitment from my colleagues to work with me \nin conference and, in the long-term, to find a solution. Four thousand \npeople die a year in truck crashes, and countless truck drivers report \nnodding off behind the wheel. This is something we have a duty to \naddress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/senate-section/article/S3280-2"}, {"day": "26", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3280-S3281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MEMORIAL DAY\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, I proudly wish to recognize the 1 percent of \nAmericans who\n\n[[Page S3281]]\n\nserve today in the Armed Forces of the United States. This past \nweekend, on Armed Forces Day, I had the honor of participating in the \ngrand opening of the Military Family Support Center presented by the \nCobb Chamber of Commerce. It remains humbling to me every time I see \nGeorgia communities come together to support our servicemen and \nservicewomen and their families.\n  Anyone who opens a newspaper today or turns on the TV knows that we \nlive in a world of unknown and dangerous threats. Despite this, nearly \n2.1 million Americans have voluntarily raised their right hands and \nsworn to defend our Nation against all enemies, foreign and domestic. \nWhat makes these men and women unique is that, despite these global \nthreats, they choose to rise to the challenge. They come from all walks \nof life. From coast to coast, every Main Street, farm, or even next \ndoor, our selfless warriors voluntarily walk away from the comforts of \nhome to join the most elite force on this planet. They endure long \nhours in the field, countless months away from their families while \ndownrange, and some even come face to face with those who wish to do us \nharm. These courageous Americans are deployed in more than 150 \ncountries around the world. From humanitarian missions to coalition \nforce partnerships to counterterrorism operations, there is no mission, \nno challenge they cannot rise to meet.\n  Our world is becoming increasingly unstable. With threats rising from \nold foes to new ones in familiar places, there is simply no shortage of \nchallenges our country faces in terms of national security. While the \nunknown threatens global peace, one constant known is the courage and \ndedication of America's Armed Forces. I am constantly reminded that we \nare the land of the free because of the brave.\n  Now, this coming Monday gives us all a moment to stop and pay respect \nto the approximately 1.3 million Americans who have given their lives \nin the defense of our great Nation. From the Revolutionary War to the \nCivil War, from World War I to World War II, from Korea to Vietnam, and \nfrom Iraq to Afghanistan, brave men and women have answered the call to \ndefend our homeland and protect the helpless around the world in the \nname of peace. Those of us who are fortunate to work in this grand \nCapitol Building need not look any farther than across the river, on \nthe other side of the National Mall, where the ``gardens of stone'' at \nArlington National Cemetery offer a sobering reminder of the price of \nfreedom.\n  While Americans enjoy the long weekend with family and barbecues, I \nwould encourage everyone to take a moment to remember the true meaning \nof the holiday: to honor the servicemembers who have paid the ultimate \nprice.\n  I also want to take a moment to honor and thank those families who \nPresident Lincoln once said ``have laid such a costly sacrifice upon \nthe altar of freedom.'' The strength of these families to persevere is \nlike no other, and their support to our goals of peace and freedom is \nsimply humbling.\n  Memorial Day--and every day--I am again honored and reminded that we \nare the land of the free because of the brave.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, Americans live free, secure, and stable \nlives thanks to generations of men and women in uniform who were \nwilling to sacrifice their own lives. We must never forget the \ntremendous debt we owe those brave Americans. It is in large part \nbecause of them that America serves as a beacon of hope, freedom, and \nequality to all the world.\n  This Monday, we will celebrate Memorial Day, a national day of solemn \nremembrance and gratitude as we honor the men and women who have died \ndefending our Nation. We honor each and every American who has made the \nultimate sacrifice on battlefields from Lexington, Concord, and Bunker \nHill to Fort McHenry; from Shiloh, Antietam, and Gettysburg to Belleau \nWood and the Somme; from Pearl Harbor, Bastogne, and Iwo Jima to \nInchon, Bloody Ridge, and the Chosin Reservoir; from Ia Drang, Khe \nSanh, and Hamburger Hill to Umm Qasr, Nasiriyah, Fallujah, and Kabul. \nWe salute the centuries-old legacy of selflessness and sacrifice that \ndefines our Nation. We are forever indebted to our warfighters and \ntheir families. On Memorial Day, we pause to reflect, to remember, to \npay respect, to give thanks. And we say a prayer for all the men and \nwomen currently serving in harm's way and look forward to the day when \nthey may return home safely to be with their families and friends.\n  Memorial Day is not only a day for looking backward. It is also a day \nfor looking forward. Those men and women who lie buried gave their \nlives so that we could live in peace. Their dream and the dream of \nevery American serving in the field of battle is that someday no more \nAmericans will be called upon to give their lives for their country, \nthat someday war will end and the world will be truly free. What better \nway, then, to honor their memory than to do everything we can to seek \npeace?\n  On this day of remembrance, I hope that all Americans remember the \ndream of those who committed the greatest sacrifice and pursue peace in \nall our endeavors. As President Lincoln put it so eloquently nearly 153 \nyears ago, let us dedicate ourselves ``to the great task remaining \nbefore us--that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to \nthat cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion--that \nwe here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain--\nthat this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom--and \nthat government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not \nperish from the earth.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/senate-section/article/S3280-3"}, {"day": "26", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3281-S3282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE U.S. HELSINKI COMMISSION\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, on June 3, 1976, U.S. President Gerald \nFord signed into law a bill establishing the Commission on Security and \nCooperation in Europe, more commonly known as the U.S. Helsinki \nCommission.\n  I bring this 40th anniversary next week to my colleagues' attention \ntoday because the commission has played a particularly significant role \nin U.S. foreign policy.\n  First, the commission provided the U.S. Congress with a direct role \nin the policymaking process. Members and staff of the commission have \nbeen integrated into official U.S. delegations to meetings and \nconferences of what is historically known as the Helsinki Process. The \nHelsinki Process started as an ongoing multilateral conference on \nsecurity and cooperation in Europe that is manifested today in the 57-\ncountry, Vienna-based Organization for Security and Cooperation in \nEurope, or OSCE.\n  As elected officials, our ideas reflecting the interests of concerned \nAmerican citizens are better represented in U.S. diplomacy as a result \nof the commission. There is no other country that has a comparable \nbody, reflecting the singular role of our legislature as a separate \nbranch of government in the conduct of foreign policy. The commission's \nlong-term commitment to this effort has resulted in a valuable \ninstitutional memory and expertise in European policy possessed by few \nothers in the U.S. foreign affairs community.\n  Second, the commission was part of a larger effort since the late \n1970s to enhance consideration of human rights as an element in U.S. \nforeign policy decisionmaking. Representatives Millicent Fenwick of New \nJersey and Dante Fascell of Florida created the commission as a vehicle \nto ensure that human rights violations raised by dissident groups in \nthe Soviet Union and the Communist countries of Eastern Europe were no \nlonger ignored in U.S. policy.\n  In keeping with the Helsinki Final Act's comprehensive definition of \nsecurity--which includes respect for human rights and fundamental \nfreedoms as a principle guiding relations between states--we have \nreviewed the records of all participating countries, including our own \nand those of our friends and allies.\n  From its Cold War origins, the Helsinki Commission adapted well to \nchanging circumstances, new challenges, and new opportunities. It has \ndone much to ensure U.S. support for democratic development in East-\nCentral Europe and continues to push for greater respect for human \nrights in Russia and the countries of the Caucasus and Central Asia.\n  The Commission has participated in the debates of the 1990s on how \nthe United States should respond to conflicts in the Balkans, \nparticularly Bosnia and Kosovo and elsewhere, and it\n\n[[Page S3282]]\n\ndoes the same today in regard to Russia's aggression towards Ukraine. \nIt has pushed U.S. policy to take action to combat trafficking in \npersons, anti-Semitism and racism, and intolerance and corruption, as \nwell as other problems which are not confined to one country's borders.\n  The Helsinki Commission has succeeded in large part due to its \nleadership. From the House, the commission has been chaired by \nRepresentatives Dante Fascell of Florida, my good friend Steny Hoyer of \nMaryland, the current chairman, Christopher Smith of New Jersey, and \nAlcee Hastings of Florida. From this Chamber, we have had Senators \nAlfonse D'Amato of New York, Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, Ben \nNighthorse Campbell of Colorado, Sam Brownback of Kansas and today's \ncochairman, Roger Wicker of Mississippi.\n  I had the honor, myself, to chair the Helsinki Commission from 2007 \nto 2015. That time, and all my service on the commission, from 1993 to \nthe present, has been enormously rewarding.\n  I think it is important to mention that the hard work we do on the \nHelsinki Commission is not a job requirement for a Member of Congress.\n  Rather than being a responsibility, it is something many of us choose \nto do because it is rewarding to secure the release of a longtime \npolitical prisoner, to reunify a family, to observe elections in a \ncountry eager to learn the meaning of democracy for the first time, to \nenable individuals to worship in accordance with their faiths, to know \nthat policies we advocated have meant increased freedom for millions of \nindividuals in numerous countries, and to present the United States as \na force for positive change in this world.\n  Several of us have gone beyond our responsibilities on the commission \nto participate in the leadership of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly. \nRepresentative Hastings served for 2 years as assembly president, while \nRepresentative Hoyer, Representative Robert Aderholt of Alabama, and I \nhave served as vice presidents. Senator Wicker currently serves as \nchairman of the assembly's security committee.\n  Representative Hilda Solis of California had served as a committee \nchair and special representative on the critical issue of migration. \nToday, Representative Smith serves as a special representative on \nsimilarly critical issue of human trafficking, while I serve as special \nrepresentative on anti-Semitism, racism, and intolerance.\n  Our engagement in this activity as elected Members of Congress \nreflects the deep, genuine commitment of our country to security and \ncooperation in Europe, and this rebounds to the enormous benefit of our \ncountry. Our friends and allies appreciate our engagement, and those \nwith whom we have a more adversarial relationship are kept in check by \nour engagement. I hope my colleagues would consider this point today, \nespecially during a time when foreign travel is not strongly encouraged \nand sometimes actively discouraged.\n  Finally, let me say a few words about the Helsinki Commission staff, \nboth past and present. The staff represents an enormous pool of talent. \nThey have a combination of diplomatic skills, regional expertise, and \nforeign language capacity that has allowed the Members of Congress \nserving on the commission to be so successful. Many of them deserve \nmention here, but I must mention Spencer Oliver, the first chief of \nstaff, who set the commission's precedents from the very start. Spencer \nwent on to create almost an equivalent of the commission at the \ninternational level with the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.\n  One of his early hires and an eventual successor was Sam Wise, whom I \nwould consider to be one of the diplomatic heroes of the Cold War \nperiod for his contributions and leadership in the Helsinki Process.\n  In closing, I again want to express my hope that my colleagues will \nconsider the value of the Helsinki Commission's work over the years, \nenhancing the congressional role in U.S. foreign policy and advocating \nfor human rights as part of that policy.\n  Indeed, the commission, like the Helsinki Process, has been \nconsidered a model that could be duplicated to handle challenges in \nother regions of the world. I also hope to see my colleagues increase \ntheir participation on Helsinki Commission delegations to the OSCE \nParliamentary Assembly, as well as at Helsinki Commission hearings. For \nas much as the commission has accomplished in its four decades, there \ncontinues to be work to be done in its fifth, and the challenges ahead \nare no less than those of the past.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/senate-section/article/S3281-1"}, {"day": "26", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     JEWISH AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and celebrate \nthe month of May as Jewish American Heritage Month. Since the founding \nof our Nation, Jewish Americans have indelibly shaped American society. \nAs a proud Jewish American, I am honored to have the opportunity to \nacknowledge the outstanding contributions of our vibrant community in \nthe past, present, and future.\n  In the 109th Congress, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz and \nthen-Senator Arlen Spector authored a concurrent resolution calling for \na proclamation each year to observe American Jewish History Month. On \nApril 20, 2006, President George W. Bush proclaimed that May 2006 would \nbe Jewish American Heritage Month.\n  Jewish Americans have fought tirelessly to realize the American Dream \nand to enrich our society. Jewish Americans have been instrumental in \neliminating disease such as the polio epidemic, and they have split the \natom. These achievements and others too numerous to count are watershed \nmoments in history, and they make up only a small fraction of the \nvarious accomplishments Jewish Americans have made.\n  Such achievements, however, do not come without concomitant \nstruggles. Jewish Americans have been dedicated to promoting tolerance \nand understanding because Jewish people have been challenged and \npersecuted throughout history whenever they have professed their faith. \nJewish Americans participated in the abolitionist movement in the 19th \ncentury and joined the ranks of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating \nCommittee during the civil rights movement in the 1960s. There is no \nquestion that the Jewish tradition of diversity and inclusion has \nhelped to make the United States the force for equal rights, democracy, \nand opportunity that it is today. Though we face challenges to that \nideal every day, we must not forget that this country was and remains a \nbeacon for those suffering under the weight of oppression around the \nworld.\n  We cannot understate the role that Israel plays in Jewish American \nsociety and in the lives of Jewish people around the world. Our \nhomeland is the focal point of our religion and our culture. Further, \nour two nations are built on a common set of core democratic principles \nand representative government, but we have more than political \nphilosophies in common; we share a strong belief in the promotion of \nequality, freedom, and tolerance. The United States will always stand \nby Israel, and we will always support the safety of the Israeli people. \nAs a U.S. Senator, I have been proud to take part in efforts to \nstrengthen the relationship between our two nations. Without our \nhomeland, Jewish Americans may never have been able to make the myriad \ncontributions they have made to our Nation. These Jewish Americans' \naccomplishments embody the positive values that form the foundation of \nour shared culture and history. Our diversity makes the United States \nof America strong, and Jewish Americans have played an integral role in \nshaping and nurturing that diversity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/senate-section/article/S3282-1"}, {"day": "26", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3282-S3283]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE MALMEDY MASSACRE\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the sacrifice of our \nsoldiers at the Malmedy massacre.\n  As we prepare for Memorial Day, it is important to remember the 87 \nAmericans who were killed in action during the Malmedy massacre and \nhonor the brave few who survived this terrible ordeal. One of the \nsurvivors of this massacre, Harold W. Billow, is a proud resident of \nPennsylvania.\n  On December 17, 1944, Mr. Billow and Battery B, 285th Field Artillery \nObservation Battalion were riding in a convoy of vehicles towards the \nBelgian town of St. Vith. The convoy was attacked outside of Malmedy by \na Nazi SS unit called Kampfgruppe Peiper.\n\n[[Page S3283]]\n\nWhile a few soldiers were able to escape the initial attack, the other \n130 Americans were forced to surrender to the SS troops.\n  Given orders to take no prisoners and violating the rules of war, \nGerman tank gunners lined up the Americans and gunned them down in cold \nblood. Worse yet, these Nazi troops searched for anyone showing signs \nof life and shot them repeatedly at point-blank range.\n  However, 40 men, including Mr. Billow, were able to play dead and \nescape the massacre. Many of these survivors traveled to Nuremburg \nafter the war to testify in the war crimes trials and demand justice \nfor their fallen brothers in arms. Today Mr. Billow is one of only two \nmen from the 285th Battalion known to be alive.\n  Mr. Billow dedicates his life to remembering his comrades who did not \nsurvive this massacre. Every Fourth of July, Memorial Day, and \nVeterans' Day, Mr. Billow decorates his front lawn with 87 American \nflags, one for each man who fell on that terrible day in 1944.\n  Today I wish to remember the ultimate sacrifice made by those killed \nin the Malmedy massacre and also to honor and thank the survivors, \nincluding Mr. Billow, who keep the memory of their fellow soldiers \nalive.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/senate-section/article/S3282-2"}, {"day": "26", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3283]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ANDY SIMKOVITCH\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, today I wish to honor and recognize a \ndistinguished D-Day veteran from Pennsylvania, Mr. Andy Simkovitch, and \nto commemorate the 72nd anniversary of the D-Day landings.\n  A resident of Erie, PA, Mr. Simkovitch was a U.S. Navy sailor that \nserved aboard the tank landing ship USS L.S.T. 501 during World War II. \nHe was involved in Operation Overlord at Utah and Omaha Beaches, where \nhe transported troops during the D-Day landings on June 6, 1944. During \nthe operation and while under heavy German fire, he went to the beach \nnine times. Following his actions in France, his ship headed to the \nPacific and saw combat in numerous battles, including the Battle of \nOkinawa. Mr. Simkovitch stayed in the Pacific until Japan surrendered, \nand he was then honorably discharged in March 1946.\n  The courage and bravery displayed by Mr. Simkovitch earned him the \nChevalier Legion of Honor medal, the highest honor bestowed by the \nnation of France. With only 855,000 of the 16 million American WWII \nveterans remaining today, it is increasingly important to honor those \nthat served our great Nation and ensure future generations know about \nthe struggles and sacrifices these brave veterans endured.\n  On behalf of the U.S. Senate, I wish to thank Mr. Simkovitch for his \ndedicated service to our Nation in advance of the 72nd anniversary of \nthe D-Day landings.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/senate-section/article/S3283-1"}, {"day": "26", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3283-S3284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           VERMONT FEDERAL EXECUTIVE ASSOCIATION 2016 AWARDS\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, to commemorate Public Recognition \nWeek, the Vermont Federal Executive Association, VTFEA, recognized the \nmore than 4,000 Federal employees working across the State and the good \nwork they do every day. I would like to offer special congratulations \nto the 2016 Excellence in Government award winners, who have been \nrecognized by VTFEA for their exemplary government service.\n  Excellence in Management and Program Support Award, Individual \nAward--Heather Festa, management program analyst, personnel security \ndivision, Office of Security and Integrity, U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services, South Burlington--Heather demonstrated \nexceptional innovation and professionalism in response to the Office of \nPersonnel Management's security breach of electronic systems containing \nbackground investigation records. When OPM instructed Federal agencies \nto mail all paper documents, many agencies simply halted their \npersonnel security processes. However, Heather skillfully designed and \nimplemented an action plan for the hard-copy paper forms to ensure \nthere would be no interruption in processing security checks within \nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n  Excellence in Management and Program Support Award, Group Award--\nnortheast regional office position description workgroup, northeast \nregional office, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, South \nBurlington, including Jeannine Longchamp, Maegan Cutler, Brian \nJohansson, and Laurie Juskiewicz--the northeast regional office human \nresources team led a working group to review supervisory position \ndescriptions for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services's entire \nfield operations directorate. Not only did the team ensure that all \npositions aligned with Office of Personal Management guidelines, it \nalso created supervisory positions at new grade levels that opened up \npreviously unobtainable career paths for some employees.\n  Professional Award--Peter Banacos and Andrew Loconto, meteorologists, \nNational Weather Service, Burlington International Airport, South \nBurlington--Peter and Andrew worked together to develop a snow squall \nidentification and forecasting technique that has greatly improved \nwinter weather forecast and warning systems for many National Weather \nService offices. Historically, there has been an overall lack of \nforecaster awareness in identifying the weather conditions in which \nsnow squalls can occur, as well as understanding their impact. Peter \nand Andrew's innovation, leadership, and persistent efforts over the \npast 3 years have enhanced the National Weather Service's ability to \nprovide useful winter weather information to the public.\n  Law Enforcement, Safety and Security Award--Amanda Cahill, special \nagent, Department of Justice, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and \nExplosives, satellite office, Rutland--Amanda exemplifies the highest \ntraditions of government service: tireless dedication and devotion to \nher agency and the residents of her community. She has singlehandedly \nreestablished a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives \npresence in southern Vermont and has begun to fill a void in the law \nenforcement community's fight against armed drug traffickers. She has \nacted as an undercover agent, as well as a lead investigator, and \nrecently, she has been recognized for her efforts by the U.S. attorney \nfor Vermont.\n  Managerial/Supervisory Award--Daniel Whitney, section chief, \ntraining, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, law enforcement \nsupport center, Williston--Dan Whitney exemplifies the continued \npursuit of excellence and an unparalleled record of achievement. The \nlaw enforcement support center, LESC, is U.S. Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement's primary point of contact for law enforcement agencies \nthroughout the country. Dan is responsible for ensuring that all LESC \nemployees receive continuous training in multiple law enforcement \ndatabases, including ICE's new enterprise database that his team tested \nto ensure that LESC employees had the training and the tools to provide \nup to the minute information to law enforcement agencies. Dan is \nsomeone who leads by example and is always willing to do whatever it \ntakes to ensure that LESC meets its mission.\n  Tina Gurka Community Service Award--registered nurse Sharon Levenson \nand police officer Guy Gardner, VA medical center, White River \nJunction--in January 2016, Nurse Sharon Levenson and Officer Guy \nGardner demonstrated their dedication to veterans in their local \ncommunity. After one of her patients did not show up for an \nappointment, Sharon contacted the local police department and requested \na welfare check. When the police department said the situation did not \nwarrant a check, VA Officer Guy Gardner contacted a neighbor, and they \ndiscovered the veteran in serious distress. Thanks to Sharon and Guy's \nefforts, the patient recovered fully. Their commitment to veterans was \nrecognized by VA Secretary McDonald during testimony before the Senate \nVeterans' Affairs Committee.\n  Interagency Collaboration and Partnership Award--Brian Wood, Border \nPatrol agent, U.S. Border Patrol, Richford--Brian has demonstrated \nexemplary professionalism and work ethic in forming and maintaining \nvaluable and productive partnerships with various Federal and State \nagencies in Vermont and across the country. Brian's efforts have \nresulted in the arrest of numerous alien smugglers, drug\n\n[[Page S3284]]\n\ndealers, and human traffickers and the removal of countless illegal \nfirearms, heroin, and cocaine from our communities. Brian uses his \nexpertise in law enforcement and his ability to collaborate \nsuccessfully to keep our communities and citizens safe.\n  Heroic Act Award--John Marsh, Border Patrol agent, U.S. Border \nPatrol, Swanton sector, Beecher Falls Station--in April 2016, while \nreturning from a call for assistance in New Hampshire, Agent Marsh \napproached two men on the ground, one pounding the chest of the other. \nAgent Marsh found the person on the ground was choking on food, was not \nbreathing, and would not respond to verbal stimulation. After \nrequesting emergency medical services, Agent Marsh administered the \nHeimlich maneuver and was able to dislodge the food from the victim. He \nremained with him until the paramedics arrived and took over care. \nThanks to John's training and his ability to stay calm under pressure, \nthe victim is alive and well today.\n  Vermont Federal Team of the Year Award--the northwest vermont \nlocality pay committee: Brandon Ackel, Transportation Security \nAdministration, Robert Brugman, National Credit Union Administration, \nBrian Johansson, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Kelly \nLarsen, Federal Aviation Administration, Alaska, Bruce McDonald, \nTransportation Security Administration, Sean McVey, U.S. Customs and \nBorder Protection, Mark Nielsen, U.S. Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement, Jeff Ostlund, Transportation Security Administration, \nCorey Price, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Texas, Lisa \nRees, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and Krista Scheele, \nTransportation Security Administration--in November 2012, VTFEA \ndiscussed what initiatives would benefit the most Federal employees, \nand it didn't take long to realize that securing locality pay for \nVermont was the No. 1 priority. In early 2013, VTFEA created a locality \npay committee, consisting of employees from six Federal agencies. \nWorking tirelessly, the team prepared a locality pay proposal for \nnorthwest Vermont and, in December 2013, presented it to the Federal \nSalary Council in Washington, DC. Unfortunately, the first proposal was \ndenied, so the following year, they tried again. Again, the proposal \nwas denied. Not to be discouraged, the team drafted a third proposal in \nNovember 2015, and committee members traveled to Washington at their \nown expense to support the package and their fellow Vermonters.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor David \nMaxwell, the director of the Arkansas Department of Emergency \nManagement, ADEM, and State Homeland Security adviser, who is retiring \nnext month after more than 36 years of service at ADEM.\n  David began his career at ADEM in 1978 as a temporary housing \nemployee working with Arkansans displaced by major flooding in Little \nRock.\n  Through the years, he held a number of positions at ADEM, including \nplans and operations division manager, where he ensured the State \nemergency operations plan, EOP, and local jurisdictional plans were \nmaintained and in compliance with State and Federal guidelines. Prior \nto assuming the role of director, David served as the department's \ndeputy director.\n  As director, David chairs the Arkansas Homeland Security executive \ncommittee and serves on a number of the State's emergency response-\nrelated councils and committees.

Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate the \nMontgomery Youth Hockey Association's, MYHA, Squirt AA Blue team for \nwinning the 2016 International Silver Stick championship in Sarnia, \nOntario. I am proud that this year--for the 3rd year in a row--the name \nof the Montgomery Blue Devils from Rockville, MD, will be on a plaque \nplaced alongside the Silver Stick trophy in the Hockey Hall of Fame in \nToronto, Canada.\n  The International Silver Stick tournament has attracted teams from \nall over the United States and Canada since 1958. The laudable purpose \nof the tournament is to develop and promote ``Citizenship and \nInternational Goodwill through hockey.'' The Montgomery Blue Devils \nteam of 9- and 10-year-olds--a squad of 15 boys and 1 girl--exemplified \nthis philosophy both on and off the ice. Led by tournament ``most \nvaluable player'' Reid Pehrkon, the Squirt AA Blue team outscored its \nopponents by a margin of 30 goals to 17. The team defeated the North \nYork Knights in Toronto, Canada, in four overtimes, 5-4, to win the \nchampionship for a 3rd consecutive year. Compiling 145 victories in the \nprocess, the Blue Devils can legitimately lay claim to being the best \nAA team in North America.\n  In addition to winning the International Silver Stick tournament, the \nteam won its regular season title, the league playoff championship, and \nthe International Silver Stick regional championship.\n  Throughout the season, the AA Blue team lived up to its simple \nrallying cry of ``work,'' and never wavered from the main goals \nestablished by Coach Rob Keegan and assistants Dave Cohen, Stu Margel, \nand Lee Rosebush, which were ``to be the hardest working team around \nand to always believe that the team is more important than the \nindividual.''\n  I ask my colleagues to join me today in congratulating the MYHA Blue \nDevils Squirt AA Blue Team for its dedication to the values of teamwork \nand perseverance while winning a third consecutive International Silver \nStick Championship.

KELLY\n\n Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Monsignor \nJoseph P. Kelly, a dear friend and spiritual advisor, for his decades \nof extraordinary service in helping others and working to secure the \ncommon good. Fifty years ago, Monsignor Kelly was ordained as a priest \nin the Diocese of Scranton. Since then, he has touched the lives of \nthousands of people in Northeastern Pennsylvania and Nebraska. He is \nbeen a servant leader, one whose profound faith is demonstrated in his \nworks. I would like to take this time to wish him the best on\n\n[[Page S3285]]\n\nthis milestone and reflect on his selfless commitment to enriching the \nlives of others.\n  Over the decades, he has worked in a variety of diocesan assignments \nand always in a position to teach students or his congregation. As an \neducator at Holy Rosary School and the Scranton Preparatory School, he \nspent 25 years teaching religion to eighth graders and high school \nseniors. He has served as pastor of several parishes, including St. \nCatherine's Moscow, Holy Rosary, St. Ann's, and Nativity of Our Lord. \nIn addition, Monsignor Kelly served as the Episcopal vicar of Hispanic \nministry for the Diocese of Scranton. He has also led Catholic Social \nServices, St. Michael's School for Boys, and Camp St. Andrew, where he \ncofounded Project Hope. At one time, Project Hope sent as many as 700 \nlow-income and at-risk youth to Camp St. Andrew, providing summer camp \nexperiences for young people who otherwise would not be able to afford \nthe program.\n  Service and serving others is not only a deed, it has been a way of \nlife for Monsignor Kelly. Although Monsignor Kelly retired from leading \nCatholic Social Services at the end of 2015, he currently is the \nexecutive director of the St. Francis of Assisi Kitchen in Scranton, \nPA. He is committed to responding to the needs of those living in \npoverty in America. I commend his lifelong efforts to foster compassion \nand promote human dignity for all people, at all stages of life. \nMonsignor Kelly's reputation for integrity is reflected in his work \nwith the poorest, most vulnerable, and most marginalized members of our \ncommunities.\n  Over the past 50 years, his life has been one of compassion, selfless \nservice, and a steadfast commitment to justice. On behalf of the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania, I commend Monsignor Joseph P. Kelly for \nthis milestone and wish him only the best in the days and years \nahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/senate-section/article/S3284-3"}, {"day": "26", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3285]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TRIBUTE TO MACKENZIE WOOTEN, BROOK HIGBEE, AND HAYDN BRADSTREET\n\n Mr. HELLER.

This is an incredible \naccolade, recognizing the very best students across the Nation who have \ngone above and beyond in their academic pursuits, and I extend my \nsincerest congratulations to these three Nevadans.\n  The U.S. Presidential Scholars Program was established in 1964 by \nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson to recognize some of the most academically \nambitious students across the Nation. Each year, up to 161 students are \nnamed as U.S. Presidential Scholars, which is one of the most \nprestigious accomplishments that high school students can achieve. All \nthree of these students have excelled in their studies and are \ncertainly deserving of this award.\n  Mackenzie is a senior at Northwest Career and Technical Academy in \nthe Clark County School District and was recognized for demonstrating \nexcellence in career and technical education. This category was added \nto the scholars list this year to recognize students pursuing science, \ntechnology, engineering, and math fields. Brook is a senior at \nPahranagat Valley High School in the Lincoln County School District and \nserves as student body president. Haydn attends Davidson Academy of \nNevada in Reno and has excelled in his scientific pursuits. Both Brook \nand Haydn were selected for excellence in their academic studies.\n  These students are shining examples of what hard work and \ndetermination can accomplish, and they should be proud of their \naccomplishments.

This award is truly prestigious \nand given to only the most ambitious companies making a significant \ncontribution to the expansion of U.S. exports.\n  As founder, CEO, and president of Kimmie Candy, Joe first established \nthe company on a farm in his hometown of Sacramento, CA. By 2003, the \ncompany had made great strides and won ``product of the year'' at the \nannual Candy Grammys held in Long Beach, CA. In 2005, Joe relocated to \nReno, NV, with the goal of creating more American jobs. Just 2 years \nlater, Joe purchased the building that is now Kimmie Candy's production \nfacility, and by 2008, the candy company was fully operational. Within \nthe next year, Joe took the company international and increased sales \nin the United States, Canada, Mexico, the Philippines, South America, \nand the Middle East. Since its opening, the company has grown to 36 \nemployees and continues to expand. I have toured the facility on \nmultiple occasions and am always impressed by this successful business. \nJoe's work in creating job opportunities in Nevada has not gone \nunnoticed, and I am thankful to have Kimmie Candy operating in our \ngreat State.\n  In 1961, President John F. Kennedy signed an executive order to \nrevive the World War II ``E'' symbol of excellence. The President's \n``E'' Award aims to honor companies across the country that have \ncontributed to America's exports by demonstrating export growth for \nover 4 years. Kimmie Candy is one of only 123 companies that was \nhonored with this award. Without a doubt, Joe's work at Kimmie Candy \nwarrants this significant accolade.\n  Today, I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in \ncongratulating my friend Joe and the entire Kimmie Candy family for \nreceiving this national award. I am thankful for everything Joe has \ncontributed to the city of Reno and our State, and I wish him well as \nhe continues his endeavors at Kimmie Candy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/senate-section/article/S3285-2"}, {"day": "26", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3285]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          50TH ANNIVERSARY OF BON SECOURS ST. MARY'S HOSPITAL\n\n Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 50th \nanniversary of the Bon Secours St. Mary's Hospital, the first hospital \nin the Bon Secours Richmond Health System. This not-for-profit Catholic \nhealth system, which is comprised of four hospitals in the greater \nRichmond metropolitan area, serves some of the neediest populations \nthroughout central Virginia.\n  St. Mary's founding was rooted in a strong history of providing care. \nIn 1824, in Paris, 12 women formed the congregation of the Sisters of \nBon Secours, French for ``Good Help.'' The Sisters' purpose was to \nnurse the sick and dying in their homes. The Sisters of Bon Secours \ncame to the United States in 1881, where they continued their work of \naiding the poor, the sick, and the dying in their homes. In 1966, Bon \nSecours expanded its mission with the opening of St. Mary's Hospital. \nThrough its history, Bon Secours Richmond has stayed true to its \nfounding principles through its community outreach and commitment to \nserving the neediest among us.\n  For the past 50 years, St. Mary's Hospital has provided critical \nhealth services including cardiac, orthopedic, women's pediatric, \nsurgery, oncology, imaging, neurology, and emergency services. St. \nMary's Hospital ranks in the top 10 percent of America's hospitals for \nemergency care. Today St. Mary's employs over 3,000 employees, \nincluding more than 1,000 physicians.\n  Bon Secours' mission is to bring compassion to health care and to be \ngood help to those in need. I commend St. Mary's Hospital on behalf of \nmy constituents for its commitment to health care excellence and \nservice to the patients and families in the greater Richmond \narea.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/senate-section/article/S3285-3"}, {"day": "26", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3285-S3286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING THE GAS TECHNOLOGY INSTITUTE\n\n Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I would like to honor the Gas \nTechnology Institute, GTI, and its dedicated employees as they \ncelebrate their 75th anniversary. Headquartered in Des Plaines, IL, GTI \nis a leading nonprofit research development organization in my home \nState, working diligently to address key global energy and \nenvironmental challenges.\n  A proven leader over the past three-quarters of a century, GTI \ncontinues to develop high-impact technologies,\n\n[[Page S3286]]\n\nunlocking the economic potential of domestic energy resources, while \nreducing the environmental footprint of fossil fuels. Founded as the \nInstitute of Gas Technology in 1941, the institute worked closely with \nthe Illinois Institute of Technology to train graduate engineers to \nlead the development of the gas industry. As national focus shifted to \ngas research and development in the 1970s, the Gas Research Institute \ntook shape to focus on natural gas supply, transportation, \ndistribution, and utilization. In 2000, these two renowned programs \nunited under the GTI umbrella where they continue to build off of past \nsuccesses as a premier research, development, and training organization \nserving the global natural gas and energy markets.\n  GTI's most profound successes are known across the globe. From \ncatalyzing the U.S. shale gas revolution through innovative research \nand development in the 1980s and 1990s, to helping to put the first \nhydrogen fuel cell bus on the road in 2006, to its 65 patents on high-\nefficiency, low-NOX burners and systems, GTI has a strong \nindustry reputation for innovation and conducting the work necessary to \nensure our domestic supplies are utilized to their full potential while \nnational and global priorities continue to shift. Our Nation continues \nto benefit from GTI's expertise in developing gas distribution \ntechnologies and reducing energy delivery costs, as well as innovations \nin the detection, quantification, and mitigation of methane emissions \nfrom the natural gas sector. Its current efforts with the hydraulic \nfracturing test site will continue this tradition, improving air and \nwater quality by increasing environmentally sustainable extraction \nmethods.\n  I congratulate and commend GTI for their continued commitment to \nproviding technology-based solutions that expand U.S. energy production \nand foster economic growth, while also minimizing impacts to the \nenvironment. GTI's efforts in the past, present, and future are key to \nboosting American competitiveness, and I look forward to celebrating \nfuture milestones.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/senate-section/article/S3285-4"}, {"day": "26", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RECOGNIZING THE HARTFORD STEAM BOILER INSPECTION AND INSURANCE COMPANY\n\n Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, 150 years ago, as the United States \nand the world advanced out of the industrial revolution, several young \nbusinessmen formed the Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance \nCompany, HSB, in Hartford, CT. I am proud to represent this company and \nwant to congratulate HSB on its 150th anniversary for its vital \ncontribution to the economy of Connecticut, as well as the rest of the \nNation.\n  During the industrial revolution in the mid-to-late 19th century, \nsteam boilers were used to drive industrial machinery, locomotives, and \nsteamboats. Steam-powered engines allowed for the rapid growth and \nexpansion of industry in the United States; these engines enabled the \neffective transportation of goods across the country. Steam power also \npermitted factories in Connecticut to produce and market goods more \nefficiently than ever before.\n  The tremendous benefits provided by steam engines and boilers, \nhowever, came with considerable risks. During the 1850s, boiler \nexplosions occurred at an estimated rate of once every 4 days. \nBelieving that better materials, better design, and regular inspections \ncould reduce the number of dangerous boiler explosions, in 1857, \nseveral Hartford entrepreneurs started ``the Polytechnic Club,'' as a \nmeans to discuss practical changes to boilers that could mitigate the \nchances of worker injury and death. These discussions helped lead to \nthe formation of HSB.\n  The Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company was \nofficially founded in 1866 on the premise that quality boiler \ninspections would enhance industrial safety, and that insurance \nprovides a valuable financial incentive to ensure businesses conduct \nthese inspections. From its founding, HSB's primary goals have been to \nimprove safety and prevent losses for industrial businesses.\n  Today HSB continues to set the standard for equipment breakdown \ninsurance, as well as a variety of other insurance products. I am proud \nto honor this company's long and distinguished role in America's \nindustrial economy. Congratulations to the Hartford Steam Boiler \nInspection and Insurance Company, and best of luck in the years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/senate-section/article/S3286-1"}, {"day": "26", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING THE COLUMBUS ASIAN FESTIVAL\n\n Mr. PORTMAN.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana memorializing the United States \n     Congress to take such actions as are necessary to treat \n     mineral and gas production in the Gulf Coastal states in a \n     manner that is at least equal to onshore oil, gas, and coal \n     production in interior states for revenue purposes; and to \n     rectify the revenue sharing inequities between coastal and \n     interior energy producing states in order to address the \n     nationally significant crisis of wetland loss in the state of \n     Louisiana; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 66\n\n       Whereas, since 1920, interior states have been allowed to \n     keep fifty percent of the oil, gas, and coal production \n     revenues generated in their states from mineral production on \n     federal lands within their borders, including royalties, \n     severance taxes, and bonuses; and\n       Whereas, coastal states with onshore and offshore oil and \n     gas production face inequities under the federal energy \n     policies because those coastal states have not been party to \n     this same level of revenue sharing partnership with the \n     federal government; and\n       Whereas, coastal energy producing states have a limited \n     partnership with the federal government that provides for \n     them to retain very little revenue generated from their \n     offshore energy production, energy that is produced for use \n     throughout the nation; and\n       Whereas, in 2006 congress passed the Gulf of Mexico Energy \n     Security Act (GOMESA) that will fully go into effect in 2017; \n     an act that calls for a sharing of thirty-seven and five \n     tenths percent of coastal production revenues with four gulf \n     states with a cap of five hundred million dollars per year; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Fixing America's Inequities with Revenues \n     (FAIR) Act would have addressed the inequity suffered by \n     coastal oil and gas producing states by accelerating the \n     implementation of GOMESA as well as by gradually lifting all \n     revenue sharing caps but the legislation died with the close \n     of the previous congress; and\n       Whereas, with the state and its offshore waters taken \n     alone, Louisiana is the ninth largest producer of oil in the \n     United States in 2014 while including offshore oil from \n     federal waters, it was the second largest oil producer in the \n     country; and when taken alone Louisiana was the fourth \n     largest producer of gas in the United States in 2013 while \n     including the Gulf of Mexico waters, it was the second \n     largest producer in the United States; and\n       Whereas, with nineteen operating refineries in the state, \n     Louisiana was second only to Texas as of January 2014 in both \n     total and operating refinery capacity, accounting for nearly \n     one-fifth of the nation's total refining capacity; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana's contributions to the United States \n     Strategic Petroleum Reserve with two facilities located in \n     the state consisting of twenty-nine caverns capable of \n     holding nearly three hundred million barrels of crude oil; \n     and\n       Whereas, with three onshore liquified natural gas \n     facilities, more than any other state in the country, and the \n     Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, the nation's only deepwater oil \n     port, Louisiana plays an essential role in the movement of \n     natural gas from the United States Gulf Coast region to \n     markets throughout the country; and\n       Whereas, it is apparent that Louisiana plays an essential \n     role in supplying the nation with energy and it is vital to \n     the security of our nation's energy supply, roles that should \n     be recognized and compensated at an appropriate revenue \n     sharing level; and\n       Whereas, the majority of the oil and gas production from \n     the Gulf of Mexico enters the United States through coastal \n     Louisiana with all of the infrastructure necessary to receive \n     and transport such production, infrastructure that has for \n     many decades damaged the coastal areas of Louisiana, an \n     impact that should be compensated through appropriate revenue \n     sharing with the federal government; and\n       Whereas, because Louisiana is losing more coastal wetlands \n     than any other state in the country, in 2006 the people of \n     Louisiana overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment \n     dedicating revenues received from Outer Continental Shelf oil \n     and gas activity to the Coastal Protection and Restoration \n     Fund for the purposes of coastal protection, including \n     conservation, coastal restoration, hurricane protection, and \n     infrastructure directly impacted by coastal wetland losses; \n     and\n       Whereas, the state of Louisiana has developed a science-\n     based ``Comprehensive Master Plan for a Sustainable Coast'' \n     which identifies and prioritizes the most efficient and \n     effective projects in order to meet the state's critical \n     coastal protection and restoration needs; and\n       Whereas, the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority \n     is making great progress implementing the projects in the \n     ``Comprehensive Master Plan for a Sustainable Coast'' with \n     all available funding, projects that are essential to the \n     protection of the infrastructure that is critical to the \n     energy needs of the United States; and\n       Whereas, in order to properly compensate the coastal states \n     for the infrastructure demands that result from production of \n     energy and fuels that heat and cool the nation's homes, \n     offices, and businesses and fuel the nation's transportation \n     needs, revenue sharing for coastal states needs to be at the \n     same rate as interior states that produce oil, gas, and coal: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to treat mineral and gas production in the \n     Gulf Coastal states in a manner that is at least equal to \n     onshore oil, gas, and coal production in interior states for \n     revenue purposes; and to rectify the revenue sharing \n     inequities between coastal and interior energy producing \n     states in order to address the nationally significant crisis \n     of wetland loss in the state of Louisiana; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-172. A concurrent resolution adopted by the General \n     Assembly of the State of Ohio urging the United States \n     Congress to increase NIH funding levels for research in and \n     development of the closed-loop system and islet cell \n     transplantation so that those who are suffering from type 1 \n     diabetes will have expedited access to such technology; to \n     the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                 Senate Concurrent Resolution Number 2\n\n       Whereas, More than one million Americans have been \n     diagnosed with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, also \n     known as type 1 diabetes; and\n       Whereas, Type 1 diabetes is a disease that frequently \n     strikes children suddenly, makes them dependent on insulin \n     for life, and carries the constant threat of life-threatening \n     complications; and\n       Whereas, The number of diagnoses of type 1 diabetes is \n     growing at an alarming rate; and\n\n[[Page S3290]]\n\n       Whereas, The cost of type 1 diabetes, including medical \n     expenses and lost productivity, is billions of dollars per \n     year; and\n       Whereas, Type 1 diabetes is a leading cause of blindness, \n     kidney failure, amputations, heart disease, and death; and\n       Whereas, Medical and technological advances in the \n     development of the closed-loop insulin delivery system, or \n     ``artificial pancrease,'' and in the development of islet \n     cell transplantation therapy have created meaningful and \n     realistic pathways to a cure of type 1 diabetes; and\n       Whereas, Adequate federal funding for research and \n     development involving the closed-loop system and islet cell \n     transplantation will result in positive medical outcomes for \n     millions of americans who are affected by type 1 diabetes \n     and, thereby, ameliorate widespread human suffering and \n     preserve billions of dollars in taxpayer funds; and\n       Whereas, Current levels of funding designated for the \n     efforts of The National Institutes of Health (NIH) in \n     advancing the technology associated with the closed-loop \n     system and islet cell transplantation are inadequate, and an \n     increase in funding for NIH's efforts will expedite the \n     refining of and access to these important medical treatments \n     and procedures: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That we, the members of the 131st general \n     assembly of the state of Ohio, in adopting this resolution, \n     urge the Congress of the United States to increase NIH \n     funding levels for research in and development of the closed-\n     loop system and islet cell transplantation so that those who \n     are suffering from type i diabetes will have expedited access \n     to such technology, thus enhancing health care while saving \n     billions of dollars in health care costs and lost \n     productivity; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the clerk of the Senate transmit duly \n     authenticated copies of this resolution to the President Pro \n     Tempore and Secretary of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker and Clerk of the United States House of \n     Representatives, each member of the Ohio Congressional \n     delegation, and the news media of Ohio.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-173. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Illinois urging the President \n     of the United States to select and nominate a candidate to be \n     an Associate Justice for the Supreme Court of the United \n     States; urging the United States Senate Judiciary Committee \n     to promptly schedule confirmations hearings for the \n     President's nominee followed by a recorded vote recommending \n     confirmation; and urging the full Senate to vote to confirm \n     such nomination; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                       House Resolution No. 1022\n\n       Whereas, Article III, Section I of the United States \n     Constitution vests judicial authority ``in one supreme Court, \n     and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to \n     time ordain and establish''; and\n       Whereas, The United States Congress passed the Judiciary \n     Act of 1789, fixing the number of Supreme Court justices at \n     6; and\n       Whereas, In an effort to avoid an evenly divided Court, the \n     Judiciary Act of 1869 increased membership on the Court to \n     one Chief Justice, and 8 Associate Justices; that number has \n     remained unchanged; and\n       Whereas, Antonin Scalia became an Associate Justice on the \n     Supreme Court after being nominated by President Ronald \n     Reagan in 1986; Justice Scalia was confirmed by the United \n     States Senate 98-0; he was sworn in on September 26, 1986; \n     and\n       Whereas, The death of Justice Scalia has effectively placed \n     the Court in ideological gridlock with respect to liberal and \n     conservative interpretations of the Constitution; and\n       Whereas, The Court now consists of 4 members appointed by \n     Republican presidents: Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice \n     Anthony Kennedy, Justice Clarence Thomas, and Justice Samuel \n     Alito; and 4 members appointed by Democratic presidents: \n     Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Justice Stephen Breyer, Justice \n     Sonia Sotomayor, and Justice Elena Kagan; and\n       Whereas, A Supreme Court term begins on the first Monday in \n     October, and continues until late June or early July of the \n     following year; the final day of the 2016 term will be June \n     26, 2016; the Court continues to hear oral arguments until \n     April 26, 2016; and\n       Whereas, There are currently 74 cases on the Court docket; \n     with the absence of Justice Scalia, many of those cases could \n     be decided 4-4; in that event, the decisions of the lower \n     courts will stand; and\n       Whereas, In its current term, the Court will hear cases on \n     a variety of issues affecting millions of Americans, such as \n     affirmative action, immigration, reproductive rights, \n     redistricting, and labor practices; and\n       Whereas, Pursuant to Article II, Section 1 of the \n     Constitution, Barack Obama was elected President of the \n     United States in 2008, and again in 2012; his presidency will \n     end on January 20, 2017; and\n       Whereas, Article II, Section II of the Constitution \n     provides that the President ``shall nominate'' judges of the \n     Supreme Court with the ``Advice and Consent of the Senate''; \n     and\n       Whereas, The Democratic and Republican Presidential \n     nominating conventions will take place in July of 2016; the \n     Presidential election will take place on November 8, 2016; a \n     new President will not be inaugurated until January 20, 2017, \n     at which time that President will have the power to nominate \n     judges; however, until that time, the power to nominate \n     remains with President Barack Obama; and\n       Whereas, In 1916, Justice Louis Brandeis was confirmed as \n     the 67th Associate Justice of the Supreme Court after 4 \n     months of scrutiny, representing the longest confirmation \n     process in American history; during which time, the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee held the first public hearings on the \n     nomination of a justice; he was sworn in on June 6, 1916, a \n     presidential election year: and\n       Whereas, Justice Anthony Kennedy is the most senior member \n     of the Court today; he was nominated by President Ronald \n     Reagan on November 30, 1987; he was confirmed unanimously by \n     a Senate controlled by Democrats on February 3, 1988 and was \n     sworn in on February 18, 1988, during the last year of \n     Reagan's presidency; and\n       Whereas, Additional Supreme Court justices nominated and \n     confirmed during the final year of a presidency include: \n     Oliver Ellsworth, Samuel Chase, William Johnson, Philip \n     Barbour, Roger Taney, Melville Fuller, Lucius Lamar, George \n     Shiras. Mahlon Pitney, John Clarke, Benjamin Cardozo, and \n     Frank Murphy: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the House of Representatives of the Ninety-\n     Ninth General Asssembly of the State of Illinois, That we \n     urge President Barack Obama to select and nominate a \n     candidate to be an Associate Justice for the U.S Supreme \n     Court in a timely manner and that the nominee both liberalize \n     and truly diversify the Court; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we urge the Judiciary Committee of the \n     United States Senate to promptly schedule confirmation \n     hearings for the President's nominee followed by a recorded \n     vote recommending confirmation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we urge the full Senate to vote to confirm \n     such nomination; and be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution be \n     delivered to President of the United States, Barack Obama; \n     Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley; \n     Vice-President, Joe Biden; Chief Justice of the Supreme \n     Court, John Roberts: and Senators Dick Durbin and Mark Kirk \n     of Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/senate-section/article/S3289-1"}, {"day": "26", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. JOHNSON, from the Committee on Homeland Security and \n     Governmental Affairs, with an amendment in the nature of a \n     substitute and an amendment to the title:\n       S. 2127.

S3294-S3296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Ms. CANTWELL (for herself, Mr. Booker, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 2997. A bill to direct the Federal Communications Commission to \ncommence proceedings related to the resiliency of critical \ntelecommunications networks during times of emergency, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I am pleased to have worked with Senator \nCantwell and Senator Schumer to introduce the SANDy Act today which \nwould provide much needed certainty and resiliency to our \ncommunications networks during times of natural disaster or emergency.\n  Severe weather and emergencies can have devastating effects on \ncommunities, as New Jersey knows all too well. In the aftermath of \nSuperstorm Sandy, we experienced loss in our communications networks \nincluding phone and Internet services. Natural disasters are one of the \nmost important times to maintain access to 9-1-1 in order to obtain \nlifesaving services.\n  Just this week, this legislation passed the House with overwhelming \nbipartisan support, including from the New Jersey delegation led by \nCongressman Pallone's efforts. I hope the Senate will now turn its \nattention to this important matter and move this initiative forward to \nthe benefit of New Jerseyans and people across the country.\n  I am further pleased that phone service providers entered into a \nvoluntary agreement last month in order to provide service to consumers \nduring times of emergency, regardless of the network the consumer \nsubscribes to in that area.\n  The SANDy Act expresses the Sense of Congress that this agreement \nshould continue to be adhered to in order to best serve 9-1-1 \nprofessionals, first responders, and local governments in accessing \ncommunications services during times of emergency.\n  Further, the legislation collects additional data on network security \nduring times of disaster and the resiliency of telecommunications \nnetworks power utility during times of emergency. With additional \ninformation and data, we can better prepare for disasters and ensure \nour networks operate at the best of their ability when severe storms \nstrike.\n  Finally, the legislation provides authority to FEMA to reimburse \ncosts associated with restoring and repairing critical communications \nservices to first responders and communities.\n\n[[Page S3295]]\n\n  The SANDy Act is an important step toward better protecting and \npreserving vital communications networks when disaster strikes. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DAINES:\n  S. 3014.

Res. 479\n\n       Whereas the United States and the Democratic Republic of \n     the Congo (``DRC'') have a history of partnership grounded in \n     economic investment and mutual interests in security and \n     stability, and marked by efforts to address the protracted \n     humanitarian crisis facing the country;\n       Whereas in 2006, DRC adopted a new constitution with a \n     provision limiting the President to 2 consecutive terms;\n       Whereas in 2006, Joseph Kabila was elected President in \n     what was widely viewed as a free and fair election;\n       Whereas many respected international observers concluded \n     that President Kabila's reelection in 2011 was deeply flawed;\n       Whereas President Kabila's second term and constitutional \n     mandate to serve as President of DRC ends on December 19, \n     2016;\n       Whereas, for the past 2 years, President Kabila has used \n     administrative and technical means to try to delay the \n     presidential election, including--\n       (1) by trying unsuccessfully to persuade the Parliament of \n     DRC--\n       (A) to change the Constitution of DRC to allow him to run \n     for a third term; and\n       (B) to pass a law requiring a multiyear census in advance \n     of the presidential election, which was widely seen as an \n     attempt to delay elections to allow President Kabila to \n     remain in power.\n       (2) by failing to pass timely election laws or release \n     authorized election funding to the Independent National \n     Elections Commission;\n       (3) by declaring that it will take the Government of DRC \n     between 16 and 18 months to revise the voter rolls; and\n       (4) by enforcing nondemocratic and nonparticipatory \n     restrictions that limit the ability of the political \n     opposition to participate in the political process and the \n     role of civil society in DRC;\n       Whereas mass popular demonstrations convinced President \n     Kabila to drop efforts to pass a law requiring a census in \n     January 2015, but not before security forces had killed at \n     least 36 protesters and jailed hundreds more;\n       Whereas Congolese security and intelligence officials have \n     arrested, harassed, and detained peaceful activists, members \n     of civil society, political leaders, and others who oppose \n     President Kabila's effort to unconstitutionally remain in \n     power after the expiration of his current term;\n       Whereas President Obama spoke with President Kabila on \n     March 15, 2015, and ``emphasized the importance of timely, \n     credible, and peaceful elections that respect the \n     Constitution of DRC and protect the rights of all DRC \n     citizens'';\n       Whereas observers view President Kabila's renewed call for \n     a National Dialogue as another attempt to delay the elections \n     and distract from the constitutional requirement for a \n     democratic succession of the presidency later this year;\n       Whereas international and domestic human rights groups have \n     consistently reported on the worsening of the human rights \n     situation in DRC, including--\n       (1) the use of excessive force by security forces against \n     peaceful demonstrators; and\n       (2) an increase in politically motivated trials;\n       Whereas the United Nations Organization Stabilization \n     Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has \n     registered more than 312 human rights violations committed by \n     officials of the Government of DRC between January 2015 and \n     January 2016, most of which targeted political opponents, \n     civil society, and journalists;\n       Whereas the Government of DRC issued an arrest warrant for \n     what appear to be politically motivated charges against a \n     leading opposition figure the week after he declared his \n     intent to run for President, and other political activists \n     remain in jail;\n       Whereas on March 30, 2016, the United Nations Security \n     Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2277, which--\n       (1) expresses deep concern with--\n       (A) ``the delays in the preparation of the presidential \n     elections'' in DRC; and\n       (B) ``increased restrictions of the political space in the \n     DRC''; and\n       (2) calls for ensuring ``the successful and timely holding \n     of elections, in particular presidential and legislative \n     elections on November 2016, in accordance with the \n     Constitution'':\n       Whereas President Kabila's refusal to publicly affirm that \n     he will step down when his constitutional mandate expires has \n     caused growing political tension, unrest, and violence across \n     DRC: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns--\n       (A) actions by the Government of DRC to subvert the \n     Constitution of DRC and undermine democracy, including the \n     arrest and detention of civil society activists (such as Fred \n     Bauma and Yves Makwambala), the harassment of political \n     opponents, and its efforts to close political space and \n     punish peaceful dissent;\n       (B) the failure of the Government of DRC to take timely \n     necessary measures to organize free and fair national \n     elections; and\n       (C) violations of human rights and international \n     humanitarian law committed by security forces of the \n     Government of DRC;\n       (2) reaffirms its support for democracy and good-governance \n     in sub-Saharan Africa that are free from political repression \n     and abuses of human rights;\n       (3) calls on President Kabila's government--\n       (A) to publicly and unequivocally commit to complete a \n     peaceful transfer of presidential power upon the expiration \n     of his mandate on December 19, 2016; and\n       (B) to adhere to the Constitution of DRC and relinquish \n     power at the end of his term on December 19, 2016;\n       (4) calls on the President of the United States--\n       (A) in coordination with regional and international \n     partners and the United Nations, to impose targeted sanctions \n     on those officials of the Government of DRC who are \n     responsible for violence and human rights violations and \n     undermining the democratic processes or institutions in DRC, \n     including visa bans and asset freezes under Executive Order \n     13671 (79 Fed. Reg. 39947), based on actions that ``undermine \n     democratic processes or institutions,'' or that ``threaten \n     the peace, security, or stability'' of DRC; and\n       (B) to consider lifting the sanctions described in \n     subparagraph (A) when the President determines that--\n       (i) President Kabila--\n\n       (I) has publicly and unequivocally stated that he will \n     complete a peaceful transfer of presidential power upon the \n     expiration of his mandate on December 19, 2016;\n       (II) has made verified progress toward organizing and \n     holding timely free and fair national elections in accordance \n     with the Constitution of DRC; and\n       (III) is respecting human and political rights for the \n     opposition and civil society; or\n\n       (ii) a free and fair presidential election has been held in \n     DRC, in accordance with the Constitution of DRC, and a new \n     President has been sworn into office in DRC;\n       (5) calls on the Secretary of State, the Secretary of \n     Defense, and the Administrator of the United States Agency \n     for International Development to review all United States \n     assistance to DRC, including security and economic \n     assistance, to ensure that such assistance is not being used \n     to support President Kabila's efforts to remain in power; and\n       (6) calls on the Secretary of State and the Administrator \n     of the United States Agency for International Development--\n       (A) to continue providing financial and technical \n     assistance to support the organizing of free, fair, and \n     peaceful national elections, and support the inclusion and \n     civic education of youth, women, and rural populations; and\n       (B) to ensure the continuance of United States assistance \n     that is delivered through national and international \n     nongovernmental organizations, particularly assistance in \n     support of improved democracy and governance and humanitarian \n     needs.\n\n[[Page S3297]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/26/senate-section/article/S3296-1"}, {"day": "26", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 480--SUPPORTING THE DESIGNATION OF MAY 2016 AS \n                        ``MENTAL HEALTH MONTH''\n\n  Mr. CASSIDY (for himself, Mr. Murphy, Mr. Alexander, and Mrs. Murray) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

In 2010, the two nations signed an agreement \n     updating and extending several provisions of the Compact, \n     including an extension of United States financial and program \n     assistance to Palau, and establishing increased post-9/11 \n     immigration protections. However, the United States has not \n     yet approved this Agreement or provided the assistance as \n     called for in the Agreement.\n       (8) Beginning in 2010 and most recently on February 22, \n     2016, the Department of the Interior, the Department of \n     State, and the Department of Defense have sent letters to \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro \n     Tempore of the Senate transmitting the legislation to approve \n     the 2010 United States Palau Agreement including an analysis \n     of the budgetary impact of the legislation.\n       (9) The February 22, 2016, letter concluded, ``Approving \n     the results of the Agreement is important to the national \n     security of the United States, stability in the Western \n     Pacific region, our bilateral relationship with Palau and to \n     the United States' broader strategic interest in the Asia-\n     Pacific region.''\n       (10) On May 20, 2016, the Department of Defense submitted a \n     letter to the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the \n     congressional defense committees in support of including \n     legislation enacting the agreement in the fiscal year 2017 \n     National Defense Authorization Act and concluded that its \n     inclusion advances United States national security objectives \n     in the region.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) to fulfill the promise and commitment of the United \n     States to its ally, the Republic of Palau, and reaffirm this \n     special relationship and strengthen the ability of the United \n     States to defend the homeland, Congress and the President \n     should promptly enact the Compact Review Agreement signed by \n     the United States and Palau in 2010; and\n       (2) Congress and the President should immediately seek a \n     mutually acceptable solution to approving the Compact Review \n     Agreement and ensuring adequate budgetary resources are \n     allocated to meet United States obligations under the Compact \n     through enacting legislation, including through this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4318.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This subtitle may be cited as the ``Open, \n     Public, Electronic, and Necessary Government Data Act'' or \n     the ``OPEN Government Data Act''.\n\n     SEC. 1098. FINDINGS; AGENCY DEFINED.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Federal Government data is a valuable national \n     resource. Managing Federal Government data to make it open, \n     available, discoverable, and useable to the general public, \n     businesses, journalists, academics, and advocates promotes \n     efficiency and effectiveness in Government, creates economic \n     opportunities, promotes scientific discovery, and most \n     importantly, strengthens our democracy.\n       (2) Maximizing the usefulness of Federal Government data \n     that is appropriate for release rests upon making it readily \n     available, discoverable, and usable--in a word: open. \n     Information presumptively should be available to the general \n     public unless the Federal Government reasonably foresees that \n     disclosure could harm a specific, articulable interest\n\n[[Page S3350]]\n\n     protected by law or the Federal Government is otherwise \n     expressly prohibited from releasing such data due to \n     statutory requirements.\n       (3) The Federal Government has the responsibility to be \n     transparent and accountable to its citizens.\n       (4) Data controlled, collected, or created by the Federal \n     Government should be originated, transmitted, and published \n     in modern, open, and electronic format, to be as readily \n     accessible as possible, consistent with data standards imbued \n     with authority under this subtitle and to the extent \n     permitted by law.\n       (5) The effort to inventory Government data will have \n     additional benefits, including identifying opportunities \n     within agencies to reduce waste, increase efficiencies, and \n     save taxpayer dollars. As such, this effort should involve \n     many types of data, including data generated by applications, \n     devices, networks, and equipment, which can be harnessed to \n     improve operations, lower energy consumption, reduce costs, \n     and strengthen security.\n       (6) Communication, commerce, and data transcend national \n     borders.

Mr. President, today the Senate is passing legislation to \nstrengthen an important humanitarian innovation prize created by the \nU.S. Patent and Trademark Office, PTO. Since 2012, the Patents for \nHumanity Award has recognized selected patent holders who use their \ninventions to address humanitarian needs. The legislation the Senate \npassed today will strengthen the award program and encourage innovators \nto continue using their work for humanitarian goals.\n  The innovations that are recognized by the Patents for Humanity Award \nprogram help underserved people throughout the world. Award winners \nhave worked to improve nutrition, provide clean drinking water, fix \nbroken bones in remote hospitals that lack x-ray technology, bring \nsolar-powered energy to villages that are off the power grid, and \ncombat the problem of dangerous counterfeit drugs, among other \nachievements. Winners of the Patents for Humanity Award demonstrate \nthat our patent system does more than drive economic gain for \nindividual companies; it can incentivize research and discoveries that \npromote humanitarian good.\n\n[[Page S3379]]\n\n  Winners of the Patents for Humanity Award receive a one-time \ncertificate to accelerate a process or application at the PTO, as \ndescribed in the program rules. For several years, small businesses and \nglobal health groups have told me that the prize would be more usable, \nparticularly for small business innovators, if the acceleration \ncertificates awarded were transferable to a third party. Award winners \nwho are not able to use the acceleration certificate themselves will be \nable to transfer the certificate to another inventor, including through \nsale, allowing the winner to receive a cash benefit. By making the \ncertificates transferable, we are increasing the value of this \nhumanitarian innovation prize without using a single taxpayer dollar.\n  The thoughtful structure of the Patents for Humanity Award program, \nset forth in its founding documents in the Federal Register, will \nensure that this program remains sustainable and does not unduly burden \nthe PTO or other patent applicants whose applications are pending \nbefore the Office. The award is granted to only a select number of \npatent holders per year--approximately 10 or fewer, with a further 20 \napplications receiving honorable mentions--and the PTO has provided \nclear guidance on the types of processes for which the certificates may \nbe used. Program judges are selected based on recognized subject matter \nexpertise, with clear competition criteria, and rules in place to \nprevent conflicts of interest. These practices and safeguards, which \nare described in detail in the Federal Register at 79 Fed. Reg. 18670 \nand 77 Fed. Reg. 6544, will ensure that the program continues to \noperate appropriately and well.\n  The Patents for Humanity Program Improvement Act is a straightforward \nand bipartisan bill that will strengthen this valuable innovation \nprogram and encourage inventions to be used for humanitarian good. I \nthank other Senators for supporting this bill and urge the House to \npass it without delay.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I further ask unanimous consent that the bill be read \na third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the HELP \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of and the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 466.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 466) recognizing National Foster Care \n     Month as an opportunity to raise awareness about the \n     challenges of children in the foster-care system, and \n     encouraging Congress to implement policy to improve the lives \n     of children in the foster-care system.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the month of May gives us the chance to \nraise awareness about the challenges of children in the foster care \nsystem and to consider ways to improve policies and practices to ensure \nthat children are in safe, loving, and permanent homes. There are \nnearly 415,000 children living in foster care; more than 255,000 \nentered the foster care system in 2014 alone.\n  According to the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting \nSystem, AFCARS, data for fiscal year 2014, the vast majority of foster \nchildren reside with a foster parent: 29 percent live in the foster \nfamily home of a relative, and 46 percent live in the foster family \nhome of a non-relative. The rest live in institutions, 8 percent; \ngroups homes, 6 percent; pre-adoptive homes, 4 percent; trial home \nvisits, 5 percent; supervised independent living, 1 percent; or are \nrunaways, 1 percent.\n  As co-founder and co-chair of the Senate Caucus on Foster Youth, I \nled a bipartisan and bicameral group of colleagues in introducing \nlegislation recognizing May as National Foster Care Month. The \nresolution aims to bring foster care issues to the forefront and \nrecognize the essential role that foster parents, social workers, and \nadvocates have in the lives of children in foster care.\n  While there have been vast improvements over the years, there are \nmany challenges still facing our Nation's youth. These children have \nexperienced abuse or neglect, often both. They can be moved from home \nto home, transferred from one school to the next, and endure trauma and \nmental health challenges. Older foster youth face difficult challenges \nas well. They deal with separation from their parents, educational \ninstability, separation disorders, and depression, as well as challenge \nof transitioning to adulthood on their own. Whereas youth in foster \ncare are much more likely to face educational instability with 65 \npercent of former foster children experiencing at least seven school \nchanges while in care. The number of youth who age out of foster care \nhas steadily increased for the past decade as well.\n  The resolution encourages Congress to implement policy that further \nthe goals of safety and permanency. The resolution currently has 24 co-\nsponsors.\n  Because there are so many issues that affect youth in the foster care \nsystem, it is important that members of Congress understand the \nrealities beyond the beltway. That is why I helped form the Senate \nCaucus on Foster Youth. Our caucus was created to be a clearinghouse \nfor members in the Senate to discuss policy issues that cross many \ncommittee jurisdictions. Our caucus was also created to help generate \nbetter ideas and best practices. We want people to learn from both \nyouth and experts. And we want these ideas to be put into practice. \nToday, 21 Senators are committed members of the Foster Youth Caucus. It \nis a bipartisan caucus that focuses on understanding the challenges \nthat foster youth face and finding solutions that can improve their \nlives.\n  Because of the challenges facing older youth, I held a hearing as \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee to examine the interplay between \nthe foster care system and the juvenile justice system when children \nare involved with both systems. The hearing focused on what data, or \nlack thereof, currently exists about children involved in both systems, \nthe risk factors associated with foster children who become exposed to \nthe juvenile justice system, and how to improve on current best \npractices implemented by the foster care and juvenile justice systems.\n  My goal for holding this hearing was to spark innovative solutions \nand to forge relationships between two distinct groups--the juvenile \njustice system and child welfare system. The experts in these fields \nmust come together to help dually involved youth who are in need of \nservices.\n  It was also a renewed call for Congress to pass the Juvenile Justice \nand Delinquency Prevention Reauthorization Act, which I helped author. \nIf this measure is enacted, States participating in the juvenile \njustice formula grants program couldn't lock up foster care children \nmerely for running away from a foster home. Some of these runaways are \nfleeing abusive situations and detention isn't the right place for \nthem. Our bill, which awaits action by the full Senate, also encourages \nStates\n\n[[Page S3380]]\n\nreceiving juvenile justice formula grants to screen children with \nmental illness or substance abuse issues. Finally, our bill would \nencourage States to rely on policies and practices that reflect the \nmost recent research on what works best with troubled youth.\n  Also during May, the Senate Caucus on Foster Youth held several \nforums to allow foster youth to share their experiences and to hear \nfrom experts about how policies can be improved for children and \nfamilies.\n  The caucus hosted a three-part series of panel discussions on the \nimpact of substance abuse and mental health disorders on children and \nfamilies involved in the child welfare system. We heard directly from \nyouth, learned more about how the opioid epidemic is impacting \nfamilies, how to prevent foster care by working with families, and how \nto better achieve positive outcomes through in-home services. We were \nfortunate to have Iowa's Judge William Owens from the Wapello County \nFamily Drug Court. Judge Owens highlighted how professionals working \nwith child welfare-involved families have changed their practice and \npolicies in his county leading to improved outcomes for families.\n  On the same topic, I co-hosted Dr. Phil who shared his expertise with \npolicymakers in helping families in crisis dealing with substance abuse \nissues. He focused on the link between the current opioid epidemic and \nthe rising number of children placed in foster care.\n  The caucus also partnered with other child welfare organizations on a \nbriefing about foster parent recruitment and retention. The frontline \ncaregivers for hundreds of thousands of children in foster care are \nfoster parents. They provide physical care, emotional support, \neducation advocacy, and, many times, a permanent home and future for \nthese kids. Sometimes they are relatives; sometimes they are complete \nstrangers. But no matter who they are, they are opening their hearts \nand homes to children in need. Because more children are coming into \ncare, we need to do all we can to recruit quality foster parents to \nkeep these kids safe, healthy, in school, and thriving in society.\n  At the end of the month, I helped co-sponsor a briefing to discuss \neffective practices for youth transitioning out of foster care. Because \n26,000 young people leave foster care without a forever family and with \nlimited resources and little support, we need to do better to guide and \nhelp this population successfully navigate the real world of adulthood. \nIt was an opportunity to learn about intensive, individualized and \nclinically focused case management and counseling, which has proven \nresults for long-term success.\n  Finally, I participated in a Senate Finance Committee hearing titled, \n``Can Evidence Based Practices Improve Outcomes for Vulnerable \nIndividuals and Families?'' As a senior member of the Finance Committee \nand the author of many child welfare laws that have gone through that \ncommittee, I was able to listen and ask questions of experts about how \nwe can move to more evidenced-based programs and learn from programs \nthat are successful.\n  The hope for panel discussions and briefings is to find innovative \nsolutions--whether through legislation or awareness and shifts in \npractice.\n  This year, I also urged the Department of Education to work with \nStates to implement a provision I helped pass in the Every Student \nSucceeds Act. This education bill includes new data collection and \nreporting provisions to shine a light on achievement gaps for students \nwho have long been overlooked in federally funded education, including \nhomeless and foster youth.\n  I have also worked on several bills this year to improve foster care \npolicies.\n  The Modernizing the Interstate Placement of Children in Foster Care \nAct would reduce the amount of time it takes to place children by \nincentivizing more States to implement the National Electronic \nInterstate Compact Enterprise, or NEICE system. Six pilot States that \nutilized NEICE, on average, reduced wait times for children by 30 \npercent and anticipate savings of $1.6 million per year in reduced \ncopying, mailing, and administrative costs. Throughout the country, \ncaseworkers often avoid exploring out-of-state placements because of \nthe long delays in processing the paperwork. Our bill gives incentives \nto States to join the NEICE system and streamline the paperwork to make \nfoster care placements and eventual adoption happen faster. The more we \ncan do to give children safe, stable homes, the better. The increased \ndisplacement of kids due to parental substance abuse, including opioid \nabuse, makes this cause especially important.\n  The Protecting Families Affected by Substance Abuse Act would \nreauthorize for 5 years the regional partnership grants that were \ncreated in 2006 when I was chairman of the Finance Committee. While the \noriginal intent of the 2006 grants was to address methamphetamine \nabuse, the scope expanded to other substances as new problems emerged. \nOpioid addiction is a key focus of the new bill, as we have seen the \nhavoc prescription painkillers and heroin continue to have on families \nand communities around the nation. The grants support regional \npartnerships for services including early intervention and preventive \nservices; child and family counseling; mental health services; \nparenting skills training; and replication of successful models for \nproviding family-based, comprehensive long-term substance abuse \ntreatment services.\n  Supporting Foster Youth Who Age Out--this bill would allow States to \nuse these Federal dollars for foster youth services up to age 23 and \nfurther help those who age out of care with more opportunities to \ntransition to adulthood. It also would allow greater flexibility for \nStates to use their funds in a manner that best benefits the youth \npopulation they serve. The legislation builds on the Chafee Foster Care \nIndependence Program, created by then-Senator John Chafee in 1999 to \nbetter support youth who age out of the foster care system at the age \nof 18. The program provides financial support for youth who are \ntransitioning to adulthood with the goal to make them self-sufficient.\n  For years, I have tried to call attention to the issues facing foster \ncare youth, which consists of more than 415,000 children nationwide, \nmore than 6,000 of whom live with one of Iowa's approximately 2,700 \nfoster families. As founder and co-chair of the Senate Caucus on Foster \nYouth, I often have the opportunity to hear firsthand from kids growing \nup in foster care. Foster youth long to be heard. These children need \npermanency and a loving family, not to be shuffled around from home to \nhome. They tell me that important improvements have recently been made, \nbut there are still gaps in services that could be solved with a \ncombination of policy changes and citizen involvement.\n  While this population of youth deserves year-round attention, we \nhonor them this month. This is an especially important time to have \ndiscussions about how we can improve their lives and strengthen their \nfamilies. It is important, too, that we remember all of the other \nindividuals involved in helping children who are in the foster care \nsystem--including caseworkers, social workers, guardians, child welfare \nadvocates, and foster families.\n  Our work on this issue will continue.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res 481, submitted earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 481) recognizing the significance of \n     May 2016 as Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month and as an \n     important time to celebrate the significant contributions of \n     Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders to the history of the \n     United States.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to join in the recognition \nand celebration of the month of May as Asian Pacific American Heritage \nMonth. This month, we celebrate the many contributions Asian American \nand Pacific Islanders, AAPI, have made to the United States and their \ncultures, traditions, and history. In 1978, Congress passed a joint \ncongressional resolution to commemorate Asian/Pacific American Heritage \nWeek during the first week of May in 1979, and in 1992, Congress passed \nlegislation that annually designated May as Asian Pacific American \nHeritage Month.\n  Congress chose May because two important anniversaries occurred \nduring this month. On May 7, 1843, the first Japanese immigrants \narrived in America. May 10 is the anniversary of the transcontinental \nrailroad's completion in 1869. Many of the workers who laid the tracks \nfor this railroad were Chinese immigrants. These two dates only begin \nto describe the innumerable contributions that Asian Americans and \nPacific Islanders have made to this country. The AAPI community of over \n18 million draws from a variety of distinct cultures, each of which has \nenriched American society and challenged our Nation to aspire to be \nbetter. This community comprises 45 distinct ethnicities and more than \n100 different languages. Through hard work and a steadfast commitment \nto American ideals, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific \nIslanders have strengthened this country as leaders, laborers, \nactivists, artists, and trailblazers.\n  I remember our beloved former colleague, Senator Daniel K. Inouye, \nwho lost an arm defending America during World War II as part of the \n``Go for Broke'' 442nd Regiment, which was composed almost entirely of \nAmerican soldiers of Japanese ancestry and became the most decorated \nunit for its size and length of service in the history of American \nwarfare. In Maryland, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have made \nsignificant contributions and serve our Nation with distinction. The \nHonorable Theodore D. Chuang of Bethesda, for example, is a U.S. \nDistrict Judge of the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland \nand is the first Asian American judge in history to sit on the Federal \nbench in Maryland or the Fourth Circuit, which includes Maryland and \nfour other States.\n  As the former chairman and current ranking member of the Senate \nForeign Relations Subcommittee on East Asia and the Pacific, I have \nbeen closely engaged on issues affecting the Asia-Pacific American \ncommunity and their families abroad. I will continue to work on behalf \nof this community, especially on issues such as human rights, security, \nand peace. I have, therefore, cosponsored two resolutions related to \nAsian Pacific Heritage Month. One resolution--the one the Senate is \ncurrently considering--recognizes the accomplishments of Asian American \nand Pacific Islanders and May 2016 as Asian Pacific American Heritage \nMonth. The other resolution notes the historical significance of \nJapanese internment and its end. I support this resolution, too, \nbecause as we honor Asian Americans, we must remember and acknowledge \nthat dark stain on our history as we redouble our efforts to ensure \nthat the United States of America remains a beacon of tolerance and \ninclusion. Discrimination based on the actual or perceived race, \nethnicity, national origin, religion, gender, or sexual orientation of \npeople is anathema to the values we cherish as Americans.\n  Once again, I would like to thank Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, \nand Pacific Islander Americans in Maryland and all around the country \nfor their tremendous contributions to and sacrifices for our Nation.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.
