Mr. President, my friend the Republican leader will be here \nshortly. I have something to do downtown, so I will have to leave. I \ncertainly do not want to get ahead of him. I know he is going to say \nsomething because we have talked about Chief of Police Kim Dine, who \nhas retired.\n  I want to join with the Republican leader in recognizing the work of \nthe U.S. Capitol Police Chief, Kim Dine. He spent his life in law \nenforcement. He spent his entire professional life serving and \nprotecting the people of Washington, DC, and the entire metro area. He \nstarted as a young officer here in Washington 41 years ago and over the \ncourse of three decades has moved up the ranks of the Metropolitan \nPolice Department, becoming assistant chief of police.\n  In 2002, he was selected to serve as chief of police of Frederick, \nMD. He served the people of Maryland with distinction for 10 years.\n  In 2012, our Sergeant at Arms asked Chief Dine to come back to \nWashington, this time as Chief of the U.S. Capitol Police Department. \nWe are very fortunate that took place.\n  Chief Dine helped oversee President Obama's 2013 inauguration, and \nsince then it has been event after big event: four State of the Union \nAddresses, Memorial Day and Fourth of July concerts, and, of course, \nPope Francis's historic visit here last year. During all of those \nproceedings, it was his obligation to protect the people who are \nvisiting and to protect the people who work within this beautiful \nCapitol Complex. At every one of those events, Chief Dine and his \ndepartment did a superb job protecting 30,000 people--Senators, \nCongressmen, and staff--who are in the Capitol Complex virtually every \nday. And that doesn't include the visitors who come here.\n  So now, as the Chief embarks upon a well-deserved retirement, we \nthank him for his service. We thank his wife Robin and their two \ndaughters for sharing their husband and father with us the past few \nyears. I am sure this man was as taken care of at home as he has taken \ncare of all of us in the metropolitan area. I hope his family takes \nsatisfaction in the outstanding work he has rendered to the American \npeople.\n  I thank you very much, Chief. We wish you nothing but the best.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this weekend U.S. Capitol Police Chief \nKim Dine will retire his badge and say goodbye to the Senate after \nseveral decades of law enforcement service, including more than three \nright here in the Capitol.\n  Chief Dine was police chief in a nearby Maryland suburb when he first \ncame to this position in December of 2012. You could say the \nappointment was a bit of a homecoming for him given that Chief Dine \nbegan his more than 40 years in law enforcement with the DC \nMetropolitan Police Department. He served there for 27 years and rose \nthrough the ranks, eventually becoming assistant chief of police.\n  I know it is never easy to leave the Capitol, but you have to imagine \nChief Dine has a lot to look forward to in retirement. After all, this \nis a guy who has been known to get into the office before the sun rises \nand leave after it sets. Most would need some rest after so many years \nof that kind of schedule.\n  So here is what we would like to say: The Senate appreciates Chief \nDine's willingness to serve our country. And after nearly four decades \nin law enforcement, we wish him all the best in his retirement.\n\n[[Page S1554]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/senate-section/article/S1554-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY AND SUBPOENA ENFORCEMENT RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me state an obvious point. When it \ncomes to filling the current Supreme Court vacancy--which could \nfundamentally alter the direction of the Court for a generation--\nRepublicans and Democrats simply disagree. We simply disagree. \nRepublicans think the people deserve a voice in this critical decision; \nthe President does not. So we disagree in this instance, and as a \nresult, we logically act as a check-and-balance.\n  There is no reason one area of disagreement should stop us from \nlooking for other areas of agreement, though. We will continue our work \nin the Senate as the American people make their voices heard in this \nimportant national conversation. For instance, we will address another \nvery important issue today, which I would like to talk about now.\n  Senator Portman and Senator McCaskill are the top Republican and top \nDemocrat on the Homeland Security Committee's Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations. Over the past year, they have worked together in a \nbipartisan way to examine human trafficking. Their probe has revealed \nhow trafficking has flourished in the age of the Internet. It has also \nrevealed how many cases of sex trafficking, including cases involving \nchildren, have been linked to one Web site in particular: backpage.com.\n  One national group who tracks the issue has told the subcommittee \nthis: Nearly three-quarters of all suspected child sex trafficking \nreports it receives from the public through its tip line have a \nconnection to backpage.\n  Chairman Portman and Ranking Member McCaskill have wanted to do \nsomething about this. They know they have to keep investigating. So \nthey issued a subpoena to backpage. They wanted documents about the \ncompany's business practices. They wanted to know how it screens \nadvertisements for warning signs of trafficking. As the leaders of the \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations, they had every right to make \nthese requests in the course of their investigation, but backpage has \nrefused to comply. Does that mean Senators Portman and McCaskill give \nup? Of course not. And we shouldn't, either. They jointly submitted a \nSenate resolution that would hold the company in civil contempt and \nforce it to turn over this required information. This resolution passed \nthrough the committee with unanimous bipartisan support 15 to 0, and \ntoday it can be adopted by the full Senate with overwhelming bipartisan \nsupport too. We will have that opportunity this afternoon. If we do, it \nwill allow the Senate's legal counsel to bring a civil suit in court \nand ask the court to order compliance with the subpoena. That is \ncritical for allowing this bipartisan investigation to move forward.\n  I thank Ranking Member McCaskill for all she has done. I thank \nChairman Portman for all he has done.\n  We saw Senator Portman's great work last week in passing bipartisan \nlegislation to help address America's heroin and opioid crisis, and \nagain today we will see Senator Portman's great work in leading on \nanother important issue and doing so once more in a bipartisan manner.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue).

Mr. President, I rise today to address what I believe is \nthe urgency of the moment, really the test of the time. We have a \nConstitution that was designed for three coequal branches of \ngovernment. We know the importance of each of those branches of \ngovernment and the roles they have are spelled out in the Constitution.\n  A fully functioning Supreme Court--one of the coequal branches--is of \nthe utmost importance to the proper function of our democracy. Justices \ndecide cases that shape the daily lives of all Americans. Even one \nJustice can deeply affect the rights and liberties of the American \npeople for generations to come.\n  Yesterday, the President nominated Chief Judge Merrick Garland to the \nSupreme Court of the United States.\n  A clear and plain reading of the text of the Constitution says \nexplicitly in article II, section 2, that it is the duty of the Senate \nto provide ``advice and consent'' to the President on key nominations, \nparticularly Justices to the Supreme Court.\n  I, along with my 99 colleagues, took an oath of office. We swore to \nsupport and defend the Constitution of the United States and to \nfaithfully discharge the duties of the offices we hold. There was no \naddendum to that oath that excused us from our responsibilities during \na Presidential election year. The people of New Jersey elected me to \nserve a full 6-year term. That means my duties and obligations as a \nSenator--or the duties and obligations of each of the 100 Senators in \nthis body--should not be interrupted by a Presidential year. That is \nespecially true when those duties are explicitly laid out in the \nConstitution and when the duties impact a coequal branch of government, \nsuch as the Supreme Court.\n  I have only served in the Senate since October of 2013. This is my \nfirst Supreme Court nominee to consider, and I look forward to \nthoroughly reviewing Chief Judge Garland's record, to meeting with him \nface to face, and hopefully, I believe rightfully, taking an up-or-down \nvote on his confirmation.\n  That is what all of us swore an oath and signed up to do when a \nvacancy occurs on the Supreme Court. That is the duty the American \npeople expect of us--to abide by the Constitution and provide our \nadvice and consent regarding a Presidential nomination of this \nsignificance--a lifetime appointment--to the Supreme Court, a coequal \nbranch of government.\n  We may not ultimately agree on whether Chief Judge Garland should be \nconfirmed. The Senate can vote no. Senators have that independent \nchoice. It happens almost every day here where we disagree on issues. \nThere is no guarantee in the Constitution that the President's nominee \nshould get confirmed. But we should agree at least to do the job we \nwere elected to do and to allow the confirmation process to move \nforward. That is bigger than any one party.\n  Now, as I understand it, Chief Judge Garland is highly respected, \nexperienced, and is considered by many to be a deliberate jurist whom \nthe Senate overwhelmingly confirmed in 1997 to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia, which is known as the second \nhighest court in the land. His nomination to be an Associate Justice on \nthe Supreme Court is certainly deserving of our consideration.\n  Chief Judge Garland, in fact, has more Federal judiciary experience \nthan any other Supreme Court nominee in history.\n  He currently serves as Chief Judge of the D.C. Circuit Court, a court \nwhere he has served for almost 19 years. Previously, he has served \nunder both Democratic and Republican Presidents at the U.S. Department \nof Justice. He first worked as Deputy Assistant Attorney General for \nthe Criminal Division of DOJ and later served as the Principal \nAssociate Deputy Attorney General. In those posts, he supervised high-\nprofile cases at the Department of Justice such as the prosecution of \nthe Oklahoma City bomber, which ultimately brought Timothy McVeigh to \njustice.\n  To call his qualifications impressive is an understatement. Chief \nJudge Garland has dedicated his life to public\n\n[[Page S1555]]\n\nservice, and his lengthy career reflects his commitment to the high \nideals etched on the Supreme Courts itself, ``Equal justice under \nlaw.''\n\n  He has said, ``The role of the court is to apply the law to the facts \nof the case before it--not to legislate, not to arrogate to itself the \nexecutive power, not to hand down advisory opinions on the issues of \nthe day.'' No wonder he is known in legal circles and around Capitol \nHill for his careful opinions and lack of overt ideological bias.\n  Chief Judge Garland is so well admired, so highly regarded, and so \naccomplished that his appeal transcends the typical partisan divisions \nthat we too often see in Washington.\n  There is no possible justification--based on this nominee's \nreputation, his experience, his dedication, his service, and his work--\nto ignore, blockade, or stonewall Chief Judge Garland's nomination or \nto deny him a hearing and a vote. There is no reason for that.\n  There is certainly no historical or constitutional precedent behind \nsuch a blockade. Since committee hearings began in 1916, every pending \nSupreme Court nominee has received a hearing, except for nine nominees \nwho were confirmed within 11 days. So what is being suggested--to not \neven meet with this nominee or to not even give this nominee a hearing \nin committee--is unprecedented in our Nation's history.\n  The Senate has previously confirmed Supreme Court nominees during a \nPresidential election year. History shows us that the Senate has \npreviously confirmed a Supreme Court nominee at least 17 separate times \nduring the Presidencies of liberals and conservatives, Republicans and \nDemocrats, alike. We have even held confirmation hearings of Supreme \nCourt nominees at least five times in Presidential election years since \nthe hearing process began in 1916.\n  Thus, the excuse that we should not move forward with the \nconfirmation process for Chief Judge Garland because this is a \npolitical election season simply falls flat in the face of our history. \nIn fact, President Franklin D. Roosevelt and, more recently, President \nRonald Reagan saw their Supreme Court nominees confirmed in a \nPresidential election year. Since 1975, it has taken, on average, a \nlittle over 2 months for the full Senate to consider a nomination \nbefore voting.\n  It is only March, so there is plenty of time to consider and confirm \na nominee. There is no reason why Chief Judge Garland cannot be \nconfirmed by even the end of May, given the average time of recent \nSupreme Court confirmations, which is more than ample time for the next \nJustice to be on the Court before the next Supreme Court term begins in \nOctober.\n  When the Supreme Court, that coequal branch of government, has a body \nof work to do, for the Senate to deny this nominee a hearing and a vote \nwe would also deny that coequal branch of government its full, \nfunctioning complement of members. This is a historic time and a \ncritical test for this distinguished body. It is a time that will test \nhow dignified our confirmation process will be for future Supreme Court \nnominees.\n  It provides us an opportunity, amidst all of the partisanship, amidst \nall of the delays that are going on, amidst all of the partisan \nrhetoric, for this body to rise above the fray. We can show that the \nSenate, at its best, treats nominees to our highest court with a level \nof dignity, honor, and respect. Indeed, we can show a greater fidelity \nto the Constitution than to party, and show that we are not susceptible \nto the partisan winds of the time.\n  I believe Chief Judge Merrick Garland deserves a dignified \nconfirmation process. It is up to each and every Senator to decide \nwhether he should be a Supreme Court Justice. For me, this moment in \ntime is not just about the individual; it is also about how we as a \nbody, the Senate, will do business and whether we will do our jobs even \nin Presidential election years.\n  I have heard some of my colleagues say simply: Let the people decide.\n  That sentiment appears to resonate at first, especially since a first \nprinciple of any democracy is to let the voters decide important \nissues. But in reality the people have already decided. They decided \nwhen they voted for each of the 100 Members of this distinguished body, \nwhich tells us that we should do our duty. The people decided when they \nvoted for President Barack Obama for a second consecutive 4-year term. \nThe people did not decide that the President should be a 1-year \nPresident or a 2-year President, but that he should serve a full 4-year \nterm and conduct his duties--his sworn duties--accordingly.\n  No Senator nor the President should shirk from fulfilling their \nConstitutional obligations. The people in this democracy decided when \nthey elected us. We should do our job and give Chief Judge Garland a \nhearing and a vote.\n  Our country has a deep history of fights, which have taken place not \nonly in this body but in our larger democracy. There have been \ndivisions and factions in this country. The Federalist Papers literally \nacknowledged that there would be divisions and fights, but the \nConstitution was designed to call us to a higher purpose, to overcome \nour petty divisions, and to unite us.\n  Our Nation is mighty and strong, and I am so proud of that because, \nas much as our differences matter, we always seem to understand that \nour country matters more. The people who founded our Nation understood \nthat we would have differences of opinion and ideology. They understood \nthat our differences and diversity of thought would make our country \ngreat, but they also understood that, in order for our Nation to \nsucceed and endure, we must be loyal to our ideals and principles. \nThose ideals and principles are enshrined in the Constitution itself \nand reflected in our democracy, and that is what brings us together. In \nfact, it harkens to the very hallmark ideal of our country: ``E \nPluribus Unum,'' out of many, one. It is written into the culture of \nour country. There is an old African saying: If you want to go fast, go \nalone, but if you want to go far, go together.\n  When our Founders drafted the Declaration of Independence, they \nenshrined for all time the ideal that we are individuals endowed by our \ncreator with inalienable rights. The Founders ended that national \ncharter by pledging their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor \nto each other.\n  There has been no greater honor in my life than when I stood in this \nwell before the Vice President and swore my oath to uphold the \nConstitution. In fact, if I ever have to, I will sacrifice myself for \nmy country. These are the ideals and this is the honor that I believe \nhas helped our great country persevere.\n  Now we are faced with a test where two conflicting ideals have been \nput forth: whether a President and a Senate should fulfill their \nobligations all the way to the end of their sworn terms or whether we \nshould begin to truncate the powers of a Presidency and the powers of \nindividual Senators and suspend our constitutional obligations because \nit is an election year. To me, that undermines the purpose and the \nspirit of our constitutional institution.\n  As I said, the nomination of Chief Judge Garland to the Supreme Court \nwill be a greater test for the Senate and the constitutional values we \nhold dear. I worry we will fail this test and descend deeper into the \nkind of divisiveness that undermines our Constitution.\n  I believe this is a time that calls for an honorable stance. We have \nan extremely competent Supreme Court Justice nominee before us. I am \nnot going to blockade his nomination. I am not going to avoid meeting \nwith this distinguished nominee. I hope we will hold hearings and a \nvote so that Senators may decide whether this nominee is worthy of \nsitting on the Nation's highest Court. I hope that each individual \nSenator will honor the precedent that has been continuous for years and \nyears and years and then allow this nominee an up-or-down vote. The \npurpose of our sacred Constitution, as spelled out and written in \narticle II, section 2, is to allow the President to put forward a \nnominee and the Senate to give its ``advice and consent,'' which I \nbelieve means an up-or-down vote on a nomination.\n  Again, we are here because greater Americans made a pledge to each \nother. As different as they were, they came together and wrote a \nConstitution and a Declaration of Independence. We are here because \npeople greater than we are pledged to each other their lives, their \nfortunes, and their sacred honor.\n  Let us harken back to that honor. Let us put forth our sacred honor \nnow\n\n[[Page S1556]]\n\nand not allow this country to lurch even deeper into divisiveness. Let \nus unify and show that, yes, there are differences; yes, there are \ndivisions; yes, there is partisanship, but in the end, we will unite \naround those bonds that hold this Nation together and ensure that our \ndemocracy functions for years, decades, and generations to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds).

Mr. President, I want to take a moment or two to speak \nabout our Nation's veterans. The Presiding Officer and I have the honor \nof serving together on the Senate Veterans' Affair Committee. I take \nthat responsibility--as does the Presiding Officer--very seriously. \nThere is no other group of people that we should hold in higher regard \nthan those who served our country. Today I want to talk about some of \nthe challenges they are facing as a result of our failure to do that.\n  Who would we expect to get the very best health care in our country? \nWe want everyone to have good quality, affordable health care. But of \nall the people we would want to make certain received the health care \nservices they were promised, clearly, it would be those who served our \ncountry--the men and women of our military who are now veterans. They \ndeserve timely, high-quality health care. That is true whether they \nlive in an urban or suburban setting or a rural place like your State \nand mine. There are more than 221,000 veterans who call Kansas home, \nand the vast majority of them live in very rural parts of our State.\n  Before being elected to the Senate, before the honor that Kansans \nallowed me to serve them here in the Senate, I served in the U.S. House \nof Representatives. I represented the First District of Kansas, \ngenerally known in our State as the Big First. That is a congressional \ndistrict larger than the State of Illinois, and there isn't a VA \nhospital in that congressional district. Veterans in this part of \nKansas drive hours on end to get care, or they simply go without it all \ntogether.\n  Over the past year, Congress has repeatedly passed legislation \ndesigned to ease the burden for veterans who are struggling to get \nhealth care from VA facilities in my State and yours and across the \ncountry. In the wake of the scandal, we learned across the country \nabout the false waiting list for veterans. The VA put people on a \nwaiting list that didn't really exist. The scandal across our country \nallowed us, as Members of the Congress and the Senate, to come \ntogether--Republicans and Democrats--and we passed legislation called \nthe Choice Act. This legislation allows veterans who can't get timely \nservice to access that service with a provider outside of the VA.\n\n  Importantly--and what I want to talk about today--the Choice Act says \nthat if you are a veteran who lives more than 40 miles from a VA \nfacility, then at your request you can have those services provided by \na local hometown physician, be admitted to your hometown hospital, see \nyour local optometrist, and be treated by your local physical therapist \nor chiropractor. All of those things make a lot of sense for the \nveterans who live in the places where I come from.\n  In the process of doing that, part of the goal was to ease the \nburden, in addition to providing quality and timely services, for those \nwho live in rural places. Part of the theory--and I think rightly so--\nin passage of the Choice Act was to lift a bit of the burden on the VA \noff of the VA. It has been difficult for them to have the necessary \nhealth care providers to meet the needs of veterans. So we began \nproviding services in the community. And we are also speeding up the \nprocess by which a veteran who still goes to a VA hospital or still \ngoes to a VA clinic gets services in a more timely and effective way.\n  This past July Congress passed legislation to amend the Choice Act. \nWe did so because of the number of problems we were encountering as a \nresult of the stories that I heard from my veterans across our State--\nand I know it is true of many Senators, if not all--about problems with \nthe way the Choice Act was being implemented by the Department of \nVeterans Affairs. We amended that legislation to try to make it work \nbetter. In my view, that shouldn't have been necessary. The VA could \nhave solved this challenge on their own but didn't.\n  What it says is that it is not a facility. I have used this example \non the Senate floor before. My hometown is a town of about 1,900 \npeople. It is about 23 miles from the community of Hays--about 20,000 \npeople--where there is an outpatient clinic of the Department of \nVeterans Affairs. The VA was saying that you cannot access the Choice \nAct if you live within 40 miles of a facility, and the problem was that \nthey were saying even if that facility doesn't provide the service the \nveteran needs. So by law, we changed the definition of what a VA \nfacility is, and it said that it is not a VA facility if it is not open \nfull time and doesn't have a full-time physician--a pretty commonsense \nkind of thing that we needed to apparently put in the law to get the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs to implement and to interpret the Choice \nAct in a commonsense way that was designed to meet the needs of \nveterans.\n  Unfortunately, many of our veterans remain unaware of their options. \nI talk to lots of veterans, some who have given up on Choice, some who \ndon't know it is an option, and some who tried and are caught up in a \nbureaucratic system and are trying to get an answer about whether they \nqualify, and even if they do, where they can go and how their bill will \nget paid.\n  Examples in my State: One of the Kansas VA community-based outpatient \nclinics--known as a CBOC--is only open 2 days a month, and it shouldn't \nbe counted as part of the Choice Act, a facility of the Choice Act. \nThere are 9 out of 14 CBOCs in Kansas that do not have a full-time \nmedical doctor. Those nine community-based outpatient clinics should \nnot be counted under Choice. I want to highlight that for veterans from \nKansas and across the country who might happen to hear what I have to \nsay today so they know there are more options than they may realize.\n  Many Kansas veterans choose to live in rural communities. Many of us \noften choose to live in rural communities and raise our families, see \nour grandkids, and more often than not, those communities don't have a \nVA hospital or a clinic to serve those veterans' needs.\n  In townhall meeting after townhall meeting and up and down Main \nStreets of communities in my State, the most common conversation I now \nhave is with veterans who are expressing how the system is failing \nthem, the frustration they are encountering, and that they are not \nseeing the improvements and changes for the betterment of the care they \nare entitled to.\n  As I said earlier, many veterans are so frustrated with the back-and-\nforth they have with the VA and the redtape, they simply give up and \neither go without health care or end up trying to pay for it out of \ntheir own pocket. That is exactly what occurred to Mr. Lamoine Guinn, \nwho is a rural Kansan. Mr. Guinn shared his story with me not to try to \nget me to solve the problem, but he wanted others to know how this \nprogram needed to change so that other veterans would benefit. After a \nyear of dealing with the VA, he decided to simply give up on Choice. I \ndon't want to let that happen. I don't want veterans to give up on \nChoice. I don't want the Department of Veterans Affairs to have the \nexcuse to say Choice is not a viable\n\n[[Page S1557]]\n\nprogram, veterans don't like it, and come back to Congress and tell us \nthat it is no longer needed.\n  If I were home in Kansas, I would explain it this way: Again, my \nhometown, Plainville--population now 1,900--used to have rail service, \nand over time the rail service diminished and became less effective. \nThe rates went up, and fewer people used the rail service, the \nrailroad, to haul grain in particular. Then the railroad could go to \nthe regulators and say: Nobody is using the railroad; can we just \nabandon it?\n  I worry that that kind of attitude and approach could happen with \nthis issue if we don't make certain our veterans see the benefit and \nactually receive the benefits that come from the Choice Act. I don't \nwant to give anybody--the Department of Veterans Affairs or other \nMembers of Congress--the opportunity to say ``The Choice Act doesn't \nmatter. People don't like it. It is not popular. Let's do something \ndifferent'' when the reality is that it would be popular if it were \nworking effectively and in a timely way and veterans were being cared \nfor.\n  Mr. Guinn lives in Oberlin, a small town, a county seat town in \nDecatur County, almost in Nebraska. It is one of those typical Kansas \nsmall farming communities. The closest VA facility to him is actually \nin Grand Island, NE. Although he is a Kansas resident, he is part of \nthe Nebraska VA network because of its proximity to Grand Island. He is \neligible under the Choice Program, and he needed to schedule spinal \nsurgery with the community provider. That is what he wanted to do. So \nthe VA referred him to HealthNet. HealthNet is the organization that \nmanages this program for the Department of Veterans Affairs. HealthNet \nthen referred him to TriWest because he is a Kansas resident. TriWest \ncovers Kansas while HealthNet covers Nebraska. The health care \nproviders were arguing about who is responsible for his care because he \nlives one place and his VA provider is in an adjoining State.\n  My complaint is that it shouldn't matter where he lives. He is stuck \nin a bureaucracy. The burden ought not fall to him to solve all of his \nproblems. The VA ought to step in and solve the problem for him and \ntell him what it is that ought to be done and get him out of the back-\nand-forth between the Nebraska and Kansas networks.\n  He has now gone a year without the surgery. He is going to now drive \nto another VA medical center in Omaha--300 miles one way--so he can get \nthe surgery he is entitled to have by his hometown provider or a \nregional hospital in his area.\n  Many of our veterans--I don't know the age of this particular \nveteran, Mr. Guinn, but many of the veterans who live in those \ncommunities are World War II veterans and now more likely Vietnam \nveterans. The opportunity for them to have family around them, the \nability for them to get long distances is a complete challenge. To have \nto go 300 miles, when the law says that he is a veteran and he, who \nserved our country, is entitled to services at home, is a terrible \nmistake, and it ought to be something that can be sorted out, but every \ntime he has attempted to do that, the burden still rests with him. We \nwant the Department of Veterans Affairs to step in and figure this out \nand get it done and get it done quickly.\n  Another veteran who reached out to my office for assistance was Mr. \nFrancis Wierman, a 92-year-old veteran. He lives in La Crosse. It is a \ncounty seat town of a couple thousand folks. Because of his age, it is \ndifficult for him to travel for his annual physical appointments.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak until I conclude my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MORAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Because of his age--Mr. Wierman needs to travel. It is difficult for \nhim to do it. What he needs is an annual physical. So Mr. Wierman has \nattempted to utilize the Choice Program, and he was told there was no \nflexibility to be seen in La Crosse by a hometown doctor or go to a \nhometown hospital due to his proximity, his location next to an \noutpatient clinic.\n  Mr. Wierman sacrificed for our country, and he deserves to be able to \nreceive his care in his own community given the burden and strain \ntraveling imposes upon him, a veteran of 92 years of age. We need to \nmake certain he receives the care he is entitled to, and we need to \nmake sure the VA is doing what needs to be done to accomplish that.\n  My final example today is Mr. Dabney, who suffers from post-traumatic \nstress. He was also told he was eligible for Choice, so he set up an \nappointment with the local care provider. Despite the OK from the VA \npractitioner about getting care outside of the VA, the handoff got lost \nin the shuffle, and somehow the VA determined that it was Mr. Dabney's \nfault that the paperwork didn't follow him, leaving him with the bill \nfor the services provided by the outside-the-VA practitioner.\n  I shared this case with Secretary McDonald at a hearing the Presiding \nOfficer and I attended several months ago. The conclusion months later \nby the VA was that Mr. Dabney simply didn't understand the Choice Act \nand he should have tried harder to get an official authorization before \nsetting up the appointment; therefore, the bill still rests with him. \nThankfully, the provider, the network TriWest, disagreed, and they are \nnow elevating his case to try to make certain he doesn't have to pay \nthe bill for the services the VA originally authorized him to receive \noutside of the VA.\n  The Choice Act was designed specifically to help these veterans. They \ngave of themselves to serve our country and fought on our behalf, and \nthey deserve the care and respect they should be receiving today from \nor country and its Department of Veterans Affairs. Our country must \nfulfill its commitments to these individuals and to others who provide \nfor those who sacrificed for our Nation, regardless of the community \nthey call home.\n  Last week I joined my Senate colleagues in sponsoring the Veterans \nChoice Improvement Act of 2016. This legislation is designed to fix \nproblems with the original Choice Act that the VA has been unable to \nresolve on their own to make sure these veterans receive what they are \nentitled to. As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I \nlook forward to working with the Presiding Officer and other members \nand with our chairman, Johnny Isakson from Georgia, as well as the \nranking member, Senator Blumenthal, for purposes of making sure that we \nget this right and that we make certain the VA does its job in caring \nfor these men and women who served our country.\n  I will continue to make certain that happens, and I continue to \nexpress my gratitude to those who served our country and renew my \nwillingness and my desire to make sure they receive the health care \nthey are entitled to.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I come to this Chamber for the 131st \ntime to urge this body to break free and wake up to what carbon \npollution is doing to our atmosphere and our oceans.\n  Last week, scientists at NOAA reported that carbon dioxide levels at \ntheir Mauna Loa Observatory jumped in 2015 by the largest year-to-year \nincrease in 56 years of research.\n  Pieter Tans, lead scientist at NOAA, said:\n\n       Carbon dioxide levels are increasing faster than they have \n     in hundreds of thousands of years. It's explosive compared to \n     natural processes.\n\n  We see the effects of this runaway carbon pollution everywhere, in \never-climbing temperatures, in ever-changing weather patterns, and in \never-rising, warming, and acidifying seas. But the Republican-\ncontrolled Congress refuses to take responsible action. They put their \nclimate effort elsewhere, such as attacking former Vice President Al \nGore for raising awareness of the real and looming climate crisis.\n  One Republican colleague has railed against Mr. Gore, calling him \n``the\n\n[[Page S1558]]\n\nworld's first climate billionaire,'' claiming that he is ``drowning in \na sea of his own global warming illusions'' and faulting him for \n``desperately trying to keep global warming alarmism alive today.''\n  Another prominent Republican, this one running for President, \nsuggested ``the Nobel committee should take the Nobel Prize back from \nAl Gore.''\n  Others claim that cold or snowy weather proves Mr. Gore wrong. After \none snow in DC a few years ago, a prominent Republican TV personality \nclaimed the storm ``would seem to contradict Al Gore's hysterical \nglobal warming theories.'' A Senator gloated after that storm, \n``Where's Al Gore now?''\n  Another Senate colleague said while campaigning for President in \nIowa:\n\n       I have to admit, I was really confused. Al Gore told us \n     this wasn't going to happen, but it was cold there.\n\n  These are all profoundly ignorant comments if you know anything about \nclimate change, but they cannot resist. They inhabit what Politico's \nDaniel Lippman and Mike Allen this week called ``a political reality \nindifferent to the exigencies of climate change.''\n  So let's catch up on what Al Gore is up to on climate change. He has \na TED talk on the ted.com Web site, and I highly recommend it. Mr. \nGore's presentation opens with the fact that our atmosphere is not as \nbig as most people think. He shows this picture taken from the \nInternational Space Station to remind us that the atmosphere \nsurrounding our planet is really just a thin shell. It is into this \nthin shell that we continue to spew megatons of heat-trapping carbon \npollution day in and day out. Mr. Gore explains that this thin \natmosphere ``right now is the open sewer for our industrial \ncivilization as it's currently organized.''\n  Here is how he shows our carbon dioxide emission rates through time. \nYou can see the amount of carbon emissions really started to increase \nhere after World War II. Vice President Gore explains: ``[T]he \naccumulated amount of man-made, global warming pollution that is up in \nthe atmosphere now traps as much extra heat energy as would be released \nby 400,000 Hiroshima-class atomic bombs exploding every 24 hours, 365 \ndays a year.''\n  He continues:\n\n       [T]hat is a lot of energy. . . . And all that extra heat \n     energy is heating up . . . the whole earth system.\n\n  The Vice President didn't mention it, but the Associated Press has \nused a similar analogy about the heat from climate change that is going \ninto our oceans, a piece that said: ``Since 1997, Earth's oceans have \nabsorbed man-made heat energy equivalent to a Hiroshima-style bomb \nbeing exploded every second for 75 straight years.''\n  Mr. Gore showed this depiction of average temperatures between 1951 \nand 1980. The blue is cooler-than-average days, the white is average \ndays, and the red is warmer-than-average days. Now we are going to look \nat what happened in the next three decades after this 1951 to 1980 \nperiod. What is going to stay the same is this green line. That will be \nthe constant against which you can see the change. Let's go to the next \nchart.\n  This is 1983 to 1993. You will notice that everything has moved \nagainst the constant. You will also notice down here that a new \ncategory has emerged. This category is extremely hot days.\n  The next chart is 1994 to 2004. Again, the average continues to move \nagainst this green line which is a constant, and now you see that new \ncategory of extremely hot days growing even more.\n  Here is our last decade, 2005 to 2015. What we experience in this \nlast decade has moved completely away from the historic norm indicated \nby that green line, and this extreme temperature, the extremely hot \ndays category, is now bigger than the cooler-than-average category. \nRemember, 1950 to 1980, this category didn't even exist. Now it is \nbigger. Well, it might have existed, but it wasn't visible on the \ngraphs; let me put it that way. Now it is bigger than the cooler-than-\naverage category. Mr. Gore points out that these extremely hot days in \nthe last 10 years ``are 150 times more common on the surface of the \nearth than they were just 30 years ago.'' By the way, we measure this \nstuff. This is not a theory.\n\n  Worldwide, 2015 was the hottest year since we began keeping records \nin 1880, according to NOAA and NASA. That Republican colleague who went \nto Iowa and thought that the cold disproved climate change dismissed \nthat finding as ``pseudo-scientific theory.'' You know what. NASA is \ndriving a rover around on the surface of Mars right now, so I will go \nwith them knowing what they are talking about.\n  The last 5 years have been the warmest 5-year period on record, \naccording to the World Meteorological Organization, and 14 of the 15 \nhottest years ever measured have been in this young century. We are a \nterrestrial species. We live on the land, so naturally we pay more \nattention to the land and not so much to what is happening in our \nwarming and acidifying oceans. This chart shows the oceans absorbing \nover 90 percent of the excess heat trapped in the atmosphere by \ngreenhouse gas emissions. This is the effect of those Hiroshima bomb \nequivalents warming up the oceans that the Associated Press used as \ntheir example.\n  What does all that extra heat mean for the oceans? Well, unless you \nare going to dispute the law of thermal expansion, it means that \nwarming things expand.\n  Last month, a study of tidal flood days along my east coast came out. \nThe author's conclusion? I will quote him:\n\n       It's not the tide. It's not the wind. It's us.\n\n  There is one industry, the insurance industry, that pays serious \nattention to climate change as their losses have been mounting. This is \ninsurance company data from the Insurance Information Institute in \nJanuary of 2006 showing the climate rate of worldwide extreme weather \ncatastrophes. Why? Well, Dr. Kevin Trenberth works at the National \nCenter for Atmospheric Research. He says:\n\n       All storms are different now.\n\n  Do you hear that?\n\n       All storms are different now. There's so much extra energy \n     in the atmosphere, there's so much extra water vapor. Every \n     storm is different now.\n\n  Well, the challenge of climate change is urgent, but Mr. Gore points \nout that we have the understanding and engineering prowess to generate \nenergy from new sources, and we are doing unexpectedly well. Vice \nPresident Gore says:\n\n       The best projections in the world 16 years ago were that by \n     2010, the world would be able to install 30 gigawatts of wind \n     capacity. We beat that mark by 14 and a half times over.\n\n  It is the same story for solar capacity, which is taking off even \nmore quickly than wind. Again quoting Vice President Gore: ``The best \nprojections 14 years ago were that we would install one gigawatt [of \nsolar] per year by 2010.''\n  The Vice President continues:\n\n       When 2010 came around, we beat that mark by 17 times over. \n     Last year, we beat it by 58 times over. This year, we're on \n     track to beat it 68 times over.\n\n  Look at that curve. These innovations helped renewable energy costs \nbecome comparable with fossil fuel power even though, as Vice President \nGore points out, ``fossil energy is now still subsidized at a rate 40 \ntimes larger than renewables.''\n  If you look at what the International Monetary Fund has said about \nthe ``effective subsidy'' of fossil fuel, the subsidy for fossil is \nactually way bigger than that.\n  Most importantly, society is moving. More than 150 major U.S. \ncompanies signed onto the American Business Act on Climate Pledge, \nsupporting a strong outcome in the Paris climate negotiations. Fifty-\nthree percent of young Republican voters--that is, young Republican \nvoters under the age of 35--have said they would describe a climate \nchange denier as ``ignorant,'' ``out-of-touch'' or ``crazy.'' Those are \nnot my words; these are the words in the poll that the young \nRepublicans chose.\n  Despite the recent stay of the administration's Clean Power Plan, 19 \nStates are continuing with EPA to develop compliance strategies for \ntheir economies and their energy sectors. Roughly 6 in 10 Republicans \nand GOP-leaning Independents under age 50 think the government should \nlimit greenhouse gases even if it causes a $20 increase in their \nmonthly bill. So people are moving.\n  Mr. Gore uses a line from the great American poet Wallace \nStevens: ``After the final no, there comes a yes, and on that yes the \nfuture world depends.''\n\n  Well, Al Gore has faced a lot of ``no.'' The fossil fuel industry and \nits minions\n\n[[Page S1559]]\n\nhave mocked and derided him. The climate denial machine keeps working \nits poison. In fact, we just learned that Arch Coal's bankruptcy filing \nshows they were funding an extremist group dedicated to harassing and \nthreatening scientists.\n  As the evidence comes in, as every major science agency and \norganization lines up with all our National Labs and military services \nand our home State universities across the country, it turns out the \nmockers and the deniers were wrong. In fact, in all decency, Al Gore \ndeserves an apology, as do the countless men and women who scrutinize \nthese data, who labor in the real science, and who call us to action. \nIf we continue sleepwalking in Congress, we will need to apologize not \njust to Al Gore but to future generations. We will need to apologize to \nour own grandchildren for our negligence when we knew better.\n  So let us wake up from our fossil fuel-funded make-believe and meet \nour moral obligation.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, this afternoon the Senate will proceed \nto a vote on S. Res. 377, a resolution that would hold backpage.com in \ncontempt of Congress for not complying with an investigation being \nconducted by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. \nUnfortunately, concerns have been raised that the Web site has \nconnections to sex trafficking. Backpage has refused to comply with the \nsubpoena request from the subcommittee. We all know that sex \ntrafficking is a heinous, evil practice, and we should not and we will \nnot tolerate it.\n  In 2012 I sponsored an amendment to the Violence Against Women Act \nthat included a sense of Congress demanding that the owners of \nbackpage.com remove the adult services section of their Web site.\n  Last year this Chamber passed the Justice for Victims of Trafficking \nAct, and it was signed into law by President Obama in the spring. This \nlaw contains language offered by Senator Kirk from Illinois which gives \nlaw enforcement officials additional tools to prosecute individuals \nsuch as those behind backpage.com who knowingly facilitate the sale or \nadvertisement of human trafficking victims online.\n  Today's resolution is another opportunity for the Senate to stand up \nfor the victims of human trafficking.\n  As a reminder, when we debated the Justice for Victims of Trafficking \nAct, we talked about the profile of a typical victim of human \ntrafficking--not that any of them are typical, but on average it is a \ngirl between the ages of 12 and 14. This is a horrific business and \nsordid business, and I encourage every Member to support this \nresolution.\n  I thank the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Portman from Ohio, \nwho has been working tirelessly to highlight this issue and bring it to \nthe Senate's full attention. I am grateful for his bipartisan efforts \nand strong leadership and look forward to voting yes on the resolution \nlater today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/senate-section/article/S1559-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1559-S1560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, on another matter, we all know that \nyesterday President Obama exercised his authority under the U.S. \nConstitution to suggest to the Senate a nominee for the Supreme Court \nof the United States. During the announcement, President Obama spent \ntime talking about the serious task of selecting a Supreme Court \nnominee, particularly one to succeed a legal lion such as Justice \nScalia, whom the President appropriately called one of the most \ninfluential jurists of our time. His point was that the Supreme Court \nof the United States--the highest Court in the land--is an institution \nof unparalleled importance. What happens at the Supreme Court affects \nthe lives of every American. So lifetime appointments to this most \npowerful Court in the land should not be taken lightly. As the \nPresident put it, our Supreme Court Justices have been given the role \nas the ``final arbiters of American law'' for more than 200 years. Of \ncourse, today they consider and answer some of the most pressing and \nchallenging controversies and questions of our time. I agree with what \nthe President said to that point.\n  We all know the Supreme Court is critical to our form of self-\ngovernment and our democracy, and the role it serves is an essential \none. When it plays a role our Founders did not intend, it really \nundermines respect for the rule of law and for the Court as an \ninstitution. So the selection of the next Supreme Court Justice should \nbe handled thoroughly and thoughtfully.\n  I understand the President is taking his authority seriously, but \nunder the same Constitution--the same Constitution that gives the \nPresident the authority to nominate a person to fill this vacancy--that \nsame Constitution has a separate responsibility for the U.S. Senate \neither to grant or to withhold consent to that nomination.\n  With the passing of Justice Scalia, the Senate must exercise its \nconstitutional authority as well. Regardless of how we come down on the \ncontroversy of the day with regard to when this vacancy should be \nfilled, we all take this responsibility seriously, and because of that, \nI believe we should follow the examples set by the minority leader, \nSenator Reid; the senior Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer; and Vice \nPresident Biden when he was chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee--their admonitions made over the years when they were in the \nmajority--and not move forward with the President's nominee at this \ntime.\n  I think it is only a matter of fundamental fairness to apply the same \nrules to the same situation no matter who is in the majority and who is \nin the minority. When they were in the majority, they argued that these \nvacancies should not be filled the last year of the President's term of \noffice. Joe Biden did that in 1992 during the Presidency of George \nHerbert Walker Bush. Senator Reid made that same argument when George \nW. Bush was President of the United States. And in 2007, 18 months \nbefore George W. Bush left office, Senator Schumer, the heir apparent \nto the Democratic leader, said there should be a presumption against \nconfirmation. So it is only fair to play by the same set of rules which \nthey themselves advocated.\n  Based on the conduct, based on the behavior of our Democratic \ncolleagues when they were in the majority--well, first when they were \nin the minority, when they filibustered judges for the first time, and \nlater when they were in the majority, before they saw the majority flip \nto Republicans, the Democratic leader packed the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals by invoking the so-called nuclear option, breaking the Senate \nrules in a raw display of political power in order to pack a court that \nmany people call the second most important court in the land. So this \nlifetime appointment to the Court is a critical check on the executive \nbranch--a check this administration has proved over and over again we \nneed desperately.\n  As others and I pointed out long before the President announced this \nnominee, this nomination will change the ideological balance of the \nSupreme Court for a generation. Justice Scalia served for 30 years. \nBecause of that, because of all of this, I believe the American people \nshould have their voices heard in the selection of the next Supreme \nCourt nominee. We have already undertaken the process here of the \nDemocrats choosing their nominee for President, and Republicans are \ndoing the same. There is simply too much at stake to leave this \ndecision in the hands of a President who is headed out the door--a \ndecision that will have dramatic consequences on the balance of the \nCourt and the direction of the country for a generation to come.\n  I believe we should listen to the voices of the American people and \nallow them to cast their vote and to raise their voice and determine \nwho will make that selection.\n  I know there have been some members of the press who have asked: \nWell, if not now, how about in a lameduck session of the Congress; that \nis, after the election and before the new President is confirmed?\n\n[[Page S1560]]\n\n  I think that is a terrible idea. If you believe in the principle that \nthe American peoples' voice ought to be heard, it makes no sense to \nhave an election and then to do it and not honor their selection.\n  So I know some have expressed some concern about that. I, for one, \nbelieve we ought to be consistent. That consistent position and the \nconsistent principle are that the American people deserve to be heard \nand their voice heeded on who makes that selection to something as \nimportant as filling this vacancy on the Supreme Court.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, yesterday President Obama nominated \nFederal appeals court judge Merrick Garland to fill the vacancy left by \nthe death of Associate Justice Scalia. The President has done his job. \nNow it is time for the Senate to do ours, to use advice and consent on \nthis nominee, not to treat that as an option but as an obligation.\n  It is my sincere hope that in the coming days and weeks, all of my \nSenate colleagues will join me in meeting the nominee and evaluating \nhim based on his merits and on his record and that Republican \nobjections about this individual be laid aside so that at least they \ncan look at his qualifications, his judicial temperament, and his \nrecord.\n  Chief Judge Garland has served the U.S. Court of Appeals since 1997. \nLet me stress that he has served on this important court for almost 20 \nyears. He was previously at a law firm as a partner. He served as U.S. \nattorney for the District of Columbia and as Deputy Assistant Attorney \nGeneral in the Criminal Division of the U.S. Department of Justice. \nFinally, he served as a U.S. circuit judge earlier in his career.\n  He is highly qualified as a nominee. America deserves to have a fully \nfunctioning court, and they deserve to have Senators who will do their \njob in reviewing this nominee. The Supreme Court cases that impact our \nfundamental rights and our operations of government--including the \nextent of property rights, privacy rights, the balance between civil \nliberty and national security, how to ensure equal protection under the \nlaw, and how to guarantee adequate and due process--are all things that \ndeserve to have a full Supreme Court.\n  We need a fully functioning Court to keep the balance that we have in \nour system--the checks and balances throughout our government. We \ncannot delay the consideration of this Supreme Court nominee.\n  President Obama had an obligation to fill this vacancy on the Court. \nHe did so by making this nomination. His duty does not end just because \nthis is an election year.\n  The Senate has a constitutional obligation now to provide the advice \nand consent to the President on this nominee. That is a job that we \nshould all take very seriously. The American people deserve no less. In \nfact, the Supreme Court Justice who grew up in the State of Washington, \nWilliam O. Douglas, was nominated and confirmed within 16 days. That is \nright--16 days.\n  President Franklin D. Roosevelt nominated Justice Douglas on March \n20, 1939, to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court on a seat vacated by \nJustice Brandeis. Justice Douglas was confirmed by the Senate on April \n4, 1939. He went on to serve on the Supreme Court for 36 years.\n  So it can be done. While I am not saying it has to be done in the \nshort amount of time that took--16 days--I do believe that we can get \nthis nominee done in an efficient time. If you look at the record of \nmost of the Supreme Court nominees, it has been, on average, 70 days. \nSo we have plenty of time to make this consideration and make this \ndecision. Yet Senate Republicans have manufactured their own artificial \nbarrier to this debate of the Supreme Court nominee, basically saying \nthat they don't believe we have to take up consideration of this issue.\n  I am asking them: Please, take Judge Garland's phone calls. Please \nmake your schedule available to meet with him. When we return, please \nschedule a hearing to consider his nomination. Then, do what the \nAmerican people want us to do; that is, do our job and actually vote on \nconsideration of Judge Garland. This is in the interest of the American \npeople. I know that Senate Republicans want to say they want to wait. \nBut we cannot wait a full year to get another nominee on the Court.\n  The Senate has confirmed Supreme Court Justices in the final year of \na Presidency more than a dozen times. During the last year of President \nReagan's final term, Justice Kennedy was unanimously confirmed by a \nDemocratic-controlled Senate. So the Republicans on the other side of \nthe aisle, and many out there in the party, are saying they want to \njust allow a minority to drive the interests of the party and delay, \ndelay, delay.\n  Well, in my opinion, you are delaying justice. In fact, you are \ntaking some of the gridlock that has existed in this building and are \njust moving it across the street to the Supreme Court. We cannot have \ndelays and gridlock in our judicial system. We need to do our job and \nmove through this process. Today, I am urging my colleagues to have a \nhearing, ask the tough questions, and finally hold a vote.\n  Let's show the American people that we can do our job and that we can \nvote for or against this nominee. But you have to first meet with him, \ntake his phone calls, and schedule a hearing.\n  The Seattle Times recently wrote: ``The hyperpartisan milieu of \nCongress this election year must not thwart the framers' intent.''\n  The Olympian newspaper in our State wrote:\n\n       The Republican Party's intransigence in Congress is \n     legendary. But the new refusal to consider any appointment of \n     a new justice to the U.S. Supreme Court by President Obama is \n     an outright abuse of power.\n\n  So, if the other side continues to refuse a nominee until a new \nPresident is sworn in, it would mark the longest period in the history \nof the Senate, since the Civil War, to fill a vacancy. All the \npositions on the Supreme Court are essential. My constituents and \npeople all across America expect the Senate to do its job, regardless \nof whether it is an election year or not.\n  So I hope that, as our forefathers and Framers of our Constitution \nput together a government that works, those here in the Senate will \ntake the phone calls of Judge Garland, take the meetings, schedule a \nhearing, and make sure that we vote on this nominee this year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 377, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 377) directing the Senate Legal \n     Counsel to bring a civil action to enforce a subpoena of the \n     Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 1 hour \nof debate, equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I rise today in support of S. Res. 377, \nwhich is a resolution to enforce a subpoena of the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations, which I chair. I will be joined shortly \nby my colleague Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, who is the \nranking Democrat on the subcommittee and whom I worked with as a \npartner on this issue over the past year.\n  This is a subpoena that we issued to a group called backpage--\nbackpage.com. This resolution is intended to enforce that subpoena. \nBackpage and its chief executive officer, Carl Ferrer, have not been \nwilling to cooperate with the committee. Unfortunately, we are at the \npoint where we have to seek the enforcement of our subpoena.\n  For nearly a year now, Senator McCaskill and I conducted a bipartisan \ninvestigation into the scourge of human trafficking on the Internet \nwith a focus on sex trafficking involving children. In the past 5 \nyears, the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children reported an \nover 800-percent increase in reports of suspected child sex \ntrafficking, an increase the organization has found to be ``directly \ncorrelated to the increased use of the internet to sell children for \nsex.'' They testified before our subcommittee about this. They are the \nexperts. They see this huge increase being related to the Internet. In \nother words, the destructive crime of sex slavery has moved from the \nstreet corner to the smartphone.\n\n[[Page S1562]]\n\n  An adult can now shop for underaged trafficking victims from their \ncomputer screen. Sex traffickers are well aware that backpage.com, the \nbiggest one by far, offers them a quick and easy-to-use marketplace to \nsell children and coerce adults.\n  Here is how the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children \nspells it out, describing this growing problem at a hearing I chaired \nlate last year:\n\n       Online classified ad sites such as backpage.com . . . allow \n     [sex traffickers] to remain anonymous, test out new markets, \n     attempt to evade public or law enforcement detection, and \n     easily locate customers to consummate their sale of children \n     for sex. Online sex trafficking also enables traffickers to \n     easily update an existing ad with a new location and quickly \n     move the child to another geographic location where there are \n     more customers seeking to purchase a child for rape or sexual \n     abuse.\n\n  This is from the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. As \ncochair of the Senate Caucus to End Human Trafficking, I have spent \nmany hours with those dedicated to fighting this crime and those who \nare victimized by it. For victims, the toll of sex trafficking is \nmeasured in stolen childhoods and painful trauma. For traffickers, it \nis measured in dollars--often a lot of dollars. It is a problem, I \nbelieve, that should command more attention around our country and \ncertainly here in the U.S. Congress.\n  The aim of our investigation is very straightforward. We want to \nunderstand how lawmakers, law enforcement, and even private businesses \ncan more effectively combat this serious crime that thrives on the \nonline black market.\n  Traffickers have found refuge in new customers through Web sites that \nspecialize in advertising ``ordinary'' prostitution and lawful escort \nservices. A business called backpage.com is the market leader in that \nindustry, with annual revenues in excess of $130 million last year. \nBackpage has a special niche: According to one industry analysis in \n2013, $8 out of every $10 spent on online commercial sex advertising in \nthe United States goes to backpage.com. The public record indicates \nthat backpage sits at the center of the online black market for sex \ntrafficking.\n  Again, the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children has \nreported that of the suspected child trafficking reports it receives \nfrom the public, 71 percent involve backpage. Again, they have said \nthat of the suspected child trafficking reports they receive from the \npublic--and they have a 1-800 number; they get reports from the \npublic--71 percent involve backpage.com.\n  According to a leading anti-trafficking organization called Shared \nHope International, ``Service providers working with child sex \ntrafficking victims have reported between 80 percent and 100 percent of \ntheir clients have been bought and sold on backpage.com.'' In fact, \nthis organization has documented more than 400 cases in 47 States of \nchildren being sex trafficked on backpage.com.\n  Despite all this, backpage executives said they are committed to \ncombatting sex trafficking. The company claims that its internal \nprocedures for reviewing and screening the advertisements ``lead the \nindustry.'' That claim led us to ask a very simple question: What are \nthose industry-leading procedures? If they are so effective in the \nfight against human trafficking, Congress and other lawmakers ought to \nknow about it. That is why Senator McCaskill and I asked backpage for \ndocuments about their ad-screening practices--a process backpage calls \n``moderation.'' We also asked for other information about their \nbusiness practices--fair questions, targeted questions, relevant \nquestions. The company has refused to answer them and refused to \ncooperate.\n\n  We then took the next step and issued a subpoena to backpage's CEO, \nCarl Ferrer, inquiring him to produce documents about backpage's \nmoderation practices, efforts to combat human trafficking, and \nfinancial information. The company essentially told us no. Wrapping \nitself in a privileged First Amendment argument, backpage refuses to \nproduce documents about its business practices and told us that the \ncompany refuses to even look for documents--not just that they don't \nhave the documents, but they refuse to even look for them, a clear sign \nof willful contempt for the Senate's process.\n  That is why we are here today on the floor. Senator McCaskill and I \ngave backpage every opportunity to cooperate in good faith with our \ninvestigation. We carefully considered its objections to the subpoena. \nWe actually issued a 19-page opinion, thoughtfully overruling their \nobjections and directing backpage to comply. They continued to \nstonewall.\n  In the meantime, our investigation has not stopped. Our investigators \nand lawyers found a number of third parties and other witnesses who had \ninformation about backpage's practices and procedures. Along the way, \nwe discovered that from 2010 to 2012, backpage outsourced much of its \nscreening and, again, this moderation; meaning, looking at these ads \ncoming in, the screening and moderation they outsourced to others, \nincluding to workers in India.\n  We obtained emails from the California company that managed those \nIndia-based moderators, including emails with backpage's CEO and other \nexecutives. These emails are deeply troubling. Our investigation showed \nthat backpage edits advertisements before posting them by removing \ncertain words, certain phrases, certain images. For instance, they \nmight remove a word or image that makes it clear that the sexual \nservices are being offered for money. Then they might post this \nsanitized version of an ad. While this editing changes nothing about \nthe underlying transaction, it tends to conceal the evidence of \nillegality. In other words, backpage's editing procedures--far from \nbeing an effective anti-trafficking measure--serve to sanitize the ads \nof the illegal content to the outside viewer.\n  We still don't know the full extent of backpage's editing practices. \nHow much of the illegal conduct--or even the fact that they were \nselling minors online--was being concealed? Why? Backpage will not tell \nus.\n  Then there is this email. It tells the moderators what to do if they \nhave doubts about whether a girl advertised on backpage is underage. I \nam going to quote from this email. It says:\n\n       If in doubt about underage: The process should for now be \n     to accept the ad . . . however, if you ever find anything \n     that you feel is underage and is more than just suspicious, \n     you can delete the ad. . . . Only delete if you [are] really \n     very sure person is underage.\n\n  To be clear, we didn't get this information from backpage itself \nbecause it refuses to provide it. This came from the contractor. \nBackpage claims emails like this are protected by the First Amendment, \nwhich is not accurate.\n  In November, Senator McCaskill and I released a bipartisan staff \nreport about our investigation and held a hearing to consider what to \ndo about backpage's noncompliance. I encourage Members to take a look \nat this staff report. It is online. You can find it.\n  By the way, despite being under subpoena, backpage's CEO refused to \nshow up for the hearing we held. Shortly before the hearing date, he \nsimply informed us that he wasn't going to show up. This is something \nSenator McCaskill and I will continue to focus on. But others did show \nup for our hearing. We heard testimony from law enforcement, \nprosecutors, and the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children \nconfirming what we had come to suspect: Backpage is not really an ally \nin the fight against human trafficking; they said it profits from it.\n\n  The general counsel of the National Center for Missing & Exploited \nChildren told us that it had dozens of meetings with backpage about \nimproving the company's anti-trafficking measures, but those meetings \nended because the national center concluded that backpage was ``not \nengaging in good faith efforts to deter the selling and buying of \nchildren for sex on its Web site.''\n  The national center told us that ``[d]espite backpage's assertions, \nit was adopting and publicizing only carefully selected sound \npractices, while resisting recommended substantive measures that would \nprotect more children from being sold for sex . . . on backpage.com.'' \nFor example, the national center noted that backpage did not ``hash'' \nits photos--a very low-cost technique for comparing digital images that \ncould help identify missing children.\n  The national center also noted that backpage has more stringent rules \nto post an ad to sell a pet, a motorcycle,\n\n[[Page S1563]]\n\nor a boat than it does to sell a person. A user is required to submit a \nverified phone number for selling a hamster but not in placing ads that \ncould involve the sale of a child for sex. Think about that.\n  The human toll of all this is staggering. It is hard to overstate the \ntraumatic effect of a minor being advertised on a daily basis on a site \nlike backpage.com.\n  In a recent lawsuit brought against backpage in Boston, the plaintiff \nwas a 15-year-old girl who had been raped over 1,000 times as a result \nof being advertised on backpage.com--1,000 times. In the course of our \ninvestigation, we also heard some similarly heart-wrenching stories. \nFor example, backpage receives reports from families pleading with it \nto take down ads of their children. Here is one such email sent to \nbackpage that the national center shared with us. Remember, this is an \nemail from a parent about a child being sent to backpage. It said this:\n\n       Your Web site has ads featuring our 16-year-old daughter [  \n     ], posing as an escort. She is being pimped out by her old \n     [boyfriend], and she is underage. I have emailed the ad \n     multiple times using your website, but have gotten no \n     response. . . . For God's sake, she's only 16. . . . Stuff \n     like this shouldn't be allowed to happen.\n\n  This is from a parent pleading.\n  Even after receiving such reports, the national center tells us \nbackpage often does not remove the ad. Instead, the ad remains live on \nthe Web site, which allows the abuse of that child to continue. Imagine \nas a parent or a grandparent, aunt or uncle, brother or sister feeling \nhelpless in the face of backpage not even being willing to take down an \nad of a family member.\n  It is sometimes hard to square backpage's public statements about its \nbusiness practices with the reality on the ground. For example, the \nnational center recently was searching for a child who was missing--and \nby the way, still is missing--and found she appeared in a sex \nadvertisement on backpage. Sadly, that is pretty common. What made this \ncase even more incredible was that backpage ad actually contained a \nmissing-child poster of that same child. So the ad advertising sex \nactually used the missing-child poster of that child. That poster had \nthe child's real name on it, real age, real picture, and the date she \nwent missing. The other pictures in the ad included topless photos. We \ncertainly would like to know what supposedly market-leading screening \nand moderation procedures missed that one. And that, Madam President, \nis exactly why we need the documents we have asked for from backpage, \ndocuments we have subpoenaed from backpage. Without them, we can't \nreally evaluate how sex trafficking is proliferated in these online \nmarketplaces. We can't really evaluate how Congress can do a better job \nfighting against this crime. We can't help the many prosecutors at the \nlocal level who are trying to stop this practice or the attorneys \ngeneral around the United States of America who are trying to stop this \npractice. We can't really help to stop this from happening.\n\n  To be clear, our purpose is absolutely not to shut down any \nparticular company or to deter protected advertising for lawful \nservices. This is not an attempt to shut down something that is lawful \non the Internet, it is an attempt to stop something that is unlawful, \nand nor are we even looking for information about individual \nadvertisers. In fact, Senator McCaskill and I have made clear that \nbackpage should redact from any documents they send us any of the \npersonally identifying information about its users. We don't need that. \nThat is not what we are about. What we are interested in are facts that \nwill enable smart legislation on a critical issue of public concern. We \nhope our investigation will help to combat this process directly but \nalso will help to generate legislation here in the Congress.\n  This civil contempt resolution before us today--S. Res. 377--will \nenable us to get those facts. It was reported out of the full committee \nunanimously. I wish to thank Senator Ron Johnson, the chairman of the \ncommittee, and Senator Tom Carper, the ranking member of the committee, \nand all of our colleagues on the committee for their unwavering support \nfor this investigation.\n  This will be the first time in more than 20 years that the Senate has \nhad to enforce a subpoena in court. I can't think of a time when it has \nbeen more justified. To my colleagues who are wondering about this, \nagain, I hope they will look at our report and see why it is so \nimportant that we move forward with enforcing this subpoena.\n  The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has a long history of \ninvestigating crime that infiltrates interstate commerce and affects \nour Nation's health and safety. In our era, the crime of human \ntrafficking has become a scourge, and Congress needs to know everything \nit can to be able to better fight it. No investigation of that subject \ncould omit backpage.com. Again, as we have heard from these outside \ngroups, the vast majority of this sex trafficking that is going on \nonline is through this very site. The National Association of Attorneys \nGeneral has described backpage as a ``hub'' of ``human trafficking, \nespecially the trafficking of minors.'' That is the attorneys general \naround the country.\n  Unfortunately, this is an issue that affects all of our communities. \nIt knows no ZIP Code.\n  Madam President, before I yield the floor, I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record a number of statements in support of the \nresolution from the Nation's leading anti-trafficking organizations, \nincluding the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       ``Rights4Girls applauds the Senate's passage of this \n     important resolution that will provide much needed \n     accountability and insight into Backpage.com's business \n     practices--practices that have led to the trafficking and \n     exploitation of children all across this country. We are \n     especially grateful to Senators Portman and McCaskill for \n     their leadership in advancing this resolution and for their \n     dedication to protecting our nation's most vulnerable \n     children.''--Yasmin Vafa, Executive Director and Co-Founder, \n     Rights4Girls\n       ``I commend the Senate, particularly Senators Rob Portman \n     and Claire McCaskill, for their leadership on the \n     investigation into Backpage and their dedication to assisting \n     victims of child sex trafficking and their families. I am \n     outraged at the business practices Backpage continues to \n     engage in and that they are not being held accountable for \n     facilitating and profiting from child sex trafficking on \n     their website. Backpage is a shopping mall for people who \n     want to exploit children and they shouldn't be able to \n     continue profiting on the rape of children without \n     repercussions. These creeps keep hiding behind the veil of \n     the First Amendment while knowingly allowing children to be \n     trafficked for sex on their website.

We thank you for your brave leadership on this \n     investigation and dedication to assisting the victims of \n     online commercial sexual exploitation and trafficking.\n       Shared Hope International was founded and exists to end sex \n     trafficking of women and children and assist the victims \n     through restoration and access to justice. Since 1998, we \n     have implemented programs and advocated for laws and policies \n     that would ensure victims of sex trafficking are protected, \n     served and honored as victims. Increasingly, the victims we \n     serve have been sold for sex on the internet, and most often \n     the website named is Backpage.com. In fact, NCMEC reports \n     that 71% of all child sex trafficking reports to the \n     CyberTipline relate to Backpage ads. Shared Hope documented \n     495 cases representing at least 548 child victims who were \n     sold for sex on Backpage.com in nearly every\n\n[[Page S1564]]\n\n     state in the U.S. These are cases we identified through media \n     coverage, which means they represent only a fraction of the \n     total number of cases. Our partners indicate most of the \n     youth they serve in recovery programs were sold on the site. \n     A study by YouthSpark in Atlanta, Georgia, found 53% of \n     children receiving care from service providers across the \n     country were bought and sold for sex on Backpage.com.\n       The Subcommittees efforts to investigate the practices of \n     Backpage.com and demand answers in an effort to prevent the \n     sex trafficking of children on that website and others like \n     it is critical to our work to end sex trafficking.

Claire McCaskill,\n     Ranking Member, Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, \n         Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Portman and Ranking Member McCaskill: On \n     behalf of the National Center for Missing & Exploited \n     Children (NCMEC) and the families and children we serve, I am \n     writing to express our strong support for your resolution \n     directing the Senate Legal Counsel to bring a civil action to \n     enforce a subpoena issued by your Subcommittee to the Chief \n     Executive Officer of Backpage (S. Res. 377). We commend you \n     for your leadership on this investigation and your dedication \n     to assisting victims of child sex trafficking and their \n     families.\n       NCMEC is a private, non-profit organization that for over \n     31 years has been designated by Congress to serve as the \n     national clearinghouse on issues related to missing and \n     exploited children. In this role, NCMEC has learned a great \n     deal about child sex trafficking, including its pervasive \n     growth online and the devastating impact this crime has on \n     children and their families. We know that sex trafficking is \n     a crime that takes place in nearly every community in the \n     United States and increasingly children are sold for sex \n     online on websites like Backpage.com.\n       NCMEC receives reports of child sex trafficking through \n     intakes of missing child cases, requests for analytical \n     assistance, and reports to the CyberTipline, the reporting \n     mechanism for child sexual exploitation crimes. In recent \n     years, NCMEC has witnessed an increase in missing and \n     exploited child cases involving the online trafficking of \n     children for sex. In 2015, NCMEC assisted with approximately \n     10,000 reports regarding possible child sex trafficking, but \n     we know this is only a small fraction of suspected child sex \n     trafficking victims in this country.\n       Even more concerning is that a majority of child sex \n     trafficking cases reported to NCMEC involve ads posted on \n     Backpage.com. More than seventy-one percent (71%) of all \n     child sex trafficking reports submitted by members of the \n     public to NCMEC relate to Backpage ads. We also have seen a \n     disturbing trend of runaway children trafficked on \n     Backpage.com. Today, when we are looking for a runaway child \n     who we have reason to believe might be trafficked, \n     Backpage.com is the first place we look for the child.\n       We have long been alarmed about Backpage's business \n     practices that fail to prevent children from being sold for \n     sex on its website. The work of your Subcommittee to \n     investigate these practices and to demand answers is to be \n     widely commended.\n       NCMEC is proud to lend our support to this important \n     resolution, and we hope the Senate's work can uncover more \n     information regarding the use of online websites, such as \n     Backpage.com, to traffic children. We are grateful for your \n     dedication to the safety of our nation's children and look \n     forward to continuing to work with you and others who are \n     working tirelessly to halt the terrible tragedy of online \n     child sex trafficking.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    John F.

Rob Portman,\n     Chairman, Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Committee \n         on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Claire McCaskill,\n     Ranking Member, Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, \n         Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Portman and Ranking Member McCaskill: On \n     behalf of Polaris, a non-profit organization working to end \n     human trafficking and restore freedom to victims and \n     survivors, I am writing to express my strong support for S. \n     Res. 377, which directs the Senate Legal Counsel to bring a \n     civil action to enforce a subpoena issued by your \n     Subcommittee to the Chief Executive Officer of Backpage. I \n     appreciate your tremendous work on this investigation and \n     your leadership in the fight to ensure victims of child sex \n     trafficking and their families receive justice.\n       Since 2007, Polaris has operated the National Human \n     Trafficking Resource Center (NHTRC), a 24-hour, national, \n     confidential anti-trafficking hotline and resource center \n     created and overseen by the Department of Health and Human \n     Services. Additionally, in March 2013, Polaris launched our \n     BeFree textline, allowing trafficking victims and concerned \n     citizens to use text message to contact us for help.\n       In 2015, the NHTRC received 1,383 cases involving sex \n     trafficking of a minor, and Polaris received 22 cases through \n     our BeFree textline involving sex trafficking of a minor. In \n     these two sets, Backpage was specifically referenced in 222 \n     cases. In total, the NHTRC has received 5,810 minor sex \n     trafficking cases since 2007, BeFree has received 66 cases \n     since 2013, and Backpage has been referenced in 595 cases.\n       Backpage's business practices have long been a major source \n     of concern for Polaris and the anti-trafficking community as \n     a whole. We wholeheartedly support your Subcommittee's \n     investigation into Backpage, and we think that S. Res. 377 is \n     critical to ensuring Backpage is held accountable for its \n     shocking, blatant disregard for your investigation. We are \n     proud to stand with your Subcommittee in this fight to stop \n     child sex trafficking, and we hope the Senate will \n     unanimously pass S. Res. 377.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Brad Myles,\n                                                              CEO.\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I urge my colleagues to vote yes on \nthis resolution and vindicate the authority of Congress to obtain \ninformation necessary for sound legislation to protect the most \nvulnerable among us.\n  We are going to hear shortly from Senator Claire McCaskill, who has \nbeen a partner of mine in this effort from the beginning. This \ninvestigation has taken about a year. We have done it thoughtfully and \ncarefully. Again, I wish to express my gratitude to her for her support \nfor the legislation. We wanted to wait until she was back in Congress--\nshe was home taking care of some important health matters--in order to \ntake up this vote today. I know she will express her own strongly held \nviews on this.\n  I just want to say I hope all of my colleagues--Republicans and \nDemocrats alike--will look at this issue and realize this is an \nopportunity for us to go on record supporting an investigation that \ncould lead to legislation that can actually help to protect those most \nvulnerable among us.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, today the Senate will vote on S. Res. \n377, a resolution directing Senate legal counsel to bring a civil \naction to enforce a subpoena of the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, PSI, against Carl Ferrer, chief executive officer of \nbackpage.com LLC, ``backpage''. I support this resolution in \nfurtherance of PSI's bipartisan investigation into businesses that \ndirectly or indirectly facilitate sex trafficking.\n  Backpage officials have publicly acknowledged that their website may \nhave been used by criminals to engage in sex trafficking, including the \ntrafficking of children. Identifying and shutting down the tools that \nhelp criminals engage in such illegality is critical to preventing \nthese crimes. We must do all we can to stop these criminals and to \nsupport the survivors. That is why I support this resolution and why I \nhave worked tirelessly to enact legislation to prevent human \ntrafficking in the first place and to provide resources for trafficking \nvictims so that they can begin to rebuild their lives.\n  Last year the chairman and ranking member of PSI jointly launched a \nbipartisan investigation to examine businesses that directly or \nindirectly facilitate sex trafficking. Backpage is one of the companies \nthat PSI has been investigating, but it is not the only one. PSI aims \nto learn as much as possible about these businesses so that the Senate \ncan craft appropriate legislative and policy responses to combat sex \ntrafficking and child exploitation.\n  On October 1, 2015, and in accordance with subcommittee rules, PSI \nvoted on a bipartisan basis to issue a subpoena to backpage's CEO, Carl \nFerrer. This subpoena was issued only after backpage failed to comply \nwith a subpoena issued earlier in the year and after several backpage \nemployees refused to testify. The subpoena required,\n\n[[Page S1565]]\n\namong other things, the production of backpage's policies and practices \nwith respect to reviewing advertisements for potential criminal \nactivity, information on how backpage cooperates with law enforcement, \ndata on how many advertisements backpage denies or deletes, and \ninformation relating to revenue earned through adult advertisements. To \ndate, backpage has refused to comply with the subpoena.\n  On November 19, 2015, PSI held a hearing about backpage.com. At this \nhearing, the senior vice president of the National Center for Missing & \nExploited Children testified that 71 percent of reports of suspected \nchild trafficking it receives involve backpage. The hearing also raised \nsignificant concerns about backpage's willingness to cooperate with law \nenforcement. PSI issued a subpoena compelling the testimony of Carl \nFerrer at the hearing, but he refused to appear.\n  The refusal of backpage to comply with the subpoena compelled the \nfull Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee to vote \nunanimously in favor of the resolution now before us. The resolution \nauthorizes Senate legal counsel to begin to take action to enforce the \nsubpoena in Federal court. PSI's investigation is exactly the type of \noversight the Senate should be conducting. The subject matter is one of \nutmost importance, and PSI's efforts have been jointly conducted by the \nchairman and ranking member of PSI since the investigation began. Most \nimportantly, the requested documents are critical to understanding how \nonline sex trafficking is effectuated and to finding ways to stop it.\n  Authorizing Senate legal counsel to enforce a Senate subpoena is a \nvery serious matter that should not be taken lightly. This action \nshould be taken only in the most limited of circumstances and should \nnever be pursued for partisan or political motives. Given the serious \nnature of this investigation and the unanimous support by all members \nof the committee and subcommittee throughout the process, I support \nthis resolution.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I wish to express my strong support \nfor the resolution to enforce the subpoena against backpage's CEO Carl \nFerrer.\n  From my work as chairman and now ranking member of the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence, I know how important congressional \ninvestigations can be to ensure that we have all the facts, and that is \nthe type of issue before us today.\n  In this case, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations is \nconducting a bipartisan investigation into the use of the Internet to \nfacilitate sex trafficking, particularly sex trafficking of minors. As \nmy colleagues know, this has been an area I have worked to address \nlegislatively, including in an amendment to the Justice for Victims of \nTrafficking Act that passed 97-2 that makes it a Federal crime to \nknowingly advertise minors for commercial sex. I believe the \nInvestigations Subcommittee's work can inform the work of the Congress \nas a whole to better protect vulnerable children trafficked over the \nInternet.\n  Backpage is a Web site that allows for the advertisement of \ncommercial sex online. In 2013, it was estimated that $8 out of every \n$10 spent on online sex advertising in the U.S. goes to backpage. \nMoreover, the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children has \nitself determined that backpage is linked to 71 percent of all \nsuspected child sex trafficking reports that it receives from the \npublic through its ``CyberTipline.'' Thus, this bipartisan \ninvestigation naturally involves questions about the specifics of how \nbackpage operates.\n  As I understand it, the subcommittee's subpoena seeks documents to \nhelp explain backpage's current policies and practices. These questions \ninvolve, among other things, whether backpage edits the content of ads \nbefore they are published, whether backpage might be more helpful to \nlaw enforcement with the data it collects, and whether backpage has \nresources sufficient to further prevent trafficking on its site. But \nbackpage has refused to comply with this subpoena.\n  Where an investigative subcommittee is conducting a bipartisan \ninvestigation into the most horrific crimes committed against young \npeople, it is the right thing to do for the Senate to enforce this \nsubpoena through the legal process.\n  I would like to also share about a case that arose in my State very \nrecently. Last week, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department \narrested three individuals charged with abducting a 20-year-old woman \nand transporting her to the Bay Area to sexually exploit her. The \nvictim was initially kidnapped in Palmdale, where she was viciously \nassaulted and then moved 6 hours north to Oakland, where her pictures \nwere taken and posted to backpage.com. She was then driven back down to \nOrange County and had a gun pointed at her by one of her attackers. The \nvictim was fortunately able to make some panicked calls to her mother \nwhile taken captive, and the L.A. Sheriff's office was able to find her \nin a motel and rescue her. The suspects were then captured and now face \na litany of charges. This all occurred just weeks ago.\n  The point is sex trafficking, facilitated by the Internet, continues \nto plague communities all over the country.\n  I recently met with John Clark, the new president and CEO of the \nNational Center for Missing & Exploited Children. The National Center \nreported that over the last 5 years, there has been an 846 percent \nincrease in reports of suspected child sex trafficking and that this \nincrease is ``directly correlated to the increased use of the Internet \nto sell children for sex.'' That is sobering.\n  Every day in America, vulnerable victims are advertised over the \nInternet and exploited by traffickers. I believe the Congress must get \nto the bottom of it, try to understand how it is happening, and do all \nthat we can to stop it. So I fully support enforcement of this subpoena \nand urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to support S. \nRes. 377, a resolution to enforce a subpoena of the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations against backpage.com and Carl Ferrer, \nthe company's chief executive officer. This action comes as part of the \nsubcommittee's ongoing investigation into the sex trafficking of minors \nand the unfortunate and increasing role of the Internet in facilitating \nthis horrific crime.\n  Before I go much further, I would like to express my deep \nappreciation to the chairman. Senator Portman has been tenacious. He is \ncommitted. He is forcing us as a body to address an issue that is so \nunpleasant that many times we shy away from it because we would rather \ntalk about more pleasant subjects and issues that are less emotional. \nBut it is what is happening in America and in the world, and thanks to \nthe leadership of Senator Portman, it is being addressed in a \nforthright manner that alerts all of us and, indeed, alerts the world. \nI very much appreciate the great work he has done on this issue. I know \nhe remains committed for as long as he is a Member of this body, and we \nare incredibly grateful for his friendship and his leadership.\n  This marks the first time in 20 years that the Senate has been \nrequired to enforce a subpoena in court. I have been in Congress for a \nlong time, and I have never seen anything quite like it. As part of the \nsubcommittee's fair and deliberative investigation into human \ntrafficking and child exploitation on the Internet, we have encountered \na company that, instead of doing everything in its power to assist in \nprotecting the most vulnerable in our society, has decided to focus its \nenergies on stonewalling congressional efforts to do so.\n  Let me be clear. As is always the case in this unsavory underside of \nsociety, it is about money. Backpage.com is the market leader in \ncommercial sex advertising. It was valued at over $600 million in 2015, \nwith over $130 million in annual revenue, and their business model is \ndependent on the revenue generated from this part of its Web site.\n\n[[Page S1566]]\n\nBackpage claims to be a leading partner in the fight to combat child \nsex trafficking by screening advertisements for evidence of trafficking \nand taking deliberate steps from preventing illegal activity from \nappearing on its Web site. But the company has refused to produce \ndocuments that could verify this claim, and the facts gathered by the \nsubcommittee from other sources indicate this is not the case.\n  As Senator Portman has indicated, backpage has been linked to \nhundreds of human trafficking cases, including those of children. The \nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children has gathered data \nthat indicates that the vast majority of suspected child trafficking \nreports it receives from the public include postings made on backpage. \nIdentifying what screening procedures are in place and the \neffectiveness of these efforts in curbing trafficking are an important \npart of this investigation.\n  Thanks to the leadership from the Senator from Ohio, it is hard to \nthink of a more worthy use of the Senate's investigative authority than \nexamining the methods used to facilitate the buying and selling of \nchildren for sexual exploitation. This investigation is designed to \nguide Congress as we consider ways to combat human trafficking and \nidentify what can be done to protect children and eliminate this crime. \nEnforcement of this subpoena is necessary to accomplish that goal and \nto protect the prerogative of the Senate to investigate matters of \nconsequence to our national interest. I appreciate Senators Portman and \nMcCaskill's truly bipartisan efforts to investigate matters of \nconsequence to our national interest. I appreciate their efforts to \nshed light on this difficult issue, and I appreciate their commitment \nto defending the Senate's role in addressing it.\n\n  I hope and believe that vote will be 100 to 0, as we strongly support \nChairman Portman's right to obtain the information he believes is \nnecessary to the subcommittee's investigation concerning human \ntrafficking. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this \nimportant resolution.\n  I know that my friend and colleague Senator Portman knows that one of \nthe areas where human trafficking is most intense are those States that \nare on the border, and our southern border is obviously penetrated \nregularly by these human traffickers. I would like, as a representative \nof the people of my State of Arizona, where this issue is of particular \nimportance, to thank Senator Portman and Senator McCaskill for their \nunending worthy and important efforts on this issue.\n  By passing this legislation, we will send a message to others. We \nwill send a message to others, I say to my colleague from Ohio, that \nthey can run but they can't hide.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from \nArizona. He has been a leader on this issue for many years. For people \nwho don't know, Cindy McCain, the wife of the Senator from Arizona, is \nan international leader on this issue dealing with human trafficking \nall over the world and also sex trafficking here at home. I appreciate \nhis passion and his commitment to it. As a former chair and a ranking \nmember of this committee, I look to him for counsel and advice on how \nwe conduct ourselves. He has been very helpful in this specific issue, \nand I thank him.\n  I yield to the Senator from Minnesota for such time as she may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator McCain for his \nwork. I started to work on some of these backpage issues in conjunction \nwith Senator McCain's wife Cindy McCain, as well as with Senator \nHeitkamp. We took a trip to Mexico focusing on the trafficking going on \nacross the border with that country.\n  I want to thank Senators Portman and McCaskill for leadership on this \nreally important resolution. Just last year, five St. Paul residents \nwere charged with running a multistate sex trafficking ring. One of the \nalleged victims was 16. Those underage girls were being advertised on \nbackpage, and the ads were placed in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, \nGeorgia, Ohio, Kentucky, and Illinois.\n  In Southwest Minnesota, an operation involving backpage resulted in \ncharges against 48 men around the towns of New Ulm and Mankato, the \ntown my husband grew up in. These cases prove that sex trafficking \nisn't just happening in some faraway place. It is happening right now \nin the United States of America. It is happening in our own \nneighborhoods. It is happening in oil patches in North Dakota. It is \nhappening in Cleveland, and it is happening in St. Paul. These are real \nstories with real people.\n  In 2014 I spoke to the trafficking advocacy group Polaris when they \nreleased their State-by-State rankings of efforts to fight human \ntrafficking. They said then:\n\n       The scope and scale of human trafficking within the United \n     States presents a daunting challenge to policymakers, service \n     providers, law enforcement, and advocates. Originally, human \n     trafficking was thought to be more of a problem in other \n     countries, but now it is known to be happening in our \n     backyards. It is estimated that there are hundreds of \n     thousands of victims of sex and labor trafficking inside our \n     borders.\n\n  We have learned more about human trafficking through the advocacy and \ndedication, as I mentioned, of our friend Cindy McCain and her work at \nthe McCain Institute. Their 2014 report actually focuses specifically \non this advertising.\n  When I was a prosecutor for 8 years, yes, we had trafficking--of \ncourse, we did--and, yes, we had child pornography, but I would say we \ndidn't see this tsunami of advertising that we see now. Why? The \nInternet has made it easier. We love the Internet. It has allowed us to \ncommunicate in ways, but it has expanded demand for sex trafficking \nvictims because of the fact that it is easier to do than it used to be.\n  What the McCain report shows is that the availability of potential \nvictims of domestic minor sex trafficking exceeded researcher \nexpectations, with no less than 38 different Web sites advertising \nvictims who showed indications of being juvenile sex trafficking \nvictims, with at least 4 Web sites providing customer feedback and \nsoliciting recommendations of victims of sex trafficking.\n  The McCain report went on to say: ``In Phoenix, during 10 days of ad \nscreening, 34 ads were identified as possibly depicting minor victims \nwith duplicate ads resulting in 81 distinct tips of domestic minor sex \ntrafficking.''\n  Last year we successfully passed the Justice for Victims of \nTrafficking Act that Senator Cornyn and I led. We are making good \nprogress in implementing this bill. Senator Cornyn and I met recently \nwith Attorney General Lynch. They are working hard. Ongoing work not \nonly includes this resolution and is the focus on the advertising of \nillegal sex trafficking but also partnering with the private sector.\n  Senator Warner and I have introduced the Stop Trafficking on Planes \nAct or the STOP Act, which is built on the work of the industry to \ntrain flight attendants and train people on the planes to find the \nvictims. I note this investigation led by the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations is a bipartisan attempt to address a serious issue. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in supporting S. Res. 377. This is just \none element of this fight against sex trafficking, but it is an \nimportant one because people should not be allowed to violate the \nSenate rules, they shouldn't be allowed to skirt hearings, and they \nshouldn't be allowed to get away with this kind of behavior. Backpage \nand others of its ilk are not just a vehicle for advertising this \ncrime, they are actually a vehicle for expanding this crime and hurting \nmore people.\n  I appreciate the work of Senator Portman and Senator McCaskill.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Minnesota for \nher strong support of this resolution today, which again is just \nenforcing a subpoena that is targeted and focused on information that \ncan help us to be able to legislate in this matter. I hope all of my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle will join us in this effort. I \nalso thank her for broader work on this issue, specifically the \nleadership role she has played as a former prosecutor in trying to get \nat this problem of sex trafficking online.\n\n[[Page S1567]]\n\n  Senator Klobuchar is absolutely right. The Internet has provided so \nmany wonderful things for our economy and for our society. Yet there is \na dark side, isn't there. That dark side is shown as clearly as \nanywhere with regard to backpage; the fact that this sex trafficking \nhas been made more efficient through the Internet and specifically \nthrough this one Web site that contains the vast majority of sex \ntrafficking and commercial sex.\n  Again, I refer you to my comments I made earlier. We talked about the \nfact that there is a girl who is currently missing. The National Center \nfor Missing & Exploited Children has been trying to find her. They put \nup posters about her, and recently she appeared on a sex advertisement \non backpage. Again, this is more common than you would expect.\n  What made this case even more incredible to me was the backpage \nactually contained a missing child poster of that same child. So the \nmissing child poster that the national center had put out there for all \nof us to help find her shows up on backpage.com as an advertisement for \nthis young girl. This poster had the child's real name, real age, real \npicture, and the date she went missing. Other photos in that ad \nincluded topless photos of this girl. She is 16 years old.\n  This is another example of where there is a problem that must be \naddressed. Our investigation is to create the information for us to be \nable to legislate wisely on this issue.\n  I see my colleague from New Hampshire has joined us. We wish to hear \nfrom her. She is another former attorney general of a State and has \nbeen involved in this issue for many years and is an active member of \nthe caucus we talked about earlier to try to combat trafficking.\n  I yield to my colleague, the Senator from New Hampshire, such time as \nshe may need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I thank Senator Portman and Senator \nMcCaskill for their strong leadership on the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, of which they are the chair and ranking member, on such \nan important issue because enforcing the subpoena--the resolution we \nhave before us to enforce the subpoena is critical.\n  As you heard today, I was attorney general of New Hampshire. I had \nthe opportunity to work with the Internet Crimes Against Children Task \nForce. The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children reports \nthat of suspected child trafficking reports it receives from the \npublic, 71 percent involve backpage.com.\n  What is the resolution about? It is about the fact that Senator \nPortman, Senator McCaskill, and the committee they lead has asked \nlegitimate questions and asked for documents from backpage.com.\n  We have heard the horrific stories of things that have happened and \nhave been reported. Senator Portman referenced a recent report in \nBoston about a 15-year-old girl who had been raped over 1,000 times as \na result of being advertised on backpage.com.\n  Of course, we have heard horrific stories about children. In one \nPennsylvania case, a defendant forced a minor to have sex with \napproximately 15 different men in one encounter where she was \nthreatened with a weapon--advertised on backpage.com, so it is pretty \nstraightforward.\n  In a Florida case, a trafficker drugged and threatened to kill a 14-\nyear-old girl so he could sell her for sexual services online--\nbackpage.com.\n  In a California case, a trafficker forced two women to work as \nprostitutes through beating and threatening them with sexual violence--\nbackpage.com.\n  These are very legitimate questions that have been asked to inform \nour policy decisions of backpage.com. Yet they will not produce the \ndocuments that have been asked of them, to ask how they were screening \nto ensure they aren't taking illegal actions when it comes to child sex \ntrafficking and trafficking of women and men and boys and girls. Yet \nthey will not answer that. The CEO of backpage.com was subpoenaed to \ntestify, and he refused to appear here.\n  If backpage.com is not doing the things in some of these reports that \nhave come forward and is not acting illegally, then they will come and \ntalk to us about this. The CEO of backpage would not try to hide behind \nthe First Amendment, making arguments that don't bear out under the \nFirst Amendment because we are talking about illegality, the \ntrafficking of children in horrific ways--then this is a legitimate \ninquiry for this committee.\n  I again commend Senator Portman and Senator McCaskill.\n  I urge the Members of the Senate to support this resolution to \nenforce this subpoena so we can ensure that we get the information this \ncommittee needs to inform our policy decisions to address a very \nimportant issue that is putting children at risk, that is harming \nfamilies, that is harming men and women who are being trafficked, and \nwe need to get to the bottom of it.\n  I yield the floor back to Senator Portman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I thank my colleague from New Hampshire.\n  Let me just say I already talked about Senator McCaskill in my \nremarks, but she has been a terrific partner on this issue and many \nothers. She has a passion for it as a former prosecutor, someone who \nunderstands this issue well.\n  I yield all remaining time to Senator McCaskill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, last year a 15-year-old girl wandered \ninto an emergency room in St. Louis, told a horrific tale, asking for \nhelp. She had been trafficked across truckstops throughout the Midwest, \ntaken from truckstop to truckstop, and sold to truckers for sex--all \nthrough backpage. As we debate this today, it is important we stay \nfocused on that 15-year-old girl and don't get lost in the process of \nthe Senate.\n  This is a valid investigation. This is an important investigation. \nWhat we are doing today is making sure the Senate can do its work under \nthe Constitution. Backpage has refused to cooperate. It has refused to \nwillingly cooperate. It has refused two legitimate and duly authorized \nsubpoenas concerning backpage asking for information at the heart of \nthe investigation.\n  Under any circumstances, I find it shocking that a company would \nrefuse a lawful subpoena of the U.S. Senate, would ignore a lawful \nsubpoena of the U.S. Senate. It is particularly outrageous given that \nbackpage has already admitted that serious criminal activity, including \nsex trafficking of children, occurs on its site. Backpage simply has no \nexcuse for not complying with these legal subpoenas.\n  During our November 19 hearing, I promised that while the \nsubcommittee would move forward carefully and cautiously, we would not \ngo quietly into the night, and on some day in the near future we would \nuse the Senate's enforcement measures to compel cooperation from \nbackpage. Today is that day. While we stay focused on that 15-year-old \ngirl, I know I speak for the chairman--and I wish to give the chairman \ngreat accolades for our working relationship. It is not always easy to \nreconcile differences in positions, differences in policy, and staffs \nworking together, but he didn't give up. We both stay at it, and we are \nboth determined to work on this committee in a bipartisan fashion. I am \nvery grateful to him for his effort in that regard.\n  As we think of that 15-year-old girl and the information we need, we \nalso need to think that a bigger principle is at stake; that is, if we \nignore backpage's refusal, what does that say to companies in the \nfuture when we need information in order to do our job? That you can \ngive the back of your hand to the U.S. Senate and there will be no \nconsequences? Obviously, that is a slippery slope I don't think we \nshould go down. I don't think the Founding Fathers would want us to go \ndown that slippery slope.\n  That is why today is the day we say enough. We go with this vote to \nthe courts and we get enforcement of these legal subpoenas so we can \ntruly find out what, if any, role backpage has had in the highly \nillegal and immoral practice of trafficking children for sex.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I yield back all remaining time for the Democrats.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of our time.\n\n[[Page S1568]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question occurs on adoption of the resolution.\n  Mr. PORTMAN.

Mr. President, briefly, the Senator from South Carolina \nand I discussed this announcement that Russia will begin withdrawing \nsome military forces from Syria. It obviously signals Vladimir Putin's \nbelief that he has bombed and killed enough of the opponents of the \nmurderous Assad regime to assure Assad's survival.\n  For 4 years, this administration--this President--stood by as the \nAssad regime slaughtered nearly half a million people in Syria. Then, \nwhen Assad appeared weak, it watched as Putin intervened militarily and \nprotected his brutal regime, in a move that the President described as \nPutin going into a ``quagmire.'' Well, apparently now Vladimir Putin is \nleaving that ``quagmire,'' and he is leaving a solid Bashar Assad in a \nposition of strength. He is leaving thousands of dead moderate \nopposition that he has indiscriminately bombed, and the United States \nhas their begging bowl out, asking and pleading that they somehow reach \nsome agreement again in Geneva.\n  It is really embarrassing to watch this President and this Secretary \nof State as they continue to beg Vladimir Putin and his stooge Lavrov \nas they continue to place Russia in a position of influence they have \nnot had since Anwar Sadat threw them out of Egypt in 1973.\n  They now have a major role to play in the Middle East. They have a \nmilitary base. They have a naval base. They have upgraded airfields, \nand they have now solidified Bashar Assad's position in power.\n  Is there anybody who believes that Russia will agree to an \narrangement that Bashar Assad or his stooge doesn't remain in power? Of \ncourse not. Aren't we tired of begging Vladimir Putin? Aren't we tired \nof watching the United States and the young men we trained and equipped \nbeing bombed by Vladimir Putin and killed and murdered? Don't we \nsometimes grow a little tired of that? It is no wonder that the United \nStates of America has no standing and no influence in the region.\n  I don't often quote from the New York Times. I would ask my colleague \nif he has seen this:\n\n       The Russian move may . . . be a reflection that Mr. Putin \n     is now supremely confident in Mr. Assad's renewed stability \n     and can afford to step back a bit and play statesman. Mr. \n     Putin has achieved many of his main goals: bringing Russia \n     back to center stage as a global power; preventing, on \n     principle, regime change by outside powers, particularly \n     Western ones; gaining a stronger foothold in Syria; picking \n     off Russian jihadists on the Syrian battlefield; and \n     strengthening Mr. Assad.\n\n  I wish to ask my friend from South Carolina: Isn't it obvious what is \ngoing to happen next; and that is, an increase in fighting in eastern \nUkraine, more Ukrainians slaughtered while we refuse to give them \ndefensive weapons, but just sufficient amount of violence and killing \nto prevent the United States of America or the Europeans from taking \nany significant action? Indeed, won't there now be pressure on the part \nof the special interests and the industrialists, particularly in \nGermany, to lift the sanctions on Vladimir Putin?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I think you are right, I say to Senator McCain.\n  Let's look at what our military leaders say rather than just look at \nwhat political people think. General Dunford, the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, in a hearing you chaired today was asked: What is \nPutin up to? What do you think he is trying to do here?\n  He said: Well, all I can tell you is the reason he came into Syria \nwas to destroy ISIL and help fight ISIL. He has proven that he did not \ndo that. He didn't try to do that.\n  So what General Dunford said was that basically Putin lied about why \nhe came to Syria. If he is leaving Syria, the job against ISIL is far \nfrom done. But I think you nailed it, I say to Senator McCain. The job \nof propping up Assad has been accomplished.\n  So what General Dunford said is that the reason that Putin came into \nSyria was not to destroy ISIL but to help his stooge, his puppet Assad. \nHe believes he achieved such military superiority on behalf of Assad by \nbombing the people we trained that he can now leave.\n  So at the end of the day, he is not leaving. A naval base and an air \nforce base will be in Syria. He said: We are withdrawing our forces, \nbut, of course, we will have a naval presence and an air base.\n  Here is what I would say. If he needs to help Assad in the future, he \nwill. Geneva has become a joke. There is no way you are going to \nnegotiate a successful agreement when Assad is backed by Russia and \nIran. The opposition has been abandoned by the United States and the \nfree world. The Russian President has bombed the people the American \nPresident trained to take Assad out.\n  Mr. McCAIN. What does the Senator from South Carolina think that does \nto our reputation when we arm, train, and equip young men, send them in \nto fight, ostensibly against ISIS or Bashar Assad--although, in this \ncase ISIS--and we stand by and watch the Russians slaughter them from \nthe air?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I think it sends a signal that you can't rely upon us. \nYou have two training programs--one by the CIA and one by the \nDepartment of Defense. The people trained outside the Department of \nDefense have been wholesale slaughtered by the Russian air attacks, and \nwe have done nothing about it.\n\n[[Page S1569]]\n\n  What does the region say? We have two enemies--Assad and ISIL. Our \nunwillingness to confront Assad has created a sense of abandonment in \nthe entire region. Assad is a puppet of Iran. Iran is the mortal enemy \nof the Sunni Arab states.\n  So what has the President accomplished here? He said Assad must go. \nHe trained people to help take him down. Russia came in and said Assad \nwill not go. They have attacked the people we have trained, and we \nbasically have abandoned the free Syrian opposition.\n  Now we are in Geneva talking about a peace agreement where the whole \nbalance now is in Assad's favor. Does anybody really believe there is \nmilitary jeopardy for Assad? And without his being in jeopardy, how do \nyou get an agreement the Syrian people can live with? If Assad or his \nhenchmen stay in power, how do you ever end the war in Syria?\n  So what we have accomplished is that we have given the Russians more \ninfluence in the Mideast than at any time since 1973. We have allowed \nIran basically to dictate the terms in Damascus. We have jeopardized \nour relationship with our Arab partners. We have put in question \nAmericans' reliability in terms of the people inside of Syria.\n  The Syrian policy of Barack Obama has done enormous damage. Without \nRussia being involved, none of this would have happened.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The tragedy of all of this, I would say to my friend, is \nthat when the United States of America was required to stand up because \nof the commitment of the President of the United States if the Bashar \nAssad regime had used chemical weapons and slaughtered--it is the \ngruesome pictures that you and I have seen--and then backed off, that \nwas one of the seminal moments that American credibility disappeared. \nHere we are now still refusing to arm, train, and equip young men to \nfight against Bashar Assad and, in fact, making them pledge that they \nwould only fight against ISIS. It is not ISIS that is barrel-bombing \nthem. It is not ISIS that is dropping chemical weapons. It is not ISIS \nthat has brought in thousands and tortured and beaten and killed. ISIS \nis our enemy. ISIS is evil. But to somehow excuse the behavior of \nBashar Assad with the Russians' indiscriminate bombing is one of the \nmost disgraceful chapters in American history in my view.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. To build on this, several years ago Russia took by force \nCrimea. This was not a fair election. It is pretty hard to have a fair \nelection when there is a Russian tank parked in front of your yard. \nGood luck saying you don't want to go to Russia.\n  We have done nothing other than sanction Russia. Russia is still \nengaged in provocative behavior. We told him not to go into Crimea. We \ntold him not to dismember Ukraine. He did. He is stronger, not weaker. \nWe told him not to use military force to help Assad, who is the Butcher \nof Damascus. He did. We pleaded with him not to attack non-ISIL \ntargets. He did. He destroyed the opposition to Assad. Russia is in \nleague with Iran. So the biggest winner of Russia's involvement on the \nground in Syria has been the Iranians, which is the most destabilizing \ngroup of people in the entire Mideast. The biggest loser has been the \nfree Syrian opposition, the Syrian people themselves, and close behind \nis the American reputation in the region.\n  I want the administration to know that your handling of Syria has \nbeen a disaster on multiple levels. It has emboldened Iran. It has made \nRussia stronger. We are losing credibility in the region at a time when \nthe region needs leadership. If you go to Geneva and you close out a \npeace deal that is a joke that allows Assad or somebody--Bob Assad, not \nBashar Assad--to stay in power, if you allow a peace agreement where \nthe Iranians control Damascus and Russia has a naval and air force base \nand more influence than we do, what have you accomplished?\n  I hope and pray the administration will stop this insane desire to \nbring Syria to a conclusion where the conclusion is going to make the \nwhole region subject to blowing up. A successful conclusion is not \nhaving Iran being the dominant force inside of Syria, Russia having \nmore influence, an air base and a naval base, and the Syrian people \nlosing the ability to replace their tormenter, and ISIL having a magnet \nfor future recruitment, which is an Iranian-backed Assad. That is not a \nsuccessful outcome.\n  What do you think, I ask Senator McCain?\n  Mr. McCAIN. For the last 5 years, we have been writing a shameful \nchapter in American history. To sum all of this up, leading from behind \ndoesn't work. If America leads from behind, somebody else is going to \nbe in front. If the United States leaves conflicts and creates vacuums, \nthen bad things happen.\n  Look at a map of the Middle East in January of 2009, when this \nPresident came to the Presidency of the United States, and look at that \nmap now--the way ISIS has metastasized, the way hundreds of thousands \nhave been murdered and millions are on the march as refugees. We still \nhave apologists for this leading from behind, a policy which is \ndescribed as ``Don't do stupid stuff.'' This is the result of \nleadership that has left the scene in a way that we have not seen since \nthe 1930s, in the days of Neville Chamberlain and ``peace in our \ntime.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week the Iranian Revolutionary Guard \nCorps, or IRGC--the hard-line military force that answers only to \nIran's Supreme Leader and is committed to the preservation of Iran's \nrevolutionary regime--launched a number of ballistic missiles, in clear \nviolation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231. These \nmissile launches are profoundly disturbing and suggest a regime that is \ncontent on continuing to destabilize the region and threaten our vital \nallies and its neighbors. They don't technically violate the terms of \nlast summer's nuclear agreement, but they do serve as a vital reminder \nthat Iran remains a revolutionary regime that does not respect world \nopinion and does not share our values or interests.\n  America and our allies must seek every opportunity to push back on \nIran's aggressive behavior--especially behavior such as this that is \noutside the parameters of the nuclear deal--by enforcing existing \nsanctions on Iran's illegal ballistic missile tests, its ongoing human \nrights abuses, and its support for terrorism across the Middle East and \nthe world.\n  Another critical way the international community can demonstrate we \nare serious about holding Iran accountable is by aggressively enforcing \nthe terms of the nuclear deal. Today I will discuss a key element of \nenforcing that deal: fully funding the International Atomic Energy \nAgency, IAEA, the world's nuclear watchdog, which is responsible for \nmonitoring Iran's compliance with the deal. The case for providing \nrobust, sustainable funding for the IAEA is further strengthened by a \nsecond topic I will discuss, which is Iran's continued human rights \nabuses.\n  Iran's compliance with the nuclear deal so far does not mean that its \ngovernment intends to embrace the international community or heed the \ncall of the Iranian people for greater democracy. In fact, I believe \nthe actions of the IRGC and Iran's hard-line conservative leaders \nindicate that the Iranian regime intends to continue to repress \ndissent, block democratic reforms, incite anti-Semitism, and violate \nbasic human rights.\n  Mr. President, in a speech to the United Nations in December of 1953, \nPresident Eisenhower proclaimed American support for a new \ninternational organization tasked with putting nuclear technology \n``into the hands of those who will know how to strip its military \ncasing and adapt it to the arts of peace.''\n  Since its founding in 1957, the IAEA has undertaken a broad array of \nresponsibilities--from promoting international nonproliferation efforts \nto supporting peaceful nuclear power--but none more vital than \nmaintaining its safeguards program, which provides\n\n[[Page S1570]]\n\ncredible assurances that countries are honoring their international \nobligations to use nuclear technology and material only for peaceful \npurposes.\n  The IAEA could not do its job without the ongoing full support of the \nUnited States. The United States develops the inspections technology on \nwhich the IAEA depends. We train and support the IAEA inspectors, \nscientists, and staff, particularly through our system of National \nLaboratories. Since 1980, every single IAEA inspector has been trained \nat least once at the Los Alamos National Lab in New Mexico. At any \ngiven time, roughly 20 percent of all the inspectors who work for the \nIAEA are undergoing training or retraining at the vital National Labs \nof the United States.\n  The commitment made by American scientists and taxpayers to the IAEA \nis even more important now in light of the agreement reached by world \npowers last summer to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. \nThis agreement, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan Of Action, \nor JCPOA, gives the IAEA unprecedented access to monitor Iran's nuclear \nefforts through highly intrusive physical inspections and 24-7 remote \nmonitoring technology. Unlike previous nuclear agreements, the JCPOA \nrequires Iran to allow the IAEA to monitor Iran's entire nuclear fuel \ncycle, which includes all the steps required to go from mining and \nmilling raw uranium to producing centrifuges that enrich uranium, to \nthe actual enrichment sites.\n  The IAEA's regular inspections and continuous monitoring and \noversight mean that the international community will know if Iran tries \nto cheat on the terms of the JCPOA before it can dash to a nuclear \nweapon or build a bomb in secret. But access alone is not enough. The \nIAEA must have the resources to actually inspect, monitor, and verify \nIran's compliance with the nuclear deal by confirming that Iran's \nnuclear declarations are accurate and comprehensive, by monitoring \ntheir declared sites to ensure Iran's behavior actually complies with \nthe terms of the JCPOA, and by tracking all nuclear-related material \nleaving every facility to make sure Iran doesn't divert and pursue \nillicit nuclear activities elsewhere in their country.\n  Given Iran's long record of cheating and of pursuing nuclear weapons \nillicitly over the decades past, investing resources in ensuring that \nthe IAEA can take advantage of this unprecedented opportunity is a wise \ninvestment not just for the American people but for the world. To \nfulfill these responsibilities in addition to its regular and ongoing \nmission of ensuring nonproliferation in every other country in the \nworld, the IAEA must have the resources to turn access into oversight.\n  Back in January, I traveled with seven other Senators to the IAEA's \nheadquarters in Vienna, Austria, and there we heard directly from \nDirector General Yukiya Amano about the challenges the agency faces in \nfulfilling its new responsibilities under the JCPOA. At the top of that \nlist of challenges is securing a reliable, long-term source of funding. \nA recent report by our own nonpartisan Government Accountability Office \nhere in the United States echos those very same concerns, stating that \n``the IAEA faces potential budgetary and human resource management \nchallenges stemming from the JCPOA-related workload.''\n  Effectively enforcing the terms of the JCPOA will require more than \njust additional inspectors, while inspectors are vital; the IAEA will \nalso be required to train a new generation of nuclear scientists and to \ncontinue to develop more and more innovative nuclear detection and \nmonitoring technologies as well--an undertaking as complex as it is \nimportant. That is why I urge Congress to increase America's voluntary \ncontribution to the IAEA to a level at least $10.6 million above the \nPresident's fiscal year 2017 request and commit to a sustained and \nlong-term investment so that we can be confident that the IAEA has the \nresources to recruit, to train, and to place the very best inspectors \nthe world can produce. The increase of $10.6 million that I am urging \nwill provide reliable funding for the IAEA--the funding they need to \nmonitor the Iran nuclear program while continuing to work for safe, \nsecure, and peaceful use of nuclear technology throughout the rest of \nthe world.\n\n  An additional $10 million would not crowd out contributions from \nother states. American representatives at the U.N. offices in Vienna \ncould direct extra funding to specific projects or withhold it from \nothers, allowing us to address unanticipated needs by the IAEA without \ndiscouraging other donors from fulfilling their obligations as they \nshould.\n  We also need to continue to insist on full transparency so that \nreports received by the IAEA, things they might learn, are shared with \nthe United States--with our intelligence community, with our lawmakers, \nwith our executive branch--and to ensure, frankly, that we know if \nthere are additional classified or secret agreements, side agreements \nbetween the IAEA and Iran.\n  Look, whether my colleagues supported the JCPOA or opposed it, surely \nwe can agree that it is in America's interest to see the IAEA succeed \nin monitoring Iran's behavior and attracting the best and brightest \nyoung scientists from around the world for years to come. As Brent \nScowcroft--who served ably as National Security Advisor to both \nPresident Gerald Ford and later President George H.W. Bush--wrote in an \nAugust 21 Washington Post op-ed, Congress ``should ensure that the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency and other relevant bodies and U.S. \nintelligence agencies have all the resources necessary to facilitate \ninspection and monitor compliance'' with the nuclear deal with Iran.\n  To fully and sustainably fund the IAEA is to make a sound investment \nin a highly technical organization that directly contributes to \ninternational peace and our security. But why exactly is it so \nimportant that we fund the IAEA, enforce the JCPOA, and push back on \nIran at every opportunity? A brief review of Iran's dismal human rights \nrecord might reenforce why it is crystal clear that this is a priority \nfor our Nation and must remain so.\n  Iran's Government continues to preach anti-Semitism, to incite hatred \nagainst Israel, and to call for the destruction of the Jewish State of \nIsrael, and it uses state-run media to blame the Jewish people for the \ninstability and violence that currently dominates the Middle East. Just \nlast week, one of the ballistic missiles Iran illegally launched \nsupposedly had a message printed on the side in Hebrew saying, ``Israel \nmust be wiped off the earth.''\n  In January, as the international community marked Holocaust \nRemembrance Day, Iran's Supreme Leader published a video on his \nofficial Web site in which the narrator condemns the world for \nsupporting Israel and questions the legitimacy and magnitude of the \nHolocaust. These statements should deeply concern and outrage the world \ncommunity, but they are simply another reflection of the Iranian \nregime's longstanding disregard for international values and human \nrights.\n  Earlier this month, the United Nations issued a report showing that \nthe number of people executed by the Iranian Government skyrocketed to \nnearly 1,000 last year--twice as many as in 2010 and 10 times as many \nas in 2005. Most of these executions were allegedly for drug-related \noffenses. According to some reports, last year one village in Iran saw \nevery single adult male--every single one in the entire village--\nexecuted for so-called drug crimes.\n  These alarming statistics follow a January report from Amnesty \nInternational that documented Iran's execution of over 70 juveniles in \nthe decade from 2005 to 2015, with another 160 young juvenile offenders \nstill on death row. No country in the world uses capital punishment for \nminors more than Iran. And despite Iran's ratification of an \ninternational treaty banning capital punishment for minors, Iranian law \nstill allows the death penalty for girls as young as 9 and boys as \nyoung as 15.\n  In addition, Iran's unelected Guardian Council suppressed democracy \nin its most recent elections, preventing the vast majority of either \nfemale or reform-minded candidates from even appearing on ballots.\n  Iran has illegally and inappropriately detained American citizens, \nincluding retired FBI agent Robert Levinson and Iranian American energy \nexecutive Siamak Namazi--both of whom we believe remain detained in \nIran. The Committee to Protect Journalists estimates that at least 19 \nreporters are\n\n[[Page S1571]]\n\ntoday still being held unjustly by the Iranian Government.\n\n  These are just a few examples among countless many of Iran's \nunwillingness to respect even the most basic norms of international \nhuman rights. Effectively pushing back on these egregious human rights \nabuses and enforcing the JCPOA demands international collaboration, but \nincreasing our voluntary contribution to the IAEA makes a direct impact \nwithout requiring approval or action by any other country.\n  There are two other additional unilateral steps this Congress can \ntake today.\n  First, we could increase Federal investment in our National \nLaboratories, which train the IAEA inspectors I spoke about, develop \ntechnologies that nuclear inspectors depend on, and undertake research \nthat improves the lives of people around the world.\n  Second, and more promptly, the Senate could and should confirm Laura \nHolgate, a nonproliferation expert who was nominated more than 5 months \nago to serve as America's Ambassador to the U.N. agencies of Vienna, \nwhich includes the IAEA. After months of delays for purely political \nreasons, her nomination was finally approved by the Foreign Relations \nCommittee on January 28. The full Senate should not delay any further \nto ensure that our government is represented at the very organization \nthe world relies upon to prevent Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon.\n  Later this month, the President will convene heads of state from \naround the world for a fourth Nuclear Security Summit, a conference \ndedicated to preventing nuclear terrorism and securing stockpiles of \nnuclear material from around the world. The IAEA is at the very \nforefront of this vital mission, and we need to work together to make \nsure it has the tools it needs to take on these serious tasks.\n  These goals demand involvement from every actor on the international \nstage, but by increasing America's voluntary contribution to the IAEA \nby an additional $10 million, Congress can send a strong signal that we \nintend to hold Iran to the terms of the JCPOA, to support the \ninternational cause of nonproliferation, and to provide a vital \nincentive for our international partners to dedicate more of their \nresources to this important agency.\n  Iran remains today a revolutionary regime fundamentally opposed to \nAmerica's values and interests. Iran's ballistic missile tests just \nlast week serve as another reminder that the Iranian Government is \nneither America's friend nor ally. We must be relentless in our efforts \nto push back on these missile tests, on Iran's destabilizing support \nfor terrorism, and on its human rights abuses. We must continue to \nenforce the existing sanctions in American law and be willing to \nconsider imposing new ones when Iran's behavior warrants it.\n  Let me be clear about one thing in closing. The Persian culture, the \nculture of the people of Iran, is one of great richness and complexity. \nI have had the blessing of knowing many Persian Americans in my life \nand have known them to be people of great intellect and inventiveness \nand capability and to be the products of an ancient and respectable \nculture. We in the United States do not wish the people of Iran ill, \nbut the Iranian regime and those who support it deserve international \ncondemnation for a decades-long pattern of human rights abuses, support \nfor terrorism, and other bad behavior. But we can and should make a \ndistinction between the Iranian regime and the Persian people.\n  The people of Iran--those who turn out at polls to vote even in \nelections that are neither free nor fair and who have repeatedly \ndemonstrated in the streets for democracy and engagement, risking life \nand limb to do so in the decade past--must know that the American \npeople support the struggle of those who hope for real democracy \nsomeday in Iran and those who hope for an Iranian regime that someday \nrespects international values and human rights.\n  So today, just a few days before Monday's Iranian New Year of Nowruz, \nwe wish the people of Iran a happy, healthy, and peaceful new year, \nwhile continuing to stand firm against the values and actions of the \nIranian regime.\n  Thank you.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I am trying to assess the financial and \neconomic challenges facing Puerto Rico, an issue I have been speaking \nabout since last summer. In fact, it was July of last year when I first \nwrote to Treasury Secretary Lew, expressing my concern about the fiscal \nsituation in Puerto Rico and inquiring about the Obama administration's \nplans to address this predicament. While I did eventually get a \nresponse from the Treasury Secretary, numerous questions that I asked \nin that initial letter to this day remain unanswered.\n  Over the ensuing months, I made other inquiries to Health and Human \nServices Secretary Burwell because, for some time now, we have been \ntold that funding--or to be more specific, a decline in funding--for \nFederal health care programs was a factor contributing to Puerto Rico's \ndebt crisis. So as the chairman of the Senate committee of jurisdiction \nover most of those programs, I wanted to know what HHS thought needed \nto be done.\n  Not surprisingly, I am still waiting for a substantive response to \nthose inquiries.\n  Instead of detailed proposals, I was initially told simply that \nhealth funding issues surrounding Puerto Rico are difficult and that \nthe administration expected Congress to address these issues in a \nfiscally responsive way--and to do it quickly.\n  Eventually, last month, with the release of the President's budget \nproposal, we learned that the administration wants to provide $30 \nbillion--that is with a ``b''--in additional Medicaid funds for Puerto \nRico. When asked how the administration thought we should pay for this, \nSecretary Burwell suggested we simply adopt the President's budget. \nHowever, given that there are more surviving members of The Beatles \nthan there are Senators willing to vote in favor of an Obama budget, I \ndon't know if anyone can take that suggestion very seriously.\n  That is the sum total of the input we have gotten from the \nadministration on dealing with Puerto Rico's health funding issues--a \nproposal for dramatically increased spending with no credible way to \npay for it and a demand that we provide that funding as quickly as \npossible. That is all they are willing to say publicly on this matter, \neven though administration officials have labeled this a humanitarian \ncrisis.\n  By the way, buried in all of the details is the fact that this \nproposal for increased Medicaid funds is meant to shore up an inequity \ncreated by the so-called Affordable Care Act. Apparently, the \nDemocrats' partisan health law provided billions in additional Medicaid \nfunding for Puerto Rico, but also included a cliff--or a point in time \nwhen that funding would drop off quickly and dramatically--and that \ncliff is fast approaching.\n  Let's be clear: The Democrats constructed that cliff, presumably \nknowing what they were doing at that time. The Democrats in Congress \nvoted for it, and the Democrat in the White House signed it into law. \nNo Republican in Congress supported that cliff.\n  Yet, now we are told that we must act quickly to eliminate the cliff \nthat they have created and add even more funds without a realistic way \nto pay for them. And, on top of that, Democrats in Congress have \nlabeled any hesitation on the part of Republicans to fix a problem they \ncreated and to fix it in the exact way they prescribe as callous \nindifference toward the plight of the American citizens living in \nPuerto Rico.\n  I have been as clear as I can be on this issue. I have said \nrepeatedly that I want to work with my colleagues to find a solution, \nbut we need to do so in a manner that is fiscally responsible with an \neye toward righting the irresponsible course taken by the Government of \nPuerto Rico.\n\n[[Page S1572]]\n\n  Toward that end, I, along with a number of my colleagues, have \nrepeatedly requested audited financial statements from the Government \nof Puerto Rico. One would think that is a reasonable request. These \nrequests date back to last September with the first hearing I held on \nthese issues in the Finance Committee. That was six months ago, yet we \nstill don't have that information from fiscal year 2014, let alone \n2015.\n  In addition, last month I wrote a 9-page letter to the Governor of \nPuerto Rico, asking a number of questions about Puerto Rico's finances, \nand I asked that they be answered by the first of this month. I have \nreceived no answers to these questions.\n  In the face of a humanitarian crisis, it seems to be too much to ask \nof the Government of Puerto Rico that they provide some verifiable \nfinancial information so that Congress can make an informed decision \nabout how to handle this very difficult situation. And, apparently, \nsome of my friends on the other side of the aisle are ready and willing \nto spend tens of billions of dollars in taxpayer funds without all the \nrelevant information and to publicly attack anyone who questions that \nstrategy.\n  So far, my friends on the Democratic side, including Members of \nCongress and the administration, have been generally unwilling to \nprovide even the most basic information about how much their various \nproposals for Puerto Rico would cost the Federal Government or whether \nthey intend to offset those undisclosed costs. And none of them show an \ninterest in even discussing ways to help Puerto Rico return to a more \nsustainable fiscal and economic course. Yet they repeatedly have the \naudacity to accuse Republicans of indifference to the struggles faced \nby the residents of Puerto Rico. Sometimes I feel as though I am all \nalone, trying to solve this problem without any help from the other \nside, and there are even difficult times on our side.\n  The absurdity of this debate, if that is what we want to call it, is \ncompounded by the fact that the only practical and fiscally responsible \nlegislation introduced in Congress to address these issues has come \nfrom Republicans.\n  As most of my colleagues should know, even with the severely \nincomplete information we have, Senators Grassley and Murkowski, who \nchair the Judiciary and Natural Resources Committees, and I have \nintroduced a bill that would provide some tax relief and fully offset \nfunds to Puerto Rico for transition assistance as well as an oversight \nauthority to help ensure that Puerto Rico establishes credible budgets \nand future fiscal plans. Our bill provides the platform needed for \nsustained economic growth and a return of access to credit markets.\n  However, neither the administration nor any of my friends on the \nother side of the aisle have shown much interest in discussing the \nsubstance of our bill. One would think they would want me to bring it \nup, and if they wanted to amend it, they could amend it. We have to do \nthis. We can't just play around with this. Instead, we have seen the \naforementioned proposals to send tens of billions of dollars in health \nfunds to Puerto Rico, no questions asked, and a proposed bankruptcy \nscheme that my colleagues have misleadingly claimed would simply give \nPuerto Rico access to chapter 9 debt relief--the same access we give to \nevery municipality in the country.\n  Of course, as I have made clear on a number of occasions, the so-\ncalled chapter 9 access they are seeking for Puerto Rico doesn't really \nresemble the actual chapter 9 of the current Bankruptcy Code. In \nreality, their proposal would create, for lack of a better word, a \nsuper chapter 9 specifically for Puerto Rico and grant the territory \nunprecedented authority to restructure its debt. And that is the \nterritory not having a special supervisory board to make sure they do \nrestructure its debt.\n  Before I say more about the super chapter 9 proposal, I just want to \nmake clear that I and others have been working for quite some time now \nto find an agreeable solution to these problems. We have done so even \nwhile the Government of Puerto Rico refuses to provide anything \nresembling a complete picture of its finances, which, it seems to this \nSenator, ought to be the first thing that is done.\n\n  I have been working with colleagues in both the House and the Senate \nto explore legislative options. And while I don't want to speak for \nanyone else at the moment, I will say we have been willing to consider \nvarious debt restructuring mechanisms for Puerto Rico, balancing the \nneed for fairness and equal treatment for similarly situated parties.\n  However, as we consider various approaches, I want to make three \nthings perfectly clear.\n  First, the Government of Puerto Rico must negotiate in good faith \nwith its creditors, and creditors must do the same with Puerto Rico. It \nwould be a mistake for officials in Puerto Rico to hold out or drag \ntheir feet on good-faith bargaining efforts in an anticipation of \ncongressional action.\n  Second, contrary to claims made by some of my colleagues, none of us \nhave any interest in helping out the ``vultures'' or ``speculators'' \nlooking to profit out of the misery created in Puerto Rico. If anyone \nuncovers illegal actions taken by investors in Puerto Rico, then by all \nmeans they should be prosecuted. If anyone can identify any investors \nwhose actions are clearly predatory and unethical, we should all rain \nshame upon them. And, if former Federal Government officials who travel \nthrough the revolving door of the administration are found to be unduly \nenriching themselves off of Puerto Rico's plight, their actions should \nbe brought to light. I have no qualms with any of that because my goal \nand the goal of my Republican colleagues is to provide sensible and \nreasonable solutions to help the people living in Puerto Rico.\n  However, this does bring me to my third point. Innocent and ethical \ninvestors from Utah, New York, New Jersey, and every other State in the \nUnion, as well as good-faith investors in Puerto Rico, should not be \ncasually labeled as ``vultures'' or ``speculators'' and should be \ntreated as any other similarly situated investor. A retiree or near-\nretiree in Sandy, UT, who invested part of her retirement savings in \nPuerto Rican debt instruments, which carry Federal tax preferences, is \nno less deserving of repayment than any other similarly situated \nclaimant. It is easy to make exaggerated claims that the bondholders \nare all rich people; they are not. Thousands and thousands, if not \nhundreds of thousands, are average people who have trusted the bonds.\n  Teresa and Julio Garcia, who are residents of Puerto Rico, along with \nother middle-class Puerto Ricans who own a significant share of Puerto \nRico's debt, are certainly not vultures and don't deserve unequal \ntreatment. Residents of Puerto Rico who are retired or near retirement \nand who are numbered among Puerto Rico's bondholders, but don't happen \nto receive public pensions, do not deserve to see their savings \ndepleted in order to favor certain public pension benefits in Puerto \nRico. To some, that last example may seem oddly specific; however, if \nyou look at the super chapter 9 proposals put forward by Democrats, the \nintent to favor public pensions over private bondholders--even those \nwhose retirement savings are invested in those bonds--is explicit. What \nis wrong with worrying about private bondholders who are like Julio and \nhis wife?\n  Regarding those public pensions, it is true that Puerto Rico tried to \nreform the retirement systems for its government employees and did end \nup making some lasting changes from one of its programs. Nonetheless, \nthe territory has not followed through on some aspects of the reforms \nit did make, and even in the face of dire fiscal conditions, some of \nPuerto Rico's major public pension systems remain unchanged. And for my \nfriends on the other side, it appears that any effort to encourage \nPuerto Rico to substantially improve its public pension systems as the \nisland restructures some of its debt would be out of the question. That \njust can't be.\n  Madam President, as we see increasingly large municipal bankruptcies \nand States with mounting fiscal pressures, severely underfunded public \npensions almost always seem to be lurking in the background. Until now, \nDetroit was probably the biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history, \nwith a debt of around $18 billion. Now Puerto Rico is coming to \nCongress for help to deal with $73 billion of debt and $43 billion of \nshockingly unfunded public pension obligations, bringing the total to \nmore than $115 billion.\n\n[[Page S1573]]\n\n  It would be beyond irresponsible to offer aid to Puerto Rico without \ntaking at least some action to improve public pension reporting and \ntransparency. Given the growing crisis of underfunded public pensions \naround the country, which I have been warning my colleagues about for \nyears now, taking no action will ensure that States and municipalities \nthat have been responsible with their pensions and their fiscal \nplanning will see their costs go up as a result of the bad and \nimprudent actors. On this point, officials of the Securities and \nExchange Commission and municipal market analysts overwhelmingly agree: \nIncreased transparency on public pension liabilities is clearly \nnecessary.\n  Earlier this week, while our bicameral work to produce passable \nlegislation to address the problems in Puerto Rico has progressed, some \nof my friends on the other side of the aisle decided to chime in once \nagain with another round of implausible policy proposals and fresh \npolitical attacks. The latest group of bills introduced by Democrats \nincludes a number of repackaged ideas from last year, including \nunscored and unsound proposals to allocate funds and direct aid as well \nas a renewed effort to grant unprecedented debt resolution authority \nfor Puerto Rico. The only real difference between the ideas we have \nseen already and those that were included in the bills this week is \nthat Democrats are apparently now willing to be upfront about the fact \nthat the debt resolution authority they are seeking isn't just the same \nchapter 9 everyone else has, but an entirely new animal altogether.\n\n  Last year, my friends on the other side had a bill to provide Puerto \nRico with an ability to apply chapter 9 debt resolution authority on a \nretroactive basis. The reasoning and rhetoric behind the bill was that \nmunicipalities in every State have access, and so should Puerto Rico--\nnever mind the retroactivity.\n  Now, however, the goalposts are being moved. My friends have now \nintroduced their super chapter 9 bankruptcy scheme devised by \nadministration officials. Of course, this new super chapter 9 is not \nsomething available to other municipalities or States. It is, in fact, \nwithout precedent. It includes virtually all government debt in Puerto \nRico and blows right through a payout protection afforded to general \nobligation debt that is in Puerto Rico's Constitution. This not only \nsteps directly on Puerto Rico's autonomy, but it also sends dangerous \nsignals by telling municipal bond markets to no longer regard general \nobligation debt issued by States as being safe, as previously expected. \nThat, of course, means higher costs to States for funding things like \ninfrastructure projects, and it is something that many State Governors \nhave said they worry about and do not support. Needless to say, this \nfreshly constructed bankruptcy scheme is extremely risky. Though my \nfriends are now being transparent about the relief they want, it \ndoesn't make their proposals any more palatable.\n  The bills introduced this week include proposals beyond the super \nchapter 9 proposal. While these ideas are not at all new, it is worth \ntaking a few minutes to go through them individually.\n  First, we have provisions, as poorly constructed this year as they \nwere last year, calling for additional Medicare and Medicaid funds for \nPuerto Rico.\n  Second, we have proposals to extend parts of the U.S. personal income \ntax system that provide direct aid to U.S. taxpayers to people in \nPuerto Rico, excluding any part that requires positive tax payment. \nResidents of Puerto Rico do not file Federal income tax returns or pay \nany personal Federal income tax, yet my colleagues want the earned-\nincome tax credit and child tax credits to be paid out to residents of \nPuerto Rico. Of course, the Joint Committee on Taxation--the \nnonpartisan scorekeeper and adviser when it comes to tax policy--has \nalready indicated that such a scheme would be rife with administrative \ndifficulties and fraud. It is, at the very least, difficult and \ncounterintuitive to expect the IRS to properly operate an income tax \nprogram for people that are not subject to the income system to start \nwith. However, that doesn't seem to faze my friends on the other side.\n  Third, we have a control board to oversee the restructuring of Puerto \nRico's debt that under the bill would be populated by Puerto Rican \npolitical appointees. That is one of the problems--the political \nappointees in Puerto Rico. Why don't they start thinking about all the \ntaxpayers in America? Clearly, the structure of this proposed control \nboard would subject any financial decisionmaking in Puerto Rico to the \nsame political wrangling that got the territory into this mess in the \nfirst place. Yet the obviousness of these problems seems to have \nescaped my colleagues.\n  As with last year, we do not know the precise cost of the health \nfunding and refundable tax credit proposals because my friends have not \nbeen interested in getting them scored or in disclosing how much they \ncost. Essentially, my colleagues want to have a debate about their \nproposals without any real discussion of what they will cost the \nAmerican taxpayers.\n  I have been here only about 39 years--actually, 40--but I think that \nis long enough to know that anyone who puts forward legislation \ndesigned specifically to throw taxpayer funds at a problem without \ndisclosing how much they actually want to spend isn't all that \ninterested in passing the legislation. Instead, what people tend to \nwant in those situations is to send a political message that they care \nabout a problem while the other side does not.\n  Perhaps I am wrong. Perhaps my friends on the other side do want to \nsee their proposals become law. If that is the case, they would be glad \nto know that I have worked with JCT and the Congressional Budget Office \nto get a ballpark figure on the cost of their proposals. All told, the \nprovisions put forward in the bill Senator Menendez and some of his \ncolleagues introduced this week would cost Federal taxpayers more than \n$45 billion, and probably closer to $50 billion, at least from what we \ncan tell from the legislative language, which is not the clearest I \nhave ever seen.\n  I can only assume that the administration does not support these \nbills, given that, in what little communication we have had with them \non these issues, they have consistently admonished us to address the \nPuerto Rico problem in a ``fiscally responsible way.'' I have a hard \ntime imagining any argument that the approaches proffered by my friends \nthis week would satisfy even the loosest definition of fiscal \nresponsibility, at least not until they come up with a semireasonable \nway to offset the $50 billion cost.\n  Once again, given all these ominous realities, I have to assume that \nthese bills are more about politics than solutions. As I said, people \nwho are serious about solving a problem typically don't propose tens of \nbillions of dollars in spending without actually disclosing the costs \nand talking about offsets. No, people who put out big ideas without a \nplausible path to get them enacted are usually more interested in \ntalking about a problem than they are in solving it and more interested \nin political posturing than actually helping people.\n  Let me say that again. People who put out big ideas without a \nplausible path to get them enacted are usually more interested in \ntalking about a problem than they are in solving it and more interested \nin political posturing than in actually helping people.\n  This Senator is not interested in the politics surrounding the crisis \nin Puerto Rico nor in what the polls say on this issue. I have been \nworking for some time now to craft a legislative solution that can \nactually pass because I am more interested in enhancing the lives and \nopportunities of our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico than I am on the \npolitical impact this debate could have between now and November. Since \nlast summer, well before almost anyone in Congress really began \nthinking about the challenges facing Puerto Rico and long before we \nsought any outlandish legislative proposal from our friends on the \nother side, I have been calling on my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to work with me to find serious and credible solutions to help \nthe people, not the politicians, in Puerto Rico.\n  I repeat that call today. If there is anyone who wants to put people \nfar out in front of politics and frankly address these problems instead \nof merely talking about them, my door remains open--wide open--and I \nhope some will walk through to help us get this done.\n\n[[Page S1574]]\n\n  I want to get this done. I believe the people of Puerto Rico deserve \nhaving it done, but it has to be done right, and it can't be done by \ngouging everybody else in America for profligacy and improper conduct \nin Puerto Rico.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/senate-section/article/S1574-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1574-S1577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FLINT, MICHIGAN, WATER CRISIS\n\n  Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I wish to talk about an issue my \ncolleague Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan and I have been working \non for 2 months. It is an issue that is sad and has been absolutely \ncatastrophic for people who live in our State, in the city of Flint.\n  In fact, today we had hundreds of folks from Flint come to \nWashington, DC, to attend a House hearing that was held to talk about \nwhat had happened in Flint and to get answers from the EPA \nAdministrator, as well as the Governor of Michigan. The folks came to \nmake sure their voices were heard in this tragedy, to make sure people \nwould see them as human beings who are being afflicted by this horrible \ntragedy. They are in a situation where they can't turn on their \ntapwater and have clean water, water free from lead.\n  I think many folks are aware of what happened. We had a situation \nwhere an unelected emergency manager was appointed by the Governor to \nsave dollars, to save money, and in the process contaminated a water \nsystem.\n  The decision was made to move away from clean Detroit water from the \nDetroit water system--water that comes from Lake Huron in the Great \nLakes--and move on a temporary basis until a new system could be put up \nand running that drew water from the Flint River. The Flint River was \nknown to be water that was very corrosive. In fact, General Motors had \nan engine plant along the Flint River and used Flint River water in \ntheir manufacturing process but found that the water was so corrosive \nthat it was damaging engine blocks. So they stopped using this water \nbecause of the damage it was doing to the manufacturing process, but, \nunfortunately, the unelected emergency manager and the State government \ndecided to use that water for the people of Flint as a source of \ndrinking water, and they did not put in the proper corrosion control \nchemicals that may have mitigated this disaster. As a result, this \nhighly corrosive water was going through the pipes, damaging the pipes, \nand released very large amounts of lead that has led to the \ncontamination of an entire water system.\n  This should have never happened. This is a disaster that was clearly \nmanmade. It was a result of negligence on the part of those folks who \nwere given the trust to run the system properly. Now we are left with \nan absolute catastrophe in the city.\n  Although every resident is hurt, there is no question that it is \nprimarily the children of Flint who have been impacted as a result. \nThat is what is so insidious about lead poisoning. Even though it will \neventually be flushed out of your body, if you are ingesting this when \nyou are young while your brain is still developing, it can have \npermanent brain damage. That damage can be mitigated, but it is going \nto require the use of wraparound education services. It is going to \nmake sure those children have proper nutrition and make sure they have \nhealth coverage, but certainly this is every resident in Flint, not \njust children but also the elderly and everybody who is a resident of \nthat city.\n  What has been so frustrating about this effort is that certainly we \nknow this is the State's responsibility. The State broke it. They need \nto fix it. The State needs to put substantial resources in place. The \nGovernor was here today talking about some of those efforts. He needs \nto do a whole lot more. Everybody agrees the State has to do a whole \nlot more, and taking responsibility means making sure the resources are \nthere to provide the services that are going to be necessary--not just \nnow but for what will likely be many decades in the future.\n  What I am concerned about, what the residents of the city of Flint \nare concerned about, is that although right now this issue has received \nnational attention and the eyes of the country are focused on Flint, \nthey know that sooner or later the TV cameras will go, that the lights \nwill not be shining on Flint, and people may forget what happened in \nFlint. However, the people of Flint will be left dealing with this \nproblem for decades to come. We cannot let that happen. These people \ncannot be forgotten. Certainly Senator Stabenow and I have been working \naggressively to hopefully force the Governor to create a future fund \nthat will provide resources for years to come for the people who have \nbeen impacted by this horrible crisis.\n  Even though this is a State responsibility and the State needs to \nstep up and do more, there is also a role for the Federal Government. \nWherever there has been a disaster anywhere in the country, the Federal \nGovernment has stepped up and helped those folks who have been the \nvictims of disaster. Some argue this is a manmade disaster, the Federal \nGovernment shouldn't be involved in it, and we only deal with natural \ndisasters, but I would just say ask the people of Flint: Does it matter \nwho actually caused this problem? Can we be there to help folks? They \ndon't care. They don't really care where it came from. They just know \ntheir children have been poisoned. They have ingested lead. They know \nthey can't use the water. Even now, although they have filters, a lot \nof them can't use the water. They are living on bottled water.\n  Today I had a woman named Gladys who came up to me. She traveled to \nWashington to tell her story. She brought a bag with hair in it. She is \nlosing her hair as a result of using some of this water. She can't use \nher home. She was in tears as she talked about the lost value of her \nhome, her entire life's savings in this house. Now she doesn't know \nwhat that house is worth because she is not sure whether the water is \nsafe to drink.\n  Folks in Flint don't care who caused this problem, they just need \nhelp. In the past, the Federal Government and this body, the Senate, \nhave always stepped up to help those in need. That is the right thing \nto do. That is what the American people expect us to do. The American \npeople look to make sure that they are always in a position to help \nthose in need. It is our values. It is who we are as a country. It is \nwho we are as a people. Yet it has been extremely difficult to get that \nhelp out of this body.\n  I am pleased to say that in the last 2 months we have made some \nprogress. Senator Murkowski of Alaska and Senator Inhofe of Oklahoma \nhave been great in working with Senator Stabenow and me. We have been \nable to build a list of cosponsors who are also helping us in this \neffort: Senator Burr, Senator Capito, Senator Kirk, and Senator \nPortman. A number of Senators have come together on both sides of the \naisle to say: Here is a solution we can get behind.\n  The proposal Senator Stabenow and I have worked on will provide money \nthrough the Safe Drinking Water Fund. It will provide grants for any \ncommunity that has an emergency. Any community, not just Flint, that \nfinds itself in an emergency of this kind could reaccess these \nresources. Although Flint is the only community right now that would \nqualify, we believe there are other communities that will likely \nqualify in the future. In fact, there may be some in a relatively short \nperiod of time.\n\n  It also creates a loan fund of potentially up to $700 million--\nperhaps even more--that every single community can access. This is an \nissue every community in our country may potentially face. With aging \ninfrastructure, we know there are incredible infrastructure needs that \nhave to be met, and the legislation we have worked on helps every \ncommunity of every single State deal with this very important issue.\n  It also addresses some of the health issues I mentioned earlier in my \ntalk--issues that help the children and the residents who have been \npoisoned by lead--by plussing up public health programs for lead \nabatement and helping the CDC do its great work to help folks.\n\n[[Page S1575]]\n\n  This is a commonsense proposal that addresses some of the pressing \nneeds in the city of Flint, while also addressing some of the pressing \nneeds we face as a country to make sure we are investing in water \ninfrastructure so that a citizen, no matter where they live or who they \nare, can turn on their tap and have clean drinking water come out of \nit.\n  We have also worked hard to address some of the concerns we heard \nfrom the other side of the aisle, in addition to the fact that this is \nopen to all communities, not just Flint. We also heard that folks \nwanted it paid for, and certainly Senator Stabenow and I believe that \nas well. So we are fiscally responsible. We found a pay-for in a \nprogram that deals with vehicle technology but one we thought was \nimportant to use to help the people of Flint and help water \ninfrastructure projects across the country.\n  The important thing about this, in addition to dealing with the \nproblem and in addition to its being completely paid for, is that it \nalso reduces the deficit. It will actually generate more money than is \nnecessary to pay for this bill and will reduce the deficit.\n  In the past, when we have had a national disaster such as the one we \nhave seen in Flint, normally we see emergency funds being used, as we \nhave done with bridge collapses and oil refinery fires and water main \nbreaks. Even though that is probably the best source to fund this--if \nyou treat the people of Flint like we treat other folks all around the \ncountry, we would use emergency funds--we went the extra distance to \ntake a fund and make sure it would completely pay for this program, \nwhile at the same time reducing the deficit.\n  We have done backflips and have worked with our colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle and have built support, and I believe if this bill \nwent to the floor, it would pass. I think it would pass by a good \nmargin. We believe we have very strong support for it. Yet here we are \ntoday, about ready to break for 2 weeks, and we are going to break \nwithout addressing this issue that has such strong bipartisan support. \nThis has been a work in progress for over 2 months. It is ready to be \nvoted on, yet we are going to leave without that vote.\n  We are going to leave because there is basically one Senator out \nthere who doesn't want to see it move forward--one Senator who doesn't \nreally like this proposal. I am not going to speak for that individual, \nbut they have their issues and they continually want more and more. The \nfolks who are suffering right now are the people of Flint. I wish that \none Senator who has the hold would have met with the people I met with \nthis morning and that Senator Stabenow and some of our other colleagues \nmet with this morning. I wish that Senator would have heard their \nstories, heard their anguish, and saw the tears in their eyes as they \ntalked about what they are dealing with. Yet this Senator continues to \nhave a hold.\n  Now, I understand the Senator may have a problem with a particular \npiece of legislation. That happens. We are not going to agree on \neverything. I would just ask that we allow this legislation to come to \nthe floor and the one Senator who has the hold--if he doesn't like the \nlegislation, that is fine--can vote no if he likes. That is certainly \nhis prerogative as an elected Member of this body--to vote no. But \nplease let the other 99 Senators in this body have a say. That is all \nwe are asking for. Put it on the floor and let this body make the final \ndecision as to whether or not this is an appropriate response to an \nabsolutely catastrophic disaster that has hit a community in this \ncountry of ours. I don't think that is asking a lot.\n  Now, I am a new Member here. I am new, but I cannot imagine that \nfolks here in the Senate will not allow legislation that is so \nimportant for people who have been impacted in such an extreme way to \ncome to the Senate Floor. What would our Founding Fathers think if they \nwere to look upon the Senate? They were concerned about factions and \npolitical parties and a body that would be paralyzed to really work on \nthe tough issues that our country was going to face. I can't imagine \nlooking in the eyes of our Founders and saying: The Senate--the \ndeliberative body, the body that is supposed to take up the really \ntough issues facing us as a country--refuses to act and refuses to even \nput it on the floor so it can be debated and voted upon.\n  So I will close and pass this on to my colleague, the senior Senator \nfrom Michigan, Ms. Stabenow, and let her continue. I am certainly \ndisappointed, and I would ask all of my colleagues to please join with \nus to work to get this to the floor so we can have a vote. The people \nof Flint cannot wait any longer. The rest of the country is looking at \nthe Senate and they are shaking their heads wondering why the Senate is \nincapable of putting this issue on the floor and having a simple up-or-\ndown vote.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, first I want to thank my partner and \ncolleague, Senator Peters, for his wonderful friendship and commitment \nto the people of Flint. We both share this. This has really become a \nsecond full-time job for us, given what has happened in Flint, in \nreaching out on behalf of the 9,000 children who are under the age of 6 \nwho have been exposed and the homes that have exposure of lead that is \nhigher than a toxic waste dump.\n  As a mom and now as a grandmother, I can't imagine what that must \nfeel like for the moms and dads and the grandpas and grandmas and the \nfear and horror they feel, as well as for the adults and the seniors \nwho are exposed and everyone who is paying a price. Certainly, the \nbusiness community is concerned now about people coming and doing \nbusiness and going to restaurants in the city of Flint, despite the \nfact that there is wonderful work going on downtown in rebuilding this \ncommunity. There are wonderful, exciting things happening, and now they \nhave really been knocked off their feet because of what has happened.\n  Across the way in the other Chamber today, there are hearings going \non. There is a lot of effort back and forth in talking about who is to \nblame for what happened. We certainly understand what happened, coming \nfrom Michigan, but I have to tell you that we are laser-focused on the \nfolks who had nothing to do with what happened--nothing to do with what \nhappened. These are the people of Flint, who assumed, like each one of \nus does, that when you get up in the morning and turn on the faucet, \nwhen you take a shower or you feed your children, clean water is going \nto come out of the pipes. We all assume that. That is pretty much a \nbasic human right, certainly in America. It may not be in other \ncountries, but it certainly is in America, where we assume that is the \ncase.\n  In America, when a community is struck by this kind of catastrophe--a \ncatastrophe they did not cause--we come together as Americans. That is \nwhat we do. We pitch in. We do what we can to help. That is what \nSenator Peters and I have been hoping to accomplish on behalf of the \npeople of Flint.\n  Since we have started debating these issues, we have found other \ncommunities as well that have challenges--none to the extent we are \nseeing in Flint, where 100,000 people and the entire city have been \nexposed to lead poisoning and the whole water system is in shambles. \nBut there are other communities that have challenges, and we believe it \nis important to help them as well. So we have come up with something, \nas Senator Peters said.\n  We have been working hard for the last 8 weeks to find a bipartisan \nplan--a compromise--that is not only fully paid for but out of \nsomething that I authored in the 2007 Energy bill, by the way. Because \nof the importance of this to the people of Flint, I said: OK, we will \ngive something we care about here. We will restructure it. We will \nshorten the time of the program, and we will pay for it out of that.\n  Senator Peters, when he was in the House, was the champion for this \nparticular advanced manufacturing loan program. We are saying: OK, we \nare willing to have that end in order to be able to pay for what is \nhappening in Flint. On top of a fully paid-for program out of a program \nthat Republican colleagues don't like--so we are going to be ending \nsomething that folks would like to end--tens of millions of dollars in \ndeficit reduction come along with this for the score. So it doesn't get \nany better than this.\n\n[[Page S1576]]\n\n  We were told to find something that is a pay-for that is not going to \ninfringe with what other people care about. We did that. We were told \nno earmarks. We did that. We were told no new programs built on current \nprograms. We did that. And we added deficit reduction. Yet the children \nof Flint are still waiting. The children of Flint--for the last 8 \nweeks--and their families are still waiting.\n  As Senator Peters said, we met some of these people this morning, and \nit just breaks your heart. People are looking at us and saying: OK, you \nhave been working on this and you have this bipartisan group; isn't \nthat great. But what is happening? The children of Flint are waiting.\n  So we are at a point where this has to stop. We need a vote. We need \na vote. We have a bipartisan bill, and we need a vote. We are at a \npoint where we need to have a vote and stop this ability of one person \nto just hold things up.\n  First, I want to thank our Republican colleagues as well as \nDemocratic colleagues who have been working with us. First of all, our \nmain Republican sponsor, the chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, Senator Inhofe, has been a true champion for \nsupporting water infrastructure investments nationally. I am so \ngrateful he came forward and offered the idea of not only being able to \nsupport Flint but to activate a financing program set up in the last \nwater resources bill that would address communities across the country \nas well. That is terrific. If we can help other communities, along with \nwhat we need to do to support the families of Flint, that is great. So \nwe thank him for his diligence. He has really stepped up, and we are so \ngrateful.\n  I want to thank the chair of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee and the ranking member, Senator Murkowski and Senator \nCantwell, who have been stellar. I can't count how many hours we have \ntalked on the phone, we have had meetings, and we have talked on the \nfloor, and the lengths to which both of them have been willing to go to \nsupport us in solving this problem. They have been wonderful--even as \nlate as a couple of hours ago in talking to us to figure out how we \ncould move forward both to address this water infrastructure bill to \nhelp Flint and other communities and also to move forward on the Energy \nbill. So we need to be doing both, and we are at a point where that \nneeds to get done.\n  We have 10 cosponsors of the bill, and I want to thank Senator \nPortman and Senator Brown, Senator Kirk, Senator Reed of Rhode Island, \nSenator Burr, Senator Durbin, Senator Boxer, Senator Mikulski, Senator \nCapito, and Senator Baldwin. People from both parties have come \ntogether to do something that will make things better for the families \nand the communities that we represent. There are a number of other \nMembers and staff who have been working behind the scenes. We are so \ngrateful for their kind words and encouragement and for the people who \nhave offered their support for what we are doing.\n  I particularly want to thank our appropriations leaders, Senator \nCochran and Senator Mikulski, for going the extra mile to figure out \nsome strategy that would satisfy the Senator from Utah to get beyond \nthis hold and to come together.\n  Unfortunately, despite strong bipartisan support and our best \nefforts, we find ourselves still in a spot, even though we have had \nconversations today--and I appreciate that, and folks say they still \nwant to work together, but it seems like we go round and round and \nround and round. We need to stop and have a vote at this point in time. \nAt one point, we thought we had agreement. As I said, we met again \ntoday. It would make sense in moving forward to offer the Senator the \nopportunity to have a second-degree amendment to our proposal. He has a \ndifferent idea on structuring that. We are willing to make the case, \nlet him make the case, and decide. That is what the Senate is about--\nhave a vote, decide.\n  The children of Flint need our help. Somehow this procedural stuff--\ntalking to folks about holds and cloture and all this--is not going to \nturn on the water in Flint. It is not going to help the children who \nhave already been exposed and their families. We need the sense of \nurgency they have.\n  When we look around the country--and, believe me, our focus is on \nFlint. Even though there are certainly other communities in Michigan \nwith water issues, others around the country, we are laser-focused on \nthe place where the water has been destroyed and the people have been \npoisoned because of a whole range of what happened, and people have not \nbeen able to take a bath or cook with water out of a tap or to be able \nto care for their children or themselves for almost 2 years.\n  It is also true that when we talk to colleagues in putting together \nthis bill, there are drinking water infrastructure needs around the \ncountry to be addressed. Utah will require $3.7 billion in drinking \nwater infrastructure over the next 20 years to meet minimum human \nhealth and safety requirements. In Jackson, MS, last month--after \nrandom samples showed lead levels above Federal action levels--the \nmayor issued a warning to pregnant women and children 5 years of age \nand younger to stay away from tapwater. The mayor also said: This is \nnot Flint because we are telling people about it and we are taking \naction, which, unfortunately, did not happen to protect the health and \nsafety of the people in Flint.\n  Last month in Crystal City, TX, there was black sludge water coming \nout of the faucet, and residents were warned to boil tapwater before \ndrinking it--in Texas. According to a recent survey by EPA, Texas will \nrequire nearly $34 billion in upgrades to its drinking water \ninfrastructure over the next 20 years to comply with minimum safety \nstandards.\n  Last month in Ohio, 13 water systems were under lead advisories. In \nSebring, OH, lab tests last August found unsafe levels of lead in \ndrinking water--and it took 5 months before the city told pregnant \nwomen and children not to drink the water and to shut down the taps and \nfountains in schools.\n  Just today, the USA TODAY network published a report that identified \nnearly 2,000 water systems where excessive lead levels have been \ndetected in the last 4 years, and they serve 6 million people.\n  Virginia Tech professor Marc Edwards recently again sounded the alarm \nabout lead pipes in Washington. In Cleveland, children have high levels \ndue to exposure to lead in household paints. We could go on and on. \nPennsylvania, high lead levels.\n  The reason I am saying this is because while the catastrophe has \nhappened in Flint--for many reasons beyond the control of anybody in \nFlint--there are other communities now that need help as well, which is \nwhy the proposal we have is one that has broad bipartisan support to be \nable to activate a wider infrastructure-financing mechanism that allows \ncommunities around the country to be able to solve problems before they \nget to what happened in Flint on the early end to solve the problems so \npeople don't get lead poisoning. That is in this bill. We step up, \nbecause these are Americans in Flint, MI, and say: We hear you. We see \nyou. We care about you, and because you have a Federal emergency \ndeclaration we will provide the opportunity to get some help. In \naddition to accountability and responsibility of the State, the Federal \nGovernment, because of the EPA's role in this, will be a part of the \nsolution in fixing these pipes.\n  We also address public health issues: the Centers for Disease Control \nChildhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Fund, HUD's Healthy Homes Program \nfor lead both in water and in paint, and we address the opportunity to \nreach out and deal with the public health issues for children.\n  Needless to say, we are extremely disappointed--putting it mildly--in \nhow we feel about coming to a point today, despite best efforts on many \npeople's parts, frankly, despite our patience working with people, \naccepting them at their word, working, trying to get things done, \nlooking at various alternatives to get beyond the roadblocks, despite a \nlot of effort. Again, we are grateful for those who have stood with us \nand worked so hard on our behalf. It is incredibly disappointing and \nfrustrating and, frankly, maddening that we are here as the Senate is \nleaving for the next 2 weeks and we do not have action on Flint and on \nwater systems across this country.\n  Again, I can tell you that for the people of Flint who have not \ngotten help\n\n[[Page S1577]]\n\nfor so long, for the people of Flint who were told the water was OK and \nit wasn't--and I have now been watching coverups and slow-walking for \ngoing on 2 years--this is just one more time when they are watching \ninaction and we could be stepping up and doing something to help.\n  So that is what we are asking for; that when we come back, the \nchildren of Flint be a priority for action; that we work together, as \nwe have done across the aisle, to put forward something that will \naddress water infrastructures to help the people of Flint, to help \npeople around the country so they don't find themselves in a situation \nlike the people of Flint; and that we do that together; that we pass \nthat bill; that we pass an energy bill; and that we move forward after \nweeks and weeks and weeks of good-faith efforts to get something done.\n  All we are asking for is a vote. That is all we are asking for, after \nall this effort, is the opportunity to vote. If someone believes it is \nnot the right thing to do, they have the opportunity that we all have, \nto vote no, but the children of Flint deserve a vote. The children in \nJackson, MS, and the people around the country are worried they might \nbecome the crisis, the catastrophe in Flint, and are asking us simply \nto vote.\n  Lead poisoning is a frightening thing. It gets in your body and never \nleaves. It goes from your blood to your bones. When a woman gets \npregnant, it goes into the fetus. It is a frightening form of poison. \nIf that is not a national emergency worthy of action by the Senate and \nthe House--the Congress of this country--I don't know what is.\n  Frankly, there are a whole lot of people who have lost faith in the \ngovernment right now of Flint, who are asking us to see them, to care \nabout them, and to help.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/senate-section/article/S1577-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY\n\n  Mr. PERDUE. Madam President, regarding the vacancy on the Supreme \nCourt, many of our colleagues in the minority party have said the same \nthings we are saying today. Let's stop kidding each other. This kind of \npolitical showmanship--and, yes, indeed, hypocrisy--is exactly what \nmakes everyone in my home State absolutely apoplectic with Washington.\n  The last time I addressed the Supreme Court vacancy on the Senate \nfloor, I urged my colleagues on the other side of the aisle not to let \nthe nominations process get bogged down in partisan politics--that is \nnot what this should be about--not to let this process turn into \npolitical theater because that is exactly what has happened far too \noften in this body ever since the Bork nomination way back in 1987.\n  The organized campaign of vilification and character attacks \nsurrounding Judge Bork's nomination was so unprecedented and so extreme \nthat it took the creation of a new word, ``to Bork,'' to describe what \nhad happened.\n  The process for nominating Justices to the Supreme Court has been \nthoroughly politicized ever since. That politicization has done great \ndamage not only to the Court but to this body, the U.S. Senate. It has \nexpanded beyond just Supreme Court nominees and now affects so many of \nour nominees for circuit judgeships as well. That is what happened in \n2013, when then-Majority Leader Reid broke a tradition almost as old as \nthe Senate itself by invoking the nuclear option and breaking the \nSenate's filibuster rule to stack various circuit courts.\n  I don't think I need to remind any of my colleagues that when the \nDemocrats were in the minority, there was no shortage of protests heard \nin this room about how sacred an institution the filibuster was. Keep \nin mind that the nuclear option was invoked after the Senate confirmed \nthe President's first nominee to the DC Circuit by a unanimous 97-to-0 \nvote. It was an act of raw political power, the nuclear option.\n  We heard yesterday that the President has named his nominee to the \nSupreme Court, but let's be clear, any previous confirmation or record \nas a judge or professional qualifications are not the issue for any \nnominee. What is at stake is the integrity of the process, not the \nperson. It is the principle, not the individual, because our judicial \nnominees to the Supreme Court, the circuits, and the district courts \ndeserve better than to be used as pawns in any political fight, and \nthat is exactly what would happen if the Senate were to consider any \nnominee in the middle of this political season.\n  I am a new Member to this institution, but this has been the view of \nmy colleagues in both parties who have served in the Senate far longer \nthan I have. This was their view no matter who the nominee was. This \nwas their view even when there wasn't a vacancy to fill.\n  The former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Vice President Biden, \nrecognized this in 1992, when he said:\n\n       Once the political season is underway, and it is, action on \n     a Supreme Court nomination must be--I want to emphasize that \n     ``must''--must be put off until after the election campaign \n     is over. That is what is fair to the nominee and is central \n     to the process. Otherwise, it seems to me, we will be in deep \n     trouble as an institution.\n\n  I agree. The Vice President correctly saw that when we inject a \nnomination into a contentious election-year atmosphere, we do a \ndisservice not only to the nominee but to the institution of the United \nStates Senate itself. It is my view that enough institutional damage \nhas already been done to the Senate through these politicized \nnominations.\n\n  I wish to say a little about the text of the Constitution. We hear \nboth sides talk about this, but let's see it in detail.\n  I have heard so many of my Democratic colleagues claim that the \nSenate has an obligation to schedule hearings and hold a vote on this \nnominee. We have all read article II, section 2, of the Constitution. \nEvery Member of this body knows the Constitution says nothing about \nhearings or votes on judicial nominees. It is simply not there.\n  Senators of both parties have always understood this and have said so \nfor years, regardless of who was in the majority. In 2005, Minority \nLeader Reid said: ``Nowhere in the Constitution does it say the Senate \nhas a duty to give Presidential appointees a vote.'' Before that, in \n2002, the former chief judge of the DC Circuit, Abner Mikva, who was a \nCarter appointee, said: ``The Senate should not act on any Supreme \nCourt vacancies that might occur until after the next presidential \nelection.'' The senior Senator from Nevada and Judge Mikva were right \nthen, and Chairman Grassley and my Republican colleagues are right now.\n  Despite many of them previously making the exact same points we are \ntoday, my Democratic colleagues are continuing this diatribe of telling \nus to do our job. I would respectfully say to my Democratic colleagues \ntoday, we are doing our job. Our job as Senators is to decide how to \nresponsibly exercise the powers of advice and consent delegated to us \nunder our Constitution.\n  The responsibile course of action here--a course of action endorsed \nby both Democrats and Republicans for decades--is to refrain from \ninitiating the nomination process in the midst of an election-year \npolitical fight. The responsible course of action is to avoid the \npolitical theater this nomination would become.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/senate-section/article/S1577-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1577-S1578]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      HONORING NEBRASKA'S SOLDIERS WHO LOST THEIR LIVES IN COMBAT\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I rise today to continue my tribute to \nNebraska's heroes and the current generation of men and women who lost \ntheir lives defending our freedom in Iraq and Afghanistan. Each of \nthese Nebraskans has a special story to tell. Throughout this year and \nbeyond, I will continue to honor their memory here on the Senate floor.\n\n\n                      First Lieutenant Jacob Fritz\n\n  Today, I wish to highlight the life of 1LT Jacob Fritz of Verdon, NE. \nJake,\n\n[[Page S1578]]\n\nas he was known to his friends and loved ones, grew up on his family's \nfarm near Verdon, NE, a town with fewer than 200 people. While \nattending Dawson-Verdon High School, Jake thrived and stood out as a \nmodel student. He was an all-around athlete and played the baritone in \nthe honor band. He was also passionate about helping others in need and \nregularly devoted his time to organizations that combat substance abuse \nin Verdon and around the State.\n  Jake's former principal, John Eickhoff, described him as ``a great \nkid, student and athlete.'' Principal Eickhoff recalls, ``If I had a \nschool full of Jacob Fritzes, I wouldn't have had anything to do.''\n  When Jake entered his senior year in high school, his focus remained \non his commitment to helping others, and he began pursuing a career in \nthe U.S. military. His mother Noala recalls Jake's dream of serving his \ncountry, which was inspired by his grandfather, a retired Air Force \nofficer. Karen Mezger, a family friend, recalls that Jake wanted to \nhave a career in the Army and more than anything come back to Verdon \nand live the life of a gentleman farmer.\n  With the support of his family and the nomination from then-Senator \nChuck Hagel, Jake left Nebraska in June of 2000 to begin his first year \nat the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. As soon as he arrived, Jake \nearned the reputation among his fellow cadets as a warm and supportive \nperson. His friend, 1LT Travis Reinfold, recalls Jake's midwestern \nvalues. ``I called him `Jolly Jake,' '' Lieutenant Reinfold remembers, \n``because no matter who you were, he always gave you a warm country \nsmile.'' Lieutenant Reinfold also noted Jake's superb voice as a member \nof the West Point Glee Club. His voice was always filled with \nconviction and beauty, particularly when singing the hymn ``Mansions of \nthe Lord.''\n  After 4 years, Jake graduated from West Point with a bachelor's \ndegree in systems engineering. He was commissioned as a second \nlieutenant in the Army on May 28, 2005. Following speciality training, \nJake was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 377th Parachute Field Artillery \nRegiment, at Fort Richardson, AK.\n  Not long after Jake's arrival at Fort Richardson, the 2nd Battalion \nwas deployed to Iraq. It was 2006, and the war was escalating. The \ninsurgency was in full force and threatening to erase the progress made \nby American troops. By the end of that year, President Bush announced a \ncounterassault known as the ``surge'' and deployed an additional 30,000 \ntroops to the region. Lieutenant Fritz joined this effort and routinely \nvolunteered at Forward Operating Base Karbala to assist Iraqi soldiers. \nJake had a natural instinct to step up and take charge. He felt an \nobligation and a commitment to the mission, which often required \nvolunteering for these types of assignments.\n  But shortly after Jake arrived at Karbala, all hell broke loose. On \nJanuary 20, 2007, enemy militants disguised as friendly soldiers \nentered the base and attacked. In a matter of minutes, Lieutenant Fritz \nand three other American soldiers were captured. The militants rushed \nJake and the other hostages east towards Mahawil. American troops \nquickly located their trail and they followed in hot pursuit. Shortly \nafter crossing the Euphrates River and with American forces gaining, \nthe militants attempted to hasten their escape by executing the four \ncaptives. The American soldiers were stripped of their identification \nand shot as the militants fled the scene, and Jake was mortally \nwounded. As his heartless murderers fled into the abyss, Jake realized \nhis body might not be identified, and so in a final act of bravery, he \nmanaged to scrawl a few letters in the dust of an abandoned vehicle. So \nwhen the American troops arrived at the scene, they saw his body and \nthe word ``Fritz.''\n  Back in Verdon, NE, it was a snowy day in late January of 2007. \nJake's mother Noala arrived home to find two strange cars in the \ndriveway. Men dressed in uniform approached her as she walked to the \nback door. She instinctively knew why they were there, and she refused \nto listen to the words no mother should ever hear. It was clear that \nher son would not be coming home.\n  First Lieutenant Jacob Fritz was laid to rest on January 31, 2007. He \nreceived full military honors, and he was buried in a church ceremony \njust 4 miles from his home. Family and friends paid their final \nrespects in a moving service that honored the courage, commitment, and \nsacrifice of this local hero. Jake was posthumously awarded the Bronze \nStar, Purple Heart, Prisoner of War Medal, and the Combat Action Badge.\n  His two younger brothers later followed in his footsteps, and they \nearned commissions in the Army. They serve to this day with the same \ndistinction and the honor they learned from their big brother.\n  Jake's mother retired from teaching and spends much of her time \nhelping Gold Star families throughout Nebraska.\n  Meanwhile, Jake's memory lives on in the hearts and minds of the \nState he served. Nebraskans are forever indebted to his sacrifice.\n  First Lieutenant Jacob Fritz is a hero, and I am honored to tell his \nstory.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/senate-section/article/S1578-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1578-S1580]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             NOMINATIONS OF BETH COBERT AND MICHAEL MISSAL\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Thank you, Mr. President. It is good to see the Presiding \nOfficer on this St. Patrick's Day, and I am pleased to have a chance to \nrise and to urge my colleagues to confirm two very important nominees. \nSome of my colleagues have scattered across the country to go home for \na 2-week recess, but the Presiding Officer is here. Hopefully, the \nwords that I am saying here today will find their way to our colleagues \nwherever they are or wherever they are headed.\n  One of the nominees is a woman named Beth Cobert, who has been \nnominated to be the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, and \nthe other is Michael Missal, who has been nominated to be the inspector \ngeneral of the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I have grown frustrated over the years \nas, too often, senior positions in the Federal Government have been \nleft vacant or filled by someone serving in an acting capacity for far \ntoo long. A lack of critical leadership at agencies can--and oftentimes \ndoes--undermine the effectiveness of Federal programs. I know all of us \nwant Federal agencies to work more efficiently to provide the most \nvalue to American taxpayers, and having strong leadership in place is \nkey to that effort. I hope we can move to quickly confirm both of these \nnominees when the Senate returns after the recess.\n  Let me start with a few words about Beth Cobert. I don't know if the \nPresiding Officer has had a chance to meet with her. She is one of the \nmost impressive leaders of this administration or any administration \nwhom I have had the privilege to know. She is an excellent nominee to \nhead OPM. Right from the start, I have been very impressed with her \nwork, with her leadership, with her work ethic, and with her ability to \nget people to work together at OMB and now during her time at OPM in \nthis acting capacity. Before that, she was Deputy Director for \nManagement within the Office of Management and Budget. I just think we \nare really lucky in this country that she is willing to continue to \nserve in this capacity as well as serving in her previous capacity. She \ncomes out of the private sector, from McKinsey & Company, a brand new \nCalifornia operation. She did that and had a number of senior positions \nwithin that company and a great career.\n  The Office of Personnel Management performs critical functions \naffecting the entire Federal workforce. What they do every day has a \ndirect impact on the quality of work at all executive branch \ndepartments and agencies. As my colleagues know, Ms. Cobert's time at \nOPM began in the aftermath of one of the worst cyber attacks committed \nagainst our government last year. One result of that incident has been \na major effort to overhaul the information technology infrastructure, \nwhich\n\n[[Page S1579]]\n\nrequires great levels of management attention and expertise.\n  Even before she came to OPM, Ms. Cobert was deeply involved in the \nOPM response to the breach from her Senate-confirmed role at OMB. If \nyou look at her management and technology experience in the private \nsector, her experience at OMB, and the time she has already spent \nleading the Office of Personnel Management, she is the ideal candidate \nto lead OPM at such a critical time. I am only one of many who have \nbeen impressed by Ms. Cobert. In addition to receiving a unanimous vote \nfrom the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on her \nnomination to lead OPM, she has the support of Chairman Jason Chaffetz \nat the House and of Ranking Member Elijah Cummings, who lead the House \nCommittee on Oversight and Government Reform. Representatives Chaffetz \nand Cummings sent a letter to Majority Leader McConnell and Minority \nLeader Reid supporting Ms. Cobert's confirmation.\n  Here is a taste of what they had to say about her: ``[Ms. Cobert] is \na qualified and competent choice to lead OPM, which is in need of \nstrong leadership, and we urge the Senate to approve her nomination \nswiftly.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe full letter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         House of Representatives, Committee on Oversight and \n           Government Reform,\n                                    Washington, DC, March 3, 2016.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Reid: We \n     write in support of President Obama's nomination of Beth \n     Cobert to serve as Director of the Office of Personnel \n     Management (OPM). She is a qualified and competent choice to \n     manage OPM, which is in need of strong leadership, and we \n     urge the Senate to approve her nomination swiftly.\n       On February 1, 2016, the Inspector General of OPM, on his \n     departure from federal service, sent a letter to President \n     Obama praising Ms. Cobert's leadership:\n       ``I am also comforted by the fact that Acting OPM Director \n     Beth Cobert appears to have wrapped her arms around the \n     multitude of challenges currently facing OPM. Further, she \n     seems to be arduously striving to institute high standards of \n     professionalism as she works to reinvigorate this great \n     agency.''\n       We further expect that as Director, Ms. Cobert will \n     continue to assist the Committee's ongoing investigation of \n     the data breach that OPM announced in 2015, which resulted in \n     the loss of personally identifiable information for over 21.5 \n     million individuals. On February 3, 2016, the Committee \n     issued a subpoena to Ms. Cobert--who has served as OPM's \n     Acting Director since July 10, 2015--for documents related to \n     the data breach investigation. The agency produced some \n     responsive documents by the February 16, 2016, deadline and \n     has agreed to produce outstanding documents on a rolling \n     basis; however, there are still outstanding documents that \n     have not been produced to the Committee. We expect the agency \n     to fully comply with the subpoena and produce all outstanding \n     documents.\n       Please contact Katie Bailey of the Chairman's staff or Tim \n     Lynch of the Ranking Member's staff with any questions. Thank \n     you for your attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Jason Chaffetz,\n                                                         Chairman.\n                                               Elijah E. Cummings,\n                                                   Ranking Member.\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Ms. Cobert is a highly qualified nominee. We are \nfortunate indeed that she is willing to serve in this capacity and take \non the many challenges that are currently facing OPM.\n  I urge my colleagues to quickly confirm her so she can continue to do \nthe good work that she is doing at OPM.\n  I have known people who are show horses and folks who are workhorses. \nThis woman is a workhorse--I like to think people look at us as \nworkhorses as well--but she is focused on getting the job done. She is \nespecially good at surrounding herself with terrific people. She did \nthat at OMB, she did that at OPM, and she did that before when she was \nin her very significant position at McKinsey & Company.\n  Let me just turn the page and talk about Michael Missal. I want to \ntalk about him and thank him for his willingness to step up and serve \nas the inspector general for the Department of Veterans Affairs. He \nserved 5 years of Active Duty in a hot war as a naval flight officer in \nSoutheast Asia and another 18 years as a P-3 aircraft mission commander \nin the Navy right up to the end of the Cold War.\n  As Governor for 8 years in Delaware and commander in chief of the \nDelaware National Guard, we send people from Delaware. Right now we \nhave people in Afghanistan. We have sent people over the years to any \nnumber of places where they are in harm's way.\n  I care a lot about veterans. My dad was a veteran. A bunch of my \nuncles were veterans. One of them got killed in World War II, the \nvictim of a kamikaze attack on his aircraft carrier in the western \nPacific. So veterans' concerns run deep in my family.\n  As we all know, our inspectors general play an extremely important \nrole in our government. Their work helps us to save money while also \nrevealing and prosecuting wrongdoing, promoting the integrity and \nefficiency of our government, and hopefully increasing the confidence \nand faith that the American people have in their government. I believe \nthe work of inspectors general, along with that of GAO, is invaluable \nwith respect to the work of the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee, in which I am privileged to serve, and the whole \nSenate as we look for ways to get better results for less money and \nfurther reduce our Federal deficit down from $1.4 trillion a half dozen \nyears ago to about close to a quarter of that--which is still too much. \nWe are making progress, but we need to make more. The IG is a big part \nof helping us to meet that goal. I think it is critical that we have \nqualified, experienced people in place to serve these important roles. \nThis is tough work. We are blessed by the many IGs we have.\n  We have seen far too many IG positions, including the one Mr. Missal \nhas been nominated to fill, sit vacant or be filled by someone serving \nin an acting capacity for far too long. In fact, the VA, of all \nagencies, given the concern we have heard and seen across the country \nin recent years--the IG vacancy at the VA--has been without a \npermanent, Senate confirmed inspector general for more than 2 years. In \nthe past several years, I have joined all the members of the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee in sending letters to the \nPresident, urging him to nominate people to fill all the IG vacancies, \nincluding one letter that specifically pointed out the importance of \nthe one I am talking about today, the inspector general position at the \nVA.\n  Our committee held a hearing last year on IG vacancies and pointed \nout the importance of having permanent IGs in place to ensure the \nindependence of this office.\n  I want to thank the President for responding to our committee's \nletters. He has done this by sending the Senate a number of well-\nqualified nominees, including Mr. Missal, for our consideration. These \nwords have been heard in the last couple of weeks. He is doing his job, \nand now it is time for us to do our job with respect to these \nnominations.\n  I was pleased that both the Veterans Affairs' Committee and our \ncommittee, the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, \nwere able to move quickly to consider Mr. Missal's nomination. I want \nto thank my colleagues on our committee for making it a priority.\n  However, since early this year, there has been no action by the \nSenate on Mr. Missal's nomination. This is an inspector general vacancy \nin Veterans Affairs, where we know there have been hospitals and \nfacilities across the country that are troubled, and we need the best \nleadership we can find at the VA in this position. Again, I think the \nPresident has given us a very good person. He is willing to do the job. \nWe need to get him confirmed.\n  As we know, the VA has been facing significant challenges over the \nlast couple of years. I believe that confirming a permanent IG at the \nVA will help provide much needed oversight, while helping to point out \nand resolve some of the problems at the VA that are negatively \nimpacting the lives of our veterans every day.\n  Leaving this position vacant impedes much needed progress on \nidentifying and addressing serious issues at the VA that impact our \nveterans. If we want to do more to fix the VA, we need a strong\n\n[[Page S1580]]\n\nand independent inspector general to be our partner in that effort. \nDelaying this nomination also delays improvements to the services that \nour veterans receive.\n  Permanent leadership of the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of \nInspector General is long overdue and will go a long way toward \nproviding stable leadership and oversight of the agency. I urge my \ncolleagues to quickly confirm Mr. Missal so he can go to work on behalf \nof our veterans and the American people--not in a couple of months or \nlater this year; we can do it now, as soon as we come back from the \nrecess that begins tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/senate-section/article/S1580-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1580]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               ZIKA VIRUS\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to talk \nabout an issue that is both concerning and tragic; that is, the rapid \nspread of the Zika virus in Central and South America in recent months. \nThis is a virus we have known about ever since I was born, and that has \nbeen about 69 years. I think the first time somebody detected this was \nmaybe on an island in the South Pacific. It has ebbed and flowed over \nthe years, and now it is flowing big time.\n  Every day researchers are discovering more about this virus and its \npotential impact, particularly on pregnant woman and their unborn \nchildren. The findings are not good. In fact, they are deeply \ntroubling. There are strong indications that the virus is connected to \na developmental birth defect that can lead to underdeveloped brains. We \nhave seen the photographs of smaller heads in too many children.\n  Additional studies are also examining a potential connection between \nthe Zika virus and other health concerns. With the World Health \nOrganization estimating that as many as 4 million people could be \ninfected in the region this year, it is clear that we must act swiftly \nto combat this threat. That is why I was pleased to see President Obama \nand his administration take an early and proactive role in addressing \nthe Zika virus. For example, a coordinated Federal response led by the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention is working with State, \nlocal, and international public health partners to step up mosquito \ncontrol efforts and to ensure that health officials have the equipment \nthey need to test people for this disease.\n  To further these efforts, President Obama has recently submitted a \nsupplemental funding request to Congress. These funds would go toward \ndeveloping vaccines, mosquito control efforts, and diagnostic testing, \namong other things. The Senate should take a long, hard look at the \nPresident's request in the coming days and weeks and consider what \nmeasures we need to take to ensure we are ready for Zika and for other \nfuture outbreaks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/senate-section/article/S1580-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1580-S1581]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO FEDERAL EMPLOYEES\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, in closing, I want to do something I think \nthe Presiding Officer has heard me do before. I try to come to the \nfloor once a month and talk about some of the employees who work at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. They work for us across this country \nand really around the world.\n  This is the youngest Department, if you will, that we have in the \nFederal Government. It is about 12 years old. It sort of formed on the \nheels of 9/11. Twenty-two agencies that have some commonality in their \nfocus or the way they touch the security of our homeland and the people \nwho live in it kind of glommed together.\n  The morale in the Department has not been good. There has been a \ngreat, sustained effort--and certainly we are trying to support it in \nour Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs--to turn a \ncorner and let people know that not only is the work they do important, \nbut we appreciate their efforts.\n  I wish to say a few words today about some of the men and women who \nwork tirelessly to keep us safe and secure, often without a lot of \nrecognition and thanks. I am talking about the good people at the \nTransportation Security Administration, now led by retired Coast Guard \nAdmiral Neffenger, Peter Neffenger, a very able and impressive leader.\n  As the Easter holidays approach, many Americans will be traveling to \nspend time with their families around the country and even around the \nworld. If you head to an airport, as many of my colleagues, their \ncolleagues, and their constituents will be doing very soon, chances are \nyou will interact with some of the hard-working men and women of the \nTSA who keep our skies safe. Nearly 59,000 people work at TSA. Many are \nfocused on securing our aviation system, while others work to protect \nour service transportation networks, such as the train I took to work \nthis morning and will be jumping on later today to go home.\n  TSA's work is not only carried out by frontline employees whom we see \nat the airports as we check in and go through security, have our bags \nchecked, our bodies checked, there are also many dedicated people who \nare hard at work behind the scenes. We never actually see them, but \nthey are there keeping us safe too. These men and women perform the \ncritical work of gathering and analyzing intelligence in order to \nidentify potential threats to our transportation system and to mitigate \nthem in real time.\n  I would like to use the remainder of my time to highlight the \noutstanding efforts of some of these individuals. I learned about them \nyesterday while meeting with Admiral Neffenger, who happened to be in a \nmeeting that we had in my office and was with me again today for a \nsecure briefing in the SCIF. He shared with me something I was very \nhappy to learn about. He told me of six members of the current \nintelligence team within TSA's Office of Intelligence and Analysis and \nhow they recently received the 2015 Intelligence Community \nCounterterrorism Award for Education and Training from the Director of \nthe National Counterterrorism Center. That is a mouthful, but it is \nquite an award, quite a recognition. These six individuals--three men, \nthree women--developed a counterterrorism threat briefing for all \nfrontline employees who man our checkpoints and transit systems so they \ncan better understand the connection between intelligence and TSA \nsecurity operations.\n  In essence, these individuals are helping TSA frontline officers \nunderstand the ``why,'' if you will, behind their work. According to \nthe Director of the National Counterterrorism Center, these six or \nseven men and women ``exemplified the essential attributes of the \ncounter-terrorism community: expertise, integration, collaboration, and \ninformation sharing.''\n  While I cannot state their names here, maybe for obvious reasons, I \ndo wish to say to all of you out there--you know who I am talking \nabout--thank you for the work you do every day to ensure that your \nfellow Americans, people who work here and the people we represent, can \ntravel safely and that our transit systems are secure. Thank you for \nthe work you have done to ensure that your fellow TSA employees have \nthe tools they need to carry out the critical work they do. Your \ndedication and your invaluable service are appreciated by me, by all of \nour colleagues in the Senate, our staffs, and by millions of Americans \nwho travel throughout our country every single day.\n  With that, I have probably said enough. I will say to the Presiding \nOfficer, the staff, and everybody who might be tuned in, happy St. \nPatrick's Day. We hope good fortune shines on all of us and on our \ncountry, not just over this holiday and upcoming recess and a special \nday today but for a long time after that.\n  Some of the people we have talked about today--their job is to make \nsure we are not just lucky, but that we are safe, secure, and \nsuccessful going forward. There is an old saying: The harder I work, \nthe luckier I get. I am talking about some people who work very hard so \nwe can be fortunate and blessed in this country. I bid you a happy St. \nPatrick's Day.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S1581]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/senate-section/article/S1581-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1581]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO MIKE DUNCAN\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a \ndistinguished Kentuckian, a man who knows the meaning of public \nservice, who I am proud to call a friend. Robert M. ``Mike'' Duncan \nwill be celebrating his 65th birthday next month, and I want to wish \nhim great happiness and every success on such a special occasion.\n  Mike is well known in Kentucky and nationally for wearing many hats. \nCurrently he serves as the president and CEO of the American Coalition \nfor Clean Coal Electricity, a national nonprofit organization that \nadvocates for coal miners in Kentucky and elsewhere and for the use of \ncoal as an affordable and reliable resource in our Nation's energy mix.\n  Mike has served the Republican Party in many roles, most notably as \nthe 60th Chairman of the Republican National Committee, RNC, from 2007 \nto 2009. He came to that role having previously served as treasurer and \ngeneral counsel of the RNC before his election as chairman.\n  During his career, Mike's served on the campaigns of five Presidents. \nHe worked in the White House as the assistant director of the Office of \nPublic Liaison. He was appointed to the President's Commission on White \nHouse Fellows in 2001, and later served as the chairman and a board \nmember of the Tennessee Valley Authority. He served in various roles \nwith the U.S.-China High Level Political Party Leaders Dialogue and the \nCenter for Rural Development.\n  Mike is also active politically in Kentucky at every level. He has \nserved as a precinct captain to a county chairman to the State chairman \nto the national chairman. In 1998, he chaired Jim Bunning's successful \nU.S. Senate race. Mike's involvement with Kentucky politics dates back \nto his time interning for the Kentucky General Assembly, when he got \nthe chance to serve as President Richard Nixon's driver when the \nPresident was campaigning for reelection in the Bluegrass State.\n  Mike is also active with numerous nonprofit organizations. He is a \ntrustee of the Christian Appalachian Project and runs a student \nmentoring program. He has been recognized with honorary degrees from \nseveral schools, including the College of the Ozarks, Cumberland \nCollege, and Morehead State University.\n  In his professional life, Mike is the principal owner, along with his \nwife, Joanne, of two community banks with five offices in eastern \nKentucky. He has served as the president of the Kentucky Bankers \nAssociation and as a director of the Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank \nCincinnati Branch.\n  Mike holds degrees from Cumberland College and the University of \nKentucky College of Law. He and Joanne call Inez, KY, their home; and \nthey have a son, Rob, who is an assistant U.S. attorney.\n  Mike was 8 years old when his uncle ran for superintendent of \nschools. It was volunteering for his uncle's campaign that sparked his \nlove of politics, and we are glad that it did. He has been of great \nservice to the people of Kentucky and to the people of this Nation for \nmany years, and we owe him our gratitude.\n  I want to wish Mike a very happy birthday, and I know my colleagues \njoin me in recognizing his achievements and wishing him many happy \nreturns.\n  Thank you, Mike, for your service to the Party and to our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/senate-section/article/S1581-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1581]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THIRD ANNUAL CESAR CHAVEZ DAY-LAS VEGAS FESTIVAL\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the third annual \nCesar Chavez Day-Las Vegas Festival. Since 2013, the Las Vegas City \nCouncil, the Cesar Chavez Committee, and Councilmember Bob Coffin have \norganized this community festival in Las Vegas to honor the lasting \nlegacy of civil rights activist and labor leader, Cesar Chavez.\n  Cesar Chavez led a courageous and humble life. He was born on March \n31, 1927, in a small farm outside of Yuma, AZ. His experiences as a \nlaborer and migrant worker in the fields of the southwest United States \nencouraged his pilgrimage from Delano to Sacramento, CA. He brought \nattention to the workplace inequities experienced by those who tilled \nAmerica's soil and harvested America's crops. Alongside Dolores Huerta, \nLarry Itliong, and United Farm Workers, Cesar Chavez fought tirelessly \nto raise salaries and improve the working conditions of farm workers. \nHe organized migrant workers to raise awareness for the humane and fair \ntreatment of all workers. Today Mr. Chavez's legacy inspires hope, \naction, and prosperity for those who are often burdened by \nmarginalization and discrimination. His contributions will forever be \nembedded in the fabric of our country, and we owe gratitude to the \nindelible mark that Cesar Chavez has left on our Nation.\n  Cesar Chavez dedicated his time to a life of purpose in bringing \nsocial justice and dignity to the workplace. As we commemorate his \nmeaningful work and contributions, it is vital that we continue his \nlegacy by fighting for higher wages, worker rights, and the fair \ntreatment of all workers. I commend the Las Vegas City Council, the \nCesar Chavez Committee, and Councilmember Bob Coffin for commemorating \nCesar Chavez, and I join in honoring Mr. Chavez's visionary leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/senate-section/article/S1581-3", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1581-S1582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, 29 years ago, March was designated \nNational Women's History Month. It is hard to imagine, but as recently \nas the 1970s, history books largely left out the contributions of women \nin America. This began to change in 1978, when a small group set out to \nrevise the school curriculum in their community--Sonoma County, CA. The \nidea was to create a Women's History Week, and its goal was to write \nwomen back into history books. It was an idea that was long overdue. \nAnd Women's History Week took off around the county . . . around the \nState . . . and across the Nation. It didn't take long before \norganizers lobbied Congress and even the White House. And on February \n28, 1980, it paid off.\n  President Jimmy Carter announced for the first time that March 2-8, \n1980, would be designated as National Women's History Week. He urged \nlibraries, schools, and community organizations to focus on leaders who \nstruggled for equality: Susan B. Anthony, Sojourner Truth, Lucy Stone, \nLucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cody Stanton, Harriet Tubman, and Alice Paul. \nIn 1981, the cause gained further momentum when an unlikely partnership \nbetween then-Representative Barbara Mikulski and Senator Orrin Hatch \ncosponsored a congressional resolution for National Women's History \nWeek. And 6 short years later, National Women's History Week became \nNational Women's History Month. And last November, Senator Mikulski was \nawarded the Nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of \nFreedom, in part for her work on equal pay for women--what an honor.\n  Throughout history, women have achieved significant progress in the \nface of discrimination and, time and time again, blazed new trails. So \nit is appropriate that Senator Barbara Mikulski would play such an \nintegral role in creating National Women's History Month. After all, \nshe understands the role of a trailblazer better than many. And during \nher last year in the U.S. Senate, it is fitting we honor some of her \naccomplishments. Senator Mikulski was the first woman elevated to a \nleadership post in the U.S. Senate and the only current Member of \nCongress in the National Women's Hall of Fame. She is also the first \nwoman elected to Congress in her own right, not because of a husband or \na father or someone who served before her in higher office. Senator \nMikulski embodies what National Women's History Month is all about, \nparticularly this year, when its theme is ``Working to Form a More \nPerfect Union: Honoring Women in Public Service and Government.''\n  So with that in mind, I would like to tell you a story about Senator \nMikulski, also known in this chamber as the Dean of Women. Following \nthe election of a number of esteemed women into the Senate, a lot of \nreporters deemed 1992, the Year of the Woman, but Senator Mikulski \ndidn't like the sound of that.\n  She said: ``Calling 1992 the Year of the Woman makes it sound like \nthe\n\n[[Page S1582]]\n\nYear of the Caribou or the Year of the Asparagus. We're not a fad, \nfancy or a year.''\n  That is classic for Senator Mikulski.\n  Today there are a record 20 female Members in the Senate, but Barbara \nwould be the first to point out that is still a minority, and we can do \nbetter. Well, after 40 years in Congress, Senator Mikulski will be \nsorely missed. Without the leadership and determination of Senator \nMikulski, the fight gets a little harder, and there is plenty of work \nto do.\n  Women still receive an average of 78 cents for every dollar earned by \nmen, and it is even greater for women of color. African-American women \nmake 64 cents for every dollar earned by men, and Hispanic women only \nmake 56 cents. It is not right, and it is long past time that Congress \npass the Paycheck Fairness Act to provide women with the necessary \ntools to fight wage discrimination. It is also time to guarantee paid \nfamily and medical leave for all. Making this a reality will mean that \nwhen major life events happen, birth of a new child or caring for an \naging parent, hard-working Americans will not have to choose between \ntheir family and debt, bankruptcy, or losing their job. But America can \novercome these challenges. We have done it before. Just look how far we \nhave come.\n  Here are just a few of the problems women faced and overcame since \nthe 1970s: women could be fired from the workplace for being pregnant; \nsexual harassment wasn't recognized in the workplace; women couldn't \nget a credit card; and marital rape wasn't considered a crime in most \nStates. But we solved these discriminatory and heinous practices. You \nsee, America's democracy has indeed been imperfect, but throughout our \nhistory, we have sought to address our Nation's imperfections. Because \nthe story of the United States is not a story of a perfect union, It is \na story about the pursuit to create ``a more perfect union.''\n  Let me close with this. Years ago, in my home State of Illinois, then \nFirst Lady Hilary Clinton said: ``If you go to the poorest places on \nEarth struggling from social problems of poverty, disease, and hunger \nand all that comes with it, and you can only ask one question to \ndetermine if they have a chance, the question you should ask is this: \nHow do you treat your women?''\n  If you give women an equal playing field, status, education, and \nopportunity, you are giving them and your country a chance to thrive.\n  This March, as we pay tribute to all the brave women who have moved \nthis country forward and in doing so inspired each and every one of us, \nlet's challenge ourselves to build on their legacies and make our \ncountry a more equal society for our mothers, sisters, and daughters.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/senate-section/article/S1582-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO DON HOOPER\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to recognize Don \nHooper, a great Vermonter who is soon to retire from the National \nWildlife Federation.\n  Don is a great environmental conservationist whose advice I have \nsought for at least 20 years on issues affecting Vermont, the United \nStates, and indeed the planet. For 17 years, Don has helped lead the \nNational Wildlife Federation, NWF, in Vermont and the region. He helped \nto bring the peregrine falcon back from the brink of extinction in \nVermont and to restore our State's breeding population of bald eagles. \nBeyond Vermont, he advocated for piping plovers, wolves, Atlantic \nsalmon, and more. Don helped the NWF become one of the first \norganizations to sound the alarm about the accelerating impacts of \nclimate change and to pull together coalitions of environmental \nadvocates, conservationists, and sportsmen and sportswomen to push for \nsolutions.\n  Don's public service extends beyond his conservation leadership. He \nworked hard in the mid-1990s as Vermont's Secretary of State to reduce \nbarriers to the ballot box and to make government more open and \naccessible, priorities both he and I share.\n  Many Vermonters also celebrate Don's 8 years representing the towns \nof Randolph, Brookfield, and Braintree in Vermont's General Assembly, \nwhen Don led efforts to divest pension funds from South African \ninvestments, helped to craft significant environmental and planning \nlegislation, and achieved what would be unthinkable in most States--a \npolitical redistricting map that was adopted by near consensus.\n  And as is the story with any great Vermonter, Don's foundation has \nbeen his family. Since 1974, the Hooper's Brookfield farm, worked by \nDon, his wife, Allison, and sons, Sam, Jay, and Miles, has been a \nmainstay of the community. They have sold hay, vegetables, goat's milk, \nand meat from the farm to friends and neighbors. Don helped found the \nMontpelier Farmers Market that Marcelle and I visit whenever we are \nhome in the summer. With Allison in the lead and Don doing much heavy \nlifting and dishwashing, the Hoopers became cheesemakers and founded \nthe Vermont Butter and Cheese Company, which has thrived for 32 years, \nemploys 77 people directly, supports many more Vermont farmers, and has \nVermont's specialty cheese industry on the international culinary map.\n  On top of all of this, Don is a volunteer for the fire department and \na member of the local Farm Bureau. It is hard to think of a more \ndedicated member of the community.\n  These are just some of the layers of Don's life in Vermont. He has \nalso done great work as a Peace Corps volunteer in Botswana and in the \nleadership of national organizations. Don Hooper stands as tall as ever \nin retirement, and while this might conclude his leadership of the NWF \nin Vermont, I know it will not be the last we hear and see of this \ngreat Vermonter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/senate-section/article/S1582-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1582-S1583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING THE ``USS MONTPELIER''\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as a native of Montpelier and as one who \nattended the christening of the USS Montpelier, I was so happy to see \nan article in the Times Argus regarding its return to the United States \nafter a 6-month deployment last month. Steve Martin and Debra Smith \nhave both been involved for years and supported the crew of the USS \nMontpelier. Marcelle and I had a memorable time at a picnic they held \nfor the crew in Middlesex. As a Vermonter, they both make me proud, and \nI wanted my fellow Senators to see what they have done.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Times Argus article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Times Argus, Feb. 8, 2016]\n\n                    USS Montpelier Returns to States\n\n                           (By Josh O'Gorman)\n\n       Norfolk, Va.--The USS Montpelier has returned home to the \n     United States following a six-month deployment.\n       Friday afternoon, the submarine--the third naval vessel to \n     share the name of Vermont's capital--docked at Naval Station \n     Norfolk after logging more than 38,000 nautical miles during \n     its most recent deployment.\n       The crew of the Los Angeles-class fast-attack submarine, \n     which includes 15 officers and 129 enlisted crew, spent the \n     recent deployment supporting national security interests in \n     Europe and the Middle East, with stops in Bahrain, France, \n     Greece and the United Arab Emirates.\n       ``I have been connected with this amazing group of men for \n     14 or 15 years now,'' said Debra Smith, of Middlesex, who \n     chairs the Veterans and Family Support Committee for the \n     Montpelier VFW.\n       Smith's support for the sailors of the USS Montpelier began \n     with her efforts to keep them entertained while at sea. \n     Smith, who used to operate Capital Video in Montpelier before \n     it closed, would send the sailors movies to watch during \n     their down time.\n       Most recently, Smith organized an effort in which students \n     from Hardwick Elementary School are making ``Welcome Home'' \n     and Valentine's Day cards, which are expected to go out in \n     the mail to the crew this week.\n       Both Smith and Steve Martin, also of Middlesex, have been \n     passengers of the 360-foot submarine, which was commissioned \n     in 1993 and which launched the first Tomahawk cruise missiles \n     during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n       ``It was pretty awesome,'' Martin said. ``It's pretty tight \n     in there. We spent the day out at sea and when they surfaced \n     we were able to go up on the bridge with the captain.''\n       He also described the steepness with which the submarine \n     dives and surfaces.\n       ``You're keeping your balance and your face is a few feet \n     from the floor,'' Martin said.\n       Next month, Smith and Martin will take a road trip that \n     will include a stop in Norfolk to visit the boat and its \n     crew.\n\n[[Page S1583]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/senate-section/article/S1583-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                    REMOVAL OF NOMINATION OBJECTION\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, on December 18, 2015, I placed a hold on \nthe nomination of Dr. Janine Ann Davidson to be Under Secretary of the \nNavy. As I made clear in my statement at that time, my action was not \ndirected at Dr. Davidson; rather, it was directed at the pending \npromotion by the Navy of RDML Brian Losey and concerns I had related to \nfindings by the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General \nconcerning Rear Admiral Losey's retaliation against whistleblowers. I \nhave been informed by the Navy that Rear Admiral Losey will not be \npromoted. Consequently, I am removing my hold on Dr. Davidson's \nnomination and will support her confirmation.\n  To quickly review why I took this action, the DOD OIG conducted \nseveral extensive investigations into allegations of retaliation by \nRear Admiral Losey against senior members of his joint command. In \nthree of those investigations, the DOD IG concluded that he wrongfully \nretaliated against his staff even after he was advised not to do so. \nThe DOD IG also concluded that his immediate subordinates carried out \nretaliatory actions at his behest in two of those cases.\n  I found the OIG findings compelling. In a January 14, 2016, letter to \nNavy Secretary Ray Mabus, Senator McCain and Senator Reed, in their \ncapacity as chairman and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, also cited the OIG findings in support of their request to \nSecretary Mabus that Losey not be promoted.\n  Notwithstanding Rear Admiral Losey's long service to our country, the \nNavy would have been wrong to dismiss the OIG findings and promote him. \nDoing so would have sent exactly the wrong message, namely that \nretaliation against whistleblowers is acceptable.\n  One of the pillars of our system of government is the rule of law; a \nprinciple that applies no less to our military and to the vital \nprinciple of civilian control over the military. It is illegal to \nretaliate against whistleblowers, whether civilian or military, and I \ncommend the DOD inspector general and his staff for their diligence in \nthese investigations.\n  I commend Secretary Mabus and the Navy for taking what I believe is \nthe right course of action in this situation, but my concern with the \nprotection of whistleblowers did not begin with the Losey case, and it \nwill not end with the Losey case. I will continue to work here in the \nSenate to ensure that those who come forward to expose waste, fraud, or \nabuse are protected.\n  In the meantime, I encourage the nominee, Dr. Janine Ann Davidson, to \nfocus on the hard work she has before her in addressing whistleblower \nretaliation issues in the military.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/senate-section/article/S1583-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FAA REAUTHORIZATION BILL\n\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, today the Senate Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation approved legislation to reauthorize the \nFederal Aviation Administration. I applaud the work of my colleagues \nSenators Thune and Nelson. Their leadership on this important \nlegislation was critical. I would like to make clear that, while we \ntook important steps forward with this legislation, more work remains \nto be done to ensure the United States remains a global leader in \naviation, safety, and innovation.\n  Going into this year, many on the Commerce Committee, along with \nDepartment of Transportation Secretary Foxx and FAA Administrator \nHuerta and key stakeholders, aimed high on FAA reauthorization. We \naimed high because there are big ideas we need to address when it comes \nto aviation in this country.\n  From the current state and financing of our airport infrastructure, \nto completing NextGen implementation, to accelerating commercial use of \nUAS technology, to new proposals about our Air Traffic Control system, \nthere were a lot of innovative ideas on the table, and while we made \nstrides on some, more work remains to be done. There is widespread \nagreement that the status quo is not acceptable, and I was pleased to \njoin my colleagues in taking this initial step forward to reauthorize \nthe FAA for the upcoming 18 months.\n  Furthermore, I am pleased that I was able to put forth amendments \nthat were included in this bill to ensure adequate staffing levels at \nthe Newark air traffic control tower. In addition, we were able to \nsecure a much-needed study of the New York and New Jersey airports, \nwhich cover the busiest airspace in the country. Findings from this \nstudy will enable us to make informed decisions about how best to \naddress this staffing problem in the future.\n  I am also concerned about staffing levels at the Transportation \nSecurity Administration, TSA. There have been incredibly long delays at \nNewark airport because of inadequate staffing of TSA agents at our \nairport. Safety is absolutely paramount in our airports. It is my hope \nthat we can achieve both topnotch security and an efficient, reliable \nprocess for travelers using our airports. Increased staffing should \nhelp us achieve that goal.\n  In this reauthorization, I was pleased to work with Senator Cantwell \nto increase competition in the Newark airport with the hope that \nincreased competition and opening up more flight slots at the airport \nmay yield more options and price points for consumers. But I must \nstress that these changes cannot move forward without ensuring the \nairport is equipped to handle more traffic and passengers. I look \nforward to continuing to work with my colleagues on this issue and am \nexcited by the opportunities this could bring for my constituents.\n  We also made progress on furthering the integration of unmanned \naerial systems, UAS, or drones into our airspace in our legislation. \nThis technology is literally taking off around the world. It has the \npower to enhance search and rescue, deliver humanitarian aid, improve \nagriculture practices, and newsgathering. I introduced the Commercial \nUAS Modernization Act to help advance this technology and was pleased \nto see many of our ideas incorporated in this legislation. I worked \nwith committee leadership to further advance a microUAS rule, which \nwould allow U.S. businesses to fly micro-drones under 4.4 pounds \nresponsibly and safely.\n  Advancing microUAS use will bring tremendous innovations and new \nefficiencies across the country and will keep the United States on par \nwith other developed nations who have been making great strides ahead \nof us in utilizing this technology. From improving research to \nproviding unmanned bridge inspections, the benefits of this technology \nare truly limitless. UAS has the power to save lives and create new \nefficiencies across industries. I am excited to see what the innovators \nand entrepreneurs come up with as a result of our rule which sets forth \nclear safety guidelines for responsible operation.\n  Finally, I want to address a couple of amendments that I put forth \nthat were not included in this legislation and express my sincere hope \nthat the chairman and ranking member will work with me before this bill \ngets to floor. I introduced two amendments to the bill that would \naddress disadvantaged business enterprise, or DBE, projects. The goal \nof this program, of course, is to promote equity and inclusion in \nfederally financed transportation projects. While neither of these \namendments were incorporated into this legislation as of yet, I am \nconfident that we can work together to advance this important policy \ngoal. One amendment would ensure conformance of the DOT size standard \nfor small businesses to the metric defined by the Small Business \nAdministration.\n  This update will enable more minority and women-owned businesses to \ncompete for infrastructure work. The second amendment sets goals for \nminority and women-owned businesses on projects financed only by \npassenger facility charges, or PFCs. I ask the chairman and ranking \nmember to continue to work with me as this bill goes to the floor to \nadvance these two important goals.\n  Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/senate-section/article/S1583-3", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1583-S1584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO MIKE ENZI\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, on March 29 in Laramie, the University \nof Wyoming will recognize the work of Senator Mike Enzi with an \nofficial dedication of the Michael B. Enzi STEM Facility. It is a well-\ndeserved honor and one that I would like to share with my fellow \nSenators.\n\n[[Page S1584]]\n\n  The state of the art facility opened in January of 2016. With more \nthan 107,000 square feet and over 30 labs, the University of Wyoming \nMichael B. Enzi STEM Facility will allow 900 students from multiple \ndisciplines to be actively engaged in lab studies at the same time. The \ndesign of the facility allows students to enjoy an active learning \nenvironment that encourages continuous interaction between instructors \nand students. Classrooms are laid out in such a way that instructors \nhave the flexibility to adjust their lessons to accommodate the needs \nand interests of the students, ensuring that they are always in an \nenvironment most conducive to learning.\n  There is no better way to honor the lifetime work of Senator Enzi \nthan to name this facility in his honor. Throughout his years as an \naccountant and in elected office, Mike has been a solid leader who is \nwilling to take on tough challenges. From his time as mayor in \nGillette, a town that truly represents the definition of an American \nboomtown, to his work in the U.S. Senate, Mike studies and works \nthrough an issue and always approaches the problem with an ``I will \nsolve this and make it better'' attitude. This approach to problem \nsolving has helped Mike succeed as chairman of both the Senate Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee and the Senate Budget \nCommittee.\n  Senator Enzi recognizes that if you provide people the tools to \nsucceed, many will. Mike understands human nature and recognizes that a \none size fits all approach to serious problems is not always the best \nway to fix things. Senator Enzi believes in the ability of people to \nlearn, whether in the classroom, on the job, or through personal \nexperiences, and to take that knowledge and use it in a way to better \nthemselves and others.\n  The Michael B. Enzi STEM Facility is a perfect reflection of the man: \ngive people an opportunity to learn, to interact, to share, and in an \nenvironment that works for them, and they will achieve great things.\n  In praising his effort to improve education in Wyoming, Chris \nBoswell, University of Wyoming's vice president for governmental and \ncommunity affairs, said the following about Mike Enzi: ``He has been \nvery influential in crafting legislation that garners bipartisan \nsupport in the Senate. These have been bills that moved significant \neducation initiatives forward. Whether as chairman or ranking member, \nSenator Enzi knows how to move bills through to become law, and Wyoming \nand the country are the better for it.''\n  I agree completely, and I congratulate Senator Enzi on this honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/senate-section/article/S1584-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE REESTABLISHMENT OF DIPLOMATIC TIES BETWEEN THE \n               UNITED STATES AND THE REPUBLIC OF ALBANIA\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, on March 15, we commemorated the 25th \nanniversary of the reestablishment of diplomatic ties between the \nUnited States and the Republic of Albania. Over 25 years ago, Albania \nemerged from nearly five decades of isolation and Communist rule to \nestablish a multiparty democracy and forge closer ties with the free \nworld. A quarter century later, Albania has made significant progress. \nAlbania's economy grew and its people participated in elections judged \nas largely free and fair. Albanians enjoy freedom of religion, \nmovement, unrestricted Internet access, and academic freedom. Today \nAlbania is a NATO ally and a candidate for accession into the European \nUnion, EU.\n  Since its emergence from isolation, Albania has been an active and \ncontributing member of the international community. Over the course of \ntwo decades, Albania deployed more than 6,500 military personnel in \nsupport of operations lead by NATO, the EU, and the United Nations. In \n2003, Albanian troops deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. Between 2002 and 2014, Albania deployed over 3,000 personnel \nto support U.S. and NATO operations in Afghanistan. Albanian personnel \ncontinue to serve in Afghanistan.\n  Despite a quarter century of notable strides, pervasive corruption, \nhigh unemployment, organized crime, and underrepresentation of women in \nbusiness and politics, among other issues, prevent Albania from \nrealizing its full potential. As a member of the Senate Appropriations \nSubcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs, I have \nconsistently voted to support assistance to Albania to strengthen \ndemocratic institutions and the rule of law, promote sustainable \neconomic growth, and assist with its regional and international \nintegration. As co-chair of the Senate Albania Caucus, I will continue \nto work with my colleagues on to strengthen the U.S.-Albania \nrelationship and support Albania's ongoing efforts to become a \nprosperous, democratic state and pillar of stability in the Balkans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/senate-section/article/S1584-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1584-S1585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING OFFICER JACAI COLSON\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the tragic death \nof a Marylander. Officer Jacai Colson of the Prince George's Police \nDepartment was killed in the line of duty, on Sunday, March 13, 2016. \nOfficer Colson was an upstanding law enforcement officer whose death \nshocked and saddened so many in Maryland and the national law \nenforcement community. America is the great Nation it is in no small \npart because of our respect for the rule of law. Officer Colson and his \nfellow Prince George's County police officers put their lives on the \nline every day to uphold the rule of law.\n  Officer Colson was only 28 years of age. Today, March 17, 2016, would \nhave been his 29th birthday.\n  On Sunday, March 13, 2016, the district III station in Prince \nGeorge's County came under fire in what was a deliberate attack on law \nenforcement and on the rule of law itself. Officer Colson arrived on \nthe scene. After finding himself in the middle of a firefight, Officer \nColson had the composure to return fire. During the firefight, Officer \nColson was shot and killed.\n  Every member of the U.S. Senate, every Marylander, and every American \nshould be inspired by the life of Officer Jacai Colson. Officer Colson \nwas an undercover narcotics agent. He had a dangerous job with zero \nmargin for error. Officer Colson did not make errors. He was a 4-year \nveteran of the Prince George's Police Department. The commander of the \nPrince George's County Police Department's narcotic enforcement \ndivision said of Officer Colson: ``Not only is he good at his job, he's \nthat guy that you wanted on your team.'' The president of the Fraternal \nOrder of Police, Lodge 89, described Officer Colson as ``. . . always \nthe first person here in the morning, ready to work and put in a full \nday's work.''\n  Officer Colson was a native of Boothwyn, PA. He came from a law \nenforcement family. His grandfather, Sergeant James G. Colson, Jr., \nretired from the Delaware County, PA, police department after more than \n40 years of service. Officer Colson was the quarterback of his high \nschool football team. He attended Randolph Macon University, where he \nalso played football. He sang in the Ujima Gospel Choir and worked in \nthe admissions office and in the marketing and communications \ndepartment. Officer Colson gave of himself to improve his community \nwhile he was in college. He was a member of Brothers 4 Change, a \nstudent organization devoted to community service, and he also \nvolunteered with Habitat for Humanity.\n  I am thankful to the Colson family for sharing such a promising young \nman with the people of Prince George's County. The pain they are going \nthrough right now is a pain no family should have to endure. Most \ntragically, they are not alone. So far in 2016, 23 law enforcement \nofficers have died in the line of duty. In February, two of Officer \nColson's Maryland colleagues from the Harford County Sheriff's office, \nSenior Deputy Mark Logsdon and Senior Deputy Patrick Dailey were killed \nresponding to a call.\n  The loss of Officer Colson represents the loss of one of the best and \nbrightest among us. He could have done anything with his life, and he \nchose to protect his fellow Americans. I am thankful that Officer \nColson was able to enrich and save the lives of so many people during \nhis life. On behalf of the people of Maryland and my fellow U.S. \nSenators, I offer my deepest condolences to\n\n[[Page S1585]]\n\nthe family and friends of Officer Colson. I hope they are able to find \nsolace in the fact that Jacai Colson was a true hero.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/senate-section/article/S1585-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1585-S1586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH 2016\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I wish to join the American people \nin celebrating Women's History Month. It is clear that 1 month is \nhardly enough time to recognize all that women have done, what they are \ndoing, and what they have yet to accomplish. Despite the persistence of \ndogmatic opposition, women have played a major role in advancing every \nsociety on earth.\n  I am a proud husband, father, and grandfather. In my time \nrepresenting the people of Maryland, in the U.S. Senate, I have \ntraversed the State many times. As a member and now ranking member of \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I have had the chance to travel \nand meet with people from very diverse backgrounds.\n  At home and abroad, I have found it difficult and often imprudent to \nmake generalizations with regard to policy. One common truth, however, \nthat easily crosses national borders, ethnic lines, political divides, \nand religious devotions is this: the way a nation treats its women is \nvery much a barometer as to how well that nation is doing.\n  And so this March we will celebrate women on the forefront of \nindustry and innovation, science and social justice, policy and \npatriotism, and so much more. We must also remember that Women's \nHistory Month is not just about celebrations. Women's History Month \nshould be a time when all Americans come together for a frank \nconversation about the well-being of women at home and abroad. That \nconversation must lead to concrete action because, if we want to \nimprove any aspect of our society, starting with empowering and lifting \nup women is an investment that will return the greatest dividends.\n  Throughout American history, we have made progress in so many arenas \nbecause women had the bravery to break the proverbial glass ceiling. \nOne such woman who I think deserves accolades during this Women's \nHistory Month, and every month for that matter, is a Member of this \nvery body. This Congress boasts the most female representatives in \nhistory. I suspect that number would be larger if we gave the people of \nWashington, DC, full statehood and a voting Senator, but I will discuss \nthat another time.\n  The record number of women in Congress is not an accident; it took \nhard work and grit. The living embodiment of that grit and know-how is \nthe senior Senator from Maryland, my colleague Senator Mikulski. There \nis a wonderful sense of symmetry in the fact that in 1981, then-\nCongresswoman Mikulski co-sponsored the first Joint Congressional \nResolution proclaiming a Women's History Week, and today she is being \ncelebrated as a role model during Women's History Month.\n  Senator Barb has been more than a dedicated champion for the State of \nMaryland. She has fought tirelessly for the welfare of all Americans \nacross the country. In the Halls of the Senate, she opened doors that \nhad previously been closed to women. Sometimes she used gentle \npoliticking, and sometimes she knocked the doors off the hinges. No \nmatter how she did it, Senator Barb refused to accept second-class \ntreatment because of her gender and fought to be recognized as an \nequal. To take that one step further, Senator Barb refused to let other \nwomen be treated like second-class citizens by the rule of law or \nantiquated social norms. I don't have the time to list all that she has \ndone for Marylanders and working families across the country in her \nlong and distinguished career, but I will share a list of hard-fought \nfirsts: first Democratic woman elected to the U.S. Senate in her own \nright; first Democratic woman to serve in both Houses of Congress; \nfirst woman to be elected to statewide office in Maryland; first \nDemocratic woman Senator elected to a leadership position; first \nDemocratic woman to serve on the Senate Appropriations Committee; first \nwoman to chair an Appropriations Subcommittee--the Commerce-Justice-\nScience Subcommittee; first woman to serve on the Senate Environment & \nPublic Works Committee; first woman to serve on the Senate Small \nBusiness Committee; first woman to serve on the House Interstate & \nForeign Commerce, now known as the Energy & Commerce Committee--first \nwoman on the Health Subcommittee; most senior woman in the Senate on \nJanuary 3, 1997; longest serving woman Senator in U.S. history on \nJanuary 5, 2011; and longest serving woman in Congress in U.S. history \non March 17, 2012.\n  Senator Barb will be leaving the Senate when her term ends next \nJanuary. That does not mean that she will stop doing what she does \nbest, fighting for what is right. Generations of young women who choose \nto participate in public life or who dream of joining the U.S. Senate \nhave benefited from Senator Barb's trailblazing legacy.\n  As we begin to fathom life in the U.S. Senate without Senator Barb, \nwe should take a minute to analyze the current state of politics and \npolicy as it relates to women in America.\n  Regardless of any Member's political support of anyone running to \nreplace President Obama, it is worth noting that there is a chance that \na woman, a former U.S. Senator, a former Secretary of State, and Former \nFirst Lady could potentially be the next President of the United \nStates.\n  The 2016 election should serve as a chance to audit how our political \nsystem is working on behalf of women, including in terms of health \ncare.\n  The Affordable Care Act, ACA, has played a role in creating greater \ngender equality in this country. Under the ACA, being a woman is no \nlonger a ``preexisting condition.'' What does that mean? It means \ninsurance companies can no longer force women to pay more based on \ntheir gender.\n  The ACA also provides more preventive services for women at no cost. \nLifesaving preventive services like mammograms, cervical cancer \nscreenings, and prenatal care are now covered at no additional cost for \nroughly 48.5 million American women with private insurance. Access to \nthese services means that fewer women will be sidelined from the job \nmarket, unable to support families because of preventable illnesses. \nThere is no question that we are making progress in women's health \ncare, in terms of cost, equity, and in providing much-needed services.\n  We have further to go. Gender-based disparities in medical research \nstill remain. Some medical trials today do not consider the impact of \ngender in their research, and diseases like heart disease, which is the \nleading cause of death for American women, are often misdiagnosed or \noverlooked.\n  That is why I have continuously fought for robust funding for the \nNational Institutes of Health, NIH, which pioneers much of our Nation's \ngroundbreaking medical research and clinical trials. I was very \nencouraged to see the NIH receive a $2 billion increase in the fiscal \nyear 2016 Omnibus spending bill--thanks in large part to Senator \nMikulski. That is the largest increase NIH has received since 2003. By \nensuring that NIH has all of the tools it needs to continue such urgent \nwork, we can address persistent disparities and continue to build on \nthe gains in our health care system made under the ACA. One thing is \ncertainly clear: we only stand to gain from increased resources for our \nmedical community to improve the health of women.\n  Improving health care is only one part of the equation involved in \nempowering and uplifting women in the United States.\n  I have previously spoken about the need to close the gender pay gap, \nthe need to pass meaningful legislation to reduce the number of women \nkilled by guns during instances of domestic violence, and the need to \nensure women can continue to make choices concerning their own \nreproductive health. All of these are critically important to the well-\nbeing of women in America.\n  America was built on the promise of equal rights. Our history is \ndefined by groups struggling to achieve full equality under the law. I \nthink many Americans would be shocked to find out that the Constitution \nstill lacks a provision ensuring gender equality. Think about that: \nwomen still lack the same constitutional protections as men. I think \nthis is wrong and have introduced legislation to remove the deadline \nfor States to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment, which 35 States have \nratified already--just three more to go.\n  The Equal Rights Amendment is slightly longer than two tweets, but\n\n[[Page S1586]]\n\nwould finally give women full and equal protection under the \nConstitution. It reads as follows:\n\n       Section 1. Equality of rights under the law shall not be \n     denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on \n     account of sex.\n       Section 2. The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by \n     appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.\n       Section 3. This amendment shall take effect two years after \n     the date of ratification.\n\n  It is that simple. When Congress passed the ERA in 1972, it provided \nthat the measure had to be ratified by three-fourths of the States, 38 \nStates, within 7 years. This deadline was later extended to 10 years by \na joint resolution enacted by Congress, but ultimately only 35 out of \n38 States had ratified the ERA when the deadline expired in 1982. To \nput that in context, in 1992, the 27th Amendment to the Constitution \nprohibiting immediate Congressional pay raises was ratified after 203 \nyears.\n  Article V of the Constitution contains no time limits for \nratification of constitutional amendments, and the ERA time limit was \ncontained in a joint resolution, not the actual text of the amendment. \nThe Senate could pass my legislation removing the 10-year deadline \nright now. I hope that the majority leader will bring this legislation \nup for a vote because American women deserve to know that their most \nfundamental rights are explicitly protected by our Nation's most \nvenerated document.\n  I would like to take a moment to discuss some issues that apply more \nto women outside of the United States but still affect every American.\n  I serve as the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee. In that position, I have seen firsthand how the relatively \nsmall amount of money allocated for foreign assistance saves both lives \nand American tax dollars over time. At less than 1 percent of the \nFederal budget, foreign assistance helps us rely less on costly \nmilitary operations and prevent international catastrophes before they \nhappen.\n  As I previously stated, the way a nation treats its women is very \nmuch a barometer as to how well that nation is doing. And just as in \nthe United States, giving women outside United States the tools they \nneed to succeed uplifts families, communities and nations. The \nmillennium development goals, MDGs, were some of the most aggressive \nand successful attempts to combat global poverty and improve the \nquality of life for millions of women and families in the developing \nworld.\n  The millennium development goals, first established in 2000, brought \ntogether nations, businesses, international organizations, and \nfoundations in a focused and coordinated effort to reduce poverty and \ndisease by 2015. Over the last two decades, the number of people \nworldwide living in extreme poverty has been cut in half, from about \none in every six people in 1990 to 836 million in 2015. We have made \nprogress in global education, with a 20 percent increase in primary \nschool enrollment in sub-Saharan Africa and a nearly 50 percent \ndecrease in the number of out-of-school children of primary school age.\n  In terms of gender equality, we still have a long way to go, but \ntoday we can cheer the fact that women have gained more parliamentary \nrepresentation in ninety percent of the countries of the world than \ntwenty years ago. The rate of maternal mortality has declined by forty-\nfive percent worldwide, including by sixty-four percent in Southern \nAsia and forty-nine percent in sub-Saharan Africa.\n  When it comes to combating HIV/AIDS, we have made truly incredible \nstrides over the past fifteen years. New HIV infections dropped by \nforty percent between 2000 and 2013, and the number of people living \nwith HIV that were receiving anti-retroviral therapy increased \nseventeenfold from 2003 to 2014.\n  Behind these impressive numbers are countless women who are alive and \nstrengthening their families and communities because of the millennium \ndevelopment goals, but there are still many areas where we need to make \nmore progress.\n  In September 2015, more than 150 world leaders gathered at the United \nNations General Assembly to adopt the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \nDevelopment and the 17 sustainable development goals, SDGs. The SDGs \naim to build on the successes of the millennium development goals and \ncatalyze further progress.\n  One area where there is still much work to be done concerns child \nmarriages. I am pleased the sustainable development goal 5 includes a \ntarget to eliminate child, early and forced marriages.\n  According to the United States Agency for International Development, \nUSAID, each year, 14.2 million girls are married before their 18th \nbirthday. Some of these girls are as young as 9 years old. Childhood \nmarriage robs girls of their adolescence, denies them an education, \ngreatly increases the risk of maternal mortality, and decreases their \nchance of becoming economically independent. Pregnancy and childbirth \nare the leading causes of death for young girls in low- to middle-\nincome countries. And children of young mothers have higher rates of \ninfant mortality and malnutrition compared to children of mothers older \nthan 18.\n  Terrorist groups often use forced marriages to sustain their efforts. \nLast April, for instance, Boko Haram kidnapped over 250 girls in \nNigeria. Some of those girls were later forced to marry their \nkidnappers. The so-called Islamic State is also notorious for forcing \nlocal women and girls to marry its fighters. Forced marriage is \ndeplorable for many reasons, not the least of which is that is it used \nas a weapon of war.\n  The women and girls being forced into these marriages are the very \nsame women and girls who could be leaders, business owners, teachers, \nand doctors if given the chance. It is in the best interest of these \ngirls and of the United States that the international community speak \nwith a united voice against this practice. As ranking member of the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee, I invite all members of Congress to \nwork together to find a way to address this pressing human rights \nissue.\n  I am an original co-sponsor of S. Res. 97, a bipartisan resolution \nsupporting the goals of International Women's Day. After seeing the \nimpacts that the MDGs have had on vulnerable populations around the \nworld, I have no doubt that the goals contained in this resolution can \nbe accomplished if the United States is willing to take the lead in \norganizing the international community.\n  I have mentioned only a small portion of legislative priorities the \nSenate could act on right now.\n  As we move through Women's History Month, let us remember that strong \nand empowered women have gotten us to this point in history and will \nhelp lead us to a brighter future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/senate-section/article/S1586-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1586-S1587]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BLACK WOMEN'S HISTORY WEEK\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I wish to request that, for the \nsecond year in a row, the U.S. Government officially recognize the last \nweek in March as Black Women's History Week. During the week of March \n28, 2016, as part of Women's History Month and in honor of the second \nyear of the United Nation's International Decade for People of African \nDescent, several leading social justice organizations will be holding \ntheir second annual week of events to honor Black women and recognize \ntheir current struggles in American society. This week will shed light \non the reality that Black women confront many intersectional challenges \nin American society, yet their concerns are often pushed to the margins \nof public attention and intervention. This week marks the perfect \noccasion to attend to the often hidden experiences of Black women and \nto generate attention to address the challenges they face.\n  Black women have traditionally gone above and beyond the call of duty \nin their contributions to American society. Black women have been \ninspirational symbols of strength and perseverance through their high \nvoter turnout and historic leadership of racial justice movements. Even \nin the face of grave oppression throughout our Nation's history, Black \nwomen have continued to stand strong and contribute to the well-being \nof their families, their communities, and our country as a whole; yet \nat the same time, Black women continue to face undue burdens and \nobstacles to their own well-being. Acknowledging both the centrality of \nBlack women in our history and social fabric as well as the unique \ninequalities they face is critical in our efforts\n\n[[Page S1587]]\n\nto build a society that ensures equality and justice for all.\n  In conjunction with the congressional declaration, a coalition of \norganizations advocating for the well-being of women and communities of \ncolor will partner to elevate the stories, histories, and realities of \nBlack women's lives, building off the momentum generated by Black \nWomen's History Week in 2015. Our charge is to ensure that the lives of \nBlack women and girls are not overlooked and that efforts to generate \ninformation about their well-being is widely shared across public \nagencies and partner institutions.\n  Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/senate-section/article/S1587-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1587]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   BLEEDING DISORDERS AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, today is St. Patrick's Day. It is a \ngreat day for those of us in this country whose ancestors came here to \nfind a better life. And today, like many of us here, I got up and put \non a green tie, but I switched it out for this one, a red one, to \nhighlight support for those who suffer from serious conditions that \nmany Americans don't speak much about or know much about.\n  This March is the first Bleeding Disorders Awareness Month. It also \nmarks the 30th anniversary of President Ronald Reagan's one-time \ndeclaration of March as Hemophilia Awareness Month.\n  Tens of thousands of Americans have been diagnosed with bleeding \ndisorders, including more than 100 Alaskan families. These families are \nspread all across my State, in Anchorage and Fairbanks, but also in \nrural communities like Chevak, Elim, Tuntutuliak, Kodiak, and Klawock. \nThese Alaskans face serious health challenges with strength and grace \nand form a vibrant tight-knit community, and I want to thank those \ncommunities for supporting their fellow Alaskans.\n  Hemophilia is the most expensive chronic condition to treat. There \nare Alaskan children whose daily dose of medication exceeds $1,800 per \nday. The good news is there is treatment that continues to improve.\n  I want to highlight the work done by the Alaska Hemophilia \nAssociation, a chapter of the National Hemophilia Foundation, which \nprovides services and support for the Alaskan bleeding disorder \ncommunity. They work to provide access to care and insurance and \nsupport our youth by hosting an annual summer camp for Alaskan children \nwith bleeding disorders and their siblings. Camp Frozen Chosen allows \nthese youth to interact with others with similar bleeding disorders. \nThey are also able to learn to manage and take ownership of their \ncondition and their lives, enabling them to be leaders of their \ngeneration.\n  The Alaska Hemophilia Association and the Alaska bleeding disorder \ncommunity are the epitome of Alaskan grit and determination and are \npart of what makes Alaska such a wonderful place.\n  I would ask that we think of those this month who are suffering from \nthese disorders and that we continue to work together to find solutions \nand to offer support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/senate-section/article/S1587-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1587]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     REMEMBERING TAMARA D. GRIGSBY\n\n Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life and \nlegacy of Tamara D. Grigsby, whose untimely passing at the age of 41 \nhas left Wisconsin without one of its greatest champions for equality \nand justice. Tamara committed her life to public service and making a \ndifference in the lives of others. She was known for her honesty, \ndedication, and ability to see beyond partisan posturing to become a \nvoice for those too often forgotten.\n  Growing up in Madison, WI, Tamara's path in life was shaped by her \nexperiences confronting economic disparity and racial bias as a student \nin what is considered Wisconsin's most liberal city. When asked about \nthe apparent dichotomy of this circumstance, she simply responded: \n``I'm a liberal. But liberal doesn't mean enlightened, and it doesn't \nmean informed.'' That statement embodies the essence of who Tamara was.\n  After earning a bachelor's degree at Howard University and a master's \ndegree at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Tamara put her energy \nand skills to work as a social worker in the Milwaukee office of the \nWisconsin Council on Children and Families. Upon seeing the impact she \ncould have on individual lives, she became convinced of the need for \neffective advocacy on a larger scale.\n  In 2004, she successfully ran for the Wisconsin Legislature. Her \ndrive and passion to change the world around her led to her success in \na three-way primary and an unopposed general election to represent the \n18th Assembly District in Milwaukee. During her tenure in the assembly, \nTamara was a strong advocate for disadvantaged families and at-risk \nchildren, who were too often overlooked and marginalized.\n  Tamara quickly gained the respect of her colleagues as a passionate, \nstrong voice for equity, fairness, and the expansion of opportunity. \nShe immersed herself in the legislative process as a member of the \njoint finance committee and as chair of the assembly committee on \nchildren and families. She was an outspoken and effective advocate on \ncritical issues such as access to scientifically based sex education \nand birth control, expansion of transitional jobs to connect unemployed \nindividuals with work, examination of the State's disproportionate \nBlack incarceration rate, and the collection of racial data in police \ntraffic stops. She stood fast against opposition to low-income tax \ncredits and quality health care for low-income Wisconsin residents.\n  Although an unexpected illness ended her 8 years as a State \nrepresentative in 2012, her public service continued. She worked in the \nMilwaukee Public School system and was tapped to lead Dane County's \nDepartment of Equity and Inclusion. It is in this role that Tamara's \nlife came full circle. She was once again in Madison challenging the \nstatus quo on the issues that inspired her to become a fierce advocate \nfor the poor and underrepresented.\n  Although Tamara's time with us was too short, she leaves behind a \nlegacy for future leaders to emulate. She will always be remembered for \nhaving the courage to speak for those who didn't have a voice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/senate-section/article/S1587-3", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1587-S1588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO JUDGE ELLEN M. HELLER\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to honor the career of Judge \nEllen M. Heller. Judge Heller has served the people of Baltimore and \nMaryland in several capacities for many decades. She is well known and \nwell respected in the legal and nonprofit and communities across our \nState. In 2010, Judge Heller brought her considerable talents to the \nWeinberg Foundation, one of Baltimore's most effective nonprofit \norganizations. After 6 years, Judge Heller will be concluding her role \nas chair of the board on March 1, 2016, and she will come to the end of \nher current term as a trustee of the Weinberg Foundation on May 16, \n2016.\n  Judge Heller has helped change lives while she has served at the \nWeinberg Foundation. Her commitment to service and her steadfastness \nhave made her an incredibly effective chairwoman. For my colleagues who \nmay be unfamiliar with the Weinberg Foundation, the organization does \nincredible work on behalf of low-income and vulnerable people from \nMaryland to Hawaii and from the former Soviet Union to Israel and \nbeyond. The responsibility of chairing the board at the Weinberg \nFoundation is significant; we are fortunate Judge Heller's personal and \nprofessional experiences helped make her uniquely suited for the job.\n  Judge Heller is no stranger to hard work. She graduated from the \nJohns Hopkins University, cum laude. She also graduated from my alma \nmater, the University of Maryland School of Law, cum laude. She earned \nboth degrees while raising two sons. Judge Heller's accomplished legal \ncareer began as an assistant attorney general. She soon became an \nassociate judge in the Baltimore City Circuit Court, the eighth \njudicial circuit, and would spend 6 years as the judge in charge of the \ncivil docket.\n  In 1999, Judge Heller became the first woman to serve as a circuit \nadministrative judge on the eighth circuit. She championed numerous \nreforms, including the practice of alternative dispute resolution, ADR, \nin circuit court cases and the introduction of court-ordered mediation \nin certain civil cases. She also directed the establishment of a new \npretrial discovery process, including the appointment of two felony \ndiscovery judges. Her dedication not only\n\n[[Page S1588]]\n\nto justice as a concept, but to improving the process by which justice \nis administered, would serve her well at the Weinberg Foundation.\n  Judges are the public face of the rule of law. I am thankful that so \nmany people will associate justice with such a capable and revered \njudge. In 2003, Judge Heller retired from the bench and began to lend \nmore of her time and talent to various worthy causes around Maryland \nand around the world. For instance, Judge Heller served as president of \nthe American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, gaining experience in \ninternational aid missions. In her long and illustrious career, Judge \nHeller has worked with many other distinguished groups: the Maryland \nSchool for the Blind, the Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene & \nPublic Health, the Task Force on Women in Prison, Girl Scouts of \nCentral Maryland, the Greater Baltimore Medical Center, the Public \nTrust and Confidence Implementation Committee, the Taub Center for \nSocial Policy Studies in Israel, and the World Jewish Restitution \nOrganization. I have omitted many more organizations, but the \nunderlying point here is that Judge Heller brought a wealth of \nexperience and talent to the Weinberg Foundation.\n  The Weinberg Foundation has a long track record of tackling issues \nhead on. The foundation has been a national leader on addressing the \nbasic human needs of healthcare, housing, economic stability, and food \nsecurity. The Weinberg Foundation has also established itself as an \neffective advocate for people living with disabilities, the elderly, \nand our veterans.\n  Judge Heller has helped the Weinberg Foundation accomplish \nextraordinary feats during her time on the board. She oversaw the \nBaltimore Library Project which to seeks to design, build, equip, and \nstaff new or renovated libraries in selected schools where existing \npublic funds can be leveraged. The Weinberg Foundation, with the help \nof 40 partners, will create as many as 24 of these inspirational \nspaces. The Weinberg Foundation has committed a total of $10 million \nfor what is expected to be a legacy project.\n  Judge Heller doubled the amount of funding provided under the \nemployee giving program. The Weinberg Foundation's employee giving \nprogram awards grants to their deeply committed staff to fund direct \noutreach programs.\n  Judge Heller and the Weinberg Foundation have done immeasurable good \nfor people across the State of Maryland and around the world. As Judge \nHeller prepares to step down from the foundation, I would like to thank \nher for her dedication to lifting up all people. I would also like to \nthank her husband, Shale D. Stiller, and the rest of her loving family \nfor sharing such an incredible woman with humanity. Judge Heller has \nplaced the Weinberg Foundation on solid footing to continue to carry \nout its important missions. I know I join my colleagues in \ncongratulating Judge Heller on everything she has accomplished and \nwishing her all the best in her future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/senate-section/article/S1588-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     RECOGNIZING THE EIGHTH GRADE CLASS AT BIG TIMBER GRADE SCHOOL\n\n Mr. DAINES.

There are \n38 students in the class and they all wrote an article.\n  Big Timber is located in southern Montana. It is a small town of \nroughly 1,600 people. I am sure this was a huge honor for the eighth \ngrade class, their parents, and the whole town.\n  Thank you to Lindsey Kroskob, the managing editor of the Big Timber \nPioneer, for making this a goal of hers since 2015 and for making it \nhappen this year. It is people like you that can help shape the minds \nof our young Montanans to realize that anything is possible.\n  Congratulations to the eighth grade class for getting the opportunity \nto write for the newspaper. I look forward to reading your very special \nedition and learning about the students of Big Timber Grade School. \nMaybe I will see your names someday in national publications across our \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/senate-section/article/S1588-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ROBERT LOUGH\n\n Mr. HELLER.

This program assists our nation's servicemembers as they \nreturn home and readjust to life in their communities. The court \nprogram includes representatives from the legal system and volunteers \nwho work to rehabilitate veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder, \ntraumatic brain injury, or drug or alcohol issues. Although there is no \nway to adequately thank the men and women who lay down their lives for \nour freedoms, the Henderson Municipal Court's Veterans Treatment Court \nprogram acts as a one-stop solution for veterans who find themselves in \na position of need. The State of Nevada is fortunate to have someone \nlike Mr. Lough, who demonstrates unwavering loyalty to Nevada veterans, \nworking in support of this important program.\n  Mr. Lough, a veteran himself, served in the U.S. Navy from 1967 to \n1973. No words can properly thank him for his service to our country, \nbut I offer my deepest gratitude for his sacrifices in defending our \nfreedoms. In addition, he is a member of the Vietnam Veterans of \nAmerica in Henderson and Boulder City Chapter 1076. In February, Mr. \nLough was recognized as Veteran of the Month by Governor Brian Sandoval \nfor his efforts in the Henderson Municipal Court's Veterans Treatment \nCourt program, an accolade that is well deserved. Mr. Lough is truly a \nrole model to all not only for his service to our country, but also for \nhis ambitions in caring for our Nation's heroes. For the last 5 years, \nMr. Lough has served as a mentor to struggling veterans who have lost \ntheir way. His charisma, caring character, and dedication to helping \nothers are truly admirable.\n  As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I know the \nstruggles that our veterans face after returning to civilian life after \nservice. Congress has a responsibility to honor these brave individuals \nand ensure they receive the quality care they have earned and deserve. \nI remain committed to upholding this promise for our veterans and \nservicemembers in Nevada and throughout the Nation. I am grateful to \nhave someone like Mr. Lough working as an ally to ensure the needs of \nour veterans are being met.\n  Today I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in recognizing \nMr. Lough for his work at the Henderson Municipal Court's Veterans \nTreatment Court, a program with a mission that is both noble and \nnecessary.

The facility provides geriatric assessment and care \nmanagement to our elderly population, addressing a wide range of \nmedical concerns, including arthritis, dementia, depression, high blood \npressure, frailty, and more. The clinic takes on a comprehensive \napproach, allowing social workers, primary care physicians, nurses, and \npsychologists\n\n[[Page S1589]]\n\nto collaborate in order to make a comprehensive patient assessment. \nEffective communication within the facility connects both the physical \nand mental health of patients, creating a better understanding of the \npatient's needs. The facility also supports patients with multiple \nchronic conditions, coordinating home and clinical services. In \naddition, the Sanford Center for Aging is spearheading the start of a \ntelemedicine program to support our rural communities.

I am grateful that he will \ncontinue to serve his family and the local community of Oxford after \nconcluding his career with the Army. We wish him well in his \nretirement.\n  A native of Georgia, LTC John Walden was commissioned as a second \nlieutenant in the U.S. Army Military Intelligence Corps from Georgia \nMilitary College in 1988. He completed a bachelor of science in \ncriminal justice from Georgia State University in 1995 and his masters \nof arts in leadership from Luther Rice University in 2013.

As an ordained \nminister, he was able to continue serving the community and provide \nmentorship to those in need. He has also worked at Ford Motor Company \nand the Maxell Corporation. It is because of all of their cooperation \nand understanding during his many tours of duty that he was able to \nmake such a positive impact on the Army Reserve.\n  Considering his many positions and service in both the Army and \ncivilian sector, we must acknowledge the tireless support of John's \nwife, Shelley, and his children, Johnathon, Lucy, and Samuel. I thank \nthem for their sacrifices and wish them all the best for continued \nsuccess in the future.\n  Throughout his 29-year career, LTC John Walden has made positive \nimpacts on the careers and lives of his soldiers, peers, and superiors. \nI am grateful for his service to our country, his community, and that \nhe chose to serve as an Army leader. I join my colleagues today in \nhonoring his dedication to the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/senate-section/article/S1589-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING GARY BRAASCH\n\n Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, Gary Braasch, a gifted photographer \nof the natural world, died on March 7, 2016. Gary dedicated his career \nto capturing visually striking portrayals of the devastating effects of \nclimate change. His work has been published in Time, LIFE, the New York \nTimes, National Geographic, and Discover and featured in the Boston \nMuseum of Science, the Chicago Field Museum, and the California Academy \nof Sciences. Some of Gary's most well-known photos depict the retreat \nof glaciers. The juxtaposition of old photos from the turn of the 20th \ncentury with Gary's modern photos dramatically demonstrated large \namounts of glacial melting. Some of these photos were featured in Al \nGore's ``An Inconvenient Truth.''\n  Gary also documented the environmental effects of the fossil fuel \nindustry. He famously captured the first images of Shell's ill-fated \nKulluk oil rig, as it prepared to drill an exploratory oil well in the \nArctic Ocean. The Kulluk is now regarded as a symbol of the \nrecklessness and dangers of Arctic oil drilling and has become a \npowerful image of our need to transition to low-carbon, renewable \nenergy.\n  Gary's photographs were also influential in the scientific and policy \ncommunities. He worked with scientists to determine how to use \nphotography to accurately portray the science of climate change. He \nalso visited Capitol Hill on numerous occasions, providing visual \nevidence of our changing environment to me and my colleagues in the \nHouse and Senate. His 2007 book ``Earth Under Fire'' graced my office \nfor many years.\n  Gary died capturing breathtaking photos on Australia's Great Barrier \nReef, a region particular vulnerable to the effects of climate change. \nHis images resonated in a way words and data could never do alone and \nwill stand on as a key component of our planet's record of climate \nchange. Gary may no longer be with us but his work will continue to \ninspire the next generation of photographers and all of us who want to \nprotect our planet and its people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/senate-section/article/S1589-3", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING BARRY LYNN COATES\n\n Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, today I wish to honor one of South \nCarolina's veterans, Barry Lynn Coates. Mr. Coates recently passed away \nat the age of 46 on January 23, 2016, after a long battle with cancer. \nHe became the voice for veterans across the nation as he fought hard to \nimprove the Veterans Affairs medical system. He fought not for himself, \nbut to improve the lives of all veterans suffering from delays in their \nmedical care.\n  About a year after first complaining to his doctors of pain, he was \nfinally able to get a colonoscopy. Doctors discovered a cancerous tumor \nthe size of a baseball. At that point he had stage 4 cancer, and it was \nonly a matter of time before he was overtaken by the illness. He \nsuffered for months. A simple medical procedure might have saved his \nlife, but he found himself on a growing list of veterans waiting for \nappointments and procedures. Barry Lynn Coates was courageous in his \nfight against cancer and in his fight for other veterans to receive the \ncare they deserve.\n  Lynn is survived by his wife, their five children, five \ngrandchildren, and a community that loved his bubbly personality and \npassion for pawn shops and for fixing things. He loved the beach, \nnature, his family above everything, and he lived for the service of \nhis country.\n  It is with pride and honor we recognize Barry Lynn Coates and his \nfamily today and add their legacy to our March 17, 2016, Congressional \nRecord. We will never forget his sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/senate-section/article/S1589-4", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1589-S1590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BETSY FLEMING\n\n Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, today I wish to honor one of South \nCarolina's great college presidents, Ms. Betsy Fleming. Ms. Fleming is \nthe sitting president for Converse College. Converse College is a \nprivate master's university in Spartanburg, SC, providing a\n\n[[Page S1590]]\n\ndistinctive undergraduate liberal arts education for women and \ninnovative programs for co-ed graduate study. President Fleming has \ndecided to step down at the end of the semester after 11 years of \nleadership at the College.\n  Through her leadership, Converse College has seen unprecedented \ngrowth and extraordinary success. Ms. Fleming has used her passion for \nthe arts to make great strides at Converse, in Spartanburg and \nstatewide. She is leaving quite a legacy in the endowment growth of the \nschool, her decision to cut tuition by 43 percent, and the \nrestructuring of the college to make it more financially sound.\n  President Fleming's love and understanding of the arts community has \nalso brought value to the students and faculty at Converse College, and \nshe has personified what it means to lead. Her vigorous involvement in \nthe college as well as at the local and State level are second to none, \nand she truly represents what it means to be an outstanding leader, \npresident, and trailblazer.\n  It is with pride and honor we recognize Ms. Betsy Fleming and her \noutstanding achievements today and add her legacy to our March 17, \n2016, Congressional Record. We will always remember her admiration for \nthe arts, for Spartanburg, and above all for Converse College.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/senate-section/article/S1590-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CELEBRATING 125 YEARS OF THE JENKINS INSTITUTE\n\n Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, I would like to honor and \ncongratulate the Daniel Joseph Jenkins Institute for Children in North \nCharleston on their 125th anniversary.\n  In 1891, the Jenkins Institute was founded as Jenkins Orphanage. In \n1892, the institute was chartered by the State of South Carolina with \nthe mission of providing a loving and secure home to many children, \nspecifically orphans, in the community.\n  The Jenkins Institute is an example of an organization that remains \ncommitted to the well-being of our community. For 125 years, they have \nopened their door to orphan children, regardless of their race or \nsocioeconomic backgrounds.\n  Today the institute continues to welcome those in need of a safe \nplace to call home. They have shown tremendous faith through works of \ncharity, and their honorable legacy will forever be appreciated. I \nacknowledge with pleasure the Jenkins Institute's influence in North \nCharleston and therefore recognize their service, dedication, and 125 \nyears rooted in love and faith. Because of places like the Daniel \nJoseph Jenkins Institute, our children will have a brighter future \nahead of them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/senate-section/article/S1590-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/senate-section/article/S1590-3", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a treaty which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/senate-section/article/S1590-4", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:57 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4416.

A bill to promote innovative approaches to outdoor \nrecreation on Federal land and to open up opportunities for \ncollaboration with non-Federal partners, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, last summer, I set out on a tour of \nOregon's Seven Wonders to hear from Oregonians in every corner of the \nState about how to improve access to outdoor recreation. Recreation is \na big economic multiplier for my State, and Oregonians are the true \nexperts on--outdoor recreation--it is in our DNA.\n  Oregon's recreation and tourism economy generates an estimated $10 \nbillion a year in direct economic impact for the state and supports \nmore than 101,000 jobs--enough people essentially to fill every seat in \nAutzen and Reser stadiums, home to the University of Oregon Ducks and \nOregon State Beavers. Recreation supports communities and businesses \nlarge and small throughout urban and rural Oregon and can have \nastounding benefits on veterans, youth, and seniors.\n  Not only do you have outfitters and the crafts people who produce \nrecreation products, like canoes, kayaks, bikes, and fishing poles, \nrecreation supports the broader travel and tourism industry including \nequipment retailers and gear shops. But the benefit doesn't stop when \nthe sun goes down. Then visitors go to the brewpubs and restaurants, \nand they stay overnight at the hotels and the motels. So what we need \nto do is ensure that recreation is a higher priority for the future so \nit can continue to boost economies large and small.\n  Yet on my tour of Oregon's Seven Wonders, I consistently heard one \ntroubling theme that's yanking our recreation economy's potential back \ndown to earth. Simply put, red tape is tying down the opportunities for \nOregon recreation and tourism to lift off to even greater heights. \nOutfitters and guides must navigate confusing permit processes only to \nwait months or years for their permits to get approved, and outdoor \nenthusiasts searching for outdoor recreation opportunities often get \nlost in the paperwork before they ever hit the trails.\n  That is why today I am introducing the Recreation Not Red-Tape, RNR, \nAct to ensure that recreation is a priority for Federal agencies and to \ncut the bureaucratic red tape in the recreation permitting process to \nmake accessing outdoor recreation opportunities easier and much more \nfun. I gathered input from Oregonians who enjoy public lands, \nentrepreneurs in the outdoor travel and tourism industry, and community \nleaders from Oregon and across the Nation. The bill focuses on making \nsure everyone has easier access to the outdoors, recognizing and \nbuilding on recreation as an economic driver, and making the repair and \nmanagement of our recreational public lands easier. Additionally, the \nbill supports improving access to outdoor recreation for veterans, \nseniors, and youth.\n  My friend and colleague, Representative Earl Blumenauer, is today \nintroducing the House companion of the Recreation Not Red-Tape Act. The \nbill is supported by over 50 Oregon and national organizations, from \nAmerican Alpine Club to Vet Voice.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COTTON:\n  S. 2708. A bill to provide for the admission to the United States of \nup to 10,000 Syrian religious minorities as refugees of special \nhumanitarian concern in each of the fiscal years 2016 through 2020; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, 6 months ago, a 12-year-old boy stood \nbefore a crowd in a Syrian village not far from Aleppo. This boy was \nChristian and standing above him were Islamic State terrorists holding \nknives. In the crowd was the boy's father, a Christian minister. \nMethodically, the terrorists began cutting off the young boy's fingers. \nAmidst his screams, they turned to the minister, his father. If he \nrenounced his faith and in their terms returned to Islam, his son's \nsuffering would stop. In the end, however, these ISIS terrorists killed \nthe boy, killed his father, and killed two other Christians solely over \nthe faith they professed. They did so by crucifixion.\n  In the time of Christ, the cross was not just a means of execution \nbut a brutal and public warning to all. Because of Christ's suffering, \nthe cross was transformed into a revered symbol of His sacrifice and \npromise of salvation, but today it is clear ISIS seeks to turn the \ncross once again into a message of dread.\n  Eight other Christians in the village that day were also killed. They \nwere executed by public beheading, but not before ISIS barbarians raped \nthe two women among the victims and forced the crowd to witness the \natrocity.\n  Today was the deadline set by law for Secretary of State Kerry to \npresent Congress with an evaluation of the persecution of Christians, \nYazidis, and other religious minorities in Syria and Iraq. I am \nheartened Secretary Kerry this morning took the needed step of \ndeclaring the systemic murder of religious minorities by ISIS what it \nplainly is: genocide.\n  The nature of these horrific crimes of ISIS has not been a secret. It \nis no secret that the story of the torture and death of that 12-year-\nold Syrian boy, his minister father, and 10 other Christians is \nrepeated many times over in different villages, with different victims \nof different religions throughout the region. It is no secret that \nhundreds of thousands of religious minorities in Syria and Iraq have \nbeen driven by war and violence from homes and lands they have held for \ngenerations. It is no secret ISIS terrorists have destroyed Christian \nchurches, desecrated holy ancient shrines, and dug up Christian graves \nand smashed their tombstones. It is no secret bishops, priests, and \nother clerical leaders are being abducted and murdered. It is no secret \nISIS terrorists capture Yazidi women and girls and lock them into a \nlife of sexual slavery and repeated rape. Many of these victims choose \nto take their own lives, seeing suicide as their only escape amidst \nhopelessness and unimaginable suffering. It is no secret that thousands \nof Christians and other religious minorities have been systematically \nraped and tortured, beheaded, crucified, burned alive, and buried in \nmass graves, if buried at all. It is no secret the word we should use \nto describe the whole of these atrocities--the word we must use--is \n``genocide.''\n  The plain reality is that the Islamic State is seeking to eradicate \nChristians, Yazidis, Sabean-Mandeans, Jews, and other religious groups \nit sees as apostates and infidels. This is part of its fanatical focus \non establishing a caliphate first in the Middle East and eventually \nacross the rest of the world.\n  Christians, Yazidis, and others who have managed to find refuge have \nseen ISIS's genocidal campaign firsthand. They can list name after name \nof missing family members--wives and daughters kidnapped into sexual \nslavery,\n\n[[Page S1595]]\n\nsons and brothers killed, and others spirited away to unknown fates. \nThese victims know the truth of the genocide occurring in Syria and \nIraq, and now that truth is recognized officially by the United States \nof America.\n  There are those who wavered on whether this was genocide. They feared \nthat uttering this truth would compel U.S. action to stop the genocide. \nMy answer is--and? A mortal enemy who wishes to commit mass terrorist \natrocities against the United States is also systematically persecuting \nand exterminating Christians and other religious minorities. When will \nour national security interests ever overlap more perfectly with our \nmoral sentiment than now? We can and we ought to stop ISIS dead, stop \nthem before they kill more Americans, stop them before they eliminate \nChristian communities that have existed since the days of Christ \nhimself.\n  Still others argue that while a genocide may be occurring, \nrecognizing it may somehow play into ISIS's propaganda that it is \nfighting a righteous jihad against a supposed new Crusade. I never \nunderstood this argument. To stay silent in the face of ISIS's \npropaganda is to accommodate that propaganda. To cede any power to \nISIS's narrative is to bend the light of truth to the hard darkness of \na lie. Standing up for the practitioners of religions born in the \nMiddle East and calling the region home since the beginning of recorded \nhistory is not a new Crusade. It is a defense of world order \ndemonstrated through the periods of peaceful coexistence of the many \nreligions in those ancient lands--an existence that today is threatened \nwith extinction by ISIS's barbarism.\n  Today the United States rightly recognizes this genocide, but we must \nalso take action to relieve it. ISIS is a threat to the United States, \nour allies, and to the stability of the whole Middle East. Destroying \nISIS and stopping its malignant expansion is a core national security \ninterest of the United States, but stopping ISIS and the depraved \nideology that enables it is also a pursuit that aligns with our highest \nideals and humanitarian principles.\n  I and many of my colleagues in the Senate have deep disagreements \nwith the President's policy to defeat ISIS. For 2 years his policy of \nconfusion, delay, and paralysis has failed to stop these terrorists. An \nentirely new approach that has the United States in the lead of a \ndetermined coalition is badly needed, but it is not only President \nObama's strategic approach that is ill-considered. His policy on Syrian \nrefugee resettlement is as well. Because the United States unwisely \nrelies on the United Nations for all referrals of refugees seeking \nresettlement in the United States, Christians and other religious \nminorities fleeing persecution are the victims of unintentional \ndiscrimination when seeking asylum and protection in the United States.\n  Last year, of the 1,790 Syrian refugees resettled in the United \nStates, only 41 were religious minorities. Of that 41, 29 were \nChristian. That means that while 13 percent of Syria's prewar \npopulation consisted of religious minorities, only 2.3 percent of the \nrefugees who make it to the United States are religious minorities. \nWithout doubt, Syrians of all confessions are being victimized by this \nsavage war and are facing unimaginable suffering, but only Christians \nand other religious minorities are the deliberate targets of systemic \npersecution and genocide. Their ancient communities are at risk of \nextermination. Their ancestral homes and religious sites are being \nerased from the Middle Eastern map. Christians and other minorities \nshould not be shut out from the small number of refugees who find \nshelter in the United States. We ought to help ensure that these faith \ncommunities survive, but why are Christians underrepresented among the \nrefugees? There are a number of factors. Perhaps chief among them is \nthat the United States, for all intents and purposes, relies \nexclusively on the U.N. refugee agency to identify candidates for \nresettlement. According to the State Department, less than 1 percent of \nthe thousands of Syrian refugees referred by the U.N. to the United \nStates are religious minorities.\n  Let me stress that this underrepresentation is not the result of \nintentional discrimination. The U.N. does praiseworthy and hard work in \nrelieving the suffering of refugees around the world and, as a result, \nimproving the security and stability of nations in and near conflict \nand disaster zones, but it is well established that many religious \nminorities in Syria are very reluctant to register as refugees with the \nUnited Nations because they fear facing even more persecution. The U.N. \nitself has reported that minority communities ``fear that registration \nmight bring retribution from other refugees'' in camps or other areas \nin which they sought safe haven. The U.S. Commission on International \nReligious Freedom has reported that Christians refrain from registering \nwith the U.N. because they fear being marked for revenge by forces \nloyal to Bashar al-Assad should he remain in power in Syria.\n  Whether these fears are well-founded or not, the reality is, they \nexist and they deter Christians from seeking U.N. protection. While the \nU.N. has sought to educate minority populations on the safety of the \nregistration system, the fact remains that only 1 percent of the \nmillions of Syrian refugees who registered with the U.N. are non-\nMuslim.\n  The United States ought not to depend solely on the U.N. for refugee \nresettlement referrals. If we are to do our part in saving ancient \nfaith communities from genocide, we must find alternate ways to \nidentify persecuted people to whom we can grant safe haven.\n  Today I am introducing legislation to create that alternate way. The \nReligious Persecution Relief Act would grant religious minorities \nfleeing persecution from groups like ISIS and other groups in Syria \npriority status so they can apply directly to the U.S. resettlement \nprogram, without going through the U.N. first. It will set aside 10,000 \nresettlement slots annually that must be devoted to religious \nminorities.\n  The priority status, known as P-2 status, will allow religious \nminorities to skip the U.N. referral process, and it will fast track \nthe process by which we confirm that they are in fact targets of \npersecution and genocide. To answer in advance a most urgent and \nunderstandable question, those who apply for P-2 status will be subject \nto the exact same security vetting process as all other refugee \napplicants. It is my strong position that the United States must work \nwith known religious leaders in the region and pursue other proven \nvetting methods to ensure that those who enter this country are not \nthreats to the security of the American people.\n  Extending a hand to help persecuted people in this manner is not a \nnew idea. In 1989, the late Senator from New Jersey, Frank Lautenberg, \ncrafted what has been called the Lautenberg amendment, which granted P-\n2 priority status to Soviet Jewry, Vietnamese nationals, and other \nreligious minorities seeking refuge. In 2004, the late Senator from \nPennsylvania, Arlen Specter, expanded the Lautenberg amendment to cover \nreligious minorities fleeing oppression from the Ayatollahs in Iran. In \n2007 the late Senator from Massachusetts, Ted Kennedy, passed a bill \nthat granted priority status to certain Iraqi religious minority \nmembers.\n  The bill I am introducing today follows this bipartisan tradition of \nthe Senate and our country. Among the first Americans were Pilgrims \nfrom religious persecution in the Old World. That is one reason we have \na long tradition of defending religious minorities here and around the \nworld.\n  In the coming weeks, I will discuss this bill with my fellow \nSenators. My hope is, it will pass and pass soon because each day will \nbring another Christian child who is tortured, another minister \ncrucified, and another girl raped. Faith communities in the Middle East \nare slowly being strangled out of existence.\n  We are coming upon Easter, the day of Christ's resurrection. The \nmessage of Easter is one for all of humanity; that in times of pain and \nsuffering, trial and tribulation, there can ultimately be salvation, \nthere can ultimately be triumph over death.\n  I try to keep this message in mind, particularly amidst these times \nwhen religious conflict and oppression do not seem to be waning but \nwaxing. Today Christianity is the most persecuted religion in the \nworld. Other religions are not far behind in the scope and depth of the \noppression they face. While the United States cannot save all those\n\n[[Page S1596]]\n\nwho are suffering from religious persecution, when the persecutors are \nrabid terrorists who want to kill Americans and we have the means not \nonly to defeat those terrorists but to also protect the innocent, we \nought to act. Certainly we have an obligation to stop the unintentional \ndiscrimination in our own refugee process that unfairly blocks \nChristians and other religious minorities from seeking safety in the \nUnited States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. HIRONO (for herself, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \n        Heinrich, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Baldwin, Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. \n        Brown):\n  S. 2710. A bill to increase the participation of historically \nunderrepresented demographic groups in science, technology, \nengineering, and mathematics education and industry; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, March is Women's History Month. So this \nmorning I would like to highlight the progress women have made in the \nfields of science, technology, engineering, and math--or the STEM \nfields--challenges that persist, and legislation that I will be \nintroducing to help overcome these challenges.\n  Today we rely on computers for much of our modern life. For that, we \nthank pioneer RDML Grace Hopper, who was one of the first computer \nprogrammers. Space travel is one of the most technologically \nchallenging endeavors that humankind has undertaken. The road to \nbecoming an astronaut requires intelligence and toughness, not to \nmention fortitude. Astronauts like Sally Ride, the first American woman \nin space, have shown that women belong in every endeavor.\n  Hawaii is home to women leaders in STEM fields. Dr. Isabella Aiona \nAbbott was raised in rural Hana on the island of Maui. She became the \nfirst Native Hawaiian woman to receive a Ph.D. in science and went on \nto discover over 200 species of algae. She remains a leading expert on \nPacific algae. These women persevered and rose to great heights of \nsuccess in the STEM fields. However, we must do better to make sure \nthat many more women have the opportunity to pursue STEM careers. While \ngirls and boys express a similar level of interest in STEM at an early \nage, studies have found that women start to lose interest in STEM as \nearly as in middle school. This loss of women and minorities continues \nat nearly every stage of the STEM career trajectory. For example, women \nare more likely to switch from a STEM to non-STEM major in their first \nyear of college than their male counterparts.\n  Girls and women report many reasons for losing interest in STEM. \nThese include negative stereotypes about women in STEM, perceived \ngender barriers, feelings of isolation, and a lack of female role \nmodels and mentors. Gender bias and institutional barriers still slow \nthe advancement of girls and women. Research shows that issues of bias \ncan hinder interest in STEM, influence academic performance, and \ninfluence whether faculty encourages female students to pursue STEM \ncareers. Furthermore, bias--whether conscious or unconscious--can harm \nthe hiring, promotion, and career advancement of women in STEM. Bias \ncan even hurt female researchers' chances of winning competitive \nscience grants. Approximately half of the U.S. population and workforce \nis made up of women. But women make up just over a quarter of the STEM \nworkforce.\n  As our economy becomes more global, our entire population--men and \nwomen--must be engaged in fields that will keep America competitive on \nthe world stage. Expanding the number of women and minorities in STEM \nfields is essential to meeting that challenge. The importance of \ngrowing the U.S. STEM workforce is acknowledged by leaders and \nbusinesses in all fields at all levels. For example, this recognition \nwas very evident in the Senate's immigration reform debate. When I \nserved on the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2013, increasing our STEM \nworkforce through immigration policy drove major sections of the \nbipartisan immigration reform bill passed by the Senate.\n  In Hawaii and elsewhere, there are programs that expose students to \nSTEM careers through mentoring and interactive activities such as \nrobotics. I want to focus on one school in Hawaii that created these \nopportunities for their students--Molokai Middle School. This is a \nschool that struggled with science and math scores, but when their \nteachers established a robotics programs, students from all backgrounds \ngot interested in science. The year the program started, the Molokai \nMiddle School robotics team overcame all odds to represent Hawaii in a \nnational robotics tournament. This year, they will compete in an \ninternational robotics competition in Kentucky. Molokai is an island of \nonly about 7,000 people. Their students have thrived and succeeded \nthrough their STEM experience. While programs like these have a \npositive impact on encouraging students to stay excited about STEM \nfields, there are not enough of such programs.\n  That is why today I am proud to be joined by Senators Gillibrand, \nMurray, Feinstein, Heinrich, Baldwin, Stabenow, and Brown to introduce \nthe Women and Minorities in STEM Booster ACT to improve the \nrecruitment, retention, and success of women and minorities at all \nstages of the STEM pipeline. This bill authorizes the National Science \nFoundation to award competitive grants for outreach, mentoring, and \nprofessional development programs.\n  The STEM booster act also authorizes funding for STEM education \noutreach programs at the elementary and secondary school levels, \nfunding for mentoring programs, and programs to increase the \nrecruitment and retention of women and minority faculty.\n  I am also working on another bill to address some of the cultural and \ninstitutional barriers that I mentioned today, which impede women's and \nminorities' advancement in STEM fields. In addition to increasing \nmentoring and outreach programs, the second bill will improve guidance, \ntraining, and coordination among Federal STEM agencies and universities \nto proactively combat bias and discrimination.\n  We are on the right track to grow our STEM workforce in the United \nStates, but we still need to move forward faster. We must act now to \nspeed this process. My bill will help expose more girls, women, and \nminorities to opportunities in STEM fields and accelerate their \nparticipation.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting women and minorities in \nSTEM now.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 2711. A bill to expand opportunity for Native American children \nthrough additional options in education, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to help \ntackle the challenging problem of fixing our broken education system on \nIndian reservations. The bill, known as the Native American Education \nOpportunity Act, would expand the education opportunities of Native \nAmerican student living on reservations by allowing their parents to \ntake full advantage of Education Savings Account which would be funded \nby the Bureau of Indian Education, BIE.\n  Under this bill, eligible students could apply for up to 90 percent \nof the per pupil expenditure that BIE would spend on them at a BIE \nschool and use those funds to pay for private school tuition, tutors, \nonline curriculum courses, special needs services, and other K-12 \neducation needs. This funding would be provided through the use of \nEducation Savings Accounts, or ESA's, which are established State-\nadministered programs in the States of Arizona, Mississippi, Florida, \nTennessee, and Nevada.\n  Across the Nation, there is a growing interest in State legislatures \nin enacting ESA's because of the freedom and opportunity they give to \nfamilies, but in particular low-income students. My home State of \nArizona is at the forefront of this revolutionary approach of \nempowering parents-To customize their child's education. I believe that \nfamilies living on Indian reservations in my state and elsewhere should \nreap the benefits of ESA's too.\n  As my colleagues know, the need to improve Indian County is a crisis \nissue. I'm of course referring to the broken Bureau of Indian Education \nsystem which consists of 185 schools and 41,000 students. By some \nestimates, the BIE's\n\n[[Page S1597]]\n\naverage per pupil spending is $15,000--higher than the national \naverage. Less than 7 percent of all Native American students attend a \nBIE school, but the performance disparity between BIE students and \nNative American students attending non-BIB schools is staggering. \nAlmost half of BIE students do not graduate from high school. Their \ntest scores trail by double digits compared to their peers. Some BIB \nschools have facilities that are unsuitable as a learning environment. \nA series of recent reports by the Government Accountability Office, \nGAO, have focused on the disrepair of schools and bureaucratic \nmismanagement. Some schools desks, school supplies, and even heat.\n  I wholeheartedly agree that Congress must intervene and implement \nadministrative reforms and maintenance improvements. But, let us \nconsider that market competition could be a powerful tool for improving \nteacher retention, diversifying education options, and improving test \nscores and graduation rates in Indian Country more so than any 5-year \nBIB plan developed in Washington.\n  This bill is particularly useful for rural Indian reservations with \nlarge land bases where children living on the reservation have little \nchoice but to attend a BIB school. Take for example the Navajo Nation \nwhere non-BIB public schools can be over 50 miles away, and private \nschool options are few and far between. It is unconscionable to leave \nstudents stranded in failing schools when we can create the option of \nexpanding their educational opportunities in even the most remote parts \nof Indian County. We can and should do more to create a market that \nattracts private schools and other education services willing to open \nshop on remote Indian reservations.\n  School choice initiatives, while still relatively new, are building a \ntrack record of success. One example is a Federal program set up 12 \nyears ago to address the beleaguered public school system in our \nNation's capital, Washington, D.C. Congress established the D.C. \nOpportunity Scholarship Program which at one time provided up to $20 \nmillion in scholarships to low income families to pull their children \nout of a failing DC public schools and place them in a private school. \nThe DC program transformed the future of thousands of children in the \nDistrict. In 2011, a U.S. Department of Education study found that \ngraduation rates, particularly among minority students jumped by as \nmuch as 20 percent for the kids who participated in the program.\n  The situation in the BIE school system is failing, and it is a \nreflection of our failure in our solemn obligation to meet certain \nneeds of Native Americans living on Indian reservations. I believe that \nopening up education opportunism beyond BIE schools for Native American \nfamilies can prove to be one of the most effective agents for change \nfor education in Indian Country. I encourage my colleagues to support \nthis legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 2716. A bill to update the oil and gas and mining industry guides \nof the Securities and Exchange Commission; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nrequire the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, to update its \nindustry guides for oil, gas, and mining companies.\n  In November 2015, Peabody Energy agreed to provide comprehensive SEC \ndisclosures about climate change risks facing the company when it \nsettled charges of misleading investors. The company executed this \nsettlement with the New York Attorney General after an investigation \ndiscovered that Peabody Energy ``repeatedly denied in public financial \nfilings to the SEC that it had the ability to predict the impact that \npotential regulation of climate change pollution would have on its \nbusiness, even though Peabody and its consultants actually made \nprojections that such regulation would have severe impacts on the \ncompany.''\n  Unfortunately, it appears that the SEC had no role in this \nsettlement, in which Peabody Energy agreed to amend its SEC \ndisclosures, admitting that ``concerns about the environmental impacts \nof coal combustion . . . could significantly affect demand for our \nproducts or our securities.''\n  It is clear that the SEC needs to do more when it comes to critically \nreviewing the disclosures being filed by publicly traded companies, but \nit is also clear that the SEC's industry guides for oil, gas, and \nmining companies should be updated to reflect the growing risk of \nclimate change to these companies. By so doing, the investing public \ncan access the material information necessary to make informed \ndecisions when investing in these types of companies. Indeed, it is for \nthis reason that the SEC has established industry guides for certain \nindustries with complex financial and non-financial data.\n  These disclosures are important to investors, such as Allianz Global \nInvestors, which is a global diversified active investment manager with \nnearly $500 billion in assets under management. Allianz has \nspecifically called for ``achieving better disclosure of the effects of \ncarbon costs on the Oil & Gas companies.''\n  In updating the industry guides for oil, gas, and mining companies, \nmy legislation would direct the SEC to work with the SEC's Investor \nAdvisory Committee. This Committee was established by the Wall Street \nReform and Consumer Protection Act to advise and consult with the SEC \non regulatory priorities, the regulation of securities products, \ntrading strategies, fee structures, disclosure effectiveness, and on \ninitiatives to promote investor confidence and the integrity of the \nsecurities marketplace.\n  I thank Ceres for their support, and I also thank Representative \nCartwright for introducing companion legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives today. I urge our colleagues to join us in supporting \nthis legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BARRASSO (for himself and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 2717. A bill to improve the safety and address the deferred \nmaintenance needs of Indian dams to prevent flooding on Indian \nreservations, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Dam \nRepairs and Improvements for Tribes Act of 2016 or DRIFT Act. This \nimportant legislation is intended to address the flood prevention and \ndam safety needs in Indian Country. It would address the deferred \nmaintenance needs of Bureau of Indian Affairs, BIA, dams, as well as \nreform tribal programs within the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n  The BIA has 137 high-hazard dams and over 700 low-hazard dams across \nthe United States. Nearly all of the high-hazard dams are in Western \nUnited States, including two high-hazard dams on the Wind River \nReservation in my home State of Wyoming--Washakie Dam and Ray Lake Dam. \nAccording to the BIA staff, on average these dams are 70 to 80 years \nold and have over $500 million in deferred maintenance needs. Funding \nis simply not keeping up with the maintenance needs of these dams and \nthe threat to public safety in and around Indian Country is very real. \nThe United States has a trust obligation to maintain and operate these \ndams and prevent what could be a future dam failure.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would require the Assistant \nSecretary of Indian Affairs, in consultation with the Secretary of the \nArmy, to address the maintenance backlog of BIA dams by establishing a \nHigh-Hazard Indian Dam Safety Deferred Maintenance Fund and a Low-\nHazard Indian Dam Safety Deferred Maintenance Fund. The high-hazard \nfund would receive $22,750,000 each year from fiscal years 2017 through \n2037. The low-hazard fund would receive $10,000,000 for the same time \nperiod. The bill funds low-hazard dams if their needs are critical as \nwell and are not being addressed by available scarce resources. \nNeglecting the deferred maintenance needs of these dams may result in \nthem becoming high hazard dams in the near future.\n  The DRIFT Act establishes criteria for how the money would be \nprioritized, looking at criteria such as threats to public safety, \nnatural or cultural resources, and economic concerns. The criteria also \nlooks at the ability of increasing water storage capacity of BIA dams \nto prevent flooding to downstream communities.\n  The legislation also seeks to make other important flood prevention \nand\n\n[[Page S1598]]\n\ndam safety policy reforms for both the BIA and the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers. Specifically, the DRIFT Act establishes a 4-year pilot \nprogram for a BIA flood mitigation program for tribes; establishes a \nTribal Safety of Dams Committee within the Department of the Interior \nto make recommendations to Congress for modernizing the Indian Dam \nSafety Act; and mandates that tribes regularly report their dam \ninventory to BIA.\n  The bill requires the BIA to report annually on the safety status of \ntheir dams to Congress; makes reforms to the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers' Tribal Partnership Program to allow the Corps to pay for any \nfeasibility study of a project costing not more than $10,000,000; \nallows in-kind contributions by tribes to count towards a cost-share of \na U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' feasibility study; and allows tribes to \nnot have a cost share for studies and projects that cost up to \n$200,000. This is the same cost-sharing requirements the U.S. Army \nCorps of Engineers allows for U.S. territories.\n  It is time to make sure that we make the necessary changes to ensure \nthat tribes and surrounding communities are protected, and that the \nFederal Government collaborates with and empowers Indian tribes to \nsecure their communities.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KAINE (for himself, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Portman, Mrs. Capito, \n        and Ms. Ayotte):\n  S. 2718. A bill to amend the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical \nEducation Act of 2006 to support innovative approaches to career and \ntechnical education and redesign the high school experience for \nstudents by providing students with equitable access to rigorous, \nengaging, and relevant real world education through partnerships with \nbusiness and industry and higher education that prepare students to \ngraduate from high school and enroll into postsecondary education \nwithout the need for remediation and with the ability to use knowledge \nto solve complex problems, think critically, communicate effectively, \ncollaborate with others, and develop academic mindsets; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, the demands of today's competitive global \nmarket require that students have the right skills and knowledge to \nsucceed in postsecondary education and enter the workforce. Providing \nstudents with an engaging experience that is relevant to the workforce \nand integrates partnerships with industry and higher education is \ncritical to our Nation's future. Unfortunately, these opportunities are \nlacking in many of today's high schools, leaving students unprepared \nfor 21st century careers.\n  Career and technical education, CTE, is often overlooked in \ndiscussions on increasing relevancy and rigor in our Nation's schools--\ndespite the fact that a strong focus on academics is the cornerstone of \nhigh-quality CTE. When the National Research Center for Career and \nTechnical Education conducted a 4-year longitudinal study in three \nstates, they found that students participating in CTE programs or \ncareer pathways outperformed their peers on the number of credits they \nearned in science, technology, engineering and math, STEM, and AP \nclasses, while also earning higher grade point averages in their CTE \nclasses.\n  That is why I am introducing with my colleagues, Senators Portman, \nBaldwin, and Capito, the CTE Excellence and Equity Act. This bipartisan \nlegislation supports funding for innovation in career and technical \neducation to help redesign the high school experience for historically \nunderserved students. It would authorize grants to partnerships among \nschool districts, employers, and institutions of higher education in \nVirginia and other states that help students earn industry recognized \ncredentials or credit toward a postsecondary degree or certificate. The \nbill also places an emphasis on understanding the relevance of \ncoursework in the context of a future career by placing an emphasis on \nteaching workplace skills through job shadowing, internships, and \napprenticeships.\n  CTE programs are critical components to every student's education. I \nam pleased to be introducing this bipartisan legislation to strengthen \nCTE programs in high school so that students are better prepared for \npostsecondary studies and the workforce. I hope that my colleagues \nconsider this legislation as we move to reauthorize the Carl D. Perkins \nCTE Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. \n        Durbin, and Ms. Warren):\n  S. 2719. A bill to amend the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to \nimprove the protections provided to members of the uniformed services \nand their families, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have often said when our nation sends \nmen and women to war we commit to taking care of them when they return \nhome. We also promise them important legal protections to allow them to \nfocus on their mission and in recognition that while they are deployed \nor away from home servicemembers often do not have the resources to \nrespond to a range of financial and legal issues. Despite these \nprotections, too many servicemembers have been cheated on their student \nloans, on their mortgages, and on their credit cards.\n  When our men and women in uniform are serving our country, they \nshould not have to worry about whether our government is going to hold \nup its end of the bargain and fulfill its responsibilities to them.\n  So today I introduce the SCRA Enhancement and Improvement Act of \n2016, which will put an end to many of these predatory practices and \ngive servicemembers and the government the tools they need to fight \nback when banks and student loan servicers deny servicemembers their \nrights.\n  In 2014, I learned of allegations that at least one major student \nloan servicer had been overcharging men and women in uniform on their \nstudent loans while they were on active duty. That's unacceptable. One \nservicemember overcharged on their student loans is one too many.\n  That is why this bill will end the unfair and improper practices of \nstudent loan servicers by requiring them to automatically apply the \nServicemembers Civil Relief Act, SCRA, interest rate cap, respond \nwithin 14 days to any request for SCRA protections, and provide a full \nexplanation any time they deny an SCRA protection, along with clear \ninstructions on how to remedy the situation so the servicemember can \nreceive that protection. It will also require student loan servicers to \nhave a designated service representative or point of contact for \nservicemembers and ensure these individuals are properly trained on the \nneeds of servicemembers, how the military operates, and the protections \nrequired by SCRA, the Higher Education Act, and other laws.\n  The bill will hold servicers accountable for their conduct and \ntreatment of servicemembers by requiring them to retain all \ncommunications with servicemembers so we can conduct thorough \noversight.\n  The SCRA Enhancement and Improvement Act will also hold the \nDepartment of Education accountable for enforcing standards and the law \nwith its student loan servicers. Following numerous allegations of \nservicemembers being mistreated by student loan servicers who were not \ncomplying with the SCRA interest rate caps, and at least 69,000 \nservicemembers who were overcharged by one Federal contractor, I asked \nthe Department to review how many servicemembers had been improperly \ndenied their benefits under SCRA. Shockingly, the Department told us \nthat the servicers were complying in the ``vast majority of cases.'' \nThis was inconsistent with what the Department of Justice and the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau had found.\n  I wrote to the Department of Education's Inspector General and asked \nher to review the Department's findings. Two weeks ago the IG released \ntheir report, and it showed that instead of doing a thorough \ninvestigation to find out exactly how many servicemembers may have been \novercharged on their student loans, the Department's review was riddled \nwith errors and papered over mishandling of military borrowers' loans.\n  The bill I am introducing today will require sufficient notice to be \ngiven when a loan is transferred or sold, and that all benefits or \nprotections for the servicemember are seamlessly transferred to the new \nloan servicer. It will\n\n[[Page S1599]]\n\nalso forgive all Federal and private student loan debt in the event the \nservicemember dies in the line of duty.\n  The SCRA Enhancement and Improvement Act also expands protections \nbeyond student loans. I was concerned when several years ago some of \nthe nation's largest mortgage servicers improperly overcharged and \nforeclosed upon deployed servicemembers in violation of the SCRA. \nThousands of servicemembers and veterans were wronged over several \nyears. After those allegations came to light, and after the Department \nof Justice reached a settlement with those mortgage servicers, GAO \nreleased a report in 2014 looking at the importance of mortgage and \nforeclosure protections in the SCRA. The results were concerning, \nespecially when they found at one mortgage servicer that 82 percent of \nloans that would have benefitted from the SCRA's interest rate cap \nstill had rates in excess of 6 percent.\n  This bill would reduce the interest rate cap to three percent to \nprovide meaningful protection to servicemembers, including a zero \npercent cap for servicemembers eligible for hostile fire or imminent \ndanger pay. It would expand the SCRA interest rate protection to all of \na servicemember's debt regardless of when it was incurred, in order to \ncover consolidation loans and in recognition that the same challenges \nexist for military borrowers regardless of when a debt was first \nincurred. It would also strengthen the protections that prevent \njudgements against a servicemember who cannot appear in court because \nof military service.\n  As the daughter of a World War II veteran, I know how much our \nmilitary families sacrifice on behalf of their country. So I believe \nprotecting our military men and women from predatory practices is an \nabsolutely essential commitment we make to them. We will not allow our \nservicemembers to be taken advantage of.\n  Finally, as we have seen too often, these protections are only as \ngood as our ability to enforce the law and hold people accountable. The \nSCRA Enhancement and Improvement Act will give servicemembers, the \nDepartment of Justice, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau the \nlegal and oversight tools they need to hold entities accountable. It \nwould clarify that servicemembers may bring a private right of action \nto enforce their rights and make arbitration clauses unenforceable \nunless all parties agree after a dispute arises. The bill will give the \nAttorney General the authority to issue civil investigative demands in \nSCRA investigations. It would double the fines against parties found to \nbe violating the protections afforded by the SCRA.\n  With the number of Federal entities involved, it is essential the \ndepartments and agencies work collaboratively to protect \nservicemembers. The Defense Department must ensure it is providing \nclear, useful information to servicemembers on their rights and how to \ninvoke them, and that the training stays current. I especially commend \nthe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for its dedicated work on \nbehalf of our men and women in uniform.\n  Our servicemembers deserve better than what they have gotten over the \nlast several years. The SCRA Enhancement and Improvement Act will go a \nlong way to ensuring our servicemembers are protected, putting a stop \nto the predatory practices of banks and student loan servicers, and \nchange the apathy that has characterized the Department of Education's \noversight. I encourage all of my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MARKEY (for himself and Ms. Warren):\n  S. 2730. A bill to award a Congressional Gold Medal to the 23rd \nHeadquarters Special Troops, known as the ``Ghost Army'', collectively, \nin recognition of its unique and incredible service during World War \nII; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Ghost Army \nCongressional Gold Medal Act to honor the 23rd Headquarters Special \nTroops, called the ''Ghost Army,'' which was a top-secret unit of the \nUnited States Army that served in the European Theater of Operations \nduring World War II. The unit was actively engaged in battlefield \noperations from June of 1944 through March of 1945. The deceptive \nactivities of the Ghost Army were essential to several Allied victories \nacross Europe and are estimated to have saved thousands of lives.\n  I was inspired to introduce this bill after hearing the story of Jack \nMcGlynn of Medford, MA. I have known Jack for decades going back to my \ntime in the Massachusetts State Legislature, but I never knew that he \nwas a member of the Ghost Army. Like many World War II Veterans, Jack \nreturned home to Massachusetts after the War, started a family, and got \ninvolved in local politics. Jack was a city councilor, Mayor, and State \nRepresentative. He kept his service in the Ghost Army a secret from \neveryone, even his wife and 6 children. Finally in 2008, Jack read that \nit was declassified and he finally shared the story with his family and \nfriends.\n  In evaluating the performance of the Ghost Army after the War, a U.S. \nArmy analysis found that ``Rarely, if ever, has there been a group of \nsuch a few men which had so great an influence on the outcome of a \nmajor military campaign.''. Many Ghost Army soldiers were specially \nselected for their mission, and were recruited from art schools, \nadvertising agencies, communications companies, and other creative and \ntechnical professions.\n  The first four members of the Ghost Army landed on D-day and two \nbecame casualties while camouflaging early beach installations. The \nGhost Army's secret deception operations commenced in France on June \n14, 1944, when Task Force Mason landed at Omaha Beach to draw enemy \nfire and protect the 980th Artillery.\n  Task Force Mason was a prelude to full scale tactical deceptions \ncompleted by the Ghost Army. Often operating on or near the front \nlines, the Ghost Army used inflatable tanks, artillery, air planes and \nother vehicles, advanced engineered soundtracks, and skillfully crafted \nradio trickery to create the illusion of sizable American forces where \nthere were none and to draw the enemy away from Allied troops.\n  Ghost Army soldiers impersonated other, larger Army units by sewing \ncounterfeit patches onto their uniforms, painting false markings on \ntheir vehicles, and creating phony headquarters staffed by fake \ngenerals, all in an effort to feed false information to Axis spies. \nDuring the Battle of the Bulge, the Ghost Army created counterfeit \nradio traffic to mask the efforts of General George Patton's Third Army \nas it mobilized to break through to the 101st Airborne. It also \nprovided assistance to elements of 10th Armored Division in the \nbesieged Belgian town of Bastogne.\n  In its final mission, Operation Viersen, the Ghost Army deployed a \ntactical deception that drew German units down the Rhine River and away \nfrom the 9th Army, allowing the 9th Army to cross the Rhine into \nGermany. On this mission, the 1,100 men of the Ghost Army, with the \nassistance of other units, impersonated forty thousand men, or two \ncomplete divisions of American forces, by using fabricated radio \nnetworks, soundtracks of construction work and artillery fire, and more \nthan 600 inflatable vehicles.\n  Three Ghost Army soldiers gave their lives and dozens were injured in \ncarrying out their mission. Their activities remained classified for \nmore than forty years after the war and I believe the extraordinary \naccomplishments of this unit are deserving of belated recognition. The \nUnited States will be eternally grateful to the Ghost Army for their \nproficient use of innovative tactics throughout World War II, which \nsaved thousands of lives and were instrumental in the defeat of Nazi \nGermany.\n  I ask all my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation to give a \nCongressional Gold Medal to the members of the Ghost Army.\n\n[[Page S1600]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/17/senate-section/article/S1600-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 403--DESIGNATING THE WEEK BEGINNING APRIL 24, 2016 AS \n ``NATIONAL INDUSTRIAL ASSESSMENT CENTER WEEK'' IN CELEBRATION OF THE \n           40TH ANNIVERSARY OF INDUSTRIAL ASSESSMENT CENTERS\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN (for herself, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Coons, Mr. Markey, Mr. \nBennet, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Donnelly, Ms. Warren, Mr. Brown, Mr. Portman, \nMrs. Feinstein, Mr. Peters, Mr. Carper, Mr. Gardner, Ms. Stabenow, and \nMr. Toomey) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Res. 406\n\n       Whereas each girl who pursues the Girl Scout Gold Award \n     aspires to transform an original idea and vision for change \n     into an actionable plan with far reaching and sustainable \n     results;\n       Whereas for more than a century preceding the date of \n     adoption of this resolution, the Girl Scouts of the United \n     States of America (referred to in this preamble as the ``Girl \n     Scouts'') has inspired girls to lead with courage, \n     confidence, and character;\n       Whereas the Girl Scout Gold Award represents the highest \n     form of the ideals of courage, confidence, and character;\n       Whereas the Girl Scout Gold Award calls on a Girl Scout in \n     grades 9 through 12 to take on a project that has a \n     measurable and sustainable impact on the community of the \n     Girl Scout by--\n       (1) assessing a need;\n       (2) designing a solution to the need;\n       (3) completing the project; and\n       (4) inspiring others to sustain the project;\n       Whereas the highest award in Girl Scouting honors \n     leadership in the tradition of the Girl Scouts;\n       Whereas the Girl Scout movement began on March 12, 1912, \n     when Juliette ``Daisy'' Gordon Low, a native of Savannah, \n     Georgia, organized a group of 18 girls and provided the group \n     of girls with an opportunity to develop physically, \n     intellectually, socially, and spiritually;\n       Whereas the goals of Juliette ``Daisy'' Gordon Low were to \n     bring girls of all backgrounds together to develop self-\n     reliance and resourcefulness, and to prepare each girl for a \n     future role as a professional woman and active citizen \n     outside the home;\n       Whereas shortly after the inception of the Girl Scout \n     movement, it was decided that there should be a special \n     recognition for each girl who--\n       (1) represents the very best of the Girl Scouts; and\n       (2) through courage, tenacity, dedication, and skill, takes \n     action in her community with an immediate and sustainable \n     impact;\n       Whereas, in 1916, the Golden Eaglet was introduced as the \n     highest award in Girl Scouting;\n       Whereas the highest award in Girl Scouting has been known \n     as the Golden Eaglet, the Curved Bar Award, First Class, and, \n     for the period of 35 years preceding the date of adoption of \n     this resolution, the Girl Scout Gold Award;\n       Whereas although the name of the highest award in Girl \n     Scouting has changed over the years, the conviction, \n     dynamism, and idealism it takes to earn the award have not;\n       Whereas the Girl Scout Gold Award, like each girl who earns \n     the award and the project the girl undertakes--\n       (1) stands as an enduring symbol of the fortitude and \n     personal strength of a Girl Scout; and\n       (2) clearly demonstrates the tangible, real-world impact \n     that participation in the Girl Scouts can have on the life of \n     a girl, and by extension, the community of the girl and the \n     world;\n       Whereas earning the Girl Scout Gold Award is comparable to \n     achieving the rank of Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of \n     America;\n       Whereas a girl who earns the Girl Scout Gold Award--\n       (1) joins an elite group of less than 6 percent of Girl \n     Scouts each year; and\n       (2) may be eligible for a higher grade when enlisting in \n     the Armed Forces of the United States or for scholarships at \n     certain institutions of higher education;\n       Whereas according to a study of the Girl Scout Research \n     Institute entitled ``The Power of the Girl Scout Gold Award: \n     Excellence in Leadership and Life'', recipients of the Girl \n     Scout Gold Award, compared to nonrecipient peers--\n       (1) report a more positive sense of self;\n       (2) are more engaged civically and in community service;\n       (3) have more confidence in their leadership abilities; and\n       (4) experience greater life satisfaction and success;\n       Whereas the Girl Scout Gold Award acknowledges the power \n     and dedication of each young woman to better herself and to \n     make the world a better place for other individuals;\n       Whereas during the century preceding the date of adoption \n     of this resolution, millions of Girl Scout alumnae have \n     positively impacted their communities and the world with \n     creative, effective, and sustainable Take Action projects; \n     and\n       Whereas in the centennial of the Girl Scout Gold Award, the \n     Girl Scouts invites alumnae and supporters of the Girl Scouts \n     everywhere to ``Celebrate 100 Years of Changing the World'': \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the remarkable impact that recipients of the \n     Girl Scout Gold Award during the century preceding the date \n     of adoption of this resolution have had on--\n       (A) the lives of individuals in the United States; and\n       (B) the world;\n       (2) recognizes the lasting impact of the projects of \n     recipients of the Girl Scout Gold Award on the communities of \n     the recipients;\n       (3) congratulates the Girl Scouts of the United States of \n     America and Girl Scout Gold Award recipients everywhere on \n     the centennial of the Girl Scout Gold Award; and\n       (4) joins the Girl Scouts of the United States of America \n     in celebrating 100 years of the Girl Scout Gold Award.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today not only to recognize the \n104th anniversary of the Girl Scouts, but also the 100th anniversary of \nthe Girl Scout Gold Award. The Gold Award is the most prestigious award \nin Girl Scouting, only comparable to the Boy Scouts of America's Eagle \nScout recognition.\n  Approximately one million Girl Scouts have earned this prestigious \naward. Girls who pursue their Gold Award aspire to transform an idea \nand vision for change into an actionable plan with measurable, \nsustainable, and far-reaching results. Since 1916, Gil Scouts have been \nplanning and executing significant projects in response to pressing \ncommunity needs. The Gold Award has inspired girls in Maryland and \nacross the country to find greatness inside themselves and share their \nideas and passions with their communities.\n  I love the Girl Scouts. I loved being a Girl Scout, especially when \nworking on my badges. Those badges I earned served as symbols for \nsuccess, leadership, and service to my community. It was during my time \nas a Girl Scout that I learned about the values and attitudes that \nserve as good guides throughout life, like courage, confidence, and \nstrong character to help make the world a better place.\n  I also loved the camaraderie of working with other girls on various \nchallenges. It really is about friendship. I am so proud to be among \nthe more than 59 million women in the United States who are alumnae of \nthe Girl Scouts of America. I could not have done it without the \nsupport of Ms. Helen Nimick, my Girl Scout leader. In fact, I wanted to \ngrow up and be just like Ms. Nimick. She seemed to know how to do 43 \ndifferent things with oatmeal boxes.\n  The Girl Scouts is an organization that has meant so much to me, and \nto this country. What started out as a group of eighteen girls in \nGeorgia organized by Juliette Gordon Low has grown into an organization \nof more than 2 million girls and women, with over 800,000 adult \nvolunteers. When the Girl Scouts started, women were not allowed to \nvote or have property in their name, and only few ever made it to \ncollege.\n  The founding of the Girl Scouts started a revolutionary movement to \ntrain and educate girls. Now, it is working to bring gender balance to \nleadership roles, whether it is in business or politics. I believe in \nthat mission, and I know we can do it. While we have a long ways to go, \nwe certainly have made progress. When I came to the Senate almost 30 \nyears ago, there were only two women--Senator Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas \nand myself. Today, there are 20 women in the Senate! Nearly 45 years \nago, there was only one woman CEO of a Fortune 500 company; now there \nare 23.\n  I bring the lessons I learned from Girl Scouts with me to the United \nStates Senate, every day and in every way. I love the Girl Scout \npromise: ``To serve God and my country, to help people at all times, \nand to live by the Girl Scout law.'' To this day, I still carry the \nGirl Scout law in my wallet. I believe that if you follow the Girl \nScout law, you're in pretty good shape--it has certainly worked for me. \n``I will do my best to be honest and fair, friendly and helpful, \nconsiderate and caring, courageous and strong, and responsible for what \nI say and what I do, and to respect myself and others, to respect \nauthority, use resources wisely, make the world a better place, and be \na sister to every Girl Scout, and a sister to every Boy Scout.''\n  While I am in the Senate now, in many ways I am still working on my \nbadges. But instead of working on my cookie badge, the badges I am \nworking on now are called ``ending gender discrimination in health \ncare,'' ``guaranteeing equal pay for equal work,'' and ``promoting \naccess to quality and affordable child care.''\n\n[[Page S1602]]\n\n  In today's hectic and increasingly uncertain world, Girl Scouts are \nmore important than ever before. The Girl Scouts are an important \ncontribution to American society--they prepare the leaders of tomorrow, \nand every day they inspire millions across this country to make the \nworld a better place.
