Mr. President, two Federal courts have already found \nthat the Obama administration's plan to regulate the land around nearly \nevery pothole and ditch is illegal. It is hardly a surprise. The \nadministration's so-called waters of the United States regulation is a \ncynical and overbearing power grab dressed awkwardly as some clean \nwater measure. It is not. Many argue it actually violates the Clean \nWater Act.\n  The true aim of this massive regulatory overreach is pretty clear. \nAfter all, if you are looking for an excuse to extend the reach of the \nFederal bureaucracy as widely and intrusively as possible, why not just \nissue a regulation giving bureaucrats dominion over land that has \ntouched a pothole or a ditch or a puddle at some point? That would seem \nto be pretty much everything, and that is why the waters of the United \nStates regulation is so worrying. It would force Americans who live \nnear potholes and ditches and puddles to ask bureaucrats for permission \nto do just about anything on their own property.\n  Want to spray some weeds? Fill out a permit. Want to put a small pond \nin your back yard? Ask Uncle Sam. Want to build a barn or just about \nanything else on the land you own? Good luck getting approval from the \nFeds on that.\n  One court said that this regulation was so ridiculous it had to be \nthe result ``of a process that is inexplicable, arbitrary, and devoid \nof a reasoned process.'' That sounds about right. It certainly wasn't a \nprocess that appropriately involved the untold number of stakeholders \nsure to be affected by such a wide-ranging regulation. Let me read you \nsomething I received from a constituent in West Liberty, KY. Here is \nwhat he wrote:\n\n       I'm disappointed [that] small businesses like mine were not \n     considered in this rule making process. Government \n     regulations, like the proposed rule, are complicated, \n     expensive to navigate and a real obstacle to growing my \n     business. This change, and its ridiculous overreach and \n     restrictions could decrease land value and hinder my ability \n     to expand, develop and use my own private land.\n\n  ``Please,'' he said, ``support S. 1140, the Federal Water Quality \nProtection Act.''\n  I have good news for this Kentuckian and for the many Americans who \nfeel the same way. I do support the Federal Water Quality Protection \nAct. I actually worked with Senator Barrasso to introduce it and will \ntake a vote to move the bipartisan bill forward this afternoon.\n  A bipartisan majority of the Senate supports the Federal Water \nQuality Protection Act. What it says is pretty simple. If the \nadministration is actually serious about protecting waterways and not \njust cynically using this regulation as a ploy to extend the \nbureaucracy's reach, then it should follow the proper process to get to \na balanced outcome. It should appropriately consult with the Americans \nwho would be\n\n[[Page S7678]]\n\nthe most affected by the regulation, especially farmers, ranchers, and \nsmall businesses, not to mention the homebuilders, manufacturers, mine \noperators, and utility providers that would be particularly impacted in \nmy State. It should appropriately consult with the States. It should \nactually conduct the regulatory impact analyses required of it.\n  In short, what this bipartisan bill would do is require the \nadministration to actually follow the balanced approach it should have \nfollowed in the first place. It is commonsense, bipartisan legislation \nthat would protect our waterways while protecting the American people \nfrom a heavy-handed regulation that threatens their property rights and \ntheir very livelihoods. A similar bill has already passed the House \nwith bipartisan support.\n  Americans in places like Eastern Kentucky have suffered enough from \nthis administration's regulatory onslaught already. This latest \nregulation threatens to turn the screws even tighter for almost no \nbenefit at all.\n  I call on every colleague to join me in standing up for the middle \nclass instead of defending cynical, job-crushing regulations. I ask \nthem to join me in supporting the bipartisan Federal Water Quality \nProtection Act this afternoon.\n  I thank my colleague from Iowa for her hard work on this issue. She \nhas introduced a measure that would allow Congress to overturn this \nmassive regulation in its entirety. It is another avenue the Senate can \npursue as we seek to protect the middle class from this unfair \nregulatory attack.\n  I know the Senator from Iowa is actually with us on the floor right \nnow. She is here for a different reason, which is the subject that I am \nturning to right now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/03/senate-section/article/S7678-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      CONGRATULATING SENATOR GRASSLEY ON CASTING HIS 12,000TH VOTE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, last week the Senate marked two \nmilestones. First, our colleague from Vermont cast vote No. 15,000. We \nall noted it at the time. And then our colleague from Iowa cast vote \nNo. 12,000, and that is what we would like to note now.\n  It is true that Senator Grassley still has some catching up to do if \nhe wants to overtake the Senator from Vermont, but there is more to \nthis story than the top-line number. Out of those 12,000 votes our \ncolleague has taken, the last 7,474 of them were taken consecutively. \nHe hasn't missed a single vote since 1993. He has the second-longest \nconsecutive voting record in Senate history, second place out of 1,963 \nSenators. That is pretty impressive.\n  Even so, we know our colleague never likes to settle for second. It \nis good for him, then, that he will soon grab gold in a different way. \nHe is just a few months out from becoming the longest serving Senator \nin Iowa history, and yet he is one of the most energetic guys around \nhere--a runner in every sense of the term.\n  He has a lot of fans in Iowa too. I don't think it is any great \nmystery why the people of Iowa keep sending him here. This is a Senator \nwith a deep love for his State and a simple philosophy. When he is here \nin Washington, he is voting. When he is back in Iowa, he is out meeting \nIowans. He makes a point to hold townhall-type events in each of Iowa's \n99 counties every single year. He hasn't missed a single county in over \nthree decades. No wonder he began his ascent into Twitter legend with \nfour simple words: ``Attending events in Iowa.'' That tweet is hardly \nas infamous as ``assume deer dead'' or ``staff has now informed me of \nwhat a Kardashian is, I'm only left with more questions.'' It captures \nour colleague perfectly in less than 140 characters.\n  Here is something that captures him in at least that many calories. \nAt the end of every annual 99-county swing, Senator Grassley has a \nritual. He gets a Blizzard from Dairy Queen--sometimes chocolate, \nsometimes vanilla, but always, always swirled with Snickers. This year, \nhe got to DQ so early he had to wait in the parking lot for it to open, \nand of course since this is the senior Senator from Iowa, he tweeted \nabout it. Here is what he said: ``I'm at the Jefferson Iowa \nDairyQueen,'' he wrote, doing ``you know what!!!'' That is some tweet. \nBut in this Dairy Queen story, you have the perfect metaphor for our \ncolleague from Iowa--early riser, driven, devoted to tradition, open to \nchange, and never afraid to mix it up. For this lover of dairy and \ndevotee of his home State, it makes perfect sense. The people of Iowa \nare lucky to have him here fighting on their behalf.\n  Here is to another 99 counties. Here is to the 12,000-vote milestone \nthe Senator from Iowa crossed last week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/03/senate-section/article/S7678-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING FRED THOMPSON\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Finally, Mr. President, on an entirely different and \nsad matter, there was never any doubt when our colleague from Tennessee \nwas nearby--6 feet 6 inches tall, deep, booming voice, and a magnetic \npersonality that lit up any room he was in. Fred Thompson may have \ntowered over the Senate in a very literal sense, but he was one of the \nmost down-to-earth guys you will ever meet. He was a true gentleman \nwith a kind heart.\n  This Senator, who lived life to the very fullest, the first in his \nfamily to ever attend college, never forgot where he came from.\n  Now, in a weird twist of fate, it turns out that Fred and I actually \ncame from the same place. We were both born in what was then known as \nthe Colbert County Hospital in Sheffield, AL. But getting back to \nFred's humility, how many successful actors can you say that about? You \nsee, Senator Thompson hardly fit the Hollywood stereotype. Senator \nThompson didn't fit the political stereotype either. He was just Fred. \nHe had one of the most interesting careers you could ever imagine--\nSenate colleague, Watergate lawyer, Presidential candidate, and radio \npersonality. And he was an icon of the silver and small screen alike, \none who didn't just take on criminals as an actor but as a real-life \nprosecutor as well. That was Fred Thompson. That was the man many of us \nhad the pleasure to serve with.\n  I am reminded of some words shared recently by Fred's friend of 50 \nyears, a friend who succeeded him here in the Senate. ``Very few people \ncould light up a room the way that Fred Thompson did,'' he said. ``I \nwill miss him greatly.''\n  I join the senior Senator from Tennessee in the same sentiment. I \nknow the entire Senate does as well, just as the Senate joins together \nin sending condolences to Fred's loved ones, Jeri and his children, in \nparticular, in this very difficult time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/03/senate-section/article/S7678-3", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, for many decades the American people have \nheard that their elected officials and political hopefuls taught family \nvalues, but right now we need more than talk. We need Members of \nCongress to step up to the plate to help working families.\n\n  Our country has fallen well behind the rest of the world when it \ncomes to paid family leave. We are the only developed country in the \nworld that does not mandate paid medical leave for workers. Think about \nthat. The most industrialized and successful country in the history of \nthe world mandates less paid and protected family leave than Malta, \nSlovakia, and Estonia. What does this mean for working American \nfamilies? It means parents can't stay home and take care of their sick \nchildren. It means mothers need to rush back to work after giving birth \nto a child. It means working Americans have to choose between a \npaycheck and their family responsibilities.\n  Right now the United States provides paid family leave for only 12 \npercent of its private sector workforce. We are one of three nations \nwithout paid maternity leave: Papua New Guinea, Oman, and the United \nStates. Those are the three nations without paid maternity leave: \nAmerica, Oman, and New Guinea. That is really unfair, and it doesn't \nqualify as family values.\n  I was pleased recently to learn that the new Speaker, Paul Ryan, told \nHouse Republicans his family is off-limits. I don't know if that means \nFriday afternoons or just Saturday and\n\n[[Page S7679]]\n\nSunday. He wants to spend more time with his family, and I applaud him \nfor that. There were some people who mocked Congressman Ryan for that, \nand they are wrong. All parents should work to protect that time with \ntheir families.\n  Here is the problem. For millions of Americans, the concept of work-\nfamily life balance is nothing more than a fantasy. For far too many \nAmericans, more time at work and less time with family is the only way \nto put food on the table and a roof over their heads. Still, these \nhard-working families are falling behind. An unpaid day off is out of \nthe question.\n  Contrast that with the Senate. The Republican-controlled Senate \ndoesn't work 5-day weeks. Yet millions of Americans can't get a day off \nwhen a loved one dies or a child is confined to a hospital bed. If you \nplay baseball, the average salary is more than $2 million a year. If \nyour wife has a baby, you take off. But they make millions of dollars a \nyear. Middle-class Americans don't make that.\n  While Speaker Ryan insists on a family-friendly work schedule for \nhimself, he is blocking legislation that would give the bare minimum in \npaid leave for hard-working Americans. Before we worry about ourselves, \nwe should worry about the millions of Americans who can't get a day off \nwork to care for a sick child--can't get a half day off work. That \nwould be real family values.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/03/senate-section/article/S7679-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       DRINKING WATER PROTECTIONS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this week the Senate will vote on two pieces \nof legislation that will nullify drinking water protections for 117 \nmillion Americans.\n  The Obama administration's clean water rule will restore important \nsafeguards to protect American water sources from pollution and \ncontamination. This landmark rule from the Obama administration will \nfinally resolve years of confusion and provide regulatory certainty for \nbusinesses, farmers, local governments, and communities without \ncreating any new permitting requirements and maintaining all previous \nexemptions and exclusions.\n  The Republicans in Congress are intent on undermining these important \nprotections. The Republican leader and his colleagues unfortunately are \nforcing the Senate to vote on legislation to roll back President \nObama's clean water rule. This legislation will fail, of course, and \nRepublicans know it will fail.\n  Last week, the junior Senator from Texas said this:\n\n       [N]ext week we will have a show vote on the waters of the \n     United States. Leadership is very happy. We will have a show \n     vote. We will get to vote, and it will fail.\n\n  Perhaps the junior Senator is right; this is another Republican \ncharade. I hope not. If these bills were to pass, President Obama will \nveto them. Yet Republicans are content to waste the Senate's time just \nso they can launch another attack on the environment. This is the first \nof a series of environmental attacks we expect this month from \nRepublicans. They are also preparing to nullify the President's rules \nto address climate change. They have no solutions and no plan to keep \nour water clean or address climate change. They are wasting valuable \nSenate time on these show votes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/03/senate-section/article/S7679-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      CONGRATULATING SENATOR GRASSLEY ON CASTING HIS 12,000TH VOTE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, every year in the Senate we are sent to this \ndistinguished body for one reason: to represent the people of our State \nand the people of this country. Our constituents expect us to \nlegislate. They expect us to be here on the Senate floor voting and \nrepresenting their interests. In the Senate, there is no one better at \nupholding that responsibility than the senior Senator from Iowa.\n  Last Thursday, Charles Grassley cast his 12,000th vote as a U.S. \nSenator. As remarkable as that is, as my friend the senior Senator from \nKentucky said, it is even more impressive that he has cast almost 7,500 \nconsecutive votes on the Senate floor. He hasn't missed a vote since \nJuly 14, 1993. He holds the second longest consecutive vote streak in \nSenate history, behind our colleague Senator William Proxmire of \nWisconsin. That is a lot of votes.\n  Senator Grassley's constancy and unwavering work ethic comes as no \nsurprise to those of us who have known him and are acquainted with his \nbackground. Chuck Grassley is a farmer. He is proud of that. He got \nstarted in politics when he was elected to the Iowa House in 1959. He \nserved for 15 years. In 1974, he ran for Congress and served three \nterms in the House of Representatives.\n  He was elected to the Senate in 1980. Thirty-six years, 12,000 \nvotes--that is remarkable, as is 7,474 consecutive votes. So I say \ncongratulations to my friend Chuck Grassley on those incredible \nmilestones.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/03/senate-section/article/S7679-3", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING FRED THOMPSON\n\n  Mr. REID.

I think we have been friends for that three and a half \ndecades.\n  When I think of Senator Grassley--12,000 votes, hundreds of hearings, \ncountless tweets, and probably four dozen sweater vests later--he is \nthe same down to earth Iowa farmer who visits every one of the State's \n99 counties every year. He is also the Iowa farmer who, when Vermont \nwas hit with terrible flooding a few years back, was the first person \nto contact me to say, ``Vermont stood with Iowa when we were hit with a \nnatural disaster. Iowa now stands with Vermont.''\n  He and I have worked together, and we have had a productive \nrelationship that spans those decades. On the Judiciary Committee, we \ntake our leadership responsibilities seriously. We have both made sure \nthat, both as chairman and ranking members, that every Senator has a \nchance to be heard. We have found ways to come together on meaningful \nlegislation. We enjoy each other's company. We are able to kid each\n\n[[Page S7680]]\n\nother, as I did on his recent birthday. But more importantly, we do \nwhat I was told to do when I first came to the Senate, and I am sure \nwhat Senator Grassley was told when he did--we keep our word. We have \nalways kept our word to each other.\n  It also helps that we both married above ourselves. His wonderful \nwife, Barbara, and my wife, Marcelle, are very close friends. They \nsometimes say that they belong to that special club that nobody wants \nto join, that of cancer survivors.\n  Senator Grassley's willingness to listen and hard work was most \nrecently on display in the Judiciary Committee, as we hammered out an \nimportant compromise on sentencing reform which brought the left and \nthe right together--both parties together. I think every single Senator \ncomplimented his leadership.\n  And I must admit I was grateful for Senator Grassley's comments last \nweek when I, too, crossed a voting milestone. He said we have been good \nfriends and hoped we could cast many more votes together. I share that \nhope and congratulate my friend on this achievement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mrs. ERNST. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate my friend, \ncolleague, and Iowa's outstanding senior Senator on casting his \n12,000th vote in the wee early hours of this last Friday morning. In \nfact, there are only 17 other Senators in history who have cast more \nvotes than Senator Chuck Grassley. On top of that, he has the longest \nexisting voting streak in Congress.\n  This farmer from Iowa serves as the chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and is one of the highest ranking members in the Senate. But \nthat has not gone to his head--not for Chuck Grassley. Back home in \nIowa, he travels all 99 counties every single year, and he has done \nthis every year for 35 wonderful years. Today his travels across the \nState to all 99 counties have a name. It is called ``the full \nGrassley.'' It is something that now our elected officials and even the \nPresidential candidates who visit Iowa try to complete as well. Senator \nGrassley has set a high bar, and I am very glad that he has.\n  Over the years I have learned quite a bit about my friend Senator \nChuck Grassley. He is extremely thrifty. Because of that, he is always \nlooking out for our taxpayer dollars. He fights tirelessly for \naccountability and transparency in Washington. I can always count on \nSenator Grassley to stop by my office for doughnuts and coffee and to \nmeet all of our wonderful Iowa constituents who happen to be visiting \nWashington, DC. He says he comes to visit the constituents. I actually \nthink it is for the free doughnuts, but we are glad he stops by.\n  Senator Grassley is the epitome of the Iowa way, and he has \nfaithfully upheld these values in the Senate. He is a workhorse and has \ndedicated his entire career to serving Iowans. Iowa has no greater \nfriend than Senator Chuck Grassley.\n  Congratulations, Senator, on your 12,000th vote. Congratulations to \nBarbara, also. Get your Twitter ready because at noon we are going to \ncelebrate.\n  I thank the Acting President pro tempore.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I thank all my colleagues, in particular \nmy colleague from Iowa but also the people who are very senior leaders \nof this body: Senator McConnell, Senator Reid, and my friend on the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, whom I have served with for 35 \nyears. I thank them for their kind words and for what they said about \nmy service to the people of Iowa as an elected representative.\n  I have interacted with tens of thousands of Iowans as their Senator, \nso I have a feeling that I know each Iowan personally at this point. Of \ncourse, I don't. I know that is technically impossible, but one of the \nbenefits of a State that is not especially big geographically is that I \nhave enough planning that I can get to every county every year, as has \nbeen said several times by my colleagues.\n  Every year, Iowans in each county host me at a question-and-answer \nsession at their factories, schools, or their service clubs. Most of \nthese are my own town meetings that I set up. At each stop, I might get \na dozen or so questions on any topic under the Sun, and that is as it \nshould be in representative government because that is a two-way \nstreet. The electorate's job is to ask the questions and my job is to \nanswer them. If people are satisfied that I have answered their \nquestions or that at least I have tried to answer them, then I hope I \nhave demonstrated how much their participation means to the process of \nrepresentative government and to casting my votes in Washington because \nI bring the benefits of every comment, question, and criticism heard \nfrom Iowans to that vote.\n\n  With these 12,000 votes, I think of the many conversations and pieces \nof correspondence behind each vote. Whether I am meeting with Iowans in \nthe Hart Building in Washington or at the University of Northern Iowa \nvolleyball matches near my farm in New Hartford, the time that people \ntake to visit with me is well spent for me, and I hope they consider it \na time well spent for them.\n  People ask me if I have any hobbies. I cannot say that I do, at least \nnot in the way people usually think of hobbies. Spending time with the \npeople of Iowa is part of my work. I get paid to listen and make sure \nthat is what I do. It is my pleasure to spend time with Iowans. When \nsomeone stops me at the Village Inn in Cedar Falls, where I go for \nSunday brunch after church, to talk about cyber security or sentencing \nreform, I am glad to do it.\n  What is important to the people of Iowa is my vocation. I am grateful \nfor the opportunity to cast 12,000 votes. Thanks to the people of Iowa, \nthanks to my wife Barbara and the rest of my family who share my regard \nfor what is important, representing the people of Iowa.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the people of Iowa for sending \nus Chuck Grassley and want to say he does not just represent Iowa, he \npersonifies it. I know of no Senator who better personifies his State \nthan the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized to say a \nfew words about our departed colleague Fred Thompson and that following \nmy remarks Senator Corker be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Remembering Fred Thompson\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, it is my sad duty, as was mentioned by \nour leaders this morning, to report that Fred Dalton Thompson, who \nserved in this body from 1995 to 2003, representing our State of \nTennessee, died in Nashville on Sunday. My wife, Honey, and I and the \nmembers of our family--every one of whom valued our friendship with \nFred--as well as Members of the Senate, express to Fred's family--his \nwife Jeri, their children, Hayden and Sammy, and his sons by his \nearlier marriage to Sarah, Tony and Dan, and his brother Ken--our pride \nin Fred's life and our sympathy for his death.\n  Very few people can light up the room the way Fred Thompson did. The \ntruth is, most public figures have always been a little jealous of Fred \nThompson. His personality had a streak of magic that none of the rest \nof us have. That magic was on display when he was minority counsel to \nthe Senate Watergate Committee in 1973, asking former White House aide \nAlexander Butterfield the famous question: ``Mr. Butterfield, are you \naware of the installation of any listening devices in the Oval Office \nof the President?'' thereby publicly revealing the existence of tape-\nrecorded conversations within the White House. National Public Radio \nlater called that session and the discovery of the Watergate tapes ``a \nturning point in the investigation.''\n  The Thompson magic was evident again in 1985, when Fred was asked to \nplay himself in the movie ``Marie.'' In real life, Fred had been the \nattorney for Marie Ragghianti, the truth-telling chairman of the \nTennessee Pardon and Parole Board during a scandal in our State when \npardons were sold for cash.\n  After that, Fred was cast in a number of movie roles as CIA Director, \nthe head of Dulles Airport, an admiral, the President of NASCAR, three \nPresidents of the United States, and District Attorney Arthur Branch in \nthe television\n\n[[Page S7681]]\n\nseries ``Law and Order''. That same magic served him well when he ran \nfor the United States Senate in 1994 for the last 2 years of Vice \nPresident Gore's unexpired term. It was a good Republican year and \nFred's red pickup truck attracted attention, but he defeated a strong \nopponent by more than 20 percentage points, mostly because when he \nappeared on television, Tennesseans liked him, trusted him, and voted \nfor him. Fred took on some big assignments during his time in the \nSenate, but sometimes he would become impatient with some of the \nfoolishness around here. A Washington reporter once asked him if he \nmissed making movies: ``Yes,'' he said, ``Sometimes I miss the \nsincerity of Hollywood.''\n  People ask me sometimes: How could an actor accomplish so much? In \naddition to those things I have already mentioned, during the 1980s \nFred was invited twice to be special counsel to Senate investigative \ncommittees. When he retired from the Senate, he took over Paul Harvey's \nradio show. In 2008, he was a frontrunner for the Presidency of the \nUnited States. For the last several years, it has been hard to turn on \nthe television without seeing Fred Thompson urging you to buy a reverse \nmortgage.\n  I believe there are three reasons his career was so extraordinary and \nso diverse. First, he was authentic, genuine, and bona fide. So far as \nI know, he never had an acting lesson. As he did in ``Marie'' and as he \ndid in most of his movie roles, he played himself. There was no \npretense in Fred Thompson on or off the stage. Second, he was \npurposeful. In 1992, when I was Education Secretary, I invited Fred to \nlunch in the White House lunchroom. For years I had urged him to be a \ncandidate for public office. I hoped he might run in 1994. What struck \nme during our entire luncheon conversation was that not once did he \nraise any political concerns. His only question was: If I were to be \nelected, what do you suppose I could accomplish?\n  When he was elected, he was serious and principled. He was a strict \nFederalist, never a fan of Washington telling Americans what to do, \neven if he thought it was something Americans should be doing. He was \nnot afraid to cast votes that were unpopular with his constituents if \nhe was convinced he was right. The third reason for Fred Thompson's \nsuccess was he worked hard. Saying that will come as something of a \nsurprise to many.\n  He was notoriously easygoing. He grew up in modest circumstances in \nLawrenceburg, Tennessee. His father Fletch was a car salesman. He was a \ndouble major in philosophy and political science at the University of \nMemphis. He did well enough to earn scholarships to Tulane and \nVanderbilt law schools. To pay for school he worked at a bicycle plant, \na post office, and a motel.\n  Before he was Watergate counsel, he was assistant U.S. attorney. The \nremainder of his busy life was filled with law practice, stage, and \nradio shows, counsel to Senate investigating committees, more than 20 \nmovies, television commercials, and 8 years as a Senator. I have \nattended a number of memorial services for prominent figures. As a \nresult, I have added a rule to ``Lamar Alexander's Little Plaid Book.'' \nIt is this: ``When invited to speak at a funeral, be sure to mention \nthe deceased as often as yourself.''\n  I mentioned this rule last year when I spoke at Howard Baker's \nfuneral because there came a point in my remarks when I could not \ncontinue without mentioning my relationship with Senator Baker, and I \ntherefore had to break my own rule. The same is true with Fred \nThompson. We were friends for nearly 50 years.\n  In the late 1960s, both of us fresh out of law school were inspired \nby Senator Howard Baker to help build a two-party political system in \nTennessee. Fred's political debut was campaign manager for John \nWilliams for Congress, against Ray Blanton in 1968. My first political \nforay was Howard Baker's successful Senate campaign in 1966.\n  When Senator Baker ran for reelection in 1972, I recruited Fred to be \nthe Senator's Middle Tennessee campaign manager. In 1973, Senator Baker \nasked me to be minority counsel to the Watergate Committee. I suggested \nhe ask Fred instead because as a former U.S. attorney Fred was much \nbetter equipped for the job. When I lost the Governor's race in 1974, \nthe Thompsons were one of two couples Honey and I invited to go to \nFlorida to lick our wounds.\n  When I was sworn in as Governor in 1979, even without asking him, I \nannounced that Fred Thompson would fly back to Nashville from \nWashington, DC, to review more than 60 pardons and paroles that had \nallegedly been issued because someone had paid cash for them. I wanted \nthe celebrated Watergate personality to help restore confidence in \nTennessee's system of justice. In the spring of 2002, Fred telephoned \nto say he would not run for reelection. So I sought and won the Senate \nseat both he and Howard Baker had held. I have the same phone number \ntoday that both of them had when they were here.\n  During my general election campaign in 2002, an opponent said: ``Why, \nFred and Lamar are both in Howard Baker's stable.'' Fred replied: \n``Stable hell, we are in the same stall.''\n  Several times I got a dose of Fred Thompson's magic during those \nhumbling experiences when I asked him to campaign with me. Campaigning \nwith Fred Thompson was a little like going to Dollywood with Dolly \nParton. You can be sure no one is there to see you.\n  We have a tradition of scratching our names in the drawers of the \ndesks that we occupy on the floor of the Senate. When I arrived in \n2003, I searched high and low until I found what I wanted: a desk \noccupied by two predecessors, my friend Fred Thompson and our mentor \nHoward Baker. During one of those late-night Senate budget sessions a \nfew years ago, I scratched my name after theirs. I am proud it will \nremain there as long as this desk does: Baker, Thompson, Alexander.\n  Tennesseans and our country have been fortunate that public service \nattracted Fred Dalton Thompson. We will miss his common sense, his \nconservative principles, and his big booming voice. We have lost one of \nour most able and attractive public servants, and my wife Honey and I \nhave lost a dear friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I rise to share my voice with Lamar \nAlexander's at the loss of a great Tennessean and a great American. I \nappreciate so much Senator Alexander's chronologically going through \nmuch of the great Senator Thompson's life and talking about the \npersonal experiences. Elizabeth and I, too, want to share our \ncondolences with Jeri, Hayden, and Sammy, along with Tony and Dan, his \nsons by his first marriage with Sarah, and his brother Ken.\n  I was able to talk to Tony last week as Fred was in hospice care. As \nyou would expect, with Fred being the kind of person he was, never \nforgetting where he came from, they wanted to spend those last days \ntogether in quiet and didn't want a lot of phone calls or a lot \nhappening to make people aware of what was happening. Fred had reached \nhis end. No doubt, again, Tennessee has lost a great son as has our \nNation.\n  Fred was one of those people, as Lamar just mentioned, who had \nextraordinary talent. To me, what was so unique about him having that \nextraordinary talent is he also had the gift of knowing when and how to \nuse it, from his extraordinary ability as a lawyer, as has been \nchronicled, to his ability when faced with a case that became something \nof national notoriety, to himself becoming an actor and playing a role \nthat in this case he was in real life, and then to serving in the \nSenate in the way that he did.\n  I, too, had the extraordinary privilege to also know Fred, as I have \nhad in knowing someone like Lamar Alexander, who I think is one of the \ngreat public servants of our State, and Howard Baker, who has been a \nmentor to all of us and had such an impact on me, Lamar, and Fred. Back \nin 1994, as I was telling some Tennesseans earlier today, I was also \nrunning for the Senate in a race that no one remembers because of the \nresults. As Lamar mentioned, everywhere you went, people wanted to see \nFred.\n  Fred had this extraordinary ability to capture people's imaginations. \nFred was unabashedly proud of our Nation and never an apologist for \nwhat our Nation has done around the world to make the world a better \nplace. I was\n\n[[Page S7682]]\n\nable to drive around and see hordes of people gather around Fred. \nPeople would pat Bill Frist, me, and the other folks running in the \nother primary on the head and say: Someday you, too, might be a \nSenator.\n  Fred was somewhat criticized that year because of the way he was \ngoing about the race. Again, it reminds me of how much talent he had \nand his ability to know how to use it. He told people: Look, the first \ntime I run a television ad, this race will be over.\n  He did, and it was. As Lamar mentioned, he went on to win by 20 \npoints because of the way the people felt about him, not only around \nour State but around our country.\n  Fred was very impatient with serving in the Senate, and I had \nmultiple conversations with him about that. Actually, serving here, one \ncan understand with someone like Fred, who constantly wanted to make \nsomething happen, how that was a frustration. But I know for a fact \nfrom watching his early days--coming in, heading the homeland security \ncommittee, and doing the many things he did--that he affected our State \nand country in a very positive way, which is something all of us would \nhope to emulate.\n  We will miss him. He was a rare talent. He was one of those people \nwho made you want to do better when you were around him.\n  I thank him for his tremendous service to our country, I thank him \nfor the tremendous and deep friendships he created all around our \nState, and I thank him for causing all of us to constantly remember \nwhere we came from.\n  With that, I join Senator Alexander in again expressing our deep \ncondolences to his family and all who were around him, especially when \nthe end came.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, first, I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Cardin manage our side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am going to make a statement about S. \n1140, which is before us.\n  Senator Barrasso, may I make my statement, due to a hectic schedule? \nI won't go very long. Is that all right with you.\n  Thank you, my friend.\n  I thank Senator Barrasso.\n  It is kind of commonplace here that it is another day and another \nattack on the environment. Today is no exception. Today it is an attack \non the Clean Water Act. That is what I believe S. 1140 does.\n  The name of this bill is the Federal Water Quality Protection Act. I \ntell you, if we could sue for false advertising, we would have a great \ncase because this bill doesn't protect anything. It allows for \npollution of many bodies of water that provide drinking water to 117 \nmillion Americans, 1 in 3 Americans. Their drinking water will be at \nrisk if my friend's bill passes. That is why I feel so strongly about \nit.\n  We see it on this poster: 117 million Americans are served by public \ndrinking water systems. That is 94 percent of public drinking water \nsystems that rely on these headwater streams. It affects 1 in 3 \nAmericans in 48 States.\n  We are talking about a bill that is called the Federal Water Quality \nProtection Act, but it is about pollution, not protection. In a way, \nwhen we name these bills the opposite of what they are--remember, this \nis called the Federal Water Quality Protection Act when in fact it is \ngoing to lead to contamination of waterways. It reminds me of the book \n``1984'' in which the government is making sure people believe \ndifferent things, and they have slogans like ``war is peace,'' and you \nthink about it, and finally you cannot tell the difference between war \nand peace.\n  Pollution is not protection, and this bill will lead to pollution \nbecause S. 1140 blocks the final clean water rule that clearly protects \nthese waters while exempting ditches and storm water collection and \ntreatment systems, artificial ponds, water-filled depressions, puddles, \nand recycled water facilities.\n  What you will hear from the other side is, oh, the Obama \nadministration has written a rule that is protecting puddles. That is \nnonsense. The fact is, the clean water rule is going to bring certainty \nto the Clean Water Act, and it is going to protect the drinking water \nof 117 million Americans. Yet my Republican friends want to stop it. \nThe exemptions that are in there would be gone, not only the exemption \nfrom ditches, storm water collection, artificial ponds, water-filled \ndepressions, and recycled water facilities, but also the exemptions for \nagriculture and forestry. So we are going to have a situation where \nthere is more chaos surrounding our water laws. It is going to lead to \nconfusion for businesses and landowners, and it is going to take us \nback to square one to figure out a whole other rule. Following two \nSupreme Court decisions, we shouldn't pass legislation that would \ncreate even more uncertainty and invite years of new litigation.\n  The other thing you hear from the other side is, oh, this clean water \nrule the Obama administration wrote--they didn't listen to the public. \nWell, more than 1 million comments were received during a comment \nperiod that lasted over 200 days, and over 400 outreach meetings with \nstakeholders and State and local governments were conducted. So this \nbill--by sending us back to square one--ignores this robust outreach, \nand it will wind up wasting millions of taxpayer dollars, forcing EPA \nto go right back to square one. How many more comments do these friends \nof mine on the other side of the aisle want? My God, there were 400 \noutreach meetings over 200 days and more than 1 million comments. It \nmakes no sense to me.\n  Nothing is more important than protecting the lives of the American \npeople, and when we weaken the Clean Water Act, that is what we do.\n  I will show a photograph. This was the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland, \nOH, decades ago. It caught on fire. It caught on fire because there was \nno regulation and there were all kinds of toxic substances on the \nwaterway. Our lakes were dying. And this one--when the people saw it on \nfire, they said enough is enough. They demanded the Clean Water Act. We \npassed it--I wasn't here then; it was 1972--by an overwhelmingly \nbipartisan majority. We have made tremendous progress. Today our \nrivers, lakes, and streams are far cleaner than they were, and the \nClean Water Act has been one of our most successful laws.\n  Let's look at the support for the Clean Water Act. This is \nunbelievable, when you see this. This is overwhelming public support \nfor the clean water rule that my friends on the other side of the \naisle, the Republicans, want to stop in its tracks.\n  Seventy-nine percent of voters think Congress should allow the clean \nwater rule to move forward, and 80 percent of small business owners \nsupport protections for upstream headwaters in the EPA's new clean \nwater rule. So somebody has to explain to me--and I am sure my friends \nwill try to, and I look forward to hearing their reasoning--why they \nare going against 79 percent of the voters and 80 percent of small \nbusinesses. It makes no sense.\n  The bill takes us in the wrong direction. That is why over 80 \nscientists with expertise in the importance of streams and wetlands, as \nwell as the Society for Freshwater Science, oppose this bill. I have \nreceived opposition letters from so many groups, I am going to read \nthem to you. And think about these groups. These are objective groups. \nThese are nonpartisan groups.\n  Under public health, there is the American Public Health Association, \nthe Physicians for Social Responsibility, and the Trust for America's \nHealth.\n  Under scientists and legal experts, there are 82 scientists, 44 law \nprofessors, and the American Fisheries Society.\n  Under business, there is the American Sustainable Business Council \nrepresenting 200,000 businesses that oppose this bill, and there are 35 \nU.S. breweries. That is kind of interesting. The breweries count on \nclean water. They are very upset about the Barrasso bill. They oppose \nit.\n  Under sportsmen, there is the American Fly Fishing Trade Association. \nI thought my Republican friends support outdoor recreation. The \nBackcountry Hunters and Anglers, the Illinois Council of Trout \nUnlimited, the International Federation of Fly Fishers, the Izaak \nWalton League of America, the\n\n[[Page S7683]]\n\nFlorida Wildlife Federation, the National Wildlife Federation, the \nTheodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, and Trout Unlimited oppose \nthis bill.\n  Under environmental, there is the Alliance for the Great Lakes, \nAmerican Canoe Association, American Rivers, and the BlueGreen \nAlliance.\n  Mr. President, I am not going to go on that much longer. I am just \ngoing to finish reading this list because when I speak--OK, you know I \nam a strong environmentalist. I am wearing my green today on purpose. \nThese groups are very concerned about the Barrasso bill, as are 79 \npercent of voters.\n  Here are the other groups that weighed in: BlueStream Communications, \nCalifornia River Watch, and Central Ohio Watershed Council. They know \nbecause they have algae blooms coming to their lakes. Continuing, there \nis Clean Water Action, Clean Up the River Environment, Coastal \nEnvironmental Rights Foundation, Defenders of Wildlife, Earthjustice, \nEndangered Habitats League, Environment America, Evangelical \nEnvironmental Network. Do you want to know why the Evangelical \nEnvironmental Network is here? Because they believe that with this bill \nwe are harming God's creation. That is why they are involved. \nContinuing, Greenpeace, Gulf Restoration Network, Kentucky Waterways \nAlliance, Lake Champlain International, League of Conservation Voters, \nMassachusetts River Alliance, National Parks Conservation Association, \nNatural Resources Defense Council, Nature Coast Conservation, New \nJersey Audubon Society, Northwest Environmental Advocates, Ohio \nEnvironmental Council, Ohio River Foundation, Prairie Rivers Network, \nRiver Network, Roots & Shoots, University of Tampa, Sierra Club, \nSouthern Environmental Law Center, Surfrider Foundation.\n  Under rural development, there is the Center for Rural Affairs.\n  There are reasons all these groups--scientists and biologists--have \ncome together. They want to protect the waterways of the United States \nof America. This bill will take us back to square one. This bill goes \nagainst the most incredible group of opponents. This bill ignores the \nwill of the people. So I am very hopeful that we will have enough votes \nto stop the special interests that want to keep dumping toxic material \nand dangerous material into our waterways.\n  I know Senator Barrasso and Senator Inhofe would like time.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the first Republican \nspeaker is done, it goes back to a Democrat, then back to a Republican, \nif that is OK with everybody.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I wish to do three things quickly. One is \na request, one is an apology, and one is the truth. The privileges of \nthe floor request will appear in another section of the Record.\n  Secondly, I have an apology. I am very fortunate I have had the same \nstaff for 21 years in the Senate. They have never made a mistake. My \nstaff never made a mistake until last Friday. Last Friday I was \ninformed by my staff that we had two votes starting at 1 o'clock in the \nmorning--two votes, and yet there were three. So I am the guy who came \ndown, thinking I had already voted. So I apologize to the leader, I \napologize to the staff who was working, and more than anything else, I \napologize to the young people on the front row, our pages, who had to \nstay up another 15 minutes at 4 o'clock in the morning because of me. I \napologize.\n  On the truth side, first, let me put in the Record--my good friend \nfrom California was talking about all of the groups. I have five times \nas many groups now on record, many of which are from the State of \nCalifornia. I have a long list. I wish to make those 44 groups from \nCalifornia a part of the Record. And then there are the 480 very \nthoughtful groups nationally that are opposed to this rule.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the two lists \nof supporters.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                 California Entities Supporting S. 1140\n\n       California Cattlemen's Association;

Now, the waters of the United States rule is not just \nanother example of regulatory overreach. I chair the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works. We have jurisdiction over the EPA, yet \nthey do not want to even come in and testify when requested, and that \nis something I don't think has ever happened before.\n  This rule we are talking about now is illegal. It is not supported by \nthe science, it is not supported by the technical experience of the \nCorps of Engineers, and it is a political power grab. Thirty-one \nStates--here is the chart--filed lawsuits against the WOTUS rule. If we \ndon't act to send this rule back, States, local governments, farmers, \nand landowners could face years of abuse by the EPA until the courts \ninevitably strike the rule down.\n  Believe me, it is inevitable that the rule will be overturned. I \nthink we know that. That is not just my opinion. This is the conclusion \nof the two courts that have looked at this rule so far.\n  On August 27, Judge Erickson of the District of North Dakota issued \nan injunction that prevented the WOTUS rule from going into effect in \n13 States. Oklahoma, my State, was not one of the 13 States. According \nto Judge Erickson--and this is her court--``the rule allows EPA \nregulation of waters that do not bear any effect on the `chemical, \nphysical and biological integrity of any navigable-in-fact water.'''\n  As a result, Judge Erickson concluded this rule is ``likely arbitrary \nand capricious.'' That means it violates the law. That is what the \njudge said.\n  Now, on October 9, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reached the \nsame conclusion and issued a nationwide stay on the WOTUS rule.\n  My committee has conducted a lot of oversight. I believe we have had \nsix hearings so far. We have memoranda from the Army Corps of Engineers \nthat document the fact that EPA is claiming the authority to assert \nFederal control wherever they want no matter what the science says or \nwhat the technical or legal experts of the Corps say. So what we have \nis a rule that is not developed based on science or technical \nexpertise. Instead, it is based on a political goal to call everything \na water of the United States.\n  If we look at the chart that is set up right now, it is imperative we \nhave to act right away. This is what we have right now around the \ncountry.\n  Let me make this comment. I am very much concerned about this. The \nones who want this the most are the farmers and the ranchers, and a lot \nof other people too, but my State of Oklahoma is a farm State, and I \ncan remember not too long a guy named Tom Buchanan. He was the chairman \nof the Oklahoma Farm Bureau. He said that, historically, it has not \nbeen this way. But as it is right now, the major problem farmers and \nranchers have in my State of Oklahoma is not anything that is found in \nthe farm bill, it is the overregulation of the EPA. Of all of the \nregulations of the EPA that are overregulating and putting farmers out \nof business, the one that is the worst is the waters of the United \nStates rule.\n  Let me share this with you, Mr. President. Five years ago, the \nliberals--those who want all the power in Washington--made an effort to \ntake the word innavigable out. Historically, this has always been in \nthe jurisdiction of the States, except for navigable waters. I \nunderstand that, and everyone else does too. So Senator Feingold from \nthe Senate and Congressman Oberstar from the House got together and \nintroduced a bill to take the word navigable out and give all the power \nto the Federal Government. Not only did we defeat their legislation, \nbut they were both defeated in the next election.\n  So this is a huge issue. It is one of regulation. It is one we need \nto go ahead with, since the courts have decided what is going to happen \neventually. We need to go ahead and pass this legislation or we are \ngoing to be working in a direction that is contrary to our court \nsystem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, let me make it clear what this legislation \nwould do. It is true it would stop the final rule on the waters of the \nUnited States that has been issued, but it would also change the \nunderlying criteria in the Clean Water Act. So it not only blocks the \nrule from going forward, it weakens the Clean Water Act. So let me talk \na little about both.\n  The final rule on the waters of the United States that has been \nissued restores clarity to the enforcement of the Clean Water Act. It \nrestores it to what was commonly understood before a series of Supreme \nCourt cases that really raised questions as to which water bodies, in \nfact, can be regulated under the Clean Water Act. The worst possible \noutcome is the lack of clarity because you don't know. You don't know \nwhat the rules are.\n  The final rule that has been proposed, and that now is final, would \nrestore that clarity to what was generally understood to be waters of \nthe United States. To say it in laymen's terms, it is waters that lead \nto, in effect, the water qualities of our streams and our waters and \nour lakes in America. It affects public health. It affects\n\n[[Page S7686]]\n\npublic health directly by the health of our waters of the United \nStates, as well as providing the source for safe drinking waters.\n  So what is at risk? If this final rule is blocked and does not become \nlaw, over half of our Nation's stream miles are at risk of not being \nregulated under the Clean Water Act. Twenty million acres of wetlands \nare at risk of not being adequately regulated under the Clean Water \nAct. The drinking source for water for one out of three Americans would \nbe at risk.\n  So this legislation would not only block the implementation of the \nfinal rule, it would also weaken the Clean Water Act. It would \ndrastically narrow the historic scope of the Clean Water Act, \narbitrarily putting in nonscientific standards for how the rules would \nbe developed.\n  Mr. President, since the enactment of the Clean Water Act, every \nCongress has tried to strengthen the Clean Water Act, not weaken it. \nThe Clean Water Act was a piece of bipartisan legislation passed in \n1972. As Senator Boxer pointed out, it was in response to rivers \nliterally catching fire and dead zones being found in our lakes.\n  In the Chesapeake Bay we had the first marine dead zone that we were \ntrying to respond to. In San Francisco Bay we had PCBs at unacceptably \nhigh levels. That is why we passed the Clean Water Act. The legacy of \nevery Congress should be to strengthen the Clean Water Act, to make \nsure we do have clean waters in the United States. If this legislation \nwere to become law, the legacy of this Congress would be to weaken the \nClean Water Act. I don't think we want to do that.\n  As I pointed out, this legislation not only rescinds the final clean \nwater rule, but it really changes the goal of the Clean Water Act. \nCurrently, the goal is to ``restore and maintain the chemical, \nphysical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters.'' That is \nscience based. Instead, it would be changed to protect traditional \nnavigable waters from pollution, which is a far different standard than \ndealing with the health issues of the waters of the United States.\n  The arbiter of this would be the Department of Agriculture on the \nhydrological science. They are not qualified to do that. It is not \ntheir field. As I will point out in detail, the regulatory structure \nfor agriculture is not changed under this final Clean Water Act. And \nthe bill would ignore hydrological science by requiring a continuous \nflow of water to be regulated, ignoring the fact that there are \nseasonal variations where you can have water flows that dry up for a \nperiod of time but which are still critically important to the supply \nof clean water in the United States. It ignores the nexus test, which \nhas been referred to in Supreme Court cases, using adjacent water--next \nto navigable waters--without any definition of what ``next to'' means. \nIt puts public health at risk.\n  For all of those reasons, we don't want to jeopardize and move \nbackwards on the Clean Water Act of 1972. We want to add to that. This \npiece of legislation would, in fact, move us in the wrong direction.\n  I just want to, for one moment, talk about the Chesapeake Bay. The \npeople of Maryland and the people of our region know how important it \nis for our economy--the watermen who make their living off it and the \nrecreational use of the bay. Millions of people every year depend upon \nthe bay for their recreation. It is a way of life for our State and for \nour region. It is a national treasure--the largest estuary in our \nhemisphere. And it depends upon receiving clean water supplies that \ncome in from other States, not just Maryland. You can't regulate the \nclean water of the Chesapeake Bay without having a national commitment \nto it because it knows no State boundary. That is why we need a strong \nClean Water Act.\n  I have heard my colleagues talk about agricultural farmers being \nagainst this. Well, farmers will not be harmed by the EPA's final clean \nwater rule. In fact, it actually is good for farmers because it \nprovides certainty and clarity. In developing the rule, the EPA and the \nArmy Corps of Engineers listened carefully to input from the \nagricultural community, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the \nState departments of agriculture. As Senator Boxer pointed out, there \nwere over 400 meetings with stakeholders across the country.\n  The act requires a permit if a protected water is going to be \npolluted or destroyed. However, agricultural activities such as \nplanting, harvesting, and moving stock across streams have long been \nexcluded from permitting, and that won't change under the rule. In \nother words, farmers and ranchers won't need a permit for normal \nagricultural activities to happen in or around those waters.\n  The rule does preserve agricultural exemptions from permitting, \nincluding normal farming, silviculture and ranching practices. Those \nactivities include plowing, seeding, cultivating minor drainage, and \nharvesting for production of food, fiber, and forest products. Soil and \nwater conservation practices in dry land are preserved. As to \nagricultural storm water discharges, there are no changes. Return flows \nfrom irrigated agriculture, construction, and maintenance of farm and \nstock ponds or irrigation ditches on dry land are not regulated under \nthis bill. Maintenance of drainage ditches is not regulated. \nConstruction or maintenance of farm, forest, and temporary mining roads \nare not regulated. It ensures that fields flooded for rice are exempt \nand can be used for water storage and bird habitat.\n  The rule also does preserve and expand commonsense exclusions from \njurisdiction, including--this is excluded--prior converted croplands, \nwaste treatment systems, artificially irrigated areas that are \notherwise dry land, artificial lakes or ponds constructed in dry land, \nwater-filled depressions created as a result of construction \nactivities, and the list goes on and on.\n  The rule does not--does not--protect any types of waters that have \nnot historically been covered under the Clean Water Act. It does not \nadd any new requirements for agriculture. It does not interfere with or \nchange private property rights. It does not change policy on irrigation \nor water transfers. It does not address land use. It does not cover \nerosional features, such as gullies, rills, and nonwetland swells.\n  In other words, we have maintained the historic exemptions for \nagriculture from the Clean Water Act. They are not expanded under this \nrule.\n  So let me just cite a couple of quotes from people who are directly \nimpacted by what is being done under the clean water rule and, of \ncourse, would be affected by the legislation before us.\n  As to the small business community, I quote from David Levine, who is \nthe CEO of the American Sustainable Business Council:\n\n       The Clean Water Rule will give the business community more \n     confidence that streams and rivers will be protected. This is \n     good for the economy and vital for businesses that rely on \n     clean water for their success. . . . Business owners want a \n     consistent regulatory system based on sound science. That's \n     what this rule provides.\n\n  Ben Rainbolt, executive director of the Rocky Mountain Farmers Union:\n\n       Water is critical to the livelihood of family farms and \n     ranches. The rule employs a commonsense rationale for both \n     clarifying what bodies of water and activities should fall \n     under the Clean Water Act, as well as maintaining the \n     existing exemptions for agriculture. This rule will result in \n     cleaner, safer water for agriculture, rural communities, and \n     all who count on healthy streams and rivers.\n\n  Andrew Lemley, government affairs representative, New Belgium \nBrewing:\n\n       Our brewery and our communities depend on clean water. Beer \n     is, after all, over 90 percent water and if something happens \n     to our source water the negative affect on our business is \n     almost unthinkable. . . . We all rely on responsible \n     regulations that limit pollution and protect water at its \n     source. Over the past 23 years we've learned that when smart \n     regulations and clean water exists for all, business thrives.\n\n  I particularly like that one because we have all seen the ads on \ntelevision about clean water. It affects small businesses. It affects \nall of our businesses.\n  I will conclude with those who depend upon recreation, who strongly \nsupport the clean water rule and oppose the legislation that is before \nus.\n  I will quote from Andy Kurkulis, owner of Chicago Fly Fishing \nOutfitters and DuPage Fly Fishing Company:\n\n       Anyone who has ever swam in our beautiful Great Lakes, or \n     fished or boated on our abundant rivers and waters has \n     benefited immeasurably. Now is the time to raise our voices \n     in support of clean water--our economy, and future \n     generations of hunters and anglers, depend on it.\n\n\n[[Page S7687]]\n\n\n  I think the verdict is clear. The rule which has been proposed will \nadd to the protections the public deserves for public health and their \ndrinking water. It is a sensible regulation. It is clearly under the \nauthority of the Clean Water Act.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this legislation and certainly the \ncloture motion so that we don't reject the rule and weaken the Clean \nWater Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity today to \nmove this legislation. It is bipartisan, and it protects our \nenvironment and helps small businesses all across the country.\n  S. 1140, the Federal Water Quality Protection Act, is legislation I \nintroduced, along with a number of Democratic Senators--Senators \nDonnelly, Heitkamp, and Manchin--and many other Senators.\n  The Senator from California previously spoke. I would point out that \nthe California Chamber of Commerce supports my legislation and the \nCalifornia Farm Bureau supports my legislation because this legislation \nwill protect our Nation's navigable waters and the streams and wetlands \nthat help our navigable waters stay clean. This bill is a testament to \nthe hard work both sides of the aisle have done in achieving an \nagreement on an environmental protection bill.\n  Our rivers, our lakes, our wetlands, and all other waterways are \namong America's most treasured resources. In my home State of Wyoming, \nwe have some of the most beautiful rivers in the world--the Snake \nRiver, the Wind River, and dozens of others. People from around the \nworld come to Wyoming to visit because we have an environmental \nlandscape that is second to none. Anyone who has come to my State and \nexperienced Yellowstone National Park, Grand Teton, and the Big Horn \nMountains comes away with a sense that Wyoming is a pristine and \nbeautiful place. It is what Wyoming sells, and it is what makes Wyoming \nso unique.\n  The people of Wyoming are devoted to keeping our waterways safe. We \nwant to preserve the water for our children and grandchildren. We \nunderstand there is a right way and a wrong way to do it.\n  It is possible to have reasonable regulations to help preserve our \nwaterways while respecting the difference between State waters and \nFederal waters. This is the environmental legacy that my constituents \nwant, and it is a legacy they have earned for their decades of sound \nmanagement. It is the people of Wyoming who have kept Wyoming's \nwaterways pristine and beautiful.\n  The EPA has now released new rules. The new rule is called the waters \nof the United States rule, WOTUS. This rule doesn't work for the people \nof Wyoming. It most likely doesn't work for any of your constituents, \neither--certainly not for those who have to put a shovel in the ground \nto make a living.\n  The courts have begun to weigh in with their concerns about this \nWOTUS rule, and they have actually given Congress and stakeholders a \nnecessary pause. That is why we are here today.\n  In August of this year, Judge Erickson of the District of North \nDakota issued an injunction that blocked the waters of the United \nStates rule in 13 States. He did it because the rulemaking record was, \nin the judge's words, ``inexplicable, arbitrary, and devoid of a \nreasoned process.'' With regard to the rationale behind the EPA's \nthreshold for what is and is not Federal water, he stated: ``On the \nrecord before the court, it appears that the standard is the right \nstandard only because the Agencies say it is.''\n  The U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals then put a nationwide stay on \nthe rule on October 9 of this year. In granting the stay, the court \nsaid, ``The sheer breadth of the ripple effects caused by the Rule's \ndefinitional changes counsel strongly in favor of maintaining the \nstatus quo for the time being.'' So keep it as it is for the time \nbeing. The court added that ``a stay temporarily silences the whirlwind \nof confusion that springs from uncertainty about the requirements of \nthe new Rule and whether they will survive legal testing.''\n  So what the courts have basically done is said: Let Congress have \ntime to act.\n  We don't have to sit on the sidelines and watch this rule slowly \ncrumble under legal scrutiny. Contrary to some activist groups' \nrhetoric, we are not facing an immediate environmental water pollution \ncrisis. In fact, in granting the stay, the Sixth Court stated that \n``neither is there any indication that the integrity of the nation's \nwater will suffer imminent injury if the new scheme is not immediately \nimplemented and enforced.'' They even called it a ``scheme.''\n  We now have the opportunity to do better, and to do better, we must \nact now. That is why we must take this opportunity to pass the \nlegislation before us that will have EPA do a new rule under a specific \nset of principles outlined by Congress. These are principles that \nprotect navigable waters and adjacent wetlands, as well as farmers, \nranchers, and other landowners.\n  I know some Senators gave the administration the benefit of the doubt \nwith this rule despite concerns they heard from their constituents, and \nthose Senators waited for the final result before making a judgment to \nsee if those concerns would be addressed. I am here to say that \nwhatever concessions the EPA says they made to address some of these \nserious problems raised by their proposed rule, the EPA added new \nprovisions in the final rule that greatly expand their authority. This \nis disappointing because I believe the great majority of Senators \nvoiced concerns in the process, and those concerns fell on deaf ears. \nThe EPA has produced a final rule worse than the one originally \nproposed.\n  Here is an example. Instead of clarifying the difference between a \nstream and an erosion on the land, the rule defines ``tributaries'' to \ninclude anyplace where EPA thinks--where EPA thinks--it sees an \n``ordinary high-water mark.'' What looks like, not what is; what looks \nlike, what they think is this ordinary high-water mark. Even worse, EPA \nproposes to make those decisions from sitting at their desks using \naerial photographs, laser-generated images, claiming that a visit to \nthe location is not necessary.\n  Under the rule, the Environmental Protection Agency also has the \npower to regulate something as ``waters of the United States'' if it \nfalls within a 100-year floodplain or if it is within 4,000 feet of a \nnavigable water or a tributary and the EPA claims there is a \n``significant nexus.'' What is a significant nexus? Under this rule, a \n``significant nexus'' can mean a water feature that provides ``life \ncycle dependent aquatic habitat'' for a species. So if you are drawing \n4,000-foot circles around anything the EPA defines or identifies as a \ntributary--remember, 4,000 feet, so we are talking over 13 football \nfields long, and everywhere there is a potential aquatic habitat. So \nessentially almost the entire United States, according to this, would \nbe underwater. Actually, 100 percent of the State of Virginia is under \nthis jurisdiction and 99.7 percent of the State of Missouri falls \nwithin this area--underwater, if you will, according to the EPA \nguidelines.\n  I would like to take a moment to talk about puddles because one of \nthe previous speakers on the other side of the aisle talked about \npuddles. People know what they think about when they think about a \npuddle--like when it rains. The final rule does exempt puddles defined \nas ``very small, shallow, and highly transitory pools of water that \nforms on pavement or uplands during or immediately after a rainstorm or \nsimilar precipitation event.'' I guess that would mean like when the \nsnow melts. The rule specifically does take control over other pools of \nwater created by rain, like those we have all around Wyoming--prairie \npotholes, vernal pools--even if the land where these pools of water \nform is far away from any navigable water or even a tributary. Under \nthis new regulation, nearly all of these pools of water created by rain \nwill now be considered ``waters of the United States,'' giving the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency the power to regulate what you do on \nthat land. These provisions are sweeping and will create uncertainty in \ncommunities all across the country.\n  There is plenty that I have already outlined in the waters of the \nUnited States rule that is bad for agriculture, with the many methods \nit provides for federalizing previously State-controlled water. The \nStates have made these decisions in the past. Now we are\n\n[[Page S7688]]\n\nadding another level of government bureaucracy.\n  This rule is bad for agriculture, for those people who produce our \nfood. Farmers, ranchers, and others are used to working with their \nStates to protect their land and water under their own stewardship.\n  We heard from the Senator from California about groups opposing this, \nbut 480 different groups support this bill, and they are major national \ngroups: the American Farm Bureau, the Agricultural Retailers \nAssociation, the American Soybean Association, the American Sugar \nAlliance, the Milk Producers Council, the National Association of Wheat \nGrowers, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, the National \nChicken Council, the National Corn Growers Association, the National \nCouncil of Farmer Cooperatives, the National Pork Producers Council, \nthe National Turkey Federation, the U.S. Poultry and Egg Association, \nthe United Egg Producers, the USA Rice Federation. I could go on and \non. These are the food producers of America. They support the \nlegislation in front of the Senate today.\n  The point is, not one State, not a single State in this country is \nout there that doesn't have a strong agriculture presence. We all do. \nSo I urge all Senators to make sure, as they prepare to vote on this \nmotion to proceed, that they check with their folks at home.\n  I would also note that many industries outside of agriculture are \nconcerned with the rule as well. These include manufacturers, \nhomebuilders, small businesses--you name it. They are all very \nconcerned with this rule, and they want Congress to act now.\n  Action could mean Congress can pass a Congressional Review Act \nresolution, which will be considered possibly later in the process, but \nthat would eliminate the WOTUS rule and prevent a substantially similar \nrule from being proposed. That would allow for a new rule as long as it \nwas not substantially similar to the existing rule. We need to vote on \nthis resolution.\n  I believe S. 1140 is a better route, the one we have here today. This \nis a bipartisan compromise. This is the bill that has a number of \nSenators from the Democratic side of the aisle cosponsoring the \nlegislation. Most importantly, this piece of legislation on the floor \ntoday allows for Congress to establish the principles--Congress to \nestablish the principles--of what the new EPA would look like.\n  I know a number of Democrats have ideas to improve the legislation \nthat is on the floor today specific for their own States. If my \ncolleagues vote to proceed to the motion to proceed at 2:30 this \nafternoon, we will have an open amendment process that would allow \nMembers to improve S. 1140 in a bipartisan way. We are willing to work \nwith anyone who wants to improve this rule in a bipartisan way. But \nlet's not sit on the sidelines anymore.\n  Rather than support an EPA final rule that actually makes it worse \nand was worse than the proposed rule--a rule that will likely not \nsurvive legal scrutiny based on what we saw from the courts, a rule \nthat doesn't represent the interests of our farmers, ranchers, \nfamilies, small businesses, and communities--let's move forward with \nthe bipartisan Federal Water Quality Protection Act to ensure the \npublic that we hear and we understand their concerns.\n  At the same time, let's give EPA and the Army Corps the certainty \nthey need to confidently move forward with a new rule--a rule that \ntruly reflects the needs of the constituents we represent. Let's \nprotect our Nation's waterways for the long term.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE: Mr. President, the famous Republican Senator from \nRhode Island John Chafee, who was one of the authors of the Clean Water \nAct, would be sorry to see what has become of his party today and what \nis being done to the Clean Water Act that so many Republicans worked so \nhard on for over so many years. The pretense is that some evil \nbureaucratic force at the EPA has leapt out to take over American \nfarmers and ranchers. That is not what has happened.\n  The Supreme Court made decisions about what the Clean Water Act says, \ndefining the navigable waters of the United States, and the EPA had to \nfollow the Supreme Court's guidance, which they did. I believe they \nhave been faithful to that Supreme Court guidance. They went through \nmore than 1,000 peer-reviewed scientific publications. They did 400 \npublic meetings. They had over 1 million comments on the proposed rule. \nGuess what. The vast majority of those comments were in support of the \nrule.\n  What we have here is not some DC bureaucratic evil presence against \nranchers and farmers across the country. What we have here is a fight \nbetween upstream and downstream.\n  As Senator Barrasso very plainly said a moment ago, the big players \nin this are the big special interests in agriculture, the big pork \nproducers with their ginormous manure lagoons, and the big commercial \nAG conglomerates. If you want to be with them fine, but let's not \npretend this is about protecting little ranchers and farmers.\n  This is about upstream versus downstream. I come from Rhode Island. I \nam from a downstream State. I have to say that if I were in big \nagriculture and I saw this rule, instead of coming in here and whining \nand complaining and yanking people's chains in order to get changes \nmade, I would grab this rule and run like a bank robber because this \nbill does so much for upstream agriculture at the expense of downstream \nfishermen, downstream aquaculture, and the downstream health of our \nrivers and bays. All agricultural exemptions and exclusions from Clean \nWater Act requirements that have existed for nearly 40 years have been \nretained. We have learned a little bit since then about what goes on.\n  One place I recently went to was Ohio. I spent the weekend in Ohio \ndoing one of my climate tours of the difficult States of the Union. In \nOhio, I went to Port Clinton on Lake Erie. I was taken by the folks \nfrom Stone Laboratory and from some of the leading charter captains in \nthis area off to the Bass Islands just offshore. They told me about the \nalgal bloom that took place in the Toledo area. Technically, this was \nnot an algal bloom. Technically, it was cyanotic bacteria; it was a \nbacterial bloom. It was so thick that the fishing captains described \nhow their boats slowed down in the muck. It was like running a \npowerboat through pudding.\n  Toledo had to stop providing freshwater to its citizens and spent \nmillions of dollars having to import freshwater and provide bottled \nwater. Lake Erie is 2 percent of the water of all the Great Lakes with \n50 percent of the fish. Two percent of the water and 50 percent of the \nfish in the Great Lakes are in Lake Erie. It has a robust fishing \neconomy for walleyes and perch. The folks who go out and make this \ntheir livelihood don't think it is very funny because this whole \nwatershed feeds down into Lake Erie.\n  Because of climate change, phosphorous has driven rain bursts. The \nrains have powered up in this area. So the phosphorous is washing off \nthe farmers' fields and is coming down, and that is what is creating \nthe cyanotic bacterial bloom in Lake Erie.\n  This upstream stuff makes a big difference to people who are \ndownstream. Wyoming doesn't have a lot of downstream. Wyoming is a \nlandlocked State, so I appreciate why the Senator is so enthusiastic \nabout this. But for those of us who are downstream, this is a rule \nthat, frankly, is too weak. The fact that we have to stand here and \nfight it from getting even weaker--from putting our rivers and our bays \nat even more risk--is very unfortunate. It is not just phosphorous. \nPhosphorous is what happens to drive the bacteria growth in Lake Erie. \nIt is insecticides, it is nitrogen, and they are doing immense damage \nin our waterways.\n  I will conclude where I began. If you are Big Agriculture and this is \nyour special interest bill, you ought to run for it. Don't waste your \ntime on this. Grab this existing Clean Water Act bill, and go for it \nlike a bank robber with his money because you got away with being able \nto continue to do immense damage to downstream resources without any \nregulation at all. To now be here complaining--it is really amazing to \nthose of us who are representing downstream States, downstream \ninterests, downstream fisheries, downstream bays, and all the catchment \nareas such as Lake Erie that get clobbered as a result of pollutants \nthat flow into our waters.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S7689]]\n\n  \n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to join my colleagues in support \nof the clean water rule issued by the Environmental Protection Agency \nand the Army Corps of Engineers and in opposition to efforts to derail \nthis critical rule.\n  Clean water is the lifeblood of our society and the basic foundation \nof good public health. Our rivers, streams, and wetlands connect \ncommunities near and far through a common resource. For decades, the \nClean Water Act has protected our waters from pollution so that \nAmericans can rely on safe drinking water, can enjoy outdoor \nrecreation, and can live in an environment that supports wildlife and a \nhealthy ecosystem.\n  However, for the last 15 years uncertainty has muddied the Clean \nWater Act. The lack of clarity for which bodies of water are federally \nregulated has led the Army Corps of Engineers to a backlog of 18,000 \nrequests from landowners seeking help in complying with the Clean Water \nAct. The new clean water rule resolves this uncertainty for our local \ngovernments, our businesses, and our farmers by clarifying which waters \nshould be protected so that all Americans can rely on clean water. The \nrule restores historic coverage of the Clean Water Act for streams and \nwetlands that provide drinking water for one-third of Americans.\n  As one who has experienced the many benefits of the Chesapeake Bay my \nwhole life, I know just how important it is to preserve and protect the \nworld around us for future generations. The clean water rule would \nrestore protections for more than half of Maryland's streams and many \nof its wetlands. Clean water means healthy families, healthy marine \nlife to support Maryland watermen, and a healthy environment. The clean \nwater rule is crucial to the health of the Chesapeake Bay and to \ncountless other bodies of water in the United States. Let's stand up \nfor our Nation's clean water and reject these attempts to derail the \nclean water rule.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I join many of my colleagues in \nopposing S. 1140 and S.J. Res. 22.\n  These measures would block or nullify the clean water rule, which \nseeks to safeguard our water and restore protections to drinking water \nsources for one in three Americans, according to the EPA, under the \nauthority of the Clean Water Act.\n  The clean water rule helps to clarify ambiguities stemming from the \n2001 and 2006 Supreme Court decisions that made the scope of the Clean \nWater Act uncertain.\n  This lack of protection has taken its toll, especially for wetlands \nand intermittent and headwater streams, slowing permitting decisions \nfor responsible development, and reducing protections for drinking \nwater supplies and critical habitat.\n  According to the National Parks Conservation Association, over 117 \nmillion Americans, including many visitors to national parks, get their \ndrinking water from surface waters.\n  This includes many Rhode Islanders who get their drinking water from \nsources that rely on small streams that are protected by the clean \nwater rule.\n  If Congress blocks the clean water rule, Rhode Island's streams and \nmillions of acres of wetlands nationwide will again be at risk from \npollution and degradation or destruction from development, oil and gas \nproduction, and other industrial activities.\n  Blocking this rule would potentially imperil drinking water sources, \nas well as the small businesses and communities that rely on clean \nwater.\n  Thousands of acres of wetlands that provide flood protection, \nrecharge groundwater supplies, filter pollution, and provide essential \nwildlife habitat are safeguarded under the clean water rule, including \nmany of Rhode Island's streams, wetlands, waterways, and the bay.\n  Additionally, the clean water rule seeks to protect small streams and \nwetlands that support fish, wildlife, and recreational areas.\n  We depend on clean water to drink, and our economy depends on clean \nwater from manufacturing to farming to tourism to recreation to energy \nproduction and more to function and flourish.\n  We must make clean water a priority throughout the nation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the clean water rule and vote ``no'' \non both S. 1140 and S.J. Res. 22.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of bipartisan \nlegislation to fix intrusive regulation that will hurt job growth and \nthat threatens to place a large share of our Nation's farmers, \nranchers, and small businesses in the regulatory grip of the EPA. This \nburdensome regulation is the EPA and Army Corps' final rule on the \nwaters of the United States. The bill to fix it is called the Federal \nWater Quality Protection Act. That is the bill we are seeking to \nproceed to today so that we can debate it, amend it, and pass it to \ndeal with this onerous regulation.\n  The burdensome regulation we are talking about, of course, is the EPA \nand Army Corps' final rule on waters of the United States. The Federal \nWater Quality Protection Act is legislation to address it. It was \nauthored by my good friend from Wyoming Senator Barrasso, and I \ncosponsored this legislation, along with many others on our side of the \naisle. This is also a bipartisan bill with our colleagues from across \nthe aisle as well. This is bipartisan legislation. It has had \nbipartisan input, and I encourage Members on both sides of the aisle to \nproceed to this legislation. Let's have this very important debate on \nbehalf of our farmers, ranchers, and so many other job creators across \nthis country. As I say, let's offer amendments and have our votes, but \nwe need to deal with this very important legislation for the benefit of \nthe American people.\n  This waters of the United States final rule greatly expands the scope \nof the Clean Water Act regulation over America's streams and wetlands. \nIt is a real power grab by the EPA, and it exceeds the statutory \nauthority of the EPA. The Supreme Court has found that Federal \njurisdiction under the Clean Water Act extends the ``navigable \nwaters.'' I don't think anyone is arguing about the EPA's ability to \nregulate navigable bodies of water like the Missouri River, in my \nState, but the Supreme Court has also made clear that not all bodies of \nwater are under the EPA's jurisdiction. Yet, under the administration's \nfinal rule, all water located within 4,000 feet of any other water, or \nwithin the 100-year flood plain, is considered a water of the United \nStates as long as the EPA or the Army Corps of Engineers decides it has \na ``significant nexus'' to that navigable water in the opinion of \neither the Corps or the EPA.\n  These agencies define significant nexus so that almost any body of \nwater qualifies. For instance, if an area can hold rainwater or has \nwater that can seep into ground water, which is almost any water \nanywhere, then there is significant nexus, according the EPA or the \nArmy Corps of Engineers, not to mention the fact that areas like the \nPrairie Pothole region in my State of North Dakota are specifically \ntargeted as waters of the United States. The result is that the vast \nmajority of the Nation's water features are located within 4,000 feet \nof a covered body of water.\n  If this expansive rule sounds out of bounds to you, you are not \nalone. In fact, the waters of the United States rule is such an \noverreach by the EPA and the Corps that 31 States are suing to overturn \nit, including my State of North Dakota, which has led a lawsuit brought \nby 13 of those 31 States.\n  When granting a preliminary injunction against this rule, the North \nDakota Federal District Court stated that ``the rule allows EPA \nregulation of waters that do not bear any effect on the `chemical, \nphysical and biological integrity' of any navigable-in-fact water.'' It \nwent further to state that ``the rule asserts jurisdiction over waters \nthat are remote and intermittent waters. No evidence actually points to \nhow these intermittent and remote wetlands have any nexus to navigable-\nin-fact water.''\n  Meanwhile, the Sixth Circuit Court in Cincinnati, OH, issued a \nnationwide stay of the rule, citing that the EPA and the Corps did not \nidentify ``specific scientific support substantiating the \nreasonableness of the bright-line standards they ultimately chose.''\n  This waters of the United States rule is clearly flawed from a legal \nperspective, but I think it is even more important to take a look at \nhow this rule, if allowed to be implemented, will affect\n\n[[Page S7690]]\n\nhard-working Americans with excessive regulation.\n  For those of you who haven't had the opportunity to visit with a \nfarmer from my State of North Dakota, know that dealing with excess \nwater is a common issue, a daily issue, to say the least. Those farmers \ncan tell you that if there is water in a ditch or a field one week, it \ndoesn't mean there will be water there the next week. It certainly \ndoesn't make that water worthy of being treated the same as a river.\n  A field with a low spot that has standing water during a rainy week \nand happens to be located near a ditch does not warrant Clean Water Act \nregulation from a legal or, more importantly, from a simple commonsense \nstandpoint.\n  The Corps and EPA have responded to these concerns by saying they are \nexempting dozens of conservation practices, but these exemptions cover \nfarmers and ranchers only for changes made before 1977 or for changes \nthat don't disturb any water or land now considered to be a water of \nthe United States. In other words, if you need a new Clean Water Act \npermit, you are not going to qualify for the EPA's exemption under this \nrule. Moreover, the exemption does not cover all Clean Water Act \npermits.\n  Because of this rule, the farmer with the low spot in the field next \nto a ditch, described above, may now be sued under the Clean Water \nAct's Section 402 National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. This \nfarmer now faces the risk of litigation costs for the United States of \neveryday weed control and fertilizer applicants, among other essential \nfarming activities.\n  Farmers and ranchers are far from the only job creators who will \nsuffer under this rule. In fact, the Small Business Administration \nOffice of Advocacy has expressed concern about the impact it will have \non other small businesses as well.\n  I am so concerned about this rule that I have led the effort on our \nAppropriations Committee to stop the rule in its tracks. We were \nsuccessful in including language in the committee-passed Interior-EPA \nAppropriations bill to do just that. The Federal Water Quality \nProtection Act, however, offers a long-term solution by vacating the \nwaters of the United States rule and sending the EPA and the Corps back \nto the drawing board to develop a new rule with instructions to consult \nwith States, local governments, and small businesses.\n  America's farmers, ranchers, and entrepreneurs go to work every day \nto build a stronger nation. Thanks to these hard-working men and women, \nwe live in a country where there is affordable food at the grocery \nstore and where a dynamic private sector offers Americans the \nopportunity to achieve a brighter future. The Federal Government should \nbe doing all it can to empower those who grow our food and create jobs. \nYet, instead, regulators are stifling growth with burdensome \nregulations that generate cost and uncertainty. The final rule on the \nwaters of the United States produced by the EPA and the Corps to \nregulate virtually every body of water--pretty much water anywhere in \nthe United States--is not the way to go. Let's stop this regulation. \nPlease join me in voting to proceed to the Federal Water Quality \nProtection Act.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Barrasso). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I come before the Senate to talk about the \nwaters of the United States rule and the legislation pending before us, \nS. 1140. I hope we can proceed to the bill. This is an important issue. \nObviously, the definition of the waters of the United States sets the \nrules of the game of who is covered under the Clean Water Act. As has \nbeen stated, several Supreme Court decisions over the past decade and a \nhalf have created a lot of uncertainty for landowners and those who \nwork the land who aren't sure whether they will be regulated. Regulated \nentities need a rule that is consistent and that has some \npredictability. That is not what we are getting with this rule.\n  The rule issued on June 29 defines jurisdiction very broadly, as we \nheard, especially when it comes to streams that don't flow year round, \nintermittent, ephemeral streams, of which Arizona has many. Several \nscientists who have been involved in the rulemaking process have told \nmy staff that there is a disagreement between what the science says and \nwhat this rule says. Science says that some streams are strongly \nconnected and others are not. There is a so-called spectrum of \nconnectivity, but this rule assumes they are all strongly connected.\n  Let me show a picture of a stream. This is Dan Bell, a rancher in \nsouthern Arizona, near the border of Santa Cruz County, standing on a \nstreambed or a dry wash or arroyo that will likely be covered under \nthis rule. Like Dan, I grew up on a ranch in northern Arizona. My whole \nlife I have ridden through a 7-mile draw, a 9-mile wash. The topography \nof the land was named for some of these dry washes, but they only had \nwater after a good rain which lasted a few minutes and that was it. \nThose will likely, under the definition of this new rule, be defined as \nwaters of the United States.\n  If you can imagine what ranchers and other agricultural users are \nfeeling right now, thinking that the Federal Government, in regulating \nwhat goes on with these streambeds or these dry washes, is going to \nstep in on other State regulations that already exist.\n  On August 27, a Federal district court judge blocked the \nimplementation in 13 States, including Arizona, saying that ``it \nappears likely that the EPA has violated its congressional grant of \nauthority in its promulgation of the rule at issue.'' As we know, on \nOctober 9 the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals stayed the rule \nnationwide. There is not consensus, obviously, on what this rule does \nor does not do.\n  In internal memos, the Army Corps of Engineers assistant chief \ncounsel of environmental and regulatory programs highlighted a number \nof ``serious areas of concern'' with the rule, including the \n``assertion of jurisdiction over every stream bed,'' which would have \n``the effect of asserting Clean Water Act jurisdiction over many \nthousands of miles of dry washes and arroyos in the desert southwest.''\n  When you hear people stand and say that it will not affect dry \nwashes, that is not what the rule says. We need clarification. We need \nto pass this legislation. We need to actually invoke cloture so we can \ndebate it and ultimately pass it. This is a bipartisan measure that \nwill address this issue and will ultimately provide a new rule that has \nthe consistency and uniformity that those who work the land really \nneed. Arizona will benefit from it, and the entire country will benefit \nfrom it.\n  With that, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, Americans have had a tough time during the \nObama administration with a sluggish economic recovery that is barely \nworthy of the name, stagnant wages for middle-class families, a health \ncare law that ripped away millions of Americans' preferred health care \nplans, and burdensome regulations that have made it more challenging \nfor businesses, large and small, to grow and create jobs.\n  One Agency has done more than its fair share to make things difficult \nfor Americans, and that is the Obama EPA. During the course of the \nObama administration, this Agency has implemented one damaging rule \nafter another--from a massive national backdoor energy tax that \nthreatens hundreds of thousands of jobs to unrealistic new ozone \nstandards that have the potential to devastate State economies. Reputed \nrebukes from various Federal courts have done little to check the EPA's \nenthusiasm for crippling, job-destroying regulations.\n  This week, the Senate is taking up legislation introduced by my \ncolleague from Wyoming Senator Barrasso to address one of the EPA's \nbiggest overreaches--the so-called waters of the United States \nregulation. The EPA has long had authority under the Clean Water Act to \nregulate ``navigable waters,'' such as rivers, lakes, and major \nwaterways. The inclusion of the term ``navigable'' in the Clean Water \nAct was deliberate. It was deliberate. The reason it was put there is \nbecause Congress intended to put limits--real limits--on the Federal \nGovernment's authority to regulate water and to leave the regulation of \nsmaller bodies of water to the States. Defining the waters to be \nregulated as navigable\n\n[[Page S7691]]\n\nwaters ensured that the Federal Government's authority would be limited \nto bodies of water of substantial size and would not infringe on minor \nbodies of water on private land, but over the last few years it became \nclear the EPA was eager to expand its reach.\n  The waters of the United States regulation, which the EPA finalized \nthis year, expands the EPA's regulatory authority to waters such as \nsmall wetlands, creeks, stock ponds, and ditches--bodies of water that \ncertainly don't fit the definition of ``navigable.'' It specifically \ntargets the prairie pothole region, which covers five States, including \nnearly all of eastern South Dakota.\n  If we look at this chart, this is something that is a very normal \nlandscape in South Dakota. It is a field that one would see in South \nDakota, and of course when it gets some rain, some of the low-lying \nareas get a little water in them, but this is basically a puddle. If we \nlook at what the regulation would do to the way in which farmers and \nranchers manage and are able to use their lands for production \nagriculture, it has some profound impacts.\n  We are not talking about lakes and rivers. We are talking about \nsmall, isolated ponds that ranchers use to water their cattle or \nprairie potholes that are dry for most of the year but do collect some \nwater after heavy rains and snows along the lines of what we see in \nthis photo. Under this regulation, even dry creekbeds could be subject \nto the EPA's regulatory authority. That is how far-reaching this \nregulation is.\n  Let me talk about that authority for just a minute. When we talk \nabout a body of water coming under the EPA's regulatory authority, we \nare not talking about having to follow a couple of basic rules and \nregulations. Waters that come under the EPA's jurisdiction under the \nClean Water Act are subject to a complex array of expensive and \nburdensome regulatory requirements, including permitting and reporting \nrequirements, enforcement, mitigation, and citizen suits. Fines for \nfailing to comply with any of these requirements and regulations, such \nas the one that is now being filed by the EPA, can accumulate at the \nrate of $37,500 per day.\n  Under the EPA's new waters of the United States rule, creeks and \nditches would be subject to this complex array of regulations. The \nirrigation ditches in a farmer's cornfield, for example--ditches where \nthe water level rarely exceeds a couple of inches--would be subject to \nextensive regulatory requirements, including costly permits and time-\nconsuming reports. Needless to say, these kinds of requirements will \nhit farmers and ranchers hard. Agriculture is a time-sensitive \nbusiness, and these types of requirements would strain a farmer's \nability to fertilize, plant, and irrigate their crops when the seasons \nand weather conditions dictate.\n  Farmers can't afford to wait for a Federal permit before carrying out \nbasic land and resource management decisions. I have received numerous \nletters from South Dakota farmers and ranchers, as well as local \ngovernments, expressing their concern with the EPA's new rule. One \nconstituent writes:\n\n       We live in Deuel County, South Dakota, where we raise \n     cattle and plant wheat, alfalfa, corn, and soybeans. . . . \n     Our land consists of rolling hills and many shallow low \n     spots. . . . According to the new rules, our entire farm \n     would be under the jurisdiction of the EPA. . . .\n\n  That same constituent goes on to say:\n\n       Mandatory laws by the EPA are just wrong and are often \n     written and enforced by someone who has never lived or worked \n     on a farm and doesn't understand how the forces of nature \n     cannot be dictated. The weather is often extreme, and we must \n     work with it. . . . Under this rule, it will be more \n     difficult to farm and ranch, or make changes to the land even \n     if those changes would benefit the environment.\n\n  That is from a constituent from my State of South Dakota.\n  Another constituent, also from my home State, said:\n\n       [O]ur business is going to be put into acute peril if the \n     EPA is not stopped. . . . By removing the word ``navigable'' \n     from the Clean Water Act, they will be in control of EVERY \n     drop of water in the United States, which is disastrous for \n     those of us engaged in farming and ranching.\n\n  This is from the Pennington County Board of Commissioners in South \nDakota. Pennington County is the second largest county and home to our \nsecond largest city, Rapid City. They wrote:\n\n       In addition to tourism, agriculture is a critical piece of \n     our local economy. . . . This proposal would cause \n     significant hardships to local farmers and ranchers by taking \n     away local control of the land uses. The costs to the local \n     agricultural community would be enormous. This would lead to \n     food and cattle prices increasing significantly.\n\n  The board also warned:\n\n       If stormwater costs significantly increased due to this \n     proposed rule, not only will it impact our ability to focus \n     our available resources on real, priority water quality \n     issues, but it may also require funds to be diverted from \n     other government services that we are required to provide \n     such as law enforcement, fire protection services, etc.\n\n  I have received letter after letter like these from farmers, \nranchers, business owners, and local governments across my State, and \nthey are not alone. Concern is high across all of the United States. \nThat is why 31 States have filed lawsuits against the EPA's \nregulations, as have a number of industry groups. The courts have \nalready granted them some temporary relief. Last month, the Sixth \nCircuit Court of Appeals expanded an earlier injunction and blocked \nimplementation of the EPA's rule in all 50 States, but a final decision \nof the courts could be years away.\n  To protect Americans affected by this rule from years of litigation \nand uncertainty, this week the Senate is taking up the Federal Water \nQuality Protection Act, introduced by Senator Barrasso, which would \nrequire the EPA to return to the drawing board and write a new waters \nof the United States rule in consultation with States, local \ngovernments, agricultural producers, and small businesses. It seems \nonly fitting that you actually ought to consult with the people who are \nimpacted by this. If that had happened, maybe there wouldn't be 31 \nStates that have already filed lawsuits against the Federal Government, \nand maybe we wouldn't have all of these local governments, agricultural \nproducers, small businesses, homeowners, and developers that are \nmortified about the impact this will have on them.\n  In my time in Washington, I have never seen an issue that has so \ngalvanized opposition all across the country. Sometimes there might be \nan issue that might affect a specific area or industry sector in our \neconomy, such as agriculture. We talk a lot about those issues in my \nState because this is our No. 1 industry, but there is rarely an issue \nwhich generates opposition from so many sectors of our economy. That is \nhow far-reaching this regulation is. Arguably, this is the largest \nFederal land grab in our Nation's history.\n  What the legislation also does is explicitly prohibits the EPA from \ncounting things like ditches, isolated ponds, and storm water as \nnavigable waters that it can regulate under the Clean Water Act. It \ntakes away these things we are talking about--the stock ponds, ditches, \nand frankly the puddles--from areas that the EPA can assert its \njurisdiction in and regulate.\n  Everybody agrees on the importance of clean water. Farmers in my \nState depend on it, and the legislation we are considering today will \nensure that the EPA retains the authority to make sure our lakes and \nrivers are clean and pollutant-free. Members of both parties should be \nable to agree that allowing the EPA to regulate what frequently amounts \nto seasonal puddles is taking things a step too far. The cost of this \nrule will be steep, and its burdens will be significant, impacting \nthose who have an inherent interest in properly managing their water to \nprotect their livelihoods and health.\n\n  Back in March, a bipartisan group of 59 Senators voted to limit the \nEPA's waters of the United States power grab, and 3 Democratic Senators \nare cosponsors of the legislation before us today. It is my hope that \nmore will join us to protect farmers, ranchers, small businesses, and \nhomeowners from the consequences of the EPA's dangerous new rule.\n  Americans have suffered enough under the Obama EPA. It is time to \nstart reining in this out-of-control bureaucracy. I hope we will have a \nbig bipartisan vote today in support of the legislation before the \nSenate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, whether you are a farmer or a small\n\n[[Page S7692]]\n\nbusiness owner, a Republican, a Democrat or someone who works at the \nEPA, we all want clean water. If we are going to ensure that our clean \nwater protections are effective, we need to work together and we need \nto use the feedback from the people who work with the land every single \nday. Unfortunately, the EPA's waters of the United States rule was \nwritten without sufficient collaboration with some of the people who \ncare about this rule the most--our farmers, our small business owners, \nour cities and States. As a result, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nSixth Circuit has blocked the implementation of the waters of the \nUnited States rule, known as WOTUS, nationwide.\n  This ruling was in line with the concerns we have raised all along. \nWhen you write a rule without significant input from all of those \nimpacted, including our farmers, ranchers, small business owners, and \nlocal governments, legal challenges are inevitable. Instead of further \nlengthy and costly court battles, Congress should act to clarify the \ncoverage of the Clean Water Act or the courts will do that job instead \nof us. It is time to roll up our sleeves and provide to our ag \nproducers, conservationists, and county and local governments the \nregulatory certainty they need to continue efforts to improve water \nquality.\n  That is why I was proud to help author and introduce the Federal \nWater Quality Protection Act with a bipartisan group of Senators, \nincluding Senator John Barrasso, a Republican from Wyoming, Senator \nHeidi Heitkamp, a Democrat from North Dakota, and Senate Majority \nLeader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky.\n  Most Hoosiers believe we can get more accomplished when we work \ntogether, and I have worked across the aisle on what I believe is a \nvery responsible solution. I hope today we will continue this debate. \nIt will be difficult, but we have the ability to get this right. If \nCongress fails to act, our ag community will be faced with continued \nconfusion and uncertainty, and we will not have strengthened our \nefforts to protect the waters of this country.\n  The WOTUS rule is a perfect example of the disconnect between \nWashington and the Hoosier ag community, farmers and ranchers around \nour country, small businesses, and our families. No one wants cleaner \nwater or healthier land more than the families who live on those farms \nand who work on our farms every single day right next to those waters--\nthe same waters their children play and swim in and with which they \nwork every day. That is why countless Hoosier farmers are frustrated \nthat Washington bureaucrats are calling the shots rather than working \ntogether with our ag community and our families to develop sensible \nenvironmental protection. This can be done if it is done the right way.\n  In Indiana we are already leading in many agricultural conservation \nand environmental protection efforts. We have more farmers than ever \nbefore doing things such as planting cover crops and using no-till \nfarming techniques that keep soil in the fields and keep the inputs in \nthe fields. We are leading the Nation in cover crop efforts. It is \nvoluntary, and it is part of a program to make sure our waters--our \nrivers and streams--are cleaner. This is being done by people, not by \nbureaucrats.\n  Let's have some faith and confidence in the people of this country \nand in the wisdom of our ag community in Indiana and in every other \nState. If we work with our friends and our neighbors, we can do even \nmore to improve water quality.\n  Listen to farmers such as Mike Shuter and Mark Legan. Mike is an \nIndiana Corn Growers Association member from Frankton, IN, who won the \nNational Corn Growers Association Good Steward Award this year for \nsustainable corn farming practices. Mike said:\n\n       I want clean drinking water for my wife, kids, and \n     grandkids. We work hard to reduce the amount of pesticides, \n     insecticides, and fertilizer on our farm. The EPA is going \n     too far by attempting to unilaterally claim jurisdiction over \n     my farmland.\n\n  Mark Legan is a farmer who received the American Soybean \nAssociation's Conservation Legacy Award in 2013. Here is what he had to \nsay:\n\n       Farmers have been good stewards of the land for \n     generations. We have found ways to produce more while using \n     less pesticides and fertilizers. Waters of the U.S. gives the \n     EPA one-sided jurisdiction over our ditches and fields, makes \n     it more difficult to grow crops, and makes it harder to feed \n     the world.\n\n  After hearing these frustrations from Hoosier ag producers and from \nlocal and county governments about this rule, and because I am the \nhired help not only for Indiana but for our country, we wrote the \nFederal Water Quality Protection Act. The intention is to strike a \nreasonable, bipartisan compromise--what a unique concept. It is the \nconcept that our country has been built on. The legislation is simple: \nFocus on common science principles to shape a final rule and to require \nstraightforward procedures that the EPA skipped the first time. These \nare steps the EPA should have done in the first place, such as \nreviewing economic and small business impacts.\n  The bill is not designed to destroy or delay the rule. In fact, our \nbill asks the EPA to complete its rule by December 31 of next year. \nThere is no long hide-the-ball game being played here. We want to have \nthis done by the end of next year.\n  The legislation includes explicit protections for waters that almost \neveryone agrees should be covered. If a body of water impacts the \nquality of the Wabash or Kankakee Rivers, the Great Lakes or anything \nsimilar, our bill protects those waters. It protects commonsense \nexemptions for isolated ponds and agricultural or roadside ditches--\nmost of which the EPA has indicated they never intended to cover.\n  We require consultation with stakeholders such as States and the ag \ncommunity, including soil and water conservation districts. Giving the \nEPA principles, procedure, and a clear deadline this bipartisan effort \nis meant to be constructive.\n  I urge my colleagues, Republican and Democrat, to allow us to \nconsider the bipartisan Federal Water Quality Protection Act. It is our \nobligation to debate this important issue. I am confident a bipartisan \nmajority of my Senate colleagues will support this commonsense \nbipartisan bill.\n  This much I promise: I will continue to push Congress to pass a \npermanent solution. We will never stop advocating on behalf of \nIndiana's farmers and families, ranchers and small businesses, and \nthose of the entire country.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, first of all I want to thank my \ncolleague, who has been working so hard on this. It affects Indiana, \nWest Virginia, and every State in the Union. I hope people realize what \nis going on. This isn't a partisan issue. This is definitely a \nbipartisan issue, and it affects everybody in our State.\n  I want to thank Senator Markey for allowing me to speak for a few \nminutes. I have a funeral in Arlington to attend for one of our dear \nsoldiers.\n  I have spoken on the Senate floor many times before about the burdens \nthe EPA has continued to impose on hard-working families and hard-\nworking people in West Virginia. Today, however, I am not speaking \nabout the mining jobs I have spoken about so much. I am speaking about \neveryday West Virginians. If you have any property whatsoever, if you \nhave a small business or a large business, if you come from any walk of \nlife, if you are in agriculture or are a small farmer or are in large \nagriculture, this affects you. This allows the overreach of the \ngovernment, as we have talked about so many times.\n  If you are a government agency, if you are a city, a small town, if \nyou are a county, any decisions you make will be affected or could be \naffected. If imposed, the agency's waters of the United States rule, \nknown as WOTUS, would have a harmful impact all over this great \ncountry. Again, the WOTUS rule will not just impact certain industries; \nit impacts everybody. The EPA wrote these rules without consulting some \nof the people who care about clean water the most--everyday West \nVirginians and Americans all across this great country. The WOTUS rule \nwould impose heavy financial penalties on all of us, including our \nsmall business owners, farmers, manufacturers, and property owners.\n  If you have ever seen the terrain of West Virginia, we are the most \nmountainous State east of the Mississippi.\n\n[[Page S7693]]\n\nThere is very little flat land whatsoever. So anything can be affected \nand everybody will be affected. Whether you build a home, have a small \nbusiness or are a little city or community, you are going to be \naffected. If they can show on an aerial map that there used to be a \nriver or stream of any kind, that comes under their jurisdiction. If \nanyone thinks differently--that it is not going to happen--this is \nexactly what is going to happen. That is why all of these small towns \nand the counties in rural America are totally opposed to this.\n  There is nobody I know of who doesn't want clean drinking water. With \nthat, we are not saying that the Federal Government shouldn't have \noversight on all of our waters that are for drinking, are navigable \nand/or recreational. In fact, I live on the water, so I know what it is \nto have the clean waters in our streams and rivers. This is not what we \nare talking about.\n  As my good friend from Indiana and my good friend from North Dakota \nare going to be talking about, this affects everybody. It affects every \npuddle, ditch, and every runoff--you name it; it affects it--and that \nmeans it affects all of our lives. They are going to say: Don't worry. \nWe are not going to do all that. We are going to exempt it.\n  We have heard that one before--until it is something they don't like, \nuntil basically it gives them a chance to shut down something. I have \nfarmers who are concerned about basically the crops they grow, the \nwildlife, the poultry and the livestock they have to care for. All of \nthis could be affected. We fought this before.\n  The Supreme Court instruction is to clarify the Clean Water Act \njurisdiction over bodies of water in use. This proposal goes too far. \nIn fact, the Supreme Court has already ruled that not all bodies of \nwater fall under the Clean Water Act regulations. So why are they \nexpanding it? If they have already ruled on it, why are they expanding \nthese rules? Why do they believe they can grab this?\n  They claim they were not required to consult with local governments \nunder the federalism Executive order, arguing the rule did not impact \nthem. The EPA claims that even though it did not comply with the \nExecutive order, it still reached out to local governments. That is not \ntrue. That is not true in West Virginia. I can tell you that.\n  The EPA claims it addressed the concerns of local governments by \nproviding exemptions for public safety ditches and storm water control \nsystems. That is not true either. So that being said, I can only tell \nyou what my citizens, my communities, business owners, and local \ngovernments are being affected by and why they are concerned.\n  The bottom line is it is completely unreasonable that our country's \nditches, puddles, and otherwise unnavigable waters be subjected to the \nsame regulations of our greatest lakes and rivers. On that we all \nagree.\n  The WOTUS rule exempts ditches only if the local government can prove \nthat no part of the entire length of a ditch is located in an area \nwhere there used to be a stream. The WOTUS rule exempts storm water \nmanagement systems only if they were built on dry land. The WOTUS rule \nsays EPA can rely on historical maps and historical aerial photographs \nto determine where the streams used to be--not where they are now.\n  These provisions of the WOTUS rules should strike terror in the heart \nof every mayor, county commissioner, and manager of a city that was \nfounded before the last century. This is how asinine this is. It is \nunbelievable that with a sweep of the pen, the EPA is trying to take us \nback to the days of Lewis and Clark. According to a memo written in \nApril, not even the Corps of Engineers knows how it will determine \nwhich ditches are exempt and which are former streams. This is our own \ngovernment.\n  Morgantown, WV, was founded in 1785. Wheeling, WV, was established in \n1795. To go back in time to determine where streams used to be would be \nnear impossible. I don't want West Virginia cities to have to worry \nabout the status of their municipal infrastructure.\n  There is no question that with the additional permitting and \nregulatory requirements, the implementation of this rule will place a \nsignificant burden on West Virginia's economy, which is already hurting \nvery badly. That includes businesses, manufacturing, housing, and \nenergy production. Many in my home State are already struggling to make \nends meet. We are one of the highest unemployment States, have been hit \nharder than any other State. We are fighting like the dickens. We will \ncontinue to fight and persevere.\n  The new financial and regulatory burdens will set people up for \nfailure in an already unstable economic climate which in large part is \ncaused by harmful regulations the EPA and the administration have \nestablished. We all want to drink clean water and breathe clean air, \nbut we can achieve this without regulating hard-working Americans out \nof business.\n  This rule represents broad overreach that has the force of law \nwithout congressional approval. I would say you cannot regulate what \nhas not been legislated. Why are we here? Why are we elected to \nrepresent the people when we cannot even do it, when we have to fight \nour own government to do the job we have been charged with doing?\n  I urge my colleagues to support this motion to proceed to S. 1140.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, Boston's sports teams have had their share \nof great moments. After a win, you can hear the crowd celebrating by \nsinging a song by the Standells that goes like this:\n\n     Yeah, down by the river,\n     Down by the banks of the river Charles.\n     Well I love that dirty water,\n     Oh, Boston, you're my home.\n\n  While dirty water signals a win for a Boston team when that is sung, \nthe real victory has been beating the pollution in the Charles River \nand Boston Harbor since the passage of the Clean Water Act. That \nvictory is thanks to the implementation of that law, which protects \nsources of our drinking water from pollution and restores dirty waters \nback to health.\n  We need to keep the Clean Water Act's winning streak alive. \nUnfortunately, the bill the Senate may consider today could end the \nrecord of wins for the Clean Water Act. Its history of success has made \nthe Clean Water Act one of the greatest American success stories. \nBefore the Clean Water Act, there was no Federal authority to limit \ndumping, set national water quality standards, or enforce pollution \nrules. City and household waste flowed untreated into rivers and \nharmful chemicals were poured into wetlands and streams from factories \nand powerplants. Back then, we were all on the honor system. Water \nsupplies were managed by a patchwork of State laws and an appeal to the \ncommon good. The result: mass pollution on a historic scale, oozing \nrivers so toxic that they could ignite into flames, fish dead by the \nthousands. America's riversides became a theater of public hazards and \nchemical death.\n  In short, before the Clean Water Act and the Federal involvement that \nwas necessary, America's waterways were its sewers. Then, in 1969, a \npublic firestorm was touched off by a Time magazine photo of the \nCuyahoga River on fire in Ohio. With full-throated support from the \npublic, Congress mobilized and produced the Clean Water Act, one of the \nmost important pieces of environmental law in the history of the United \nStates. The ultimate goal of the Clean Water Act--making waterways safe \nfor the public and wildlife--was so popular that in 1972 a bipartisan \nCongress overrode a veto by Richard Nixon.\n  The successes and the benefits yielded by the pursuit of the goal of \nclean waterways would prove tremendous in the years ahead.\n  The Clean Water Act guards the Nation's natural sources of drinking \nwater by guiding how we use them. It protects the wetlands, the \nstreams, and other surface waters that ultimately provide us with \ndrinking water.\n  The Clean Water Act has slowed the loss of wetlands, known as the \n``kidneys of the landscape'' because of their ability to remove \npollution from the water. They do this for free, making wetlands the \nmost fiscally responsible water system in the world. The only \nalternative to this free service is to put our waters on dialysis by \nconstructing filtration plants for billions of dollars in long-term \nmaintenance and building costs. Our wetlands support the $6.6\n\n[[Page S7694]]\n\ntrillion coastal economy of the United States, which comprises about \nhalf of the Nation's entire gross domestic production and includes our \nnearly $7 billion annual fishery industry and $2.3 billion recreational \nindustry.\n  The Clean Water Act has doubled the number of swimmable and fishable \nrivers in the United States. It has saved billions of tons of fertile \nsoil from being washed off of our farms. It has fostered State and \nFederal collaboration, giving States a key role in managing poisonous \nrunoffs from cities and farms. It established a permitting system to \ncontrol what gets dumped into America's waterways. It developed fair \nand objective technology-based pollution control standards to help \nindustries plan their compliance investments in advance. It sets \nscience-based water quality standards and requires well-thought-out \nplans to meet them. Its environmental monitoring requirements prevent \nrehabilitated waterways from backsliding into unusable condition. It \nprovides $2 billion annually in critical funding to States for water \nquality and infrastructure improvements. Among its most important \ncontributions, it empowers citizens to enforce its provisions and \nactively guard the health of their families.\n  For all of its benefits and successes, however, the Clean Water Act \nhas still not reached it goal. One-third of our rivers still have too \nmuch pollution. When these drain into coastal waters, they add to the \nproblems being caused by ocean acidification and warming. The pollution \ncan cause dead zones off of our coasts and in the Great Lakes, putting \ndrinking water supplies at risk and threatening sea life. While the act \nhas slowed their loss, wetlands continue to disappear, and gone with \nthem are millions of wetland-dependent creatures, such as ducks and \nturtles and most of the species of fish we find on our plates.\n  Clearly, clean water must be preserved for the health of the public, \nthe environment, and the economy. That is why the Environmental \nProtection Agency and the Army Corps have spent so much time developing \nthe recently finalized clean water rule. The clean water rule clears up \nconfusion caused by two U.S. Supreme Court rulings on the reach of \nFederal water pollution laws and restores protections that were \neliminated for thousands of wetlands by President George W. Bush in his \nadministration.\n  Specifically, the rule revises the definition of ``waters of the \nUnited States,'' a term that identifies which waters and wetlands are \nprotected under the Clean Water Act. The rule was written in response \nto requests for increased predictability and consistency of Clean Water \nAct permitting programs made by stakeholders such as the National \nAssociation of Home Builders and the National Stone, Sand & Gravel \nAssociation.\n  The clean water rule restores clear protections to 60 percent of the \nNation's streams and millions of acres of wetlands that were stripped \naway under the previous Republican administration. The EPA estimates \nthat returning the clean water protections will provide roughly half a \nbillion dollars in annual public benefits, including reducing flooding \ndamage, filtering pollution, supporting over 6 million jobs in the over \nhalf-a-trillion-dollar outdoor recreation industry.\n  The rule protects public health by closing pollution loopholes that \nthreaten drinking water supplies to one-third of Americans. In \nMassachusetts, the drinking water of nearly 3 in 4 people will now be \nprotected.\n  The rule enjoys broad support from local governments, small \nbusinesses, scientists, and the general public, who submitted over \n800,000 favorable public comments. Eighty percent of Americans support \nthe clean water rule, and when asked if Congress should allow it to go \nforward, they responded with a resounding yes.\n  Despite public support for clean water and this commonsense rule, the \nRepublicans want to bring a bill to the floor that would undermine the \nnational goals and policy written by the Clean Water Act. If enacted, \nthis water-polluting bill would undermine the legal framework that \nprotects our water. It would once again leave one-third of the Nation's \ndrinking water vulnerable to dangerous contamination. It would set up a \nfight over technical details that would prevent us from protecting the \npublic health by preventing the dumping of toxic chemicals into natural \npublic drinking water sources.\n  The critics falsely claim that the clean water rule overreaches \nbecause it enables broader Federal jurisdiction than is consistent with \nlaw and science.\n  So, ladies and gentlemen, I support the work the EPA and the Army \nCorps have done in putting together the clean water rule. It will \ncontinue the string of victories our Nation has enjoyed under the Clean \nWater Act. I urge my colleagues to oppose any legislative efforts to \noverturn the clean water rule. We need to keep the Clean Water Act \nworking for all of America.\n  I want to make sure that the only place in Massachusetts people are \ntalking about dirty water is after one of our great Boston sports teams \nhave chalked up another victory. That is the only time we should be \nsinging about dirty water because otherwise the health and well-being \nnot just of people in Massachusetts but all across our country will be \nharmed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, listening to this, you would think that \npeople who want some commonsense regulation don't believe in clean \nwater. You would think that if we do this, somehow the Charles River or \nthe Cuyahoga River, having been navigable the whole while here under \nthe Clean Water Act jurisdiction, would suddenly not be navigable. That \nis not the case. That is not the case. I think it is really important \nthat we ratchet down the emotion and we start looking at the facts.\n  Let's start with where we are right now with this idea of what are, \nin fact, jurisdictional waters under the Clean Water Act. This has been \na debate for 40 years. It has been in and out of the courts for 40 \nyears. In 1985 the Court made a ruling. In 2001 the Court made a \nruling. In 2006 the Court decided a case called Rapanos. What Rapanos \nsaid is--four Justices said EPA is right, four Justices said EPA is \nwrong, and one Justice said EPA may be right. As a result, we have \ncreated a system that has caused great uncertainty in America today as \nit relates to how we use land. Acting on that uncertainty, EPA \npromulgated a rule. That rule is inconsistent, in my opinion, with the \ndirection they were given by the Court. That rule has created an \nincredible amount of uncertainty.\n  To suggest that all the major ag groups, all the groups that are out \nthere, including the Association of Counties, including many of the \nGovernors, are all wrong and they all love dirty water is absolutely \ninsulting as we kind of move forward on this discussion.\n  I am going to show you why North Dakota is concerned about this \nregulation. This is an aerial picture of my State. You may not think \nthere is a lot of water in North Dakota. This is a picture of my State \nand Devils Lake in the Devils Lake area. You might say: Oh she picked a \npicture that looks like this.\n  I ask and invite any of you to come to North Dakota and I will fly \nyou anywhere in North Dakota. This is what North Dakota looks like. You \nsee all this water here and you see all this water here and you see \nthis. Do you see that? That is a pothole, what we call a prairie \npothole. It used to be and seasonally is full of water. Sometimes it is \nfarm, sometimes it is not. Is this waters of the United States? It is \nnot connected to any navigable stream. It is not adjacent to any kind \nof navigable water, moving water. None of this is connected with any \nkind of cross-land connection.\n  I will tell you under the rule that we have and under the \ninterpretations of the Corps of Engineers--which we always forget when \nwe are talking about this--the Corps of Engineers and EPA, what they \nwould say is: We don't know. We would have to send biologists to take a \nlook at this. We would have to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars, \nof taxpayer dollars, to determine whether in fact there is substantial \nnexus.\n  We asked for a simple rule. First, just as a point of view, when the \nstatute says navigable water, that water ought to be moving someplace \nother than into the ground. All water in the\n\n[[Page S7695]]\n\nworld is interconnected. We know that. That is a matter of hydrology. \nThat is a matter of science. Scientists would say there is no such \nthing as a discrete separation.\n  But you know what. Legally there is. It did not say every drop of \nwater is controlled by the Environmental Protection Agency under the \nClean Water Act, it said navigable water, and we have been in this \nfight for a lot of years, including 2006.\n  Mr. President, I know we are in excess of the time. I ask unanimous \nconsent for just a little more time to conclude my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. I want to make this point because it really is a \nquestion. The Senators who have come to the floor and talked about this \nrule talk about: Look, we are making progress. What they haven't told \nyou is that rule has absolutely no legal effect anywhere in this \ncountry today. Do you know why? Because the courts of the United States \nhave stayed it. It is not in effect while we litigate yet another case.\n  So when we looked at this problem and we looked at trying to give \ncertainty to farmers who own this land--by the way, this land is not \nowned by the people of this country. This land is owned by farmers who \nneed certainty, who need to know. So we looked at this and we said: It \nis time for Congress to do what Congress ought to do, which is to \nlegislate, which is to actually make a decision--to not just get on \neither side of a regulatory agency and yell about whether they are \nright or wrong but actually engage in a dialogue.\n  That is why Senator Donnelly, Senator Barrasso, Senator Inhofe, and I \nsat down and said: Look, this will continue in perpetuity. We will \nspend millions of dollars litigating this and never get an answer \nbecause chances are we are back to 441, and that is not an answer.\n  So we put together a piece of legislation looking at how can we as \nlegislators, as Congress provide some parameters on what this means. \nPeople who will vote no on a motion to proceed will tell you we want \nEPA to decide. I am telling you that people in this country expect \nCongress to decide. They expect Congress to make this decision, to step \nup, and resolve this controversy because 40 years and millions and \nmillions of dollars spent in litigation is not a path forward.\n  As we look at this legislation simply on a motion to proceed on one \nof the most controversial issues in America today--which is waters of \nthe United States--not voting to debate this issue, not voting to \nproceed on this issue is the wrong path forward.\n  I urge my colleagues to open the debate and let's talk about this \nmap--not the Charles River and not the Cuyahoga River because I will \nconcede that they are navigable water. I want to know in what world is \nthis navigable water of the United States, what world should EPA have \njurisdiction over this pond, and in what world--when you are the farmer \nwho owns it--do you think you have any certainty as we move forward?\n  We are trying to give certainty to the American taxpayer. We are \ntrying to give certainty to people who build roads and bridges. We are \ntrying to actually have a debate on an important issue of our time.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote yes on the motion to proceed so we can \nhave an open debate--it could be fun--as we talk about this issue.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President we will have a chance at 2:15 p.m., I \nbelieve, for 15 minutes to close the debate, and at 2:30 p.m. we are \ngoing to have a vote on a cloture motion. I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst the cloture motion.\n  I agree with my friend Senator Heitkamp that we need certainty. We \nhave been debating this issue for a long time since the court cases. If \nthis bill were to become law, you are not going to have certainty. It \nis going to be litigated. Whatever is done, it is going to be \nlitigated. We know that. We have seen the litigious nature of what has \nhappened over the course of the issues.\n  Yes, I want Congress to speak on this. Congress has spoken on this. \nCongress has said very clearly that we want the test of the Clean Water \nAct to be to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and \nbiological integrity of our Nation's waters.\n  I don't want Congress to say: No, we don't want that. We now want a \npragmatic test that could very well jeopardize the Clean Water Act. The \nbottom line is each Congress should want to strengthen the Clean Water \nAct, not weaken it. This bill would weaken the Clean Water Act and \nprevent a rule that has been debated for a long time from becoming law.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the motion for cloture, and we will \nhave a little bit more to say about this at 2:15 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nmandatory quorum call under rule XXII be waived with respect to the \ncloture vote on the motion to proceed to S. 1140.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/03/senate-section/article/S7695-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until 2:30 \np.m. will be equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today as the Senate considers an \nissue that is critically--critically--important to agriculture and to \nrural America.\n  It is my hope the Senate will advance landmark legislation that I, \nalong with a bipartisan group of colleagues, have introduced in \nresponse to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's final rule that \nredefines waters of the United States--commonly referred to in farm \ncountry as WOTUS, among other acronyms--under the Clean Water Act. I am \nproud to be an original cosponsor of S. 1140 and represent agriculture \nand rural America's charge in pushing back against EPA's egregious \nFederal overregulation.\n  EPA's final WOTUS rule would adversely impact a vast cross-section of \nindustries, including agriculture. As I have said before, I fear the \nsheer number of regulations imposed by this administration is causing \nthe public to lose faith in our government. Too often I hear from my \nconstituents that they feel ``ruled'' and not ``governed.'' S. 1140 is \nin response to exactly that sentiment.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, \nI have heard directly from farmers, ranchers, State agency officials, \nand various industries in Kansas and all throughout our country that \nultimately would be subject to these new burdensome and costly Federal \nrequirements. The message is unanimous and clear. This is the wrong \napproach and the wrong rule for agriculture, rural America, and our \nsmall communities.\n  According to the Kansas Department of Agriculture, EPA's final rule \nwould expand the number of water bodies in Kansas classified as \n``waters of the United States,'' subject to all--subject to all--Clean \nWater Act programs and requirements by 460 percent, totaling 170,000 \nstream miles. This is just incredulous. The expanded scope will further \nexacerbate the burden of duplicative pesticide permitting requirements \nand the other overregulation by this administration. This simply is not \ngoing to work and makes zero sense, especially in places such as arid \nwestern Kansas. Furthermore, the final rule undercuts a State's \nsovereign ability as\n\n[[Page S7696]]\n\nthe primary regulator of water resources, which administers and carries \nout Clean Water Act programs.\n  Even more troubling, in recent months it has become apparent through \nthe release of internal government documents between the EPA and the \nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers that there are serious concerns and \nquestions with regard to the legality of the EPA's role and actions \nduring the famous or infamous public comment period to garner support \nfor the final rule. The tactics employed by the EPA throughout this \nrulemaking process completely undermines the integrity of the \ninteragency review process and the public's trust.\n  The EPA claims they have listened to farmers and ranchers about the \nconcerns they have raised. EPA not only stacked the deck against \nfarmers and ranchers, but EPA deliberately ignored them. This bill \nrequires the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers to withdraw the final \nrule and craft a new rule in meaningful consultation with stakeholders, \nState partners, and regulated entities, which are ready and waiting to \nwork with EPA--if we can.\n  All of us want to protect clean water. No one here--especially \nagriculture--wants to threaten such a valuable and integral natural \nresource that sustains our livelihood. It is our water. It is time the \nadministration listened and developed a rule that is effective for \nfarmers, ranchers, and rural America.\n  This WOTUS regulation is the No. 1 concern I hear about in farm \ncountry--that the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry \nhears about--and over 90 agriculture groups--90--have signed a letter \nin support of this legislation. Additionally, the ongoing litigation, \nwhich involves 31 States challenging the final rule, only adds further \nconfusion about the implementation and applicability of the final rule \nacross the rest of the country.\n  It is time for Congress to intervene. I thank my colleagues who have \njoined me in this effort, especially the Senator from Wyoming, and I \nurge all of my colleagues to support S. 1140 and vote yes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to a real champion of \nclean water in the United States, Senator Boxer.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank very much my colleague and \nsubcommittee ranking member, Senator Ben Cardin, for taking the lead \ntoday on this opposition we are expressing to a very radical bill that \nwill essentially, in my view, in many ways repeal the heart of the \nClean Water Act.\n  The Clean Water Act came about because the Cuyahoga River in Ohio \nwent up in flames because there was so much pollution and there were so \nmany toxins in the water there, and people recognized--this was in the \n1970s--that we were endangering our families and the health of our \nfamilies. So the Clean Water Act was written, and it basically said \nthat if a river or a stream or a body of water found its way into a \nsource of drinking water or a recreational body of water, the people \nwho were dumping this stuff into this natural environment had to get a \npermit and had to show us that it was safe. It is as simple as that.\n  That is why we have overwhelming support. I had a chart, and now I \ndon't have it, reflecting 79 percent in support across this Nation for \nmoving ahead with the clean water rule. Then comes the Barrasso bill, \nwhich has a beautiful name--protecting the waters of the United \nStates--and it reminds me of the book ``1984'': War is peace, love is \nhate, and the rest. Big government is telling you what to think.\n  Really, this is not a bill that protects our water. It is not. It is \na bill that essentially protects polluters and endangers 117 million \npeople who want to drink clean water. This is a right in our country. \nYou don't want to be frightened when your child swims in a stream or \ndrinks water that might make him or her sick.\n  So what we do with this bill, what Senator Barrasso, my friend--and \nhe is my really good friend--does here is essentially to take the Clean \nWater Act and stands it on its head. He says we are not going to worry \nabout all of these bodies of water that feed into the Nation's drinking \nwater supply for 117 million people, and we are going to say you are \nfree to dump into that water everything you want.\n  In closing, I have often said that when I go home, people come right \nup to me and say: Barbara, you need to do this; and, Barbara, you have \nto fight for that. Never, in all my years in elected life--40 years \nsince I started, which is hard to believe--has anyone come up to me and \nsaid: The water is too pure. The water is too clean. My drinking water \nis perfect, don't make it safer. My air is pristine; don't pass any \nmore laws. It is the opposite.\n  So what this would do today is take us back, back, back--back to the \ndays when rivers caught on fire, back to the days when you worried a \nlot about drinking water. And as a person who wrote the law on \nprotecting the quality of drinking water for children, this is a step \nbackward. It is all about the farm bureau. And I get it, but I don't \nthink they really understand the rule that is coming out, where \nmillions of people actually commented on the rule, where they had \nhundreds of meetings. This is an EPA that wants to work with the \npeople.\n  So I hope we will reject this and that we can move on and let this \nclean water rule work its way through the courts and become the law of \nthe land.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, with this vote on the motion to proceed \nto S. 1140, the Federal Water Quality Protection Act, the Senate really \nhas a unique opportunity today to pass a strong bipartisan bill--a bill \nthat will direct the EPA to write a reasonable rule to protect our \nnavigable waterways.\n  As I mentioned before, I introduced this legislation with my \nDemocratic colleagues Senators Donnelly, Heitkamp, and Manchin, as well \nas many of my Republican colleagues. I appreciate all my colleagues who \nspoke out in favor of this legislation.\n  Let me just conclude this discussion with these thoughts. Our \nbeautiful rivers and lakes deserve protection, and this bill does \nnothing to block legitimate efforts to safeguard the waters of the \nUnited States. By striking the right balance, we will restore \nWashington's attention to the country's traditional waterways, \nprotecting these cherished natural resources. At the same time, we will \ngive certainty to farmers, ranchers, and small business owners that \nthey can use their property reasonably without fear of constant \nWashington intervention.\n  The existing rule on waters of the United States is the poster child \nof EPA overreach. The courts have already begun to weigh in with their \nconcerns and have stayed the rule nationally. There is a great legal \nuncertainty about whether this waters of the United States rule will \nsurvive these legal challenges. These challenges could take years. \nMeanwhile, a long-term viable solution to protecting our waterways will \nnot be in place.\n  Now, many of my colleagues, both Democratic and Republican--and \nparticularly those from rural States--have talked about their concern \nwith this rule, so I urge them to join with us today by showing their \nconstituents they are ready to do something about it. I urge them to \nvote for this motion to proceed to S. 1140 and to work with me through \nan open amendment process to create an even better bill--a better \nbipartisan bill and a bill that gives the EPA the certainty they need \nto craft a rule to protect our Nation's waterways for the long term.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote on the motion to proceed to S. 1140.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, this legislation does two things. First, \nit stops the final rule on the waters of the United States, and second, \nit weakens the underlying Clean Water Act, something I would hope none \nof us would want to do. I urge my colleagues to reject the motion to \nproceed.\n  Let me tell you what is at risk here. What is at risk is about one-\nhalf of our Nation's stream miles from being protected under the Clean \nWater Act. Their water supply would not be protected. What is at stake \nhere? Twenty million acres of wetlands could go unprotected because of \nbeing denied protection under the Clean Water Act. What is at risk \nhere? The water supply\n\n[[Page S7697]]\n\nfor 117 million Americans--1 out of every 3 Americans. The source of \ntheir water could very well come from unregulated supplies being exempt \nfrom the Clean Water Act. I don't think we want to do that.\n  I agree with my colleagues that we want to have certainty. That is \nwhy we want the rule to move forward. But it does more than that--the \nunderlying bill. It also changes the standard that would be judged in \ndeciding what is to be regulated waters. The current law says it is to \n``restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity \nof the Nation's waters.''\n  In other words, it is science-based. If we need to regulate in order \nto protect our water supply, we can regulate. That is what we are \ntrying to achieve--regulating waters that end up in our streams, waters \nthat end up in our water supply. If, on the other hand, we take what is \nbeing done under this legislation to protect traditional navigable \nwaters from pollution, we are exempting so many of the waters that are \ncritically important. I mentioned a little earlier that it has to have \na continuous flow. Well, there are seasonal variations of what enters \ninto our water supply in this country. That would be exempt.\n  I want to dispel two things. First, this bill would remove certainty, \nnot give certainty. The Supreme Court cases caused us to lose our \ntraditional definitions of what was covered under the Clean Water Act. \nWe need that. It returns certainty, which I think is in everyone's \ninterest. The last point is--and I have said it many times, and the \nDepartment has confirmed this--this final rule on waters of the United \nStates does not change the regulatory structure for permitting for \nagriculture. There are no additional requirements. They are exempt. The \nexemptions that exist today will continue to be exempt. The agency \nresponded to the concerns of the agricultural community as they should.\n  The bottom line is that clean water and agriculture go together, and \nwe all need to work together in that regard. So I urge my colleagues to \nallow this rule to go forward. I urge my colleagues not to have a \nlegacy of weakening our protections for clean water in America, and \nthat is what this bill would do.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before \nthe Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 153, S. 1140, a bill to require the \n     Secretary of the Army and the Administrator of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency to propose a regulation \n     revising the definition of the term ``waters of the United \n     States,'' and for other purposes.\n         Mitch McConnell, Dean Heller, Jeff Flake, Steve Daines, \n           Johnny Isakson, Mike Rounds, Ben Sasse, Roy Blunt, \n           Daniel Coats, John Cornyn, John Boozman, Richard Burr, \n           Cory Gardner, Shelley Moore Capito, Richard C.

Mr. President, I rise to speak from the floor for the \nfirst time. I have never been in politics before, and I intentionally \nwaited to speak here.\n  I wish to talk about the historic purposes and uses of the Senate, \nabout the decades-long decline of the legislature relative to the \nexecutive branch, and about what baby steps toward institutional \nrecovery might look like.\n  Before doing so, let me explain briefly why I chose to wait a year \nsince election day before beginning to fully engage in floor debate. I \nhave done two things in my adult work life. I am a historian by \ntraining and a strategy guy by vocation. Before becoming a college \npresident, I helped over a dozen organizations through some very ugly \nstrategic crises, and one important lesson I have learned again and \nagain when you walk into any broken organization is that there is a \nvery delicate balance between expressing human empathy on the one hand \nand not becoming willing to passively sweep hard\n\n[[Page S7698]]\n\ntruths under the rug on the other. It is essential to listen first, to \nask questions first, and to learn how a broken institution got to where \nit is because there are reasons. People very rarely try to break \nspecial institutions that they inherit. Things fray and break for \nreasons.\n  Still, empathy cannot change the reality that a bankrupt company is \ncosting more to produce its products than customers are willing to pay \nfor them, that a college that has too few students is out not only of \nmoney but out of spirit. This is the two-part posture I have tried to \nadopt during my rookie year here. Because of this goal of empathetic \nlistening first and interviewing first and because of a pledge I made \nto Nebraskans--in deference to an old Senate decision--last year I have \nwaited.\n  Please do not misunderstand. Do not confuse a deliberate approach \nwith passivity. I ran because I think the public is right that we are \nnot confronting the generational challenges we face. We do not have a \nforeign policy strategy for the age of jihad and cyber war, and our \nentitlement budgeting is entirely fake. We are entering an age where \nwork and jobs will be more fundamentally disrupted than at any point in \nhuman history since hunter-gatherers first settled in agrarian \nvillages, and yet we do not have many plans. I think the public is \nright that the Congress is not adequately shepherding our Nation into \nthe serious debates we should be having about the future of this great \nNation.\n  I will outline the key observations from my interviews with many of \nmy Senate colleagues in summary form on another day, but for now let me \nflag just the painful top-line takeaway. I don't think anyone in this \nbody truly believes we are laser-focused on the greatest challenges our \nNation faces--no one. Some of us lament this fact, some of us are \nangered by this fact, some of us are resigned to it, some try to \ndispassionately explain how we got to the place where we are, but I \ndon't think anyone actually disputes it.\n  If I can be brutally honest for a moment, I am home basically every \nweekend, and what I hear every weekend, I think, are most of the same \nthings most all of my colleagues hear every weekend, which is some \nversion of this: a pox on both parties and all of your houses. We don't \nbelieve that the politicians are even trying to solve the great \nproblems we face--the generational problems.\n  To the Republicans, those of us who would claim that the new majority \nis leading the way, few people believe it. To the grandstanders who \nwould try to use this institution chiefly just as a platform for \noutside pursuits, few believe that the country's needs are as important \nto you as your own ambitions.\n  To the Democrats who did this body great harm through nuclear \ntactics, few believe that bare-knuckled politics are a substitute for \nprincipled governing.\n  Who among us doubts that many--both on the right and on the left--are \nnow salivating for more of these radical tactics? The people despise us \nall.\n  Why is this? Because we are not doing our job. We are not doing the \nprimary things that the people sent us here to do. We are not tackling \nthe great national problems that worry our bosses at home. I therefore \npropose a thought experiment. If the Senate isn't going to be the venue \nfor addressing our biggest national problems, where should we tell \npeople that venue is? Where should they look for long-term national \nprioritization if it doesn't happen on this floor? To ask it more \ndirectly of ourselves, Would anything really be lost if the Senate \ndidn't exist?\n  To be clear, this is a thought experiment, and I think that many \ngreat things would be lost if the Senate didn't exist, if our Federal \nGovernment didn't have the benefit of this body, but game out with me \nthe question of why. What precisely would be lost if we only had a \nHouse of Representatives, a simple majoritarian body instead of both \nbodies? The growth of the administrative state, the fourth branch of \ngovernment, is increasingly hollowing out the Senate and the entire \narticle I branch, the legislature. Oddly, many in the Congress have \nbeen complicit in this hollowing out of our own powers. Would anything \nreally be lost if we doubled down on Woodrow Wilson's obsession and \ninclination toward greater efficiency in government, his desire to \nremove more of the clunkiness of the legislative process? What would be \nlost? We could approach this thought experiment from the inside out and \nask: What is unique about the Senate? What can this body do \nparticularly well? What are the essential characteristics of just this \nplace, which has often been called the gem of the Founders' structure. \nWhat was the Senate built for? Let's consider its attributes.\n  We have 6-year terms, not 2-year terms, and the Founders actually \ndeliberated about whether Senators should have lifetime appointments. \nWe have proportional representation of States, not of census counts, \nreflecting a Federalist concern that we would always maintain a \ndistinction between perhaps agreeing that government has a \nresponsibility to address certain problems and yet guarding against a \nroutinized assumption that only a centralized, nationalized, one-size-\nfits-all government could tackle X or Y.\n  Third, we have rules designed to empower individual Senators, not to \nthe end of obstruction but for the purpose of ensuring full debate and \nengagement with dissenting points of views, for the Founders didn't \nshare Wilson's concern with governmental efficiency, they were \npreoccupied with protecting minority rights and culturally unpopular \nviews in this big and diverse Nation.\n  Fourth, we didn't even have any rules in this body that recognized \npolitical parties until the 1970s. There was merely an early 20th \ncentury convention that gave right of first recognition in floor debate \nto the leaders of the two largest voting blocks. We have explicit \nconstitutional duties related to providing the Executive with advice--\nit is a pretty nebulous thing--about building his or her human capital \nteam and about the long-term foreign policy trajectory of this Nation. \nSix-year terms, representation of States, not census counts, nearly \nlimitless debate to protect dissenting views, almost no formal rules \nfor political parties, what does all this add up to? What is the best \nanswer to the question, What is the Senate for?\n  Probably the best shorthand is this: to shield lawmakers from \nobsession with short-term popularity so we can focus on the biggest \nlong-term challenges we face.\n  Why does the Senate's character matter? Precisely because the Senate \nis built to insulate us from ``short-termism.'' That is the point of \nthe Senate. This is a place built to insulate us from opinion fads and \nfrom the bickering of 24-hour news cycles. That is the point of the \nSenate. The Senate is a place to focus on the biggest stuff. The Senate \nwas built to be the antidote to sound bites.\n  I have asked many of you what you think is wrong with the Senate. \nWhat is wrong with us? As in most struggling organizations, in private \nit is amazing how much common agreement there actually is. There is so \nmuch common agreement about what around here incentivizes short-term \nthinking and behavior over long-term thinking, behaving, and planning.\n  The incessant fundraising, the ubiquity of cameras everywhere that we \ntalk, the normalization over the last decade of using many Senate rules \nas just shirts-and-skins exercises, the constant travel--again, \nfundraising--meaning, sadly, many families around here get ripped up. \nThat is one of the things we hear about most in private in this body. \nThis is not to suggest that there is unanimity among you in these \nprivate conversations. The divergence is actually most pronounced at \nthe question of what comes next and whether permanent institutional \ndecline is inevitable in this body. Some of you are hopeful for a \nrecovery of a vibrant institutional culture, but I think the majority \nof you, from my conversations, are pessimistic. The most common framing \nof this question or this worry is this: OK. So maybe this isn't the \nhigh moment in the history of the Senate, but isn't the dysfunction in \nhere merely an echo of the broader political polarization out there? It \nis an important question. Isn't the Senate broken merely because of a \nlarger shattered consensus of shared belief across 320 million people \nin this land? Surely that is part of the story, but there is much more \nto say.\n\n[[Page S7699]]\n\n  First, the political polarization beyond Washington is so often \noverstated. We could talk about the election of 1800, the runup to the \nCivil War, the response to Catholic immigration waves at the beginning \nof the last century, the bloodiest summers of the Civil Rights \nmovement, the experience of troops returning from Vietnam, if you want \nto mark some really high-water marks of political polarization in \nAmerican life.\n  Second, civic disengagement is arguably a much larger problem than \npolitical polarization. It isn't so much that most regular folks we run \ninto back home are really locked into predictably Republican and \npredictably Democratic positions on every issue, it is that they tuned \nus out altogether. Despite the echo chambers of those of us who have \nthese jobs, are we aware that according to the Pew Research Center, the \n24-hour viewership of CNN, FOX, and MSNBC is about 2 million. That is \nit.\n  Third, one of our jobs is to flesh out competing views with such \nseriousness and respect that we, the 100 of us, should be mitigating, \nnot exacerbating, the polarization that does exist. This is one of the \nreasons we have a representative rather than a direct democracy.\n  Fourth, surveys reveal that the public is actually much more \ndissatisfied with us than they are even scared about the intractability \nof the big problems we face. Consider the contrast. Somewhere between \ntwo-thirds and three-quarters of the country think the Nation is on a \nbad track; that the experiences of their kids and grandkids will be \nless than the experience of their parents and grandparents. That is \nbad. Consider this: Only 1-in-10 of them is comforted that we are here \ndoing these jobs.\n  Let's be very clear what this means. If the American people were \nactually given a choice to decide whether to fire all 100 of us and all \n535 people in the Congress, do any of us doubt at all what they would \ndo?\n  There are good and bad reasons to be unpopular. A good reason would \nbe to suffer for waging an honorable fight for the long term that has \nnear-term political downsides, like telling seniors the truth that the \namount they have paid in for Social Security and Medicare is far less \nthan they think and far less than they are currently receiving. That \nwould be a good reason to be unpopular, but deep down we all know the \nreal reason the political class is unpopular is not because of our \nrelentless truth-telling but because of politicians' habit of \nregularized pandering to those who most easily already agree with us.\n  The sound-bite culture, whether in our standups for 90-second TV in \nthe Russell rotunda or our press releases or what we all experienced on \nour campaigns--both for and against--the sound-bite culture is \neverywhere around us. We understand that, but do we also understand and \naffirm in this body that this place was built expressly to combat that \nkind of reductionism, that short-termism?\n  The Senate is a word with two meanings. It is the 100 of us as a \ncommunity, as a group, as a body--that is an important metaphor--and it \nis this room. This is the Chamber where we assemble supposedly to \ndebate the really big things. What happens in this Chamber now is what \nis most disheartening to a newbie like me. As our constituents know, \nsomething is awry here. We, in recent decades--again, this is a body \nand not just us but what we have inherited--have allowed short-termism \nand the sound-bite culture to invade this Chamber and to reduce so many \nof our debates to fact-free zones.\n  I mentioned that I have done two kinds of work before coming here. I \nwas a historian/college president and crisis turnaround guy. Although \nthey sound very different, they actually have a lot of similarities \nbecause they are both driven by a kind of deliberation, a Socratic \nspeech.\n  Good history is good storytelling, and good storytelling demands \nempathy. It requires understanding different actors, differing \nmotivations, and competing goals. Reducing everything immediately to \ngood versus evil is bad history--not only because it isn't true and \nbecause it is unpersuasive but because it is really boring. Good \nhistory, on the other hand, demands that one be able to talk \nSocratically so you can present alternate viewpoints, not straw-man \narguments, and explain how people got to where they are.\n  Similarly, can you imagine a business strategist who presents just \none idea and immediately announces that it is the only right idea, the \nonly plausible idea, and every other idea is both stupid and wicked? \nHow would companies respond to such a strategist? They would fire him. \nA good strategist, by contrast, puts the best construction on a whole \nrange of scenarios, outlines the best criticisms of each option, \nespecially including the option you plan to argue for most \npassionately, and then you assume that your competitors will upgrade \ntheir game in response to your opening moves. This is a kind of \nSocratic speech. But bizarrely, we don't do that very much around here. \nWe don't have many actual debates.\n  This is a place that would be difficult today to describe as the \ngreatest deliberative body in the world, something that was true \nthrough much of our history. Socrates said it is dishonorable to make \nthe lesser argument appear the greater or to take someone else's \nargument and distort it so that you don't have to engage their \nstrongest points. Yet here, on this floor, we regularly devolve into a \nbizarre politician speech. We hear the robotic recitation of talking \npoints.\n  Well, guess what. Normal people don't talk like this. They don't like \nthat we do, and more important than whether or not they like us, they \ndon't trust our government because we do.\n  It is weird, because one-on-one, when the cameras are off, hardly \nanyone around here really thinks the Senators from the other party are \nevil or stupid or bribed. There is actually a great deal of human \naffection around here, but again, it is private, when the cameras \naren't on.\n  Perhaps I should pause and acknowledge that I am really uncomfortable \nwith this as an opening speech. It is awkward, and I recognize that \ntalking honestly about the recovery of more honest Socratic debate runs \nthe risk of being written off as being overly romantic and naively \nidealistic. To add to the discomfort, I am brand new to politics, 99th \nin seniority, and occasionally mistaken for a page. But talking bluntly \nabout what is not working in the Senate in recent decades--not just \nthis year or last year--but talking bluntly about what is not working \naround here is not naive idealism; it is aspirational realism. Here is \nwhy. I think that a cultural recovery inside this body is a partial \nprerequisite for a national recovery.\n  I don't think that generational problems such as the absence of a \nlong-term strategy for combatting jihad and cyber war, such as telling \nthe truth about entitlement overpromising, and such as developing new \nhuman capital and job retraining strategies for an era of much more \nrapid job change than our Nation has ever known--I don't think that \nlong-term problems such as these are solvable without a functioning \nSenate. And a functioning Senate is a place that rejects short-termism, \nboth in substance and in tone.\n  The Senate has always had problems. This is a body made up of sinful \nhuman beings, but we haven't always had today's problems. There have \nbeen glorious high points in the Senate. There have been times when \nthis place has flourished, and I believe a healthier Senate is possible \nagain. But it will require models and guides.\n  To that end, I have been reflecting on three towering figures over \nthe last half-century who used this floor quite differently than we \nusually use it today, and who thereby have much to teach us. Before \nnaming them, let me clarify my purpose. I don't think there is a magic \nbullet to the restoration of the Senate. My purpose in speaking today \nis really just to move into public conversations I have been having \nwith lots of you in private as I try to define a personal strategy for \nhow to use the floor. I want advice, and I am opening a conversation on \nhow to contribute to the broader theme. There are many of you here who \nwant an upgrading of our debate, of the culture, of the prioritization, \nand of our seriousness of what are truly the biggest long-term \nchallenges we face.\n  Two weeks ago, in a discussion with one of you about these problems, \nI was asked: So you are going to admit our institutional brokenness and \nissue a call for more civility? No. While I am in favor of more \ncivility, my actual call here is for more substance. This is\n\n[[Page S7700]]\n\nnot a call for less fighting. This is a call for more meaningful \nfighting. This is a call for bringing our A game to the biggest debates \nabout the biggest issues facing our people and with much less regard \nfor 24-month election cycles and 24-hour news cycles. This is a call to \nbe for things that are big enough that you might risk your reelection \nover.\n\n  So let's name the three folks who have something on which to instruct \nus because they brought a larger approach to the floor.\n  First, I sit quite intentionally at Daniel Patrick Moynihan's desk. \nThe New Yorker who cast a big shadow around here for a quarter century \nfamously cautioned that each of us is entitled to our own opinions, but \nwe are most certainly not entitled to our own set of facts. He read \nsocial science prolifically and sought constantly to bring data to bear \non the debates in this Chamber. Like any genuinely curious person, he \nasked a lot of questions. So you couldn't automatically know what \npolicy he might ultimately advocate for because he asked hard questions \nof everyone. He had the capacity to surprise people. We should do that.\n  Second, in a time when circling partisan wagons and castigating the \nopposing party feels reflexively easy, we can all benefit from reading \nagain Margaret Chase Smith's heroic ``Declaration of Conscience'' \nspeech on this floor in June of 1950. The junior Senator from Maine was \na committed anti-Communist. She was also called the first female cold \nwarrior in the Nation. For her, that meant not knee-jerk opposition to \ncompeting views but rather the full-throated defense of what she called \n``Americanism.'' She defined it as ``the right to criticize; the right \nto hold unpopular beliefs; the right to protest; and the right of \nindependent thought.'' Senator Smith was rightly worried about Alger \nHiss and the infiltration of the State Department by actual Communist \nspies. This was actually happening. So for her, grandstanding and lazy \ncharacter smearing were not only dishonest, they were distracting and \ntherefore inherently dangerous. Thus, the freshman Senator--at this \npoint she was the only woman in the body--came to the floor to demand \npublicly what she repeatedly sought unsuccessfully in private from Joe \nMcCarthy. Was there any evidence for all of these scandalous claims? \nThink of that. As a committed truth-teller, she was willing to \nchallenge someone not just in her own party but someone with whom she \nhad lots of ideological alignment. She wanted to reject straw-man \narguments and disingenuous attacks. Because of that moment, 4 years \nlater the Senate would censure McCarthy and banish McCarthyist tactics \nfrom this floor.\n  Finally, and for my purposes today most importantly, I would like us \nto recall Robert Byrd, one of the larger figures in the two-and-a-half-\ncentury history of this body. As a historian, I have long been a \nstudent of the West Virginian, troubled though he was.\n  We sometimes conceive of our role today here as merely policy \nadvocates--as those who argue for our respective party's position on \nshort-term policy fights, and that is sometimes important, but that is \nonly one of our roles, for we don't have a parliamentary system and we \ndon't have one on purpose. With Moynihan and Margaret Chase Smith, we \nalso need to contextualize our debates about our largest national \nchallenges with facts and data. We need to agree on what problems we \nare trying to solve before we bicker about which programs would be more \nor less effective toward those ends. We need to challenge those in our \nown party not to construct straw-men arguments with those we are \ndebating. But there is something else we need as well.\n  Beyond policy advocating and policy clarifying, we need an \noverarching shared narrative of what America means. We need to pause to \nregularly recall the larger American principles that bind us together--\nour constitutional creed, our shared stories, and our exceptional \nAmerican commitment to a dream of life, liberty, and the pursuit of \nhappiness for all 320 million of our country men and women.\n  We all know in our marriages that sometimes the only way around a \nsmall disagreement is to pause to embrace again our larger shared \ncommitments and our history. We need more of that here. We need to be \nable to more often agree on some big things before we get to the work \nof honorably disagreeing about smaller things.\n  One of the important legacies of Senator Byrd--and again this is no \ncommentary on other aspects of his messy past--but one of the important \nlegacies of Senator Byrd is that he forced this Senate to grapple with \nour history, with the 100 of our specific duties, and with the unique \nplace in the architecture of Madisonian separation of powers that this \nbody and this body alone sets.\n  To return to our thought experiment, do we think the Founders would \nhave regarded a 9-percent congressional approval rating--a stunning \nlevel of distrust in representative government--do we think they would \nhave regarded that as an existential crisis? Is it conceivable we can \nget away with just drifting along like this or must we fix it? Count me \nemphatically among those who think we need to fix it. We should not be \nOK with this.\n  If we are going to restore this place, part of it will center on \nrecovering the executive-legislative distinction. The American people \nshould be demanding more of us as legislators, and they should be \ndemanding more of the next President as a competent administrator of \nthe laws that we pass. This is possible only if we again recover a \nsense of our identity that has some connection not just to Republican \nand Democrat but to the Constitution's article I legislative duties and \nsome tension on purpose with the duties of the article II executive \nbranch. Everything cannot be simply Republican versus Democrat. We need \nDemocrats who will stand up to a Democratic President who exceeds his \nor her power, and I promise you that I plan to speak up the next time a \nPresident of my party seeks to exceed his or her legitimate \nconstitutional powers.\n  Despite all of his other failings, Robert Byrd labored hard to mark \nthese nonpartisan lines, and we should too. To that end, in the coming \nmonths I plan a series of floor speeches on the historic growth of the \nadministrative state. This will not be a partisan effort. It will not \nbe a Republican Senator criticizing the current administration because \nit is Democratic. Rather, it will be a constructive attempt to try to \nunderstand how we got to the place where so much legislating now \nhappens inside the executive branch. Our Founders wouldn't be able to \nmake sense of the system we are living right now.\n  This kind of executive overreach came about partly because of a \nsymbiotic legislative underreach. Republicans and Democrats are both to \nblame for grabbing more power when they have the Presidency. \nRepublicans and Democrats are both to blame in this legislature for not \nwanting to take on hard issues and to lead through hard votes but \nrather to sit back and let successive Presidents gobble up more and \nmore power. We can and we must do better than this.\n  A century-long look at the growth of executive branch legislating \nover the next many months will be an attempt to contribute to the \nefforts of all here, both Republicans and Democrats, who want to see \nthe Senate recover some of its authorities and to recover some of its \ntrustworthiness in the eyes of the people for whom we work.\n  Each of us has an obligation to be able to answer this question: Why \ndoesn't Congress work and what is your plan for fixing the Senate? If \nyour only answer to this question is to blame the other party, then you \ndon't get it, and the American people think you are part of the \nproblem, not part of the solution.\n  This institution wasn't built for the two political parties, and this \ninstitution wasn't built just to advocate policy X versus new policy Y \nfor next month. We must serve as a forum for helping our Nation \nunderstand and navigate the hardest generational debates before us. Our \nways of speaking should mitigate, not exacerbate, the polarization that \ndoes exist. As was well said around here last week:\n\n       We will not always agree--not all of us, not all of the \n     time. But we should not hide our disagreements. We should \n     embrace them. We have nothing to fear from honest differences \n     honestly stated . . . [for] I believe a greater clarity \n     between us can lead to greater charity among us.\n\n  Again, saying that we should be reducing polarization doesn't mean we\n\n[[Page S7701]]\n\nshould be watering down our convictions. I mean quite the contrary. We \ndo not need fewer conviction politicians around here; we need more. We \ndon't need more compromising of principles; we need a clearer \narticulation and understanding of the competing principles so that we \ncan actually make things work better and not merely paper over the \ndeficits of vision that everyone in the country knows exist.\n  We should be bored by lazy politician speech. We should be bored by \nknee-jerk certainties on every small issue. We should primarily be \ndoing the harder work of trying to understand competing positions on \nthe larger issues.\n  Good teachers don't shut down debate; they try to model Socratic \nseriousness by putting the best construction on their arguments, even \nand especially to those on which they don't agree. Our goal should not \nbe to attack straw men but rather to strengthen and clarify meaningful \ncontests of ideas for the American people.\n  Representative government will require civic reengagement. Our people \nneed to know that we in this body are up to the task of leading during \na time of nearly universal angst about whether this Nation is on a path \nof decline.\n  A 6-year term is a terrible thing to waste. A 2-year term requires \nhamster-wheel frenzy; our jobs do not. I think we can do better, and I \npledge to work with all of those who want to figure out how.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The majority leader.\n\n\n                      Congratulating Senator Sasse\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate our new \ncolleague, Senator Sasse. There was a good deal of suspense attached to \nwondering what the junior Senator from Nebraska would have to say, as \nhe chose to wait until the end of the year and to listen and begin to \nstudy the institution. I expect most people would not have predicted \nthat the best lesson we were to hear about what is wrong with the \nSenate and what needs to change would come from somebody who just got \nhere.\n  I think the fact that there were so many Senators on the floor to \nlisten was a tribute to the great work the Senator has done here and \nthe study he has put into this institution and what needs to be done on \nall of our parts to make it work better.\n  On behalf of all of the Senate, I congratulate the junior Senator \nfrom Nebraska on an extraordinary maiden speech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, that was a wise speech. It was a speech \nthat made me think of the comment someone once said--that the Senate \nwas the one authentic piece of genius in the American political system. \nWhat Senator Sasse has done is put fresh eyes on a subject, and \nsometimes fresh eyes are the best eyes.\n  What he has reminded us is to remember what a privilege it is to \nserve here and that if we are temporarily entrusted with the \nresponsibility and opportunity to give real meaning to the idea that \nthis is the one authentic piece of genius in the American political \nsystem, we have some work to do.\n  I am delighted he is here. I am delighted he took the time to wait, \nstudy, listen, and make his comments. I listened very carefully. I hope \nevery single Member of the Senate did. I pledge to work with him toward \nthe goal he set out. I look forward to serving with him for a long \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, we \nshould expect a rollcall vote around 4 o'clock on the motion to proceed \nto S.J. Res. 22, which is the Congressional Review Act on the waters of \nthe United States.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. ERNST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Waters of the United States Rule\n\n  Mrs. ERNST. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about this ill-\nconceived and harmful waters of the United States rule--better known as \nWOTUS--and how its implementation threatens the livelihoods of many of \nmy fellow Iowans.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, recent court decisions have forced \nthis rule--EPA's latest power grab--to come to a screeching halt across \nthe country because of the likelihood that EPA has overstepped its \nauthority. To be clear, it is not just me saying that; it is the court.\n  As my colleague and friend, the senior Senator from Iowa, Chuck \nGrassley, often says, Washington is an island surrounded by reality. \nThere is not a more perfect phrase to describe how the events and \nprocesses have unfolded surrounding this confusing rule. Only in \nWashington do unelected bureaucrats take 300 pages to simplify and \nprovide clarity. This rule is so complex and so ambiguous that folks in \nmy State are concerned that any low spot on a farmer's field or a ditch \nor a puddle after a rainstorm may now fall under the EPA's watch.\n  We all want clean water and clean air. That is not disputable. Time \nand again, I have emphasized that the air we breathe and the water we \ndrink need to be clean and safe. Statements suggesting otherwise cannot \nbe further from the truth. It is unfortunate that the EPA continues to \nfuel that line of false attack through their election-style tactics and \ncontroversial lobbying efforts on social media.\n  This rule and this debate are not about clean water. The heart of \nthis debate is about how much authority the Federal Government and \nunelected bureaucrats should have to regulate what is done on private \nland.\n  You can see the map behind me. Look at my State of Iowa. This rule \nwould give the EPA extensive power to regulate water on 97 percent of \nthe land in the State of Iowa--97 percent. If you compare that to \nIowa's Federal land percentage in acreage of 0.3 percent, it is quite a \nshift in the current makeup of Federal authority over the land in Iowa.\n  I spent the weekend going back through letters my fellow Iowans have \nsent me on this issue. So many of them are frustrated with the lack of \ncommon sense coming out of Washington. They are taking this issue \npersonally because their livelihood depends on it. Many of the letters \nI get are from farmers who spend their days working land that has been \nin their families for generations, some going back over 100 years. They \nhave an incentive to take care of their land and conserve it for future \ngenerations. Caring for the land and conserving is a way of life in the \nheartland. It is as if the EPA turns a blind eye to that fact.\n  One Iowan wrote:\n\n       This proposed rule is so vague, long, and very unclear, \n     that I feel they are wanting farmers to fail so a large fine \n     can be assessed. Why am I taking this so personal? Because \n     for me and my family, we live off this land. If we don't take \n     care of it, it will not take care of us. So I will do \n     whatever I can to protect this land and water for my \n     children. My family lives on well water. My cattle drink from \n     the same wells. I don't want either to get sick.\n\n  That is what one Iowan wrote. I believe the same exactly.\n  This rule would give EPA the authority to expand its power over \nfamily farms, small businesses, ranches, and other landowners in our \nrural community. Iowans are so concerned about this rule because they \nknow it will actually create a negative impact on conservation and it \nis contradictory to the commonsense and voluntary work that is taking \nplace in communities across Iowa today.\n  In Iowa, we have had a State-level clean water initiative in place \nfor several years now. It is a partnership between the State \nlegislature, the Department of Natural Resources, the Iowa Department \nof Agriculture and Land Stewardship, Iowa State University, and a \nmyriad of stakeholders across the State.\n  The voluntary Nutrient Reduction Strategy is based on extensive \nresearch and provides a path forward for conservation efforts that \nindividual farmers can pursue with matching funds from the State. This \nscience-based approach provides incentives for farmers and other \nlandowners to make sustainable decisions on their own land rather than \nbe forced to adhere to a one-size-fits-all regulation that would do far \nmore harm than good. A farm in Iowa is not the same as one in Montana, \nand the rolling plains of Texas are very different from the hills and \nvalleys of\n\n[[Page S7702]]\n\nPennsylvania. This is simply one more reason this WOTUS rule is the \nwrong approach. A one-size-fits-all solution from inside the beltway \ncould have disastrous effects nationwide.\n  As I mentioned, I have heard from constituents across the State of \nIowa who have grave concerns with the ambiguity of this rule. They are \nholding off on making conservation improvements to their land for fear \nof being later found out of compliance with this WOTUS rule and facing \nsignificant fines. Maybe it is because we are so ``Iowa nice'' that we \nare inclined to work together collaboratively rather than simply \nissuing more onerous regulations.\n  Take the Middle Cedar Partnership, for example. This project in \nEastern Iowa uses local dollars and State funding, coupled with Federal \ngrants from the USDA, to organize and advocate for land practices that \nimprove water quality downstream. The coalition is made up of city, \ncounty, and State officials, businesspeople, farmers, \nenvironmentalists, and other concerned citizens. Together they are \nmaking meaningful progress on multiple watershed projects within the \nCedar River basin and sharing what they have learned. This approach is \nnow being adopted by other municipalities within the State.\n  Contrary to what some claim, Iowa has done all of this on its own, \nnot at the behest of the EPA. In fact, the EPA has asked the leaders of \nIowa's efforts to come to DC and explain how they are able to get such \ngrassroots buy-in on voluntary conservation projects and programs. The \nother States in the Mississippi River Basin look to Iowa as a leader on \nwater quality and are modeling their own State-level efforts after ours \nin the State of Iowa. While there are clear indications that this WOTUS \nrule is illegal and likely to be scrapped by the courts, that process \ncould take years to play out--and all at the expense of the average \nAmerican.\n\n  Let's not wait around for the inevitable and force our small farmers \nand businesses to operate in the dark while they wait. Let's fix this \nnow and give American families the certainty they deserve. We can do \nthat by passing the legislation before us.\n  I have led the charge in the Senate on this joint resolution of \ndisapproval which would scrap the rule entirely. My legislation is the \nnecessary next step in pushing back against this blatant power grab by \nthe EPA. We will send this to the President, and he will be forced to \ndecide between the livelihood of our rural communities nationwide and \nhis unchecked Federal agency.\n  I also voted for S. 1140, which provides the EPA with clear \nprinciples and directions on how best to craft a waters of the United \nStates rule. It spells out steps they should have taken prior to \nfinalizing this rule to guarantee they can take into consideration the \nthoughtful comments from folks such as farmers, ranchers, small \nbusinesses, and manufacturers. Congress is acting because it is evident \nthat the EPA did not seriously consider the comments and perspective \nfrom those whom this rule will directly impact, and it is clear they \nare far outside the bounds of the congressional intent of the Clean \nWater Act.\n  Iowa is bounded by rivers. The very shape of our State is dictated by \nthe mighty Mississippi and Missouri Rivers. Take one look at commerce \nand recreation happening on them, and it is easy to see why these are \nconsidered navigable waters. When Congress passed the Clean Water Act, \nthis was the type of water it intended to protect, not a grass waterway \nrunning across a farmer's field or a ditch bordering it. This rule \nignores congressional intent and is nothing more than a power grab by \nthe EPA.\n  The EPA continues to run roughshod over Iowans, acting as if they are \na legislative body--something they have no business doing. It is no \nwonder they have lost the trust of the American people and many in \nCongress. Every community wants clean water and to protect our Nation's \nwaterways, but we simply cannot allow mounting, unnecessary regulations \nto overwhelm the commonsense voice of hard-working Americans, \nespecially when they are not based on sound science. Again, it is not \njust me saying that, the courts and the Army Corps have both called the \nEPA on their shaky data, or lack thereof. Yet unelected bureaucrats \nremained committed to making a political decision instead of the right \ndecision.\n  As Iowa's U.S. Senator, it is my responsibility to speak for the \nfolks I represent and hold the Federal Government accountable when it \nis clear they have gone too far. And make no mistake--they have here.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this effort to \nturn back this rule. The rule has been well explained by the Senator \nfrom Iowa. Her efforts are about all that Congress can currently do. \nFrankly, I would hope that we can figure out how to go further so that \nthe Congress has to approve every rule that is issued by every agency \nof government that has significant economic impact.\n  It is, frankly, hard to imagine a rule that has a more wide-ranging \nimpact or more economic impact than this one does. As has been well \npointed out, the authority given to the EPA under the Clean Water Act \nwas very consistent with Federal discussions and debates for 170 years. \nI think 1846 was the first time the term ``navigable waters'' was used \nin Federal law, in a bill that James Knox Polk--President Polk actually \nvetoed the bill, but the term was understood, and it quickly came back \ninto Federal law, and it meant exactly what it said: navigable waters \nof the United States.\n  Why would that be a Federal responsibility? Because ``navigable'' \nmeans you can move something on it. ``Moving something on it'' means \ncommerce, and one of the principal reasons for the Constitution was to \nregulate interstate commerce. So this is a long-established principle. \nYes, there is some Federal responsibility for those avenues of commerce \nin the country--areas, rivers, waterways you can navigate. But, of \ncourse, that is not good enough for the EPA--170 years of Federal law, \ntotal and complete understanding around the country and, it appears, \neven on the part of Federal judges of what ``navigable'' means.\n  There is a way to get expanded jurisdiction if the EPA wanted \nexpanded jurisdiction, and that is to come to Congress and say: Give us \nnot just responsibility over navigable waters but all the water that \ncan run into all of the water that can run into any water that can run \ninto any water that can run into navigable waters.\n  If the EPA got this jurisdiction, you wouldn't be able to come up \nwith enough Federal bureaucrats to oversee this level of jurisdiction. \nIn a map that is not nearly as large as the map we have on the poster \nbut a map that the Missouri Farm Bureau put out in our State, this is \nhow much of the State of Missouri would be under the jurisdiction of \nthe EPA under this law.\n  Even if you are standing very close to this map, you can't see the \nnon-red areas. The red area is the new Federal jurisdiction. The non-\nred area is three-tenths of 1 percent of the State. So anything that \ngoes on in 99.7 percent of our State is really founded on the basis of \nthe rivers that cut through the middle of it, that bind it on the east, \nand would be, obviously, waters that are in most cases navigable and \ninarguably navigable, but all the water that runs into any water that \ncould ever run into any water that runs into that water is clearly not \nnavigable.\n  That is why county commissioners all over our State are calling and \nsaying: If this passes, what does it mean? Can we mow the right-of-way \nwithout a Federal permit?\n  There is no question that if this passes, every roadside ditch in the \nentire State of Missouri would be navigable waters. There is nowhere \noutside the offices of the EPA and the most extreme among us where \nanybody would want to argue that every ditch along every road and \nhighway is navigable waters. The EPA wants jurisdiction they couldn't \nexercise.\n  This is a moment when Congress can stand and say: We do not want this \nrule to go into effect. We are going to pass a resolution that puts \nthis on the President's desk, and if the President is going to be for \nthis no matter what the courts say, no matter what the Corps of \nEngineers says, no matter what the Congress says, the President has to \ntake a position on this rule. It is his EPA; it is out of control on \nthis rule.\n\n[[Page S7703]]\n\n  I hope my colleagues join the Senator from Iowa and me and many \nothers in saying we don't want this rule to go into effect.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I wish to take a quick moment and thank \nmy friends, my colleagues for supporting this effort, and I look \nforward to some lively discussion on the EPA's overreach and this WOTUS \nrule. I encourage my fellow Republicans and my fellow Democrats to \ncarefully consider what this overreach by the EPA does to their home \nStates. Just as it does in Iowa--it covers 97 percent of our land. I \nencourage them to listen to their constituents very carefully as we \nmove forward on this debate and this vote.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for supporting this effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I wish to congratulate our friend and \ncolleague, the Senator from Iowa, on this strong vote on the motion to \nproceed to this congressional resolution of disapproval of this \noverreaching regulation issued by the Environmental Protection Agency. \nI want to talk a little bit about this rule, but I also want to talk \nabout how symptomatic this is of the overreach we are seeing coming \nfrom the executive branch, particularly when it involves rulemaking.\n  This rule is a response to a Supreme Court decision and a number of \nother decisions by the lower courts which held previously that the \nFederal Government had overreached when it comes to trying to regulate \nso-called navigable waters of the United States.\n  I think there is no real question in anybody's mind that under the \ninterstate commerce provisions of the U.S. Constitution, the Federal \nGovernment has a responsibility when it comes to navigable waters, but, \nas the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals said in a decision it handed down \non October 9, the plaintiffs in the case against the Environmental \nProtection Agency and this particular rule established a substantial \npossibility of success on the merits of their claims where they said \nthat the rule's treatment of tributaries, adjacent waters, and waters \nhaving a significant nexus to navigable waters is at odds with the \nSupreme Court's decision in the Rapanos case, which was handed down in \n2006. It said also that the provisions of the rule make it unclear as \nto the distance limitations, whether it is harmonious with the \ndecisions of the Supreme Court. So, for example, if you could say the \ntributary that feeds another body of water that feeds another body of \nwater that then feeds another body of water that eventually gets into \nnavigable water is subject to the rulemaking authority of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency is in conflict with the decision in the \nRapanos case, and I don't believe it would ever withstand \nconstitutional scrutiny.\n  Moreover, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals said the rulemaking \nprocess by which the so-called distance limitations were adopted is \nsuspect. They said it did not include any proposed distance limitation \nin use of the terms such as ``adjacent waters'' or ``significant \nnexus.'' So under the opinion of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, a \nbody of water could be far removed from that navigable water and still \nbe determined as an adjacent water or have a significant nexus and be \nsubject to the far-reaching provisions of the rule.\n  The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals also said that there was no \nscientific support for the distance limitations that were included in \nthe final rule.\n  The plaintiffs contended and the Sixth Circuit agreed that this rule \nis not the product of reasoned decisionmaking and is vulnerable to \nattack as impermissibly arbitrary or capricious under the \nAdministrative Procedure Act.\n  Ordinarily, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit said, they \nwould not issue a stay pending the resolution of the challenge to the \nrule, but they said the sheer breadth of the ripple effect caused by \nthe rule's definitional changes counsel strongly in favor of \nmaintaining the status quo for the time being. They also noted that the \nrule had already been stayed in 13 different States where previous \nlitigation had been filed and decided. So, as a result, on October 9, \nthe Sixth Circuit\n\n[[Page S7704]]\n\nCourt of Appeals issued a nationwide stay for the very rule that is the \nsubject of this Congressional Review Act vote that we just had and that \nwe will have after 10 hours of debate.\n  But beyond the arcane provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act \nand what is navigable water and what is adjacent water, what has a \nsufficient nexus and the like, I think what we need to recognize is \nthat this rule represents the single largest private property grab \nperhaps in American history because it claims as Federal jurisdiction \nprivate property that previously had not been thought of as having any \nnexus or connection with Federal authority or even interstate \ncommerce--potholes, drainage ditches, culverts, stock ponds, things \nsuch as that that are arguably now within the ambit of this rule, and \nthat cannot be the case.\n  That is why so many of us have heard not just from our farmers, \ncattle raisers, and agriculture producers, but we have heard from \npeople in the construction business, people who are concerned about \nthis private property grab, and they said this cannot be the case. As I \nsaid, farmers and ranchers, homebuilders, manufacturers, utilities, the \nconcrete industry--any entity that builds or develops on real estate \nwill likely be impacted.\n  I am very happy that under the leadership of the Senator from Iowa, \nwe have gotten this far on this congressional resolution of \ndisapproval, and I hope that after this debate--perhaps tomorrow--we \nwill be in a position to send this to the President of the United \nStates stating views of the U.S. Senate and Congress that this rule \nsimply is too broad and cannot stand.\n  The Sixth Circuit Court's opinion is not a substitute for what we do \nunder the Congressional Review Act. It is part of our responsibility as \nMembers of the U.S. Congress.\n  In my State, as, I am sure, in other places around the country, \nfarming and ranching is more than a job. It is a way of life. It is \npart of our culture and very definitely a family affair. In fact, about \n98 percent of all farms and ranches in Texas are family-owned. When I \nam back home and have the chance to visit with those who provide the \nfood and the fiber to feed and clothe us, they are very concerned about \nthis legislation--as they should be--because it not only represents a \nthreat to their way of life and their ability to provide for their \nfamilies and for our States and our country, it is a power grab \nunprecedented in U.S. history.\n  In May, the Environmental Protection Agency released the final rule \nthat is supposed to protect our water. Who could be opposed to that? \nWell, nobody if they had done it within the Constitution and within the \nlaw. That sounds innocuous enough. But in reality, it acts as a Federal \nland grab, one which would add significant costs to our farmers and \nranchers and which has the potential to greatly intrude on the private \nproperty of landowners.\n  While we all can agree that clean water is a priority, the Obama \nadministration has overstepped that goal and pitted the EPA and the \nArmy Corps of Engineers against the hard-working farmers and ranchers \nin Texas and across the country. But it is not just the agriculture \nsector, as I mentioned a moment ago. I have been hearing from a lot of \nstakeholders back home who are incredibly concerned about the negative \npotential impact this rule will have on their business. This rule is \nsuch a vast expansion of Federal jurisdiction that multiple sectors of \nour economy could be adversely affected--as I said, homebuilders, the \noil and gas industry, mining companies, and manufacturers.\n  This rule is not just some simple, straightforward provision to \nprotect water; it is a veiled threat against the private sector and a \nblueprint for stifling economic growth in our country.\n  In 2014 the economy in my State grew roughly 5.2 percent. We were \namong the most fortunate States in the Nation to see a lot of job \ngrowth and opportunity. That is why people are moving to Texas--because \nthat is where the jobs are. Conversely, in 2014 we saw across the \ncountry our economy grow at roughly 2.2 percent.\n  While we have been encouraged to see the unemployment rate tick down \nlittle by little, the truth is that when you start getting into the \nnumbers, you realize that the labor participation rate--the percentage \nof people actually actively looking for work--is at a 30-year low, thus \nmaking that lower unemployment rate look better than it really is.\n  This is an important piece of legislation, and I know a lot of people \nare paying attention to it back home and across the country because of \nits impact. I am frustrated we weren't able to move the earlier \nlegislation forward due to a filibuster by the minority, in this case, \nwho are clearly trying to do everything they can to protect this \nadministration and its overreach, but of course all of us are going to \nbe held accountable at the ballot box, as we should be. Anyone who has \nvoted against proceeding with this commonsense legislation to rein in \nan out-of-control Federal agency, I believe, will live to regret that \ndecision.\n\n\n      Congratulating Senator Grassley On casting His 12,000th Vote\n\n  Madam President, I just have one other thing to say on a different \ntopic. It has sort of been the quiet after we celebrated the 15,000th \nvote by the Senator from Vermont very publicly the other day. Our more \nreticent, and perhaps even occasionally shy, Mr. Chuck Grassley, the \nsenior Senator from Iowa, celebrated his 12,000th vote in the Senate.\n  Senator Grassley is well known for his consistency and steadfast \ncommitment to the people of Iowa. I have to say, I don't know of any \nSenator who works harder to get and to keep the trust and confidence of \nthe people he represents. This 12,000th vote should come as no \nsurprise. He actually hasn't even missed a vote since 1993. Every year \nfor more than 30 years, Senator Grassley has demonstrated his \ncommitment to the people of Iowa by visiting every one of the State's \n99 counties.\n  I know he keeps his colleague, the junior Senator from Iowa, Mrs. \nErnst, running just trying to keep up with him. That is an impressive \nrecord for anyone, and one that many--including our Presidential \ncandidates--sometimes need to try to duplicate.\n  I will speak, for just a second, beyond statistics about Senator \nGrassley because I have the honor of serving with him on both the \nFinance and Judiciary Committees. He has worked tirelessly, not just \nfor the people of Iowa but for all Americans. Indeed, my colleague \nshares my concern for creating a more open and transparent government. \nAs somebody who is conservative by ideology and by nature, I was not \nsent by my constituents in Texas to pass more rules and regulations. I \nam here to hold the government, and particularly the bureaucracy, \naccountable. One way we can do that, without adding additional \nregulations, rules, and costs to the taxpayer, is by encouraging an \nopen and more transparent government because with that comes \naccountability.\n  Senator Grassley has used his role as chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee to advance these values and to hold government and the \nbureaucracy accountable for the benefit of not just Iowans but for the \nbenefit of the American people.\n  I thank the Senator from Iowa for the great example he sets for the \nrest of us and applaud him for casting his 12,000th vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mrs. CAPITO. Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the CRA, \nCongressional Review Act amendment on the waters of the United States, \nof my colleague from Iowa. West Virginia is no stranger to the crushing \nconsequences of harmful regulations. Our unemployment rate is the \nlargest in the Nation. Layoff notices keep coming and declining \nrevenues from coal severance taxes are eroding our State's budget. I \nread an article earlier today saying that this far into the fiscal year \nin the State of West Virginia we have a deficit of $91 million.\n  The EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers waters of the United States \nrule, known as the WOTUS rule, is just the latest example of a \nregulatory environment that threatens to put West Virginians and other \nAmericans out of business. Everyone can agree--and the Senator from \nTexas just talked about this and I know the Senator from Iowa has \ntalked about it frequently--that we must protect our drinking water \nresources, and we also must protect our precious natural resources, but \na rule that subjects puddles and ditches to\n\n[[Page S7705]]\n\nregulations just goes too far. The EPA's unprecedented expansion of \nFederal authority has very serious consequences, both in the State I \nrepresent, West Virginia, and throughout the rest of the country.\n  In my State of West Virginia, the steep mountainous terrain means \nthat the EPA would have oversight over any land located in the valley \nor low-lying area. If you have been to West Virginia, you know you are \neither on a mountain or in a valley in a low-lying area. There is very \nlittle flat land.\n  The West Virginia Coal Association pointed out that the WOTUS rule \nwould trigger ``an alphabet soup of statutes, regulatory programs and \nfederal regulatory agencies'' involved in traditionally nonregulated \nactivities. Something as simple as digging a ditch on a farm or \nbuilding a home on privately owned property could be under the purview \nof the EPA and a failure to comply with that rule could result in fines \nas high as $37,500 a day.\n  A county commissioner from Monongalia County recently wrote to my \noffice expressing concerns that this WOTUS rule would impede the \ncounty's attempt to create developable tracks of land needed to attract \nlarge employers in West Virginia.\n  I will remind everyone that developable land in a State like mine is \nvery difficult to create because it is not natural and it would create \na lot of those low-lying areas, ditches, and puddles that this \nregulation goes way beyond to regulate.\n  A small business owner in Scott Depot, WV, shared her concern that \nsmall businesses were not adequately considered in the WOTUS rule. She \nsaid:\n\n       Government regulations, like the proposed rule, are \n     complicated, expensive to navigate, and a real obstacle to my \n     growing business. This change, and its ridiculous overreach \n     and restrictions could decrease land value and hinder my \n     ability to expand, develop and use my own private land.\n\n  We talk a lot about creating jobs in this country. This is a quote \nfrom a small business owner who is concerned about her ability to \ncontrol her own destiny with her own small business on her own \nprivately owned land. I think this is the reason that 31 States, \nincluding West Virginia, are suing to overturn this misguided rule, and \ntwo courts have already found it likely illegal.\n  Rather than incorporating thoughts from Congress and concerned \nAmericans, this misguided rule doubles down on overreach and threatens \nto impede small businesses, agriculture, manufacturing, coal, natural \ngas production, and many other vital sectors of the economy as the \nSenator from Texas just talked about.\n  The decision by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals to block the \nimplementation of the WOTUS rule nationwide confirms that WOTUS was the \nwrong approach to protecting our water resources and reinforces the \nneed to rein in this administration's unprecedented and overreaching \nregulations.\n  Along with colleagues on both sides of the aisle--just this afternoon \nat 2:30 p.m.--I proudly supported Senator Barrasso's Federal Water \nQuality Protection Act, which would have directed the EPA and the Corps \nof Engineers to withdraw this rule, go back to the drawing board, and \nissue an alternative approach that is crafted in consultation with \nState and local governments and small businesses.\n  The bill we voted on earlier today received bipartisan support from \n57 Senators but only partisan opposition. Both Republicans and \nDemocrats supported moving forward on the Federal Water Quality \nProtection Act because we wanted to offer a real solution that would \nbring clarity and common sense to the protection of our Nation's \nwaters.\n  This legislation would have provided certainty to farmers, \nmanufacturers, energy producers, State and local governments, and \nanyone seeking to do virtually anything on private land. Unfortunately, \n41 Democrats stopped a bipartisan majority from considering this bill. \nWe must now consider other options to block the misguided WOTUS \nregulation issued by the EPA and Corps of Engineers.\n  I am glad we will have the opportunity to vote on a Congressional \nReview Act resolution of disapproval offered by the Senator from Iowa. \nThis resolution would protect hard-working West Virginia families, \nsmall businesses, energy producers, and others across the country who \nwould be unfairly burdened by this onerous and deeply flawed WOTUS \nrule. The WOTUS rule would lead to a massive expansion, again, of \ncostly permitting requirements and hinder our already struggling \neconomy, an outcome West Virginia and the Nation simply cannot afford.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me and the Senator from Iowa, who \nis leading the charge in such an admiral way in supporting this \nimportant effort to block the harmful WOTUS rule.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                 Federal Water Quality Protection Bill\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I rise not only in support of the \ncritical bipartisan legislation that was before the Senate earlier \ntoday but also in support of the proposal of the Senator from Iowa that \nis before us now. While the measure failed to secure the necessary \nvotes earlier today, the fight is not over.\n  The Federal Water Quality Protection Act would have enabled American \ncitizens to maintain control over their water resources, and it would \nhave stopped the administration's WOTUS rule. Congress has already \nlimited the Federal Government's regulatory authority under the Clean \nWater Act to only navigable waterways, but instead of following the \nlaw, this administration has broadened the definition of ``waters of \nthe United States'' and extended Federal authority far beyond the law's \noriginal intent.\n  The rule, which is commonly referred to as WOTUS, exponentially \nexpands Federal jurisdiction over all water--from prairie potholes to \nditches and everything in between. Ultimately, this rule prevents State \nand local agencies from effectively regulating our water by placing \ncontrol in the hands of Washington bureaucrats.\n  I am proud to have worked with my colleagues on a bipartisan effort \nto overturn this dangerous rule and force both the EPA and the Army \nCorps of Engineers to go back to the drawing board. Our legislation, \nknown as the Federal Water Quality Protection Act, would have required \nthe administration to consult with States and local stakeholders before \nimposing the Federal regulations on our State-owned water resources. \nAdditionally, the bill would have ensured a thorough economic analysis \nto make sure that was conducted before restricting States from managing \ntheir own natural resources.\n  The importance of allowing our States to manage these resources hit \nhome during a Senate Environment and Public Works Committee field \nhearing that I chaired in Lincoln, NE, this past March. At the hearing, \na wide variety of Nebraska stakeholders provided personal accounts of \nhow this will affect families, businesses, and communities all across \nour State.\n  One witness from the Nebraska State Home Builders Association noted \nthat 25 percent of the current cost associated with building a new home \nare due to existing regulations. Adding more Federal rules and \nregulations will only put that American dream of owning a home out of \nreach for most of us. That is not right, and that is not the kind of \ngovernment people want.\n  Additionally, the Common Sense Nebraska Coalition noted that the \nsweeping impact of this rule would affect everyone, from county \nofficials trying to build a road to farmers trying to manage that \nrainwater runoff.\n  The WOTUS rule affects much more than rural America. Our \nmunicipalities are charged with wastewater, storm water, and flood \ncontrol systems, as well as providing drinking water, electricity, and \nnatural gas to our citizens. Taxpayers will shoulder these added costs. \nWe are going to pay more for road construction. We will pay more for \nlevees that protect our drinking water. We will pay more for wastewater \nimprovements, and that will cost our families. Those higher taxes will \nhurt our families.\n  With the expanded definition of ``navigable water'' under this rule \nand our extensive aquifer system, the Federal Government can assert \ncontrol over nearly all the water in the State of Nebraska. Nebraskans \ntake their role in protecting and conserving our natural resources very \nseriously. Responsible\n\n[[Page S7706]]\n\nresource management, including the careful stewardship of our water, is \nthe cornerstone of my State's economy.\n  We all also understand that the people closest to a resource are the \nones who manage it best. That is a principle that is shared across this \ncountry. That is why I am committed to working with my colleagues to \nmanage responsibly our Nation's water for our current and future \ngenerations. I don't believe the Federal Government should focus on \nways to make life harder for people. That is not what we were sent to \ndo. Instead we need to explore policy options that will promote growth \nand conservation.\n  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Federal Water Quality \nProtection Act. This important bipartisan legislation would have set \nclear limits on the Federal regulation of water. I am disappointed the \nObama administration would force this irresponsible, overreaching rule \non hard-working Americans. We have a duty to roll back this rule. We \nhave a duty to prevent the harm it will inflict.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to come together on this so we can \nensure that job creators, communities, and families from across the \ncountry can continue to prosper.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, there is a saying by Thomas Hornsby \nFerrill engraved on the walls of the Colorado State Capitol that reads, \n``Here is a land where life is written in water. . . . '' I come to the \nfloor to talk about the most precious natural resource in the West; \nthat is, of course, our water. Water in the West has helped shape \ncommunities, agriculture, tourism, and industry. The management of that \nwater has been traditionally controlled at the State and local level, \nnot the Federal Government.\n  Colorado is the State of origin for four major river basins: The \nColorado, the Arkansas, the Platte, and the Rio Grande. These water \nbasins help make for a robust agricultural economy throughout the \nState. According to the Colorado Department of Agriculture, this \nindustry contributes nearly $41 billion to the State economy and \nemploys nearly 173,000 people. Colorado has more than 35,000 farms and \nranches and more than 31 million acres for farming and ranching.\n  The State ranks in the top five nationwide for production of products \nranging from potatoes and cantaloupes to sunflowers and wheat. \nUnfortunately, the Environmental Protection Agency has decided to put \nforth a rule that would endanger many of these farms as well as the \njobs and local economies they help support. The waters of the United \nStates rule, known as WOTUS, would significantly expand the definition \nof navigable waters under the Clean Water Act. With this rule, the EPA \nand the Army Corps of Engineers have unilaterally decided that isolated \nponds and irrigation ditches may be subject to the same Federal \noversight as the Mississippi River. They are doing all of this based on \nauthority passed by Congress more than 40 years ago.\n  Instead, this rule could have significant negative impacts on \nagriculture, industry, local utilities, and water districts, merely by \nthe uncertainty it creates with local entities trying to determine if \ntheir water is subject to Federal oversight.\n  According to the Colorado Farm Bureau, an additional 1.3 million \nacres of land and an additional 170,000 stream miles in Colorado alone \ncould be subject to Federal Government jurisdiction. It is important to \npoint out that Colorado is a lower 48 State, one of the only lower 48 \nStates that has all water flowing out of it and no water flowing into \nit. Farmers and ranchers would likely be subjected to increased \npermitting requirements under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act to \ncanals and ditches on their own land. Even if their land is exempted, \nas some would have you believe from the WOTUS rule under the proposed \nexclusions, there is already an air of uncertainty for these farmers \nand ranchers who will have to try and navigate the Federal bureaucracy \nto determine if they have to apply for the increased permitting \nrequirements.\n  It is no secret that the Environmental Protection Agency often works \nvery slowly in the regulatory and permitting process. Two water \nprojects in Colorado with bipartisan support, the Northern Integrated \nSupply Project and Gross Reservoir Expansion, have languished in the \nregulatory process for more than a decade. The waters of the United \nStates rule is simply not the answer.\n  The Federal Government should not be passing expansive new laws \nwithout the consent of Congress to regulate every drop of water. The \nEPA wants you to believe that the proposed WOTUS rule is not a major \nexpansion of power and that this rule does not add any new requirements \nfor agriculture or interfere with private property rights or include \nthe regulation of most irrigation ditches.\n  Fortunately, our Nation maintains a separation of power. On October \n9, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued a nationwide \nstay for the waters of the United States rule after a lawsuit was filed \nby 18 States, including the State of Colorado. The order of stay \nspecifically states that the rule effectively redraws the \njurisdictional lines over our Nation's waters and that the States and \nothers would be harmed if the justice system did not act.\n  I applaud the Sixth Circuit for their action and for the 18 States \nthat moved forward to protect control of the water within their \nboundaries. Now I believe it is time for Congress to act. \nUnfortunately, yesterday we watched as a strictly partisan minority \nblocked S. 1140, the Federal Water Quality Protection Act authored by \nSenator Barrasso of Wyoming.\n  This legislation, which had moved through the Senate under regular \norder and in a bipartisan fashion, would seek to have the EPA and \nothers make significant revisions to the WOTUS rule and would throw out \nthe current rule. It calls for significant consultations with State and \nlocal governments who actually control the water. I believe this \nconsultation process is a significant step forward.\n  I have heard from many water districts and utilities throughout \nColorado. They all have major concerns with the WOTUS rule in its \ncurrent form and the unintended consequences of the rule. But because \nof this partisan minority of Senators blocking the legislative vehicle \nto try to address the many shortcomings of the WOTUS rule, I believe we \nhave no other choice but to move forward in disapproving of the rule in \nits entirety. I applaud my friend and colleague Senator Ernst of Iowa \nfor her work in introducing S.J. Res. 22, which provides for \nCongressional disapproval of the waters of the United States rule.\n  That is why I have come to the floor today, to urge a ``yes'' vote on \nS.J. Res. 22 because in Colorado, we know that we have to stick up for \nour water rights. In Colorado, we know we have to stand up for our \nwater law. In Colorado, we know that we have to keep the Feds' hands \noff our water rights. I urge the adoption of this measure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I am here to actually address some of the \nrecent developments on the Keystone XL Pipeline. Before going into \nthat, I would like to take a minute, though, and mention the \nCongressional Review Act that is before us now and how important it is \nthat we pass it.\n  I want to commend Senator Ernst for her diligence on this very \nimportant matter. The waters of the United States is a regulation \nissued by the EPA that goes far beyond their statutory authority, far \nbeyond the statutory authority that Congress has given them under a \nlegal theory referred to as ``significant nexus.'' It is something I \nhave worked on for a long time. In fact, I have included a bill that \nwould defund the regulation as part of the EPA appropriations bill in \nour appropriations, both at the subcommittee and the full committee \nlevel.\n\n[[Page S7707]]\n\n  So I certainly hope and feel that the good Senator from Iowa will be \nsuccessful in this CRA effort, as far as getting it through Congress. I \nthink it will go through in strong fashion in both the Senate and the \nHouse, thanks to her good work and, of course, the underlying \nimportance of the issue.\n  Of course, our challenge will be with the administration. I hope the \nadministration will look at the strong support here in Congress and \nlisten to the people of this great country, the farmers and ranchers \nacross our country, and the small business people across the country \nwho know so well that WOTUS is a serious problem for them. I hope the \nPresident will consider them and not veto the legislation, but I am \nconcerned that he will veto it. And if he does, then we will continue \nto work through the appropriations process to defund this legislation.\n\n  Again, even if we are not able to deauthorize it through the CRA \nprocess, we will work to defund it. Of course, the disadvantage with \ndefunding is that only goes for a year, but obviously that would take \nus through most of the balance of the Obama administration and \nhopefully get us to a fresh start.\n  I think the key point, though, is that we rescind this onerous \nregulation. That can be through deauthorizing it, it can be through \ndefunding it, and, in fact, it can be through litigation. I think in \nexcess of 30 States have joined in litigation across the country \npushing back on this onerous regulation. In fact, the Federal district \ncourt in North Dakota stayed the regulation. That stay was upheld, that \ninjunction was upheld by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in \nCincinnati, OH. So right now there is a national stay on this \nregulation, which I think just goes to show that we are on the right \ntrack here because we are coming at it from so many angles with so many \npeople who are saying: Look, this is common sense. This is a big-time \noverreach by EPA. It adversely affects farmers, ranchers, small \nbusinesses, and property rights. In fact, in this great country, it \nadversely affects property rights. So through deauthorization, \ndefunding, and the legal process, we will work to rescind it.\n  Again, I wish to echo the strong comments of my esteemed colleague \nfrom the great State of Colorado and also acknowledge and commend the \ngood Senator from the State of Iowa on her efforts to lead the charge.\n\n\n                          Keystone XL Pipeline\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to speak, as I said, for up to 10 minutes as in \nmorning business on the subject of the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  Yesterday, after 7 years--7 years starting in September of 2008--the \nTransCanada company asked the U.S. State Department to pause or suspend \nits application to build the Keystone XL Pipeline. The company asked \nfor that pause because it is working through an application process for \nroute approval by the Public Service Commission in Nebraska. The \nGovernor and the legislature in Nebraska actually approved the route \nfor the pipeline in Nebraska, but after many lawsuits in the State of \nNebraska and demonstrations, often led by movie stars and other \ncelebrities, the company has chosen what I would call a belt-and-\nsuspenders approach. Essentially, they have decided that in spite of \nthe fact that they have received approval from the Governor, the \nlegislature, and that that decision has been upheld by the Nebraska \nSupreme Court, they are going back and they are going through the \nprocess with the Nebraska Public Service Commission. So that is why I \nsay it is really a belt-and-suspenders approach. Now they are going \nback, and in addition to the approvals they have already received, in \naddition to the decision by the Nebraska Supreme Court, now they are \ngoing back through the Public Service Commission process in Nebraska as \nwell. The thing about that is it will take about a year to do it.\n  So now TransCanada is asking for forbearance from the Obama \nadministration--not because the company hasn't met all the legal and \nregulatory requirements. It has. It has met all of them and it spent \nmillions of dollars doing so. But, rather, TransCanada is asking for \nforbearance on the project because the company is once again going \nthrough all of the requirements, all the regulations, and all the \nredtape to get every approval--State, local, and ultimately Federal--\nfor the project. That is why I call it, as I said, the belt-and-\nsuspenders approach.\n  Now we will see what the Obama administration does with TransCanada's \nrequest. Will they now hold off or wait on their denial decision, which \nthe Obama administration obviously wants to make based on their \nenvironmental agenda, or will they honor TransCanada's request to pause \nor suspend the project, just as they have made TransCanada wait now for \n7 years pending all of the administration's requirements, including the \nObama administration's adamant concern that the process in Nebraska be \nfully completed before the administration render a decision. Remember, \nthis administration made a big deal about waiting until the Nebraska \nprocess was fully completed before the administration would make a \ndecision. So let's see what they do. As I have just outlined, that \nprocess would probably take another year.\n  So will they forbear on making a decision now after they held the \nprocess up 7 years? Will they honor the request by TransCanada to pause \nwhile the company completes this process in Nebraska or will they say \nno, in spite of their concern that that be fully completed? Will they \ngo ahead and in essence reverse themselves on process and deny the \nproject? Well, we will see. We will see what they do. But if they don't \ngrant this pause or suspend the application pending completion of the \nproject in Nebraska, it seems to me like a double standard. On the one \nhand, they hold up the project for 7 years and they say the company \nmust go fully through the process in Nebraska. So for them now to say \n``No, we are not going to provide the time to do that'' seems, in fact, \nvery much like a double standard.\n  As I have talked about in this Chamber before and as I think the \nadministration is very well aware--and I think that is part of the \nreason they have held up on making a decision rather than turning down \nthe project--this is a project which is overwhelmingly supported by the \nAmerican people. In poll after poll, there is 65 percent to 70 percent \nsupport by the American people. Also, it is supported by Congress. It \npassed overwhelmingly with more than 60 votes in this Chamber. It \npassed with a big bipartisan majority in the House.\n  Another consideration obviously now for the administration is, what \nabout the new administration in Canada? The Trudeau administration is \ncoming in, and the new Prime Minister in Canada supports the project. \nSo what is the message to Canada if the administration says ``No, we \nare not going to honor that company's request for a stay or a pause or \nan extension on the project now'' and instead goes ahead and turns it \ndown?\n  The administration's own Quadrennial Energy Review dedicates a whole \nchapter to the benefits of integrating North American energy markets. \nThe administration states that ``energy system integration is in the \nlong term interest of the United States, Canada, and Mexico, as it \nexpands the size of energy markets, creates economies of scale to \nattract private investment, lowers capital costs, and reduces energy \ncosts for consumers.'' That is right out of their own Quadrennial \nEnergy Review, prepared by their own Department of Energy, which says \nwe need to work with Canada on energy.\n  So what will they do? In spite of all of that, will they turn down \nthe project now or will they treat the company fairly and give them due \nprocess?\n  Well, regardless of the decision the Obama administration makes, I \nthink in the final analysis the project will be approved. It might take \na year, it might take a little over a year, but I think in the final \nanalysis this project will be approved. It should be approved because \nthe people of this country overwhelmingly support it and recognize that \nit is in their interest and to their benefit. But what it really comes \ndown to is the merits. In the final analysis, a project should be \napproved or disapproved on the merits, right? And the merits are these, \nvery simple: To build the kind of energy plan that we want for this \ncountry, where we are energy secure--meaning we produce more energy \nthan we consume--we have to build the energy infrastructure we need to \nmove that energy safely and efficiently from where it is produced to\n\n[[Page S7708]]\n\nwhere it is consumed. That means we need pipelines, we need \ntransmission lines, we need rail, and we need road to move that energy \nas safely and cost-effectively as possible.\n  If you think about it, that doesn't mean just oil and gas; that means \nall types of energy. That means renewables too, right, to move those \nelectrons through transmission lines. We need the energy infrastructure \nfor the right kind of energy plan for this country--energy from \nsources, traditional and renewable, to move that energy as safely and \nas cost-effectively as possible.\n  So what is the message here? The message is very simple: If we want \ncompanies to step up and invest the hundreds of millions and billions \nof dollars it takes to build that infrastructure, then we have to have \na legal and regulatory process where they know that if they go through \nit and they meet all the requirements, they can then get approval for \nthe hundreds of millions that they invest to get that done and to build \nthese projects.\n  That is energy infrastructure we need to build so that we don't \ncontinue to rely on OPEC or let Russia dominate the energy markets or \nrely on countries such as Venezuela, and ultimately, that is what the \nAmerican people want. That energy security, that energy independence, \nif you will, working with our closest friend and ally, like Canada, and \ndeveloping energy in this country, is what the American people want. \nThat is what the American people want because it makes us strong and \nsecure.\n  This is just one project, but it is about all of the projects we need \nto build to make this Nation energy secure. That is why ultimately this \nproject will be approved on the merits.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I wish to speak this evening a little bit \nabout the budget deal that was recently enacted. There are three parts \nof that I wish to address. One is the spending increases, another is \nthe debt ceiling, and finally there is the Crime Victims Fund, which--I \nam very upset about this.\n  Starting with spending, it shouldn't be controversial--but of course \nit is--that we spend too much money here. We spend way too much money. \nThere are any number of metrics that would confirm and demonstrate how \nmuch we overspend, but I think the most compelling is the size of the \ndeficit that all this spending is creating, with record revenue. I want \nto underscore that. The Federal Treasury is taking in record amounts of \ntax revenue. So with alltime-record levels of revenue, we are still \nspending so much above and beyond that that this year we are going to \nrun about a $450 billion deficit.\n  There are some people in this town who practically sprained their \narms patting themselves on their backs because it used to be a $1 \ntrillion deficit. That is true, but $450 billion is still way too much. \nWe have too much debt now, and a $450 billion deficit this year is \ngoing to add $450 billion to a debt level that is already too big. And \nguess what. All forecasts, everybody's forecasts--liberal, \nconservative, Democrat, Republican, CBO, private sector--everybody \nagrees the deficits are on path to get worse. So we are spending too \nmuch. Our deficits are too big. They are adding to a debt that is \nalready too high, already doing damage to our economy, our ability to \ncreate jobs, because of all the uncertainty and the risk that all this \ndebt creates. And what happens? The only spending discipline we have \nbeen able to achieve in recent years--the spending caps that were \nenacted in 2011--the President insists we have to bust them.\n  Many of us believe we should be spending more on defense. If we are \ngoing to do that--I think part of our job is to prioritize spending. \nNational security, defending our country, should be our No. 1 priority, \nand since we need to spend more there, you offset that with spending \nreductions somewhere else. That would be the prudent thing to do. But \nthat is not what the President insisted on. The President insisted that \nif we were going to spend anything more on defense, we had to match \nthat dollar-for-dollar with increased spending elsewhere. So not only \nwere we not offsetting the increase in defense spending, but we were \ncompounding the spending by increasing the nondefense spending. So this \ndeal busts the spending caps, and, in fact, the deficits will be larger \nthan they otherwise would be.\n  That leads me to the second point, and that is the debt ceiling. \nLet's think about the context of where we are. When President Obama \ntook office, the total amount of debt owed to the public--the amount of \nmoney the Treasury had borrowed because of previous deficits was less \nthan $6 trillion. It was a very big number, but it was less than $6 \ntrillion. By the end of next year, it is going to be over $13 trillion. \nSo this President, by the time he leaves office, will have more than \ndoubled the total amount of debt we have borrowed to fund these \ndeficits. Another way to think about it is that this President will \nhave added to our debt burden by an amount greater than the sum total \nof every single one of his predecessors combined, from George \nWashington to George W. Bush. This is a staggering amount of debt that \nwe have imposed on ourselves, our kids, our grandkids, our economy, and \non our ability to be a productive country.\n\n  And what did the President say in response to all this debt? Give me \nthe authority to borrow more with no conditions. We are not even going \nto have a discussion or a negotiation about the underlying problem that \nis causing all of this debt.\n  I think that is, frankly, outrageous, and it is extremely unusual \nbecause for decades now American Presidents have met with Congress, and \nwhen we have had discussions in the past about the level of debt and \nwhat we are going to do about it--when the Presidents have said we need \nto increase our debt ceiling so that we can borrow more money--that has \nvery typically included a discussion about dealing with the underlying \nproblems.\n  There are many examples of this. Back in 1985, during the Reagan \nadministration, it was in the context of a debt ceiling debate that we \npassed the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings measure, which was about limiting our \ndeficits and reducing the amount of debt we would incur going forward. \nIn 1990 George Herbert Walker Bush negotiated with Congress the Budget \nEnforcement Act, which again was related to a debt ceiling increase at \nthe time and which adopted measures to deal with the deficits of that \nday. In 1997, William Jefferson Clinton--President Clinton--with a \nRepublican Congress sat down and negotiated a balanced budget \nagreement. And you know what happened? They balanced the budget. So \nPresident Clinton decided to work with Republicans in Congress to deal \nwith this underlying problem, and within a few years we actually had \nbalanced budgets.\n  Then in 2011, in the context of the debt ceiling increase that was \ndiscussed at the time and eventually raised, these spending caps were \nestablished as a way to at least do something about this runaway \nspending and these excessive deficits and the debt. But this time the \nPresident had a different view. His view was that he would not even \nhave a discussion. There would be no negotiations, no consideration. We \nare not even going to talk about the underlying problem. He wanted to \nhave unlimited authority to borrow more money through the end of his \nPresidency, and that is what is in this deal.\n  So what can we expect? We can expect a whole lot more debt. That is \nexactly what is going to happen. By the way, contrary to what some in \nthe administration like to say, this has nothing to do with paying for \npast bills. We have paid for those bills. This is to enable excessive \nspending going forward--the deficits we are going to incur because this \nPresident is insisting on this overspending.\n  Let me get to the last point I wanted to stress today, which is one \nof the really disturbing things about this budget deal and what it has \ndone with the Crime Victims Fund. By way of background, the Crime \nVictims Fund was a fund established in 1984. It consists exclusively of \nmonies that are assessed to convicted criminals--corporate or \nindividuals. As part of their punishment, they are made to pay a fine, \nand the fine goes into an account with the Federal Government. It \nactually is quite substantial. Year in and year out this ends up being \nactually billions of dollars.\n\n[[Page S7709]]\n\n  The statute requires, first of all, that all this money go to victims \nof crimes and their advocates, and specifically, it requires a priority \nfor victims of child abuse, sexual assault, and domestic violence and \nthat those three categories of crimes be given a special priority. \nThere are organizations that do wonderful work across Pennsylvania and \nacross the country in helping people who are victims of these terrible, \nterrible crimes that are so difficult to recover from. There are groups \nof people who do great work in helping these victims to recover.\n  The whole idea of the Crime Victims Fund is to take these dollars \nfrom the criminals--not a penny of tax dollars--and give it to the \nvictims of crimes and the people who are advocates for them. But what \nthis budget deal does is it takes $1.5 billion out of the Crime Victims \nFund and it spends it on other things.\n  I think this is outrageous. This is not taxpayer money in the first \nplace. It is not as though we don't have victims of crimes anymore. \nObviously, we still do. And we have organizations that can do great \nwork if they had the resources. But in the absence of resources, it \nmeans that children who are victims of child abuse don't get the \ncounseling and the care they need. It means a victim of domestic \nviolence doesn't have a place to stay when she needs protection from an \nabusing spouse. It means people who really need these services are \ngoing to go without because we are diverting this money that is \nsupposed to be going to crime victims and we are spending it somewhere \nelse.\n  The most important thing I want to say tonight is that it is not too \nlate to fix this. What the Congress passed and the President signed \nlast week paves the way to misallocate this money from the Crime \nVictims Fund, but it doesn't require that to happen. So I have a bill \nthat will fix this problem. I have a bill called the Fairness for Crime \nVictims Act, and what it will do is it will require that the money go \nto the victims, as it was always intended.\n  By the way, the idea that we should not be diverting the Crime \nVictims Fund to these other miscellaneous spending categories is a \nbipartisan idea. There is broad bipartisan support for the idea that \nthe money in the Crime Victims Fund should go to victims of crime. The \nWall Street Journal ran an article on Sunday, and they quoted a crime \nadvocate describing the budget deal saying, this deal ``violates the \nintegrity of a decades-old program that funds safe havens for domestic \nviolence victims, counseling for abused children and financial aid for \nmurder victims' families, among other programs.''\n  Josh Shapiro is the chairman of the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime \nand Delinquency, and he wrote about this provision in the budget deal. \nHe said that it ``puts in danger our commitment to victims of crime \nthroughout our country.'' Democratic members of the Pennsylvania State \nHouse agree with me that this money should not be diverted this way. \nThey sent a letter, among other things, saying that the budget deal \nincreases spending to ``the detriment of current and future crime \nvictims'' and that this constitutes ``a terrible precedent.''\n  I couldn't agree more, and that is why I hope we will pass my \nlegislation, the Fairness for Crime Victims Act. It ends this \ninjustice. Here is the way it works. It is very simple. It simply \nrequires that Congress allocate to crime victims and their advocates an \namount equal to the sum of the previous 3-year average that went into \nthe fund. So the short way to think about it is that it means we are \ngoing to send to crime victims the money that comes in for crime \nvictims, and we are not going to send it somewhere else.\n  This means that victims of crime and their advocates are going to see \na big increase in this funding, because for years Congress has refused \nto allocate all of the money that has been coming in. In the past, they \njust refused to allocate it. There are budgetary gimmickry reasons for \ndoing that, and this needs to come to end. We certainly can't continue \ndiverting this fund for other purposes.\n  We have had colleagues--Members of this body--come to the floor and \nmake the point that we shouldn't use Medicare and Social Security funds \nas an ATM to fund other programs. I agree. We also shouldn't use the \nCrime Victims Fund, which is not a single dime of taxpayer money. We \nshouldn't use that to fund other programs either. It is not too late to \ndo the right thing for victims of some of the most heinous crimes that \nare committed anywhere.\n  I urge my colleagues to help pass this piece of legislation. This was \nreported out of the Committee on the Budget unanimously. There was very \nbroad bipartisan support. What happened in this budget deal is an \nillustration of why my legislation is necessary. Money that is left \naround in a pot somewhere in this town gets spent pretty quickly by \nsomeone for something. This money needs to go to crime victims. If we \npass my legislation, that is where it will go.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I want to talk about what we have been \ndebating today on the Senate floor, the waters of the United States \nrule, and legislation that has received bipartisan support so far. We \nthink it needs a lot more support on why this is so important for the \ncountry.\n  I was a cosponsor of Senator Barrasso's bill. Unfortunately, that \nbill didn't get the 60 votes necessary, but Senator Ernst has a \nresolution that I think is going to be very important to pass that \nwould stop this rule from being enacted by the EPA. Hopefully, we will \nsee if the President, once this is put on his desk, has the common \nsense to sign it rather than veto it.\n  I want to put this rule in a much broader context, to put the debate \nwe are having on the waters of the United States rule into the broader \ncontext of actually what is happening in our country and how the EPA's \nwaters of the United States rule is actually a symbol for much broader \nproblems that I think the vast majority of Americans recognize.\n  The other night I went to a premiere of a short film on the Trans-\nAlaska Pipeline system, what we call in Alaska TAPS. It is Alaska's \n800-mile artery of steel that was done in the most responsible manner, \nin terms of the environment, that brings much energy to our country. \nWhen it was built, it was actually one of the biggest private sector \nconstruction projects ever in the history of our great Nation, and \nliterally directly and indirectly employed tens of thousands of \nAmericans. It has carried almost 17 billion barrels of American oil to \nenergy-thirsty American markets and continues to provide thousands and \nthousands of jobs, not only in Alaska but throughout the country. It is \ncertainly a technological and environmental marvel. Here is the thing: \nThat kind of huge project was built in 3 years.\n  Think about that, 800 miles of steel pipeline, crossing 3 mountain \nranges, more than 30 major rivers and streams, and it took Americans 3 \nyears to build it. Go to Alaska and it is functioning incredibly well \ntoday. We are reminded of how, when this Nation puts its mind to \nsomething, we can get great things done. In many ways, Congress played \na critical role in making sure that incredible energy infrastructure \nsystem happened.\n  We are a great nation, but I must admit when I was watching this \nmovie last week with a bunch of Alaskans--Senator Murkowski, Don Young, \nand others--I did feel a sense of unease, almost a little nostalgia, \nwhen we were watching this film about this great project that Americans \ncame together from all over the country to build. We all know we used \nto do great things here and built great things. Let me give a few \nexamples.\n  In Alaska is what is called the Alcan Highway, the Alaska-Canada \nHighway, through some of the world's most rugged terrain, 1,700 miles, \nbuilt in under 1 year. We built the Empire State Building in 410 days. \nWe built the Pentagon in 16 months, the Hoover Dam, the Interstate \nHighway System, putting a man on the Moon--I could go on and on and on. \nWhen we look at the history of this country, it is a history of getting \nbig things done, and it is not just getting big things done. These \nprojects were a symbol of American pride, of American greatness, and \nthey also created tens of thousands of jobs--great jobs, middle-class \njobs, which gave workers a sense that what they were doing was very \nimportant in their daily lives and very important to their country.\n  In Alaska still, when you talk to someone who worked on TAPS, who\n\n[[Page S7710]]\n\nconstructed this--for the country--they talk about it in terms of \npride, in terms of what they were doing for their State but also what \nthey were doing for America and how everybody came together to build \nthis.\n  Here is a sad fact: These kind of projects are not being built today. \nInstead, we have become a redtape Nation. Instead of symbols of \ntechnological wonder, national pride, and American ingenuity, we now \nhear story after story--and we have all heard them in the Senate--of \ndelay and discord and disappointment, all of which symbolizes a country \nthat can't get things done. The main culprit--the main culprit--is \nright here: Washington, DC, the ``Capital of Dysfunction.'' Whether it \nis the Keystone Pipeline, transmission lines in California or bridges \nor highways or runways across the country, killing crucial development \nin infrastructure projects through permitting and regulatory delay and \nFederal agency overreach with new rules upon new rules--and all they do \nis stop development--this certainly has been a hallmark of the Obama \nadministration. The WOTUS rule--the EPA's waters of the United States \nrule--is just the latest manifestation of this. As we know, this is \nhappening all over the country.\n  Frequently, because of the political risks, the President and members \nof his administration, like Gina McCarthy, will not openly oppose \neconomic development projects. Instead, they will wrap them in redtape \nuntil they delay them to death. Let me give some examples.\n  In 2008, Shell acquired leases in the Arctic Ocean off the coast of \nAlaska for over $2 billion. That is a company going to the Federal \nGovernment. The Federal Government is saying: We want to lease this \nland to you. A company says: We will give you billions in return--the \nFederal Government; that money has already been spent, the billions--to \ndevelop natural resources. Of course, this was big news in Alaska. New \nproduction of oil would have filled up three-quarters of TAPS, which I \ntalked about earlier. It would have created jobs, some estimates are in \nthe tens of thousands of jobs, direct and indirect jobs, and provided \nmuch needed State and local revenue and energy security for our \ncountry.\n  So what happened? Remember, the Federal Government is inviting a \nprivate sector company to do this. It didn't take long for this project \nto run into a maddening array of often conflicting and confusing \npermitting challenges, drilling moratoriums, new regulations, \nenvironmental lawsuits, permitting confusions, that year after year \nkept the drill bit above the ground.\n  Now, jump to 2015. What had once been a very robust exploration \nprogram has resulted in what happened this summer: The permission, \nfinally, to drill one exploration well off the coast of Alaska where \nhundreds of wells have already been drilled safely. We have been doing \nthis safely in Alaska for decades.\n  Let me sum it up. It took 7 years, $7 billion, to get permission to \ndrill one exploration well in 100 feet of water; 7 years, $7 billion, \nto finally get the Federal Government's permission to drill one single \nexploration well in 100 feet of water. No company in the world can \nendure that. This was a project that was meant to be delayed, delayed, \ndelayed until it was killed.\n  Some of my colleagues have been celebrating this--celebrating this. I \nthink that is sad because what they are really celebrating is the loss \nof very good jobs for Americans throughout the country. In many ways \nthey are celebrating what is a symbol of America's decline.\n  These resources in the Arctic are going to be developed one way or \nthe other, and it is either going to be by countries like us who have \nthe highest, most responsible standards on the environment or countries \nlike Russia and China who don't. So the Russians and Chinese are now \ngoing to be in charge. They are going to be producing the energy, they \nare going to be getting the jobs, and they are not going to care at all \nabout the environment. So instead of a win-win-win for the United \nStates, this is a lose-lose-lose. Yet we have Members of this body \ncelebrating this. Again, this is not a problem confined to my State or \nenergy programs in terms of the delay, delay, delay. Let me provide a \nfew examples.\n  We had a recent Senate commerce committee hearing on aviation \ninfrastructure. Everybody thinks aviation infrastructure is important. \nI certainly do. The manager of the Seattle airport was testifying. As \npart of his role as CEO of the American Association of Airport \nExecutives, he talked about how it took almost 4 years to build the \nSeattle airport's new runway. It seems like a fair amount of time. \nMaybe a construction project like that takes a fair amount of time. I \nhad a question for him, which I didn't know the answer to. I asked him: \nHow long did it take to get the Federal permits, to go through the \nFederal permitting system to build this additional runway at the \nSeattle airport?\n  His answer: 15 years--15 years to get the Federal permits to build a \nrunway. You could have heard--well, you did hear the whole committee, \nthe whole audience. They gasped. Then he said: They built the Great \nPyramids of Egypt faster than that.\n  This is what is going on in our country, and this town is to blame. \nIt is happening all over the country. Americans need to know this. It \nonly took 9 years to permit a desalinization plan, which would provide \nmuch needed fresh water to drought-stricken California. Simply razing a \nbridge in New York--not building a new bridge, razing one--took 5 years \nand 20,000 pages of Federal permitting requirements.\n  The average time it now takes in America to get Federal approval for \na major highway project is more than 6 years--again, not to build a \nhighway but to get the Federal permission. It took almost 20 years, if \nyou include the litigation, to get Federal permission to build a single \ngold mine in Alaska--20 years. We had to take that all the way to the \nU.S. Supreme Court because the Federal Government was not supporting \nus. Now the Kensington mine employs over 300 people at an average wage \nof $100,000 per person. Those are great jobs. We have a Federal \nGovernment that wants to delay, delay, delay.\n  Let's talk about the Keystone Pipeline. We had a debate here--7 years \nand counting to build a pipeline in terms of the Federal permits. Who \nis hurt by this? Our friends on the other side talk a lot about the \ncompanies and everything--TransCanada. The people who are hurt by this \nare American families, middle-class workers, union members.\n  One of the most surprising things I saw as a freshman this year when \nwe were debating the override of the Keystone Pipeline--the State \nDepartment had predicted this would create as many as 30,000 jobs. \nThese are good jobs--construction jobs, real jobs, real Americans \nworking to build something important. I was presiding in the Chair like \nyou, Mr. President, and some of the Members on the other side of the \naisle started arguing that these aren't real jobs because they are \ntemporary, that this isn't going to create 30,000 jobs because they are \ntemporary jobs. I about fell out of my chair. Construction jobs aren't \nreal jobs? Since when is that the case?\n  According to the President's own Small Business Administration, the \nregulatory costs on small businesses in the United States are close to \n$2 trillion per year. That is $15,000 per family. The bottom line is, \nwe know we can do better. We have to do better if we want to grow this \ncountry and create jobs.\n  I believe there is a silver lining. I believe things have gotten so \nbad that this delay is happening everywhere on projects that matter to \nus as a nation. Projects that are so weighted down under redtape are \nmaking Americans, regardless of party, start to take note. I have seen \na silver lining here. Both Democrats and Republicans are starting to \ndemand change. They are demanding bold and serious regulatory reform.\n  I have had conversations with Members of both sides of the aisle here \nabout how important this is for our economy, how important it is for \njobs. That is why this debate today on the waters of the United States \nis so important.\n  Unfortunately, we didn't get the number of bills. We did have a \npretty strong bipartisan group. I think we would have gotten to 59--1 \nvote short to move forward. It is unfortunate that the other side \ncouldn't see the merits of this. But this rule will not help grow our \neconomy. This rule will continue to stifle growth. This rule will \ncertainly continue to kill jobs. It takes\n\n[[Page S7711]]\n\nwhat we all want--certainly, the whole idea of protecting our water, \nclean water. In my State of Alaska we have the cleanest water of any \nState in the country. We win awards every year for our clean, pristine \nwater. It is not because the EPA is making that happen; it is because \nAlaskans are making that happen. But it takes the Clean Water Act and \nsomehow, through a rule that the EPA itself has devised, it gives the \nEPA the power to regulate not major rivers but water in our backyards, \nliterally.\n  Almost certainly this rule doesn't comport with Federal law. We have \nnow had two courts say that. There is a stay on it nationally. The \nSixth Circuit has put a stay on this rule. Over 30 States have sued to \nstop this rule--a bipartisan coalition of States--because it is almost \ncertainly not legal.\n  I asked Administrator McCarthy about the legal opinion, the legal \nbasis they had for this rule. I have never gotten an answer from the \nEPA Administrator. I am not sure they even care. In the last two \nSupreme Court terms, the EPA has lost two big cases in the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. They have lost the Sixth Circuit case for now. Unfortunately, we \nhad the Administrator of the EPA on TV a few months ago, on the eve of \nthis Supreme Court case--EPA vs. Michigan. When asked if she was going \nto win the case, she said: We think we are going to win, but ultimately \nit doesn't really matter because the companies have already had to \ncomply with hundreds of millions of dollars. Think about that. Think \nabout what she said.\n  This rule is going to have a huge, profound impact on my State. \nAlaska has more waters under the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act \nthan any other State in the country. Over 50 percent of America's \nwetlands are located in Alaska.\n  I held multiple field hearings as a chairman of the subcommittee on \nfisheries, water, and wildlife on the waters of the United States rule. \nIt is clear to me that Alaskans of vastly different backgrounds, \nideologies, and different parts of the State are opposed to this rule. \nOne group in my State said the rule would ``straitjacket any \ndevelopment.'' Another said that it would have negative impacts on \n``virtually any economic development project'' in Alaska.\n  One project we are very focused on in Alaska--we are having a special \nsession right now in our State legislature--is the Alaska LNG Project, \na very large-scale LNG project that, like TAPS, will be great for the \ncountry and create thousands of jobs and energy security for Americans \nand our allies. This rule, if left in its present form, will very \nnegatively impact the cost and timeline of that project.\n  Simply put, the waters of the United States is one of the largest \nland grabs in history, and it is an example of the kind of challenges \nwe need to address here to get our economy moving again, to create good \njobs for Americans. It is why this debate we are having is so \nimportant.\n  These are problems we can fix. We know we can fix them. Americans \nsent us here to fix these problems, and we need to start by stopping \nrules like the waters of the United States that undermine our country's \nfuture and the jobs that we need throughout this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I see a number of Senators on the \nfloor. I don't know if there is an order at this point that has been \nestablished. What is our manner of proceeding? Senator Isakson is here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time agreement.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I ask unanimous consent that the Chair recognize Senator \nWhitehouse from Rhode Island, followed by Senator Isakson, and then \nSenator Daines.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Before that matter is settled, reserving the right to \nobject, I will be speaking for about 15 minutes. If one of you is going \nto be quicker than that, particularly significantly quicker--not 14 \nminutes--I would be happy to yield and let somebody go first.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. The Senator from Montana is going to preside at 6:30 \np.m., so I think he is the one who will need to go, and I will go after \nthe Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Why doesn't the Senator from Montana proceed with his \nremarks.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Chair \nrecognize the Senator from Montana, Mr. Daines, followed by Senator \nWhitehouse, followed by Senator Isakson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today the Senate came a few votes shy of \npassing legislation to protect our farmers, ranchers, and small \nbusiness owners from major new costs and regulatory burdens. I \nappreciate the bipartisan support demonstrated today by four key Senate \nDemocrats. I have to say, I am disappointed that others chose instead \nto put loyalty to President Obama before the concerns of the \nconstituents, the concerns of those people they represent.\n  Montanans know that this power grab has more to do with controlling \nMontanans' land-use decisions than ensuring access to clean water as \nthe Clean Water Act intended. This is an ill-conceived rule that \nprovides the EPA unprecedented power to regulate virtually any spot \nacross Montana that is occasionally wet. This could have a devastating \nimpact on Montana jobs, on Montana's natural resources and ag \nindustries, and on Montanans' property rights.\n  Don't just take my word for it. POLITICO recently described it as \nhaving the potential to ``give bureaucrats carte blanche to swoop in \nand penalize landowners every time a cow walks through a ditch.'' The \nEPA's own estimates show this rule will cost Americans between $158 \nmillion and $465 million a year.\n  The New York Times describes how harrowing this situation is for \nMontana farmers: ``Farmers fear that the rule could impose major new \ncosts and burdens, requiring them to pay fees for environmental \nassessments and obtain permits just to till the soil near gullies, \nditches, or dry streambeds where water flows only when it rains.''\n  In Montana, this rule has received a severe rebuke from our farmers, \nour ranchers, and our small businesses who simply can't afford this \noverreach. The Montana chamber president and CEO, Webb Brown, said:\n\n       If this rule stands, there will be tremendous cost to our \n     states, our economies, and our employers, and their \n     employees' families. Under this unprecedented extension of \n     federal power, land and water use decisions will be made in \n     Washington, D.C., far from the affected local communities.\n\n  Here is what Gene Curry of Valier, MT, from the Montana Stockgrowers \nAssociation says: ``This rule is an unwise and unwarranted expansion of \nEPA's regulatory authority over Montana's waters, and would have a \nsignificant detrimental impact on Montana's ranchers.''\n  Listen to Charlie Bumgarner, president of the Montana Grain Growers. \nI met with Charlie a week ago in Montana. Charlie says this: ``If \nimplemented, the final WOTUS rule would have a devastating impact on \ngrain growers across the state.''\n  Listen to Dustin Stewart with the Montana Homebuilders Association. I \ngrew up in the home building industry. My dad is a home builder. Here \nis what Dustin had to say: ``The EPA's waters of the U.S. regulation is \nan incurably flawed rule. . . . ''\n\n  Dave Galt, the executive director of the Montana Petroleum \nAssociation, said:\n\n       The EPA's new water rule is an unnecessary expansion of \n     jurisdiction for the Federal Government. The EPA's rule will \n     negatively impact all land-use industries including \n     agriculture and energy production.\n\n  Yet, despite this broad opposition, President Obama is moving forward \nwith yet another out-of-touch Washington, DC, regulation. But already \ntwo Federal courts have issued a stay on this misguided rule, \ndemonstrating the questionable legal ground this regulation stands on. \nThis is a rule issued by the same Federal Agency that has continued to \nperpetuate a war on American energy. In fact, earlier this year we saw \nthe Supreme Court issue a severe rebuke of the EPA's mercury and air \ntoxic standards which would have a direct and lasting impact on our \neconomy in Montana. This MATS rule, just like WOTUS, is just one of the \nnew, burdensome regulations cooked up by the Obama administration and\n\n[[Page S7712]]\n\nhas the potential to eliminate good-paying jobs and devastate the \nlivelihoods of hard-working Montana families and hard-working American \nfamilies.\n  Throughout my home State of Montana, we have tremendous opportunities \nto develop our State's natural resources and create new jobs, and that \nis a good thing. Rather than hitting pause on our energy production, we \nneed to encourage it. But the Obama administration is doing exactly the \nopposite.\n  President Obama's full assault on American energy independence has \nmost recently resulted in TransCanada's decision to suspend its \napplication to build the commonsense Keystone XL Pipeline, which, by \nthe way, first enters Montana from Canada. This pipeline would have \ncreated new opportunities for good-paying jobs, helped advance American \nenergy independence, and lowered American energy prices.\n  Well, the suspension on Keystone is bad news, but it is not the end \nof the line. We are going to keep fighting for this job-creating \nproject that has the overwhelming bipartisan approval of Congress as \nwell as the support of the American people because America can and \nAmerica should power the world. But the Obama administration's \nrelentless attacks on affordable energy and good-paying union jobs, as \nwell as tribal jobs, through this so-called Clean Power Plan continue \nto hinder innovation. Under the final so-called Clean Power Plan, the \nColstrip powerplant in Montana will likely be shuttered, putting \nthousands of jobs at risk.\n  Our farmers, ranchers, and local business owners should be empowered \nto drive local land use decisions, not a bunch of Washington, DC, \nbureaucrats who can't even find Montana on a map. We can only do it if \nthe Obama administration steps back from its extreme overreach and \nallows American innovation to thrive once again.\n  I look forward to casting my vote tomorrow to permanently stop this \nmisguided waters of the United States rule. It is time to ditch this \nrule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                            Clean Power Plan\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I guess in the order proceeding here, \nI am here to bring the opposing views. Every week we are here, I remind \nthis body of the damage carbon pollution is doing to our atmosphere and \nto our oceans. I have traveled to Senator Isakson's State to see what \nthe University of Georgia is measuring off of Sapelo Island, and I hope \nto have the chance to go west to continue this.\n  We have to wake up to climate change, and we have to move toward a \nclean-energy economy and the jobs and innovation that support it. Clear \nmeasurements exist of the harm that is already happening: climbing sea \nlevels, we measure; climbing global temperatures, we measure; \nacidifying oceans, we measure.\n  Virtually every respected scientific and academic institution agrees \nthat climate change is happening and that human activities--\nspecifically carbon emissions--are driving it. Carbon pollution is \naffecting our economy, it is affecting agriculture and wildfires, and \nit is affecting storms and insurance costs.\n  There are so many people--doctors and health professionals, military \nand security leaders, insurance and reinsurance industry folks, our \nmajor utilities, American corporations, and our faith leaders all agree \nthat climate change is a serious challenge and an important priority. \nYet here, despite the growing chorus around the country calling for \nclimate action, we hear congressional Republicans, such as the majority \nleader, claim they are here to stand up for our people by blocking the \nPresident's Clean Power Plan.\n  As carbon pollution piles up in the atmosphere, who are they standing \nup for? Certainly not the American people. Eighty-three percent of \nAmericans, including 6 in 10 Republicans, want action to reduce carbon \nemissions. The Clean Power Plan delivers.\n  For the first time, we have a national plan to reduce carbon \npollution from the largest source of U.S. carbon emissions, which is \npowerplants. The 50 dirtiest coal plants in America together emit more \ncarbon pollution than all of South Korea and more than all of Canada. \nAre we going to do nothing about that?\n  Too often we hear on the Republican side folks who trumpet these \nindustry-backed, one-sided reports that point only to the cost of \naction. They don't even measure or consider the cost of inaction. If \nyou were an accountant and did the books that way, you would go to \njail. Well, if you look at both sides of the ledger, the EPA shows that \nthe projected health benefits of the Clean Power Plan will avoid \n300,000 missed work and school days, 1,700 heart attacks, 90,000 asthma \nattacks, and 3,600 premature deaths every year. Every dollar invested \nthrough the Clean Power Plan will keep up to $4 in American families' \npockets. The savings are also passed on to electricity consumers, with \nthe average American family projected to save almost $85 per year on \ntheir electric bill by 2030.\n  I am from New England. We have the Regional Greenhouse Gas \nInitiative, RGGI, and it is proving that States grow their economies at \nthe same time that they cut emissions. Putting a price on carbon and \nplowing that money back into clean energy products is saving us \nbillions of dollars and helping to reduce carbon pollution.\n  The EPA put the States in the driver's seat to come up with plans \nthat suit them. An analysis from the Union of Concerned Scientists \nshows that ``31 States are already on track to be more than halfway \ntoward meeting their 2022 Clean Power Plan benchmarks.'' These States \ninclude both cap-and-trade States, such as California and the Northeast \nRGGI States, and coal-heavy States, such as Iowa, Ohio, and Kentucky.\n  ``We can meet it,'' says Kentucky energy and environment secretary \nLeonard Peters about the plan. ``We can meet it.'' In fact, Dr. Peters \npraised the EPA for working with States like Kentucky to build this \nrule. ``The outreach they've done, I think, is incredible,'' he said. \nThe EPA had an ``open door policy. You could call them, talk to them, \nmeet with them.''\n  The Kentucky experience was echoed around the country, as EPA listens \nclosely to hundreds of concerns, holds hundreds of public meetings, and \nthe final rule includes significant adjustments to accommodate \nindividual State's concerns.\n  Even with all of this, the majority leader, the senior Senator from \nKentucky, will brook no serious conversation about climate change. We \njust never have that come up as a subject. The Republican leader, in a \nmodern, massive resistance effort, wrote to all 50 Governors urging \ndefiance of Federal regulation, calling the regulations ``extremely \nburdensome and costly.'' That might have been a more credible \nallegation about the regulations if he had not reached it months before \nthe regulations were even finalized.\n  The Clean Power Plan, says the majority leader, is the latest battle \nin a great ``War on Coal.'' He says, ``[W]e have a depression in \ncentral Appalachia created because of the President's zeal to have an \nimpact worldwide on the issue of climate.'' It seems that the head of \none of his region's biggest electric utilities doesn't agree. \nAppalachian Power president and CEO Charles Patton told a meeting of \nenergy executives last week that coal can no longer compete against \ncheaper alternatives such as natural gas and wind power. Coal, he said, \nwill continue to decline with or without the Clean Power Plan. It has \nnothing to do with the President. ``If we believe we can just change \nadministrations and this issue is going to go away,'' Patton said, \n``we're making a terrible mistake.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article titled ``Coal \nnot coming back, Appalachian Power president says'' and editorial \ntitled ``Reality check on coal, future'' be printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  It says:\n\n       With or without the Clean Power Plan, the economics of \n     alternatives to fossil-based fuels are making end roads in \n     the utility plan, companies are making decisions today where \n     they are moving away from coal-fired generation. The debate \n     largely at this time has been lost.\n\n  Mr. Patton is not alone. In September, financial giant Goldman Sachs \nreleased several bleak reports on the future of the global coal market. \nThe latest report was in September, where they drew the conclusion that \n``[t]he industry does not require a new investment given the ability of \nexisting assets to satisfy flat demand, so prices\n\n[[Page S7713]]\n\nwill remain under pressure as the deflationary cycle continues.'' In \nplain English, market forces are driving coal's decline. I seriously \ndoubt that any colleague would think Goldman Sachs is a bunch of \nliberal greenies who launched a war on coal. This is their clear \neconomic thought.\n  Since the clean power rule was finalized in August, the massive \nresistance the majority leader sought has not ensued.\n  Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear has so far not heeded the majority \nleader's call to rebel.\n  Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin, the first to publicly pledge to resist \nthe President's plan, recently hinted that Oklahoma would submit a \ncompliance plan after all.\n  Indeed, even while West Virginia leads the multistate lawsuit against \nEPA, Governor Earl Tomblin announced last week that his administration \nwill begin working on a compliance plan. In the heart of coal country, \nin Charleston, WV, the newspaper, Gazette-Mail, praised the Governor's \nmove, writing on its editorial page:\n\n       It is the right thing to do--both to decrease emissions \n     that contribute to human-caused climate change--\n\n  Here is a newspaper in the heart of coal country conceding that \nemissions contribute to human-caused climate change, and I don't know \nwhy we can't get over that in the Senate--\n\n     and as the governor says, to make sure West Virginia's \n     interests are best represented in how the plan is carried \n     out.\n\n  They described Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell's urge to rebel \nagainst the rule as petulant and foolish. That is from the heart of \ncoal country.\n  The coal industry, like an aging ship at sea, is taking on water. \nBetween the costs of old, dirty powerplants and the competitive \nadvantage of cheaper natural gas, coal is struggling to stay afloat. As \nMr. Patton from Appalachian Power pointed out, those circumstances have \nnothing to do with whoever is sitting in the Oval office.\n  For States that have relied on coal for generations, the Clean Power \nPlan is actually a lifeboat. It is a chance to kick-start new \nindustries and innovative technologies and to choose the path forward \nthat is best for your State and your citizens. It is a way off a \nsinking ship.\n  Recognizing the costs of carbon pollution is another lifeboat. I know \nthis sounds strange to my colleagues, but please bear with me. You \ncan't build the carbon capture plants that could keep coal plants \noperating if they are free to pollute. There is no economic value to a \ncarbon capture plant if it is free to pollute. The truculent insistence \non this market failure by Big Coal is ironically coal's own undoing. \nYet congressional Republicans won't engage. They waste time with the \nuseless Gingrich-era Congressional Review Act efforts to block carbon \npollution controls on powerplants--controls that Americans \noverwhelmingly support.\n  Beyond that, our Republican friends simply have no plan--nothing. \nThere is no plan B to the President's Clean Power Plan. If you have \nsomething else, please bring it forward. We can debate which is better, \nbut you can't just pretend this isn't a problem. They have no plan to \ndeal with climate change, no plan to help coal-reliant communities find \nsafe passage to a more sustainable economic future.\n  I ask my colleagues to please read what the CEO of Appalachian Power \nsaid. Please take it to heart. Please read the Charleston Gazette-Mail \neditorial. Please engage with us while we can still do some good \nbecause when the market completely collapses, when there is nothing \nleft to do, when coal is priced out by solar and wind and natural gas \nand other fuels, then it is too late to come back and say: Now we need \nhelp. When the market has acted and someone suffers as a result, they \ndon't get any sympathy in this building.\n\n  Now is the time when people who want to make this a smooth transition \nfor coal economies need to come forward in the interests of their own \npeople, in the interests of their own miners who need their pensions \nfilled and fixed, in the interests of communities that need \ntransitions, in the interests of their economy.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Georgia for his patience.\n  I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Charleston Gazette-Mail, Oct. 27, 2015]\n\n         Coal Not Coming Back, Appalachian Power President Says\n\n                           (By David Gutman)\n\n       Roanoke.--Coal consumption is not likely to increase, \n     regardless of whether new federal regulations on power plants \n     go into effect, and, from coal's perspective, the national \n     debate on coal and climate change has largely been lost, the \n     president of West Virginia's largest electric utility told a \n     roomful of energy executives Tuesday.\n       The Clean Power Plan, the Obama administration's proposal \n     to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, would \n     cut coal consumption--but even if the regulations are \n     blocked, coal consumption will not increase, Appalachian \n     Power President Charles Patton said at the state Energy \n     Summit at the Stonewall Resort.\n       ``You just can't go with new coal [plants] at this point in \n     time,'' Patton said. ``It is just not economically feasible \n     to do so.''\n       Patton acknowledged that entire communities, particularly \n     across Southern West Virginia, are being decimated by coal's \n     decline. However, he laid out a series of stark economic \n     realities.\n       By 2026, Patton said, Appalachian Power expects its use of \n     coal power to be down 26 percent, with or without the Clean \n     Power Plan.\n       That's because of cheaper alternatives and already-imposed \n     environmental regulations that make coal uncompetitive, \n     Patton said.\n       The cost of natural gas electricity, including construction \n     of power plants and infrastructure, is about $73 per megawatt \n     hour, Patton said. For a conventional coal plant, it's $95 \n     per megawatt hour.\n       Even wind power, which is less dependable than coal, is \n     still significantly cheaper, at $73 per megawatt hour, when a \n     longstanding tax credit for wind energy production is \n     factored in.\n       An advanced coal power plant, with carbon capture and \n     storage to lower emissions, costs nearly twice as much, at \n     $144 per megawatt hour, Patton said.\n       ``With or without the Clean Power Plan, the economics of \n     alternatives to fossil-based fuels are making inroads in the \n     utility plan,'' Patton said. ``Companies are making decisions \n     today where they are moving away from coal-fired \n     generation.''\n       What's more, the debate over the ``war on coal,'' which \n     sucks up so much of the political air in West Virginia, has \n     largely been settled in other states, Patton said\n       He said 72 percent of Americans believe the earth is \n     getting warmer and that man-made causes are partly \n     attributable. Nearly two-thirds of Americans favor stricter \n     emissions limits on greenhouse gases, Patton said, with even \n     larger majorities among young people.\n       ``Americans believe there is a problem, and while we in \n     West Virginia believe that's ludicrous and we have our view \n     on coal, it's really important to understand, if you're not \n     in a coal-producing state, your affinity for coal is not \n     there,'' Patton said. ``The debate largely, at this point in \n     time, has been lost.''\n       Patton reminded the audience that the closest the United \n     States ever came to a carbon tax was the cap-and-trade bill \n     pushed by Sens. Joe Lieberman and John McCain. ``I don't see \n     John McCain as a flaming liberal,'' Patton said.\n       He said he opposes the Clean Power Plan and said West \n     Virginia should continue its lawsuit to block it. However, \n     Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin said Tuesday that West Virginia will \n     submit a plan to comply with the Clean Power Plan--despite \n     Republican calls to boycott it--while those lawsuits play \n     out.\n       Patton said the federal regulations, intended to help stave \n     off the worst effects of climate change, would cause a \n     reduction in coal use, but even defeating the regulations \n     won't make the push to address climate change disappear.\n       He urged the crowd to ``think globally'' and work to \n     advance cleaner-burning coal technologies.\n       ``If we believe that we can just change administrations and \n     this issue is going to go away,'' Patton said, ``we're making \n     a terrible mistake.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the Charleston Gazette-Mail, Oct. 30, 2015]\n\n            Gazette Editorial: Reality Check on Coal, Future\n\n       To his credit, Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin says West Virginia \n     will participate in the federal Clean Power Plan by \n     submitting its own proposal for cutting greenhouse gas \n     emissions. He may be doing it with an air of resignation and \n     distaste, but then again, no one likes the fact that West \n     Virginians are struggling as market forces undercut an \n     industry that has employed generations of people.\n       It is the right thing to do--both to decrease emissions \n     that contribute to human-caused climate change, and as the \n     governor says, to make sure West Virginia's interests are \n     best represented in how the plan is carried out. States that \n     choose not to come up with their own plan, as Kentucky's Sen. \n     Mitch McConnell has petulantly and foolishly urged, will be \n     handed one by the federal government. Gov. Tomblin is right. \n     Better to have a say in how drastic changes will play out in \n     your own state.\n       Arguments against trying to head off the worst effects of \n     climate change are hollow.\n\n[[Page S7714]]\n\n     Some elected officials (and their fossil fuel industry \n     promoters) seem to think that because China is a big \n     polluter, for example, the United States should just shrug \n     and give up. That is no way to be a world leader. That is no \n     way to stimulate new technological developments and \n     industries.\n       Indeed, the Clean Power Plan is part of the reason why \n     China has committed to limiting its own carbon dioxide \n     emissions. Where the United States goes, the world follows.\n       The War on Coal public relations campaign has been a \n     smashing success, convincing the most vulnerable working \n     people and retirees that if only they could get the nasty \n     federal government off their backs, all would right itself to \n     some vague and misty perfection, circa 1955. West Virginians, \n     in turn, convince their elected leaders to defend the status \n     quo at all costs.\n       Senators Joe Manchin and Shelley Moore Capito are steady on \n     the job, clinging to the past, signing on to a resolution \n     that seeks to block the Clean Power Plan.\n       Of course, defeating efforts to further clean up the air \n     locally won't bring coal back. The people pushing the \n     campaign know it. The rest of the country knows it.\n       Appalachian Power CEO Charles Patton, who buys more coal \n     than anyone, knows it. Also speaking at the state Energy \n     Summit at the Stonewall Resort this week, he reiterated a \n     message he has shared before: Coal isn't coming back, even \n     without the Clean Power Plan, because of price. Coal is more \n     expensive than wind or natural gas, partly because of \n     existing environmental regulations, partly because natural \n     gas is so cheap.\n       The goal now is to manage this change, to help people into \n     new livelihoods and meaningful work, to minimize the \n     predictable suffering of families and communities. West \n     Virginia has wasted enough time.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I appreciate the words of the \ndistinguished Senator from Rhode Island, and I always enjoy his \nspeeches, whether I am on the floor or watching him back in my office. \nHe is an articulate spokesman for what he believes, which is one of the \nthings that make this Senate an important body. While from time to time \nI differ in terms of carbon emissions because of nuclear energy, that \nis part of the solution to the problems of the future, and I will speak \nabout that on another day.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I would be glad to speak with the \nSenator from Georgia about that because he may find we agree more than \nwe disagree.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I think we probably would, and that is why I brought it \nup, and I look forward to that.\n  We are hear to talk about the rule for the waters of the United \nStates undertaken by the EPA.\n  When I started working this afternoon and preparing myself for what I \nwould say to try to make my point and express myself, I listened at 3 \np.m. to the speech by Senator Ben Sasse from Nebraska. Today he made \nhis maiden speech on the floor of the Senate. Because I had an \nimportant appointment to get to, I do know exactly how long he spoke. \nHe spoke for 27 minutes--because that is how late I was for my \nappointment. But his speech was so good and so important and it \naffected so much this rule of the waters of the United States that I \nwanted to include it in my remarks tonight.\n  What Senator Sasse said very simply is this: In his 1 year in the \nU.S. Senate, observing the Senate and how it operates, how we all \noperate, he went back to his constituents and spoke to them. One thing \nhe talked about is how we are moving more and more toward the \ngovernment of an executive branch and a judicial branch and moving away \nfrom the legislative branch. We have administrations like the current \nadministration which is trying to enforce the law through \nadministrative rules and executive orders, not through legislation. He \ndidn't just point out that being a Democratic situation, it is \nRepublican as well.\n  If we look over the last 35 years, there has been a growth in the \nnumber of edicts that have come down regulatory-wise rather than \nlegislatively. It is important for us to return the legislative branch \nof government to its appropriate place so we have a balance between \nlegislative, executive, and judicial.\n  I use the waters of the U.S.A. rule to explain to my colleagues why \nthat is so important. This is a horrible rule. It is a rule that is \ngoing to be litigated in court for the next 30 to 40 years. Why? \nBecause the clean water bill, which is its predecessor, has been \nlitigated for 30 or 40 years, and eventually we have come to good water \npolicies--not because that is where we started, it is because that is \nwhere we ended.\n  I wish to take a few experiences that I had working on the Clean \nWater Act in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s to make the point of why the \nwaters of the United States bill is so dangerous.\n  The Clean Water Act passed with almost unanimous support. There was \nsome opposition. Almost everybody said: I can't be against clean water; \neverybody wants clean water. But then there is the word ``promulgate.'' \nWe passed a law that expressed the intent of Congress, and then we said \nit is up to the agencies responsible for promulgating the laws, the \nrules, and regulations necessary to carry out the intent of the law. \nTherein lies the problem because agencies like the EPA start \npromulgating rules which take the force and effect of the law, which \ncause the wrong thing to happen.\n  Let me tell my colleagues what is going to happen with the waters of \nthe U.S.A. if it becomes a rule. We are going to give the power to the \nEPA that we have given under eminent domain to cities and counties and \nStates in the United States. Eminent domain is the way the government \nwas allowed under the Constitution to take property but reimburse the \nowner of the property for the damage done by the government in the \ntaking for road rights-of-way, sewer lines, water projects, and things \nof that nature. This is a grant for eminent domain to an agency without \nany requirement to compensate the person from whom they have taken the \nland or restricted the use of the land.\n  The Presiding Officer mentioned that his father and family were in \nthe homebuilding industry. I was in the homebuilding industry too and \nthe land development industry. What we do is we add value to the land. \nWe add value to its resources. We improve its drainage and use of \nwater. But if we have a regulatory agency that makes it too expensive \nto develop the land, we go out of business and the community goes out \nof business because there is no new housing. The effect of the rule is \nit shuts down the economy, growth, and opportunity; it doesn't add to \nit.\n  So it is very important to understand that when somebody says ``We \nare going to pass a waters of the U.S.A. rule that is going to improve \nthe quality of our water, and we are going to do so by delegating to \nthe EPA--an unelected appointment agency--the power to tell you what \nyou have to do,'' they are in effect saying that they are giving the \npower of eminent domain to the EPA without a requirement that you as a \nlandowner be compensated.\n  The reason America is different from every other country on the face \nof this Earth is because we are a nation of individual landowners. We \nown our country, and we are still good stewards of our land, and we \nappreciate that opportunity. In most countries around the world, people \ndon't have the opportunity to own the land and have private ownership. \nThey lease their little place in life and that is where they go. \nAmerica is different, and that is what made us different. But if we are \nlandowners and we come under a waters of the U.S.A. rule and the EPA \nprovides edicts that have the force and effect of law without the \nrequirement to be compensated by an unjust agency that is enforcing a \nrule or regulation, we are becoming nothing better than a European \ncountry or, worse than that, a country that no longer has the benefit \nof private ownership of land.\n  So it is very important that we understand that the quality of water \nis important, protecting our water is important, but it is a balance, \nand it is a balance between the user, the landowner, and the \ngovernment. What we need to do is come together to develop policies \nthat are necessary to see to it that we have a good quality of water \nand we have good use of our water but not a dictatorial agency in the \nFederal Government given the total priority to control our land and its \nuse.\n  I love this country. I love the opportunity it has given to me and \nthe opportunity to serve in the U.S. Senate, to take my life \nexperiences and try to add to the quality of legislation we pass here. \nI hope we will pass the Ernst legislation and stop the growth of the \nwaters of the U.S.A. rule and get everybody--all the users--to come to \nthe table and talk about positive ways to protect the quality of our \nwater and\n\n[[Page S7715]]\n\nthe use and the management of our water but not the confiscation of our \nproperty and the dictates of an agency rather than an elected body.\n  We do not need America to become a dictatorial country. We need to \ncontinue to be a country of participation and negotiation, where \neverybody at the table has a stake and where in the end we work for the \nbest interests of all, not just the interests of an agency or, worse \nthan that, a central belief within that agency.\n  This rule is a rule that is bad for farmers, developers, landowners, \ncities, counties, water authorities, wastewater authorities, sewer \ntreatment plants, and anybody else who has water.\n  I want to read what the EPA's coverage is in this bill. It says:\n\n       The flawed rule of the EPA to regulate nearly all water \n     includes manmade water management systems, water that \n     infiltrates into the ground or moves over land, and any other \n     water the EPA decides has a significant nexus to downstream \n     water based on the use by animals, insects, birds, and on \n     water storage considerations.\n\n  There is no other provision in there. It includes all water. It is \nthe authority for EPA to regulate it.\n  We have a farm bureau in Georgia that came up with the right slogan. \nThey just simply said, after talking about the rule, after talking \nabout waters in the U.S.A., there is only one thing we need to do: We \nneed to ditch the rule.\n  It is time tonight for the Senate to adopt the Ernst provision, ditch \nthe rule, and go back to the table and pass laws that are partnership \nlaws between landowners, land developers, the local communities, local \ncity councils, local county commissions, the local States. Let's not be \na nation that edicts from the top down, but let's have solutions from \nthe bottom up that always protect land ownership and land distribution \nand never take control of the water out of the hands of the States and \nmove it to Washington, DC, where there is no accountability.\n  Last but not least, do not give the power of eminent domain--by that \nname or any other name--to the U.S. Government and take away the right \nto compensate because if you do, you become no better than a third-\nworld nation, and it would be no good for the United States of America.\n  I see the majority leader has come to the floor, and I am anxious to \nhear his remarks because I know his name was invoked a few moments ago, \nso I will yield back my time. I am sure the majority leader would like \nto speak.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/03/senate-section/article/S7715-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN.

Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a \ndistinguished Kentuckian who is being honored by the Commonwealth and \nby the many people who know and respect his life's work. The late John \nDavid Goodlette came from small town beginnings: he was born in Hazard, \nKY, in 1925 to Dudley and Lillian Goodlette. He would go on to become a \nhighly respected rocket engineer who was instrumental in the Viking \nmissions to land American spacecraft on the surface of the planet Mars.\n  From a young age, John had a passion for flight and aircraft. He \nwould assemble model aircraft as a hobby, and this hobby soon grew to \ninclude piloting gliders and small aircraft. John's interest in flight \nled him to study engineering, and after graduating from Hazard High \nSchool in 1943, he would enroll at the University of Kentucky, where he \nstudied mechanical engineering. His studies were interrupted by his \nservice in the U.S. Army during World War II, when John served as a \ntugboat captain in the South Pacific. After resuming his studies at UK, \nhe graduated in 1949.\n  The majority of John's professional career was spent at the Martin \nMarietta Corp., now known as Lockheed Martin, where he worked for 39 \nyears. His research initially focused on jet propulsion, heat transfer, \nand thermodynamics, but he soon found himself immersed in developing \nrocket programs for the company.\n  In 1956, John was selected to lead Martin Marietta's Titan \nintercontinental ballistic missile project. The project led him to \nincrease his familiarity with nuclear physics, high-speed gas dynamics, \nand electrical engineering.\n  Then came the project that would be the highlight of John's career: \nthe Viking project. John served as chief engineer on this project for \n10 years, which culminated with the successful landing of two Viking \nspacecraft on the surface of Mars in July and September of 1976.\n  ``The Viking was one of those heart-in-the-mouth things,'' John has \nbeen quoted as saying. ``We never knew for sure it was going to work. \nThat kept us going at a fever pitch to make sure all went right.''\n  The Viking program was the most expensive and ambitious mission to \nMars to that point and resulted in the bulk of our knowledge of the Red \nPlanet for the next several decades. They were highly successful \nmissions for which John Goodlette rightfully deserves a large share of \nthe credit.\n  John is being inducted into the Kentucky Aviation Hall of Fame for \nhis pioneering role in aviation and space exploration. Students and \naviation enthusiasts from all over the Commonwealth, but especially \nfrom Hazard, can be proud of what this son of Kentucky accomplished in \na brilliant career devoted to technology and science.\n  John also serves as an inspiration at the Challenger Learning Center \nof Kentucky, which uses space exploration as a tool to excite and \ninspire students to learn science, technology, engineering, and \nmathematics. The Center is located in Hazard, John's hometown.\n  John would go on to serve as a vice president of Martin Marietta and \nretire in 1991 after 39 years with the company. He has sadly passed on \nnow and is unable to witness this historic occasion in his honor, but \nmembers of his family will be present at the Kentucky Aviation Hall of \nFame induction ceremony.\n  I know John's three children, Sarah, David, and Alice, must be proud \nof all their father accomplished in his remarkable career. John not \nonly served his country in uniform, he also added greatly to the sum \ntotal of knowledge in the universe for the benefit of his country and \nall of mankind.\n  On behalf of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, I want to thank the \nGoodlette family and express my admiration and respect for John David \nGoodlette's life and work. We are truly grateful for his passion to \nexploration and his service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/03/senate-section/article/S7715-3", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7715-S7716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RECOGNIZING THE 125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF YOSEMITE \n                             NATIONAL PARK\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \ncelebrating the 125th anniversary of Yosemite National Park, a \nCalifornia treasure nestled against the stunning backdrop of the Sierra \nNevada mountain range.\n  In 1864, President Abraham Lincoln signed the Yosemite Grant Act, a \nlandmark bill granting 39,000 acres of Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa \nBig Tree Grove to the State of California. This was the first time the \nUnited States had ever set aside land to protect it for the public to \nenjoy. Three decades later, Yosemite became the Nation's third national \npark--1,500 square miles of stunning waterfalls, magnificent sequoia \ntrees, breathtaking mountain peaks, and portions of ancestral homeland \nfor several American Indian tribes and groups.\n  Over the years, Yosemite National Park has been a leader, becoming \nthe first national park to hire a female law enforcement ranger, open a \nmuseum, and establish partnerships to help preserve Yosemite for future \ngenerations. Yosemite has also championed efforts to reduce waste and \npollution by establishing recycling programs in the 1970s and operating \na fleet of hybrid electric shuttle buses.\n  Since its earliest days, Yosemite National Park has provided \nsanctuary, comfort, and inspiration to millions of visitors from across \nthe globe who come to experience its natural splendor, rich geologic \nhistory, and abundant wildlife. The timeless beauty of Yosemite \nNational Park is a testament to the vision and commitment of countless \ndedicated people and institutions over the past 125 years. I want to\n\n[[Page S7716]]\n\nexpress my deep gratitude to the staff, volunteers, and friends of \nYosemite for all they do to protect this natural wonder, and I am \npleased to join in honoring this special anniversary occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/03/senate-section/article/S7716-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   OBSERVING ADOPTION AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, each November we celebrate National Adoption \nAwareness Month to recognize the families that choose to adopt and the \norganizations that support them. During this month, we honor those who \nwelcome these children into their homes and hearts, help them to grow \nto their full potential, and give them a better future. Today I would \nlike to draw attention to the importance of adoption and raise \nawareness about youth in foster care programs, especially in Maine.\n  There are over 400,000 children in the foster care system, many of \nthem waiting and hoping that the right family will come to adopt them. \nWhile many of these children are successfully returned to their birth \nparents and relatives, almost half are left in the system to fend for \nthemselves. The absence of a stable family structure can be disastrous \nfor children who are still developing psychologically and are trying to \nfind their way in the world.\n  This issue has very real impacts on the future of these children and \nour society as a whole. Young adults who age out of the foster care \nsystem before being placed with a family are at a significantly higher \nrisk for homelessness, incarceration, and unemployment. Alternatively, \nchildren who are adopted from foster care are more likely to achieve \nacademic success and emotional security than their counterparts who \nremain in foster care. Nearly 80 percent of Americans, myself included, \nbelieve that more should be done to encourage adoption; yet, each year, \ntens of thousands of available children remain in the system, without \nfamilies. Every child deserves to grow up in a permanent, safe, and \nloving home. This month, as we thank all those who have opened their \nhearts and homes to these children, we must acknowledge that there is \nstill much work ahead of us.\n  I am proud of the important roles Maine citizens have played in \npromoting adoption awareness. Adoptive & Foster Families of Maine, \nInc., AFFM, has been instrumental in helping children find the security \nthey deserve and in providing support to the families who welcome them \ninto their homes. Fostering or adopting a child can be an emotional \nprocess, and AFFM offers many services to all Maine adoptive families, \nincluding support groups, resource mentors, material goods, and a \nreferral database for legal matters and mental health support. The \nadoption process is an emotional, transformative, and sometimes even \nstressful time for children and for their new families; therefore, the \nservices provided by AFFM are an integral aspect of cultivating safe, \njoyful adoptions across the State. I have witnessed their hard work in \naction, and I am proud of all they have done for families and children \nacross Maine.\n  My wife, Mary, and I have been blessed with two adoptions. I know \nfirsthand what an amazing process adoption can be. Our experience would \nnot have been possible without the loving support of our family, \nfriends and community. Mary and I have been so fortunate with the joy \nall of our children bring to our lives every day, and I am proud to \ncelebrate National Adoption Awareness Month.\n  I would like to recognize and thank Adoptive & Foster Families of \nMaine, Inc., and all others who facilitate adoptions throughout the \ncountry and make it possible for children in foster care to find their \nforever homes. Selfless, caring individuals and programs like AFFM help \nbring children one step closer to their dreams. They offer the hope of \nlove and security to future generations, and for that, they deserve our \nimmense gratitude.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/03/senate-section/article/S7716-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING COWBOYS AGAINST CANCER\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, today I come to the floor to recognize \none of Wyoming's most generous groups, Cowboys Against Cancer. Founded \nin 1994 by cancer survivor Margaret Parry, Cowboys Against Cancer \nraises funds for residents of Sweetwater County who have been diagnosed \nwith cancer. Touched by those who aided and encouraged her during her \nown battle with cancer, Margaret created Cowboys Against Cancer in \norder to provide the same comfort to those battling this awful disease. \nMargaret's mission--and that of Cowboys Against Cancer--is one of \ncompassion and support. From offering the comfort of a shoulder to lean \non to awarding grants to support overburdened individuals and families, \nCowboys Against Cancer has waged a tireless battle against cancer.\n  As a nonprofit volunteer organization, Cowboys Against Cancer is a \nproud group devoted exclusively to charity. The organization's \nvolunteers work without compensation, and Cowboys Against Cancer \nemploys no staff members. Without staff on the payroll, no office \nspace, and very little overhead, the majority of the profits generated \nare donated directly to those in need. Since the organization's \ninception, Cowboys Against Cancer has given hundreds of grants to local \ncancer patients, including more than 150 grants in 2015 alone. In \naddition to these grants, the group has also worked to fund the \ndevelopment of cancer treatment infrastructure throughout Sweetwater \nCounty to better serve the regional population.\n  This year marks the 21st and final Cowboys Against Cancer Annual \nBenefit and Banquet. Over 1,000 people will gather to both celebrate \nthe memories of those who are no longer with us and recognize the \nexemplary courage and determination exhibited by cancer survivors. \nIncluding the donations raised from this capstone gala, Cowboys Against \nCancer estimates that they will have awarded a total of $5 million of \ngrants to folks in Wyoming. This is a remarkable achievement.\n  Margaret has a tremendous team of volunteers who have helped her make \nthis dream a reality. Over the years, dozens upon dozens of folks have \nworked for this great organization. I would like to recognize the \ncurrent board of directors and the people who have volunteered for 10 \nyears or more. The Cowboys Against Cancer board of directors are: \nMargaret Parry, president and founder; George Lemich, vice president \nand auction officer; Cindy Petersen, historian; Kristi Parry, \nsecretary; Erika Kosher, banquet; Anita Punders, treasurer; Terry \nWarren, grant disbursements; Kathy Devoy, invitations and tickets; \nCindy Rodriguez, advertising; and Geannie Berg, auction item data base.\n  The kind, generous, and energetic volunteers who have lent a hand for \nover 10 years are Sandra DaRif, Danella ``Prune'' Devries, Pat Devoy, \nDebbie Gunn, Mary Hardy, Beth Ice, Mary Juel, Veldon Kraft, Don Melvin, \nVance Petersen, Kyle and Patsy Rossetti, Becky Sanchez, Kelly Shablo, \nBess Stevenson, Liz Strannigan, Tim Warren, and Donald Wiggen. Students \nfrom Western Wyoming Community College, Rock Springs High School, and \nGreen River High School have always been generous with their time. And, \nfinally, a special note of thanks to Al Harris who serves as the \nevent's master of ceremonies.\n  Please join me in offering my heartfelt congratulations to Margaret \nParry and her Cowboys Against Cancer team for their efforts toward \ncreating a cancer-free world. This organization has exemplified the \nnature of the cowboy spirit: tough, but neighborly. Sweetwater County--\nand Wyoming--are better, thanks to the selfless contributions of \nMargaret Parry and Cowboys Against Cancer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/03/senate-section/article/S7716-3", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7716-S7717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ASHLEY MITCHELL\n\n Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I wish to celebrate and \ncongratulate the recent accomplishments of Ms. Ashley Mitchell. At only \n4-foot-9-inches tall and 94 pounds, Ashley holds the title of Weight \nLifting World Champion.\n  The daughter of Anticia S. Mitchell and a native of Alexandria, LA, \nAshley is a hard-working honor roll senior with a 3.0 GPA at Alexandria \nSenior High School, ASH. In addition to her academic triumphs, Ashley \nis also a dynamic athlete. During Ashley's freshman year of high \nschool, ASH powerlifting coach Duane Urbina introduced her to the \nsport. With her mother's encouragement to take a risk and\n\n[[Page S7717]]\n\nto try something new, Ashley embraced the opportunity wholeheartedly.\n  Ashley has achieved several impressive titles as a result of her hard \nwork. Ashley is a three-time first place North Regional Champion, as \nwell as the North Regional Most Outstanding Lifter on the light-weight \nplatform. Additionally, Ashley broke the bench and deadlift records at \nNorth Regionals. Moreover, Ashley is a three-time first place Louisiana \nState Champion. Ashley has earned the Billy Jack Talton Award for Best \nLifter in the State of Louisiana and has placed second at both the \nnational meet in Killeen, TX, for 2013-2014 and the national meet in \nMilwaukee, WI, for 2014-2015.\n  On May 15, 2015, Ashley earned first place at the Men's and Women's \nPowerlifting National Meet in San Antonio, TX; Ashley's first place \naward qualified her to join TEAM USA and to compete at the \nInternational Powerlifting Federation, IPF, Championship held in \nPrague, Czech Republic, on August 28-September 6, 2015.\n  Talented competitors from 28 nations competed at the IPF \nChampionship. Ashley rose to the challenge, receiving the gold medal in \nthe 94.5 pound weight class for the Sub-Junior and Junior USA Team. \nAshley earned the second place silver medal for squatting 275 pounds, \nthe first place gold medal for benching 159.5 pounds, and the first \nplace gold medal for deadlifting 326.5 pounds. Each lift event included \nthree attempts. On Ashley's second attempt for the deadlift, she broke \nthe world record by lifting 309.1 pounds; Ashley immediately broke this \nrecord on her third attempt by lifting 326.5 pounds, now the new world \nrecord. Ashley also set the new world record for total weight lifted, \nby lifting a combined 761 pounds during the squat, bench, and deadlift \nevents.\n  Powerlifting is both physically and mentally demanding, but not \ninsurmountable for Ashley, who finds support in God, her family, her \ncoach, and her powerlifting team. Through blood, sweat, and tears, \nAshley welcomes the challenges and celebrates how the sport teaches her \nabout how to overcome life's obstacles.\n  Ashley Mitchell makes our community, State, and country very proud. \nToday I join my colleagues in honoring this young woman's tremendous \neffort and dedication.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/03/senate-section/article/S7717-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING THE 366TH FIGHTER WING\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I wish to honor Mountain Home Air \nForce Base's 366th Fighter Wing, which recently earned the Air Force \nOutstanding Unit Award. Congratulations to the skilled and dedicated \nmen and women who serve in the 366th Fighter Wing for their outstanding \nservice to our Nation.\n  The Outstanding Unit Award was created 61 years ago. According to the \nAir Force Personnel Center, it is awarded by the Secretary of the Air \nForce to units that ``distinguished themselves by exceptionally \nmeritorious service or outstanding achievement.''\n  The 366th FW earned the award for the period of June 1, 2014, to May \n31, 2015, and is credited with 9,200 hours spent in the air. When \nmaking the nomination, U.S. Air Force Lt. Gen. Mark C. Nowland cited \nthe fighter wing's ``determination and relentless pursuit of \nexcellence.'' He noted a number of the wing's accomplishments: the \nsuccessful use of airpower during Republic of Korea theater security \npackage operations; the Gunfighters expanded their airspace by 25 \npercent, supporting seven military branches from five countries during \nfive major exercises; and the achievement of an impeccable personal \ntraining pass rate. Lieutenant General Nowland wrote, ``Whether at home \ntraining for current and future contingencies or sending Airmen \ndownrange to complete combat operations, the Gunfighters exemplify the \nFly, Fight and Win ethos.''\n  The more than 4,680 military and civilian members and approximately \n4,590 family members of the 366th FW have a long history of excellence. \nIt has been awarded the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award 17 times, \ndating back to its accomplishments in 1966 and as recent as 2012. The \nwork of the wing's servicemembers also earned Meritorious Unit Awards \nin both 2008 and 2009. These are just a few of its recognitions.\n  Various divisions of the wing have also received numerous awards. The \nwing's maintenance group was acknowledged as ``Outstanding Maintenance \nUnit'' for their efforts during a massive aerial combat training \nexercise at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada. The 366th Security Forces \nSquadron was also named ``Most Outstanding Security Forces Medium Unit \nin Air Combat Command.'' The 366th Force Support Squadron was selected \nas the best force support squadron in Air Combat Command, ACC, and the \nbase's medical group is the top rated in ACC.\n  The commitment and dedication of the thousands of courageous and \naccomplished Americans who call Idaho home is beyond impressive. We are \nblessed to have many knowledgeable and brave individuals and their \nfamilies protecting our Nation. I congratulate the 366th Fighter Wing \non its many successes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/03/senate-section/article/S7717-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7717-S7718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. DONALD WILLIAMSON\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure and the \nhighest regard that I speak on the accomplishments of my valued \nconstituent and friend, Dr. Donald Williamson. On October 31, 2015, Dr. \nWilliamson concluded 23 years as Alabama's State health officer and 29 \nyears of service in the Department of Public Health.\n  Dr. Williamson has served the public health community for more than \n30 years, first in his home State of Mississippi and in Alabama since \n1986. He began his career in Alabama as the director of the Division of \nDisease Control from 1986 to 1988. He then served as the director of \nthe Bureau of Preventative Health Services from 1988 to 1992, when he \nwas appointed as the State health officer and director of the Alabama \nDepartment of Public Health.\n  Dr. Williamson received his medical degree, cum laude, from the \nUniversity of Mississippi School of Medicine and completed a residency \nin internal medicine at the University of Virginia Hospital.\n  His devotion to health and public service has been recognized on \nnumerous occasions. He received the 2011 Nathan Davis Award from the \nAMA for outstanding public service by a career public servant at the \nState level; the 2009 Wallace Alexander Clyde Award from Children's \nHospital; the 2000 Arthur T. McCormack Award from the Association of \nState and Territorial Health Officials for dedication and excellence in \npublic health; the 1999 Theodore R. Ervin Award from the Public Health \nFoundation; and the 1999 Child Health Advocate Award from the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics. He also was the recipient of the 1997 D.G. Gill \nAward from the Alabama Public Health Association for outstanding \ncontribution to public health in Alabama and the 1998 Internist of the \nYear Award from the Alabama Society of Internal Medicine. In addition, \nhe has held leadership roles in several national and State \norganizations, including the Association of State and Territorial \nHealth Officials.\n  For the last 3 years, Dr. Williamson has held two of the largest jobs \nin State government, serving both as health officer and chairman of the \nAlabama Medicaid Transition Taskforce. Governor Robert Bentley \nappointed Dr. Williamson to serve as chairman of the transition \ntaskforce at a time when the Medicaid Program was on the brink of \nfailing.\n  During his tenure, All Kids, Alabama's public health insurance for \nchildren, was recognized nationally for its success in reducing the \nnumber of uninsured children. As the chairman of the Medicaid \ntransition taskforce, he helped rescue the Alabama Medicaid Agency and \nrestructured the Medicaid Program. Under his direction, the Medicaid \nProgram will be transformed into Regional Care Organizations and \nPatient Care Networks. This new structure represents a shift from \ntreating an illness or injury to focusing on overall health and well-\nbeing and will lead to improved health outcomes for many Alabamians.\n  Dr. Williamson has demonstrated the ability to find solutions for \nseemingly insurmountable challenges and has been a calm, strong voice \nof reason and common sense in the most difficult of times. Throughout \nhis career, he continued to find new ways of making Medicaid work for \nits patients and the physicians who treat them.\n\n[[Page S7718]]\n\n  However, it is good to note that this is not the end of Dr. \nWilliamson's healthcare service. He will become the CEO and president \nof the Alabama Hospital Association in November. His tremendous \nknowledge of health care will continue to be a valuable resource to \nAlabama and to this critically important organization.\n  I have known this able, energetic leader for many years.

No one was surprised and all were \npleased when Governor Bentley asked him to take over as chairman of the \nMedicaid transition taskforce at a truly critical time. His reputation \nthroughout the State, the awards he has received, and the sustained \neffort he has given for the betterment of the health of all Alabamians, \nespecially the poor, truly sets him apart and makes him worthy of the \nhighest accolades.\n  In light of these and all of his many accomplishments, I want to \ncongratulate him on his outstanding career and to wish him the very \nbest in his next important and challenging endeavor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/03/senate-section/article/S7718-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING DONG PHUONG BAKERY & RESTAURANT\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, Louisianians share a long history \nof triumph and resilience over hardship, and as a result, folks from \nall backgrounds pursue the American Dream with dedication and \ncommitment. This is particularly true of the Vietnamese community and \nlocal small businesses in southeast Louisiana who came together to \nrebuild New Orleans East after Hurricane Katrina. In honor of National \nWomen's Small Business Month, I am proud to recognize Dong Phuong \nBakery & Restaurant of New Orleans, LA, as this week's Small Business \nof the Week.\n  Amidst an intense postwar political climate following the end of the \nVietnam war, De and Huong Tran immigrated to the United States in 1980 \nin search of a more peaceful life and greater opportunities for their \nyoung family. The Trans and their three young children settled in an \narea with a fast-growing Vietnamese presence, the Versailles \nneighborhood of New Orleans. Shortly after settling into their new \ncommunity, De enrolled at the University of New Orleans and found work \nat a local grocery store. Given De's busy class and work schedule, \nHuong cared for the young Tran children as they adjusted to their new \nhome and culture. Searching for ways to reconnect with her beloved \nVietnamese culture and provide extra income for her young family, Huong \ndrew from her past working in her father's bakery in Vietnam and began \nbaking a variety of Vietnamese delicacies, selling them to friends, \nfamily, and local shops in her community. Realizing they had a hit, \nHuong and De opened the Dong Phuong Oriental Bakery in 1981, selling \ntraditional Vietnamese pastries and items with a French flair.\n  During the rebuilding process after Hurricane Katrina, De and Huong \nTran provided support and hope to their community, and today the Dong \nPhuong Bakery & Restaurant remains in their original location in the \nVietnamese neighborhood of Versailles, operating out of a 4,000-square-\nfoot restaurant space. Now under the ownership of Huong Tran and Linh \nTran Garza, the bakery continues to prepare and sell traditional \nFrench-Vietnamese cuisine, as well as their beloved fresh French bread \nto restaurants and customers across south Louisiana.\n  Congratulations again to Dong Phuong Bakery & Restaurant for being \nSmall Business of The Week and to Huong and Linh for their praiseworthy \nentrepreneurial spirit and for setting an example for women \nentrepreneurs across the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/03/senate-section/article/S7718-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JOSEPH J. COX\n\n Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, it is with gratitude and \nappreciation that I congratulate Joseph J. Cox of Virginia on his \nretirement as president and chief executive officer of the Chamber of \nShipping of America.\n  Upon graduating from the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy in 1967, Mr. \nCox served honorably as a deck officer on commercial ships in the \nVietnam war. He worked for 8 years at the U.S. Department of Labor in \nthe Marine Standards Office. In 1981, he joined the Chamber of Shipping \nof America, the association of American ship owners, operators, and \ncharterers. He rose to president and CEO and led the organization from \n1997 until his retirement earlier this year.\n  Mr. Cox is widely respected as a valued representative of the \nAmerican maritime community. He has actively advocated for domestic \nlegislation and regulation to advance the interests of the shipping and \nmaritime industry. He has participated in the development of \ntransnational treaties at the International Maritime Organization and \nthe International Labor Organization.\n  At the helm of the Chamber of Shipping of America, he elevated the \nnearly 100-year-old association to its respected status in the global \nmaritime community. He will continue to serve as an adviser to the \norganization.\n  I thank Joe Cox for his decades of service to his country and to the \nmarine trades, and I wish him and his family smooth sailing on the next \nleg of their voyage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/03/senate-section/article/S7718-3", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neimann, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/03/senate-section/article/S7718-4", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOTIFICATION OF THE PRESIDENT'S INTENT TO TERMINATE THE DESIGNATION OF \n THE REPUBLIC OF BURUNDI AS A BENEFICIARY SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN COUNTRY \n UNDER THE AFRICAN GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY ACT (AGOA), RECEIVED DURING \n          ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE ON OCTOBER 30, 2015--PM 31\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States which was referred to the \nCommittee on Finance:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  In accordance with section 506A(a)(3)(B) of the African Growth and \nOpportunity Act, as amended (AGOA) (19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)(3)(B)), I am \nproviding notification of my intent to terminate the designation of the \nRepublic of Burundi (Burundi) as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African \ncountry under AGOA.\n  I am taking this step because I have determined that the Government \nof Burundi has not established or is not making continual progress \ntoward establishing the rule of law and political pluralism, as \nrequired by the AGOA eligibility requirements outlined in section 104 \nof the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3703). In particular, the continuing crackdown \non opposition members, which has included assassinations, extra-\njudicial killings, arbitrary arrests, and torture, have worsened \nsignificantly during the election campaign that returned President \nNkurunziza to power earlier this year. In addition, the Government of \nBurundi has blocked opposing parties from holding organizational \nmeetings and campaigning throughout the electoral process. Police and \narmed youth militias with links to the ruling party have intimidated \nthe opposition, contributing to nearly 200,000 refugees fleeing the \ncountry since April 2015. Accordingly, I intend to terminate the \ndesignation of Burundi as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country \nunder AGOA as of January 1, 2016.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, October 30, 2015.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/03/senate-section/article/S7718-5", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7718-S7719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n                         enrolled bills signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 6, 2015, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on November 2, 2015, during the \nadjournment of the Senate, received a message from the House of \nRepresentatives announcing that the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Messer) \nhad signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 623.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan urging the President \n     of the United States and the United States Congress to take \n     action to halt the illegal dumping of foreign steel into the \n     U.S. market; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S7720, November 3, 2015, in the third column, for POM-\n102, the following language appears: . . . Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: . . . Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n\n                        House Resolution No. 87\n\n       Whereas, Steel is the backbone of the modern economy, and \n     it contributes to every level of daily life. It supports our \n     bridges, takes our buildings to new heights, and can be found \n     in the everyday appliances in our homes. Michigan's strong \n     manufacturing sector, particularly our automotive industry, \n     relies extensively on the metal, as does the energy sector's \n     domestic oil and gas extraction efforts. In fact, in 2014, \n     Michigan and Minnesota shipped 93 percent of usable iron ore \n     products in the United States; and\n       Whereas, Iron ore mining and manufacturing has been \n     significantly undermined by low-price steel imports from \n     foreign nations. Companies in places like China, South Korea, \n     India, the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Taiwan, and Saudi \n     Arabia are selling their products in the United States at \n     predatory prices. Some estimates state that certain Chinese \n     steel firms retail their products in the United States at 75 \n     percent of the domestic cost of production. A South Korean \n     firm recently retailed its products even lower at 48 percent \n     of the domestic cost of production. This unfair trade puts \n     American mills, and the mines that feed them, at risk; and\n       Whereas, The economic consequences of steel dumping have \n     begun and will have a lasting detrimental impact on the \n     Michigan economy and the entire nation. Across the Midwest, \n     thousands of steelworkers have already been laid off in \n     recent years, and as mills continue to operate well below \n     their operational capacity, more steelworkers and miners are \n     at risk. As the percentage of foreign steel used in the \n     United States increases, the impacts on American \n     manufacturing will only increase. This could lead to the \n     erosion of enterprises that are critical to our economy and \n     national defense; and\n       Whereas, The dumping of foreign steel into the United \n     States is a violation of international trade agreements and \n     must be halted, Article VI of the General Agreement on \n     Tariffs and Trade 1994 states that products\n\n[[Page S7721]]\n\n     from another country shall not be introduced into the \n     commerce of another country at a value less than the \n     product's normal price in the destination country. The \n     Department of Commerce has used the provisions of this \n     article to investigate and take anti-dumping measures against \n     nations in the past. However, this process is slow. So, while \n     nations and companies are being identified, investigated, and \n     punished, American workers are being laid off. Action must be \n     taken to more aggressively identify those violating \n     international trade agreements and punish them accordingly: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we urge the \n     President and Congress of the United States to take action to \n     halt the illegal dumping of foreign steel into the U.S. \n     market; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, and the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-103. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California urging the President of the United \n     States and the United States Congress to enact S. 664, the \n     Foster Care Tax Credit Act, which would provide tax relief to \n     short-term foster parents by helping to cover the actual \n     costs of caring for a foster child; to the Committee on \n     Finance.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 17\n\n       Whereas, Foster parents make a positive and tremendous \n     difference in the lives of so many vulnerable children by \n     opening their hearts and homes, and yet California faces \n     constant challenges in recruiting and retaining enough foster \n     families to ensure each child is placed in a family-like \n     setting; and\n       Whereas, Caring for a child in foster care can be more \n     expensive than caring for one's own biological children. \n     Children placed into foster care often have experienced \n     significant emotional and physical trauma and have higher \n     incidences of medical and behavioral health issues, resulting \n     in additional costs to foster parents. On average, current \n     foster care rates would have to increase almost 40 percent \n     nationwide to provide for basic care; and\n       Whereas, Foster parents do not always begin full-time \n     foster parenting immediately. It is not uncommon for foster \n     parents to first provide shorter-term respite or emergency \n     care before ``graduating'' into more full-time foster \n     parenthood. Likewise, foster parents may intend to be full-\n     time; however, children placed with them may be reunified \n     with their biological families after short lengths of time. \n     Foster parents may have multiple placements for three to four \n     months at a time. According to the Public Policy Institute of \n     California, in California in 2010, 31 percent of children \n     left foster care within three months; and\n       Whereas, The shortage of foster homes has been widely \n     reported. According to the Los Angeles Times in 2015, \n     ``Demand for foster beds exceeds supply by more than 30% \n     nationally. Forty percent of parents withdraw during their \n     first year, and an additional 20% say they want out, national \n     studies show. Those families that remain are often stuck in \n     deep poverty themselves''; and\n       Whereas, Encouraging individuals to become foster parents \n     can contribute to a greater number of children being adopted \n     from foster care. According to the United States Department \n     of Health and Human Services, of the children adopted from \n     foster care in 2012, 54 percent were adopted by former foster \n     parents. In 2012, that would have equated to 27,358 children \n     adopted by former foster parents; and\n       Whereas, Senate Bill 664 of the 114th United States \n     Congress, known as the federal Foster Care Tax Credit Act, \n     would seek to help the many families who care for foster \n     children for six months or less, who unlike longer term \n     foster, families, are not eligible for tax credit assistance \n     under the federal Child Tax Credit, to cover the actual cost \n     of caring for foster children; and\n       Whereas, The Foster Care Tax Credit Act provides tax relief \n     to short-term foster parents and helps cover the actual costs \n     of caring for a foster child by establishing an inflation-\n     adjusted, refundable tax credit of up to $1,000 per year, per \n     foster child, which is prorated by the number of months a \n     foster child is in a family's care; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and the Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That because foster parents make \n     significant and meaningful contributions to the lives of so \n     many vulnerable children by opening their hearts and homes, \n     the Legislature urges the President and the Congress of the \n     United States to enact Senate Bill 664 of the 114th United \n     States Congress, known as the Foster Care Tax Credit Act, \n     which would provide tax relief to short term foster parents \n     by helping to cover the actual costs of caring for a foster \n     child; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, the Speaker and Minority Leader of the \n     House of Representatives, the Majority Leader and Minority \n     Leader of the Senate, and each member of the California \n     delegation to the United States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-104. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Michigan urging the United States Congress to reject the \n     U.S.-led nuclear agreement with Iran and press for a new \n     agreement that will prevent all pathways to an Iranian \n     nuclear weapon; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 104\n\n       Whereas, On July 14, 2015, a six-member coalition of \n     nations, including the governments of Great Britain, France, \n     Russia, China, and Germany and led by the United States, \n     reached an agreement with the Islamic Republic of Iran. This \n     agreement, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of \n     Action, seeks to limit Iran's capacity to refine, store, and \n     use weapons-grade nuclear material and develop nuclear \n     weapons in exchange for international sanctions relief; and\n       Whereas, The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, commonly \n     referred to as the Iranian nuclear agreement, is not in the \n     strategic interest of the United States and its allies. With \n     the notable exception of the Arak heavy-water nuclear \n     facility, this agreement leaves in place much of Iran's \n     nuclear infrastructure, including 5,060 centrifuges. \n     Moreover, this deal allows Iran to continue researching and \n     developing advanced centrifuges capable of refining weapons-\n     grade nuclear material for use in intercontinental ballistic \n     missiles that can strike the United States and short-range \n     missiles capable of hitting targets throughout the Middle \n     East. This creates a direct threat to our national security \n     at home and the national security interests of Israel and \n     other allies; and\n       Whereas, The Iranian nuclear agreement legitimizes Iran's \n     nuclear program and does not definitively block a path to a \n     nuclear weapon. While the agreement restricts the amount of \n     nuclear material Iran may store and allows for international \n     inspections, these provisions will slow--but not halt--the \n     advancement of Iran's weapons program. The inspections also \n     do not meet the ``anytime, anywhere'' standard needed in this \n     case, but rather uses the ``managed access'' approach that is \n     insufficient to ensure Iran is not developing or hiding \n     nuclear weaponry and weapon components. Given Iran's history \n     of deceiving the International Atomic Energy Agency and its \n     refusal to recognize its nuclear program's military \n     dimension, the international community will be challenged \n     keeping Iran's nuclear weapons program in line with the \n     agreement. With some of the toughest restrictions ending in \n     ten years, Iran is 15 years from manufacturing a nuclear \n     arsenal, which could sink the Middle East into a nuclear arms \n     race; and\n       Whereas, International sanctions relief would allow Iran to \n     further support terrorist organizations. The Joint \n     Comprehensive Plan of Action, if enacted, would unfreeze an \n     estimated $150 billion in assets currently isolated in \n     foreign banks almost immediately. These assets, alongside \n     additional revenue from sanctions relief, could be redirected \n     by the Iranian government to more substantially support \n     terrorist organizations in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Lebanon, \n     Palestine, and others. Sanctions relief could also allow more \n     money to support a domestic military build-up that could be \n     used against area nations, like Israel, which Iran has long \n     committed to destroying. This emboldens the autocratic state \n     to continue its conflict with the United States, destabilize \n     the region, and marginalize Iranian moderates; and\n       Whereas, The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action is not the \n     best agreement for the United States, the Middle East, and \n     the world. The agreement fails to set free imprisoned \n     Michigan resident and former Marine Amir Hekmati and other \n     Americans. It fails to address Iran's human rights situation, \n     a situation that, according to a 2015 State Department \n     report, continues to deteriorate. The agreement does not \n     allow the inspection of Iranian military installations, which \n     are needed to ensure secret research is not conducted and \n     weaponry and components are not hidden; and\n       Whereas, Israel's support of the Iranian nuclear agreement \n     is crucial to reaching long-term peace. However, the \n     agreement does not have the support necessary to reach that \n     goal. Repeated Israeli public opinion polls have shown a \n     broad consensus, seemingly traversing conventional political \n     divides, against the Iranian nuclear deal: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we to urge the Congress of the \n     United States to reject the U.S.-led nuclear agreement with \n     Iran and press for a new agreement that will prevent all \n     pathways to an Iranian nuclear weapon; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution he transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-105. A petition by a citizen from the State of Texas \n     urging the United States Congress to propose an amendment to \n     the United States Constitution which would require both \n     houses of Congress approve, by a three-fifths vote of all \n     members elected and serving in each body, any declaration of \n     martial law, or suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, by \n     the President of the United States, and further providing \n     that such Congressionally-approved martial law declaration, \n     or suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, not exceed 30 \n     days duration, and clearly describe the geographic territory \n     covered by such declaration or suspension; to the Committee \n     on the Judiciary.\n\n[[Page S7722]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/03/senate-section/article/S7722-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. JOHNSON, from the Committee on Homeland Security and \n     Governmental Affairs, with an amendment in the nature of a \n     substitute:\n       S. 1550.

A bill to express the sense of Congress that the Government \nof the Maldives should immediately release former President Mohamed \nNasheed from prison and release all other political prisoners in the \ncountry, as well as guarantee due process for and respect the human \nrights of all of the people of the Maldives; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, since January 2015, President Abdulla \nYameen of the Maldives has increasingly cracked down on dissent within \nhis own party and the political opposition, presided over the erosion \nof judicial impartiality, and put increasing pressure on civil society. \nThe arrest of former president Mohamed Nasheed, who was convicted in a \nwidely condemned trial that UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid \nRa'ad described as containing ``flagrant irregularities'', and who \nremains imprisoned today, is indicative of the current situation.\n  That is why today I am introducing, together with a bipartisan \ncoalition of 13 other Senators, a bill expressing the sense of Congress \nthat the Government of the Maldives should immediately release former \npresident Nasheed and all other political prisoners in the country, and \nguarantee due process for, and respect the human rights of, all of the \npeople of the Maldives.\n  The United States and the Maldives have common interests in maritime \nsecurity, commerce, and addressing climate change. But we also expect \nour partners to respect the fundamental rights of their people, \nincluding those who disagree with the government's policies, and to \nuphold the basic principles of justice. I thank the cosponsors of this \nlegislation for their support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/03/senate-section/article/S7725-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7725-S7726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 302--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE IN SUPPORT OF \n        ISRAEL AND IN CONDEMNATION OF PALESTINIAN TERROR ATTACKS\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL (for himself, Ms. Ayotte, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Graham, Mr. \nBennet, Mr. Kirk, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Cornyn, Mrs. \nGillibrand, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Toomey, Mr. Portman, and Mr. \nHeller) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 302\n\n       Whereas Israel is a democratic ally and major strategic \n     partner of the United States, as codified by the United \n     States-Israel Strategic Partnership Act of 2014 (Public Law \n     113-296), and cooperation between Israel and the United \n     States continues to increase in importance with a swiftly \n     shifting security situation in the Middle East and North \n     Africa;\n       Whereas Jerusalem is an undivided city, eternal capital of \n     Israel, holiest city for the Jewish people, central to the \n     worship of three monotheistic religions, and unique in the \n     Middle East region as a city of religious tolerance where \n     Israel guarantees access, security, and respect for the three \n     monotheistic religions to worship in peace at holy sites;\n       Whereas, upon Israel securing control of Jerusalem in 1967, \n     it has maintained a policy of keeping the Haram Al Sharif \n     specifically open for Muslim prayer, welcoming over 3,500,000 \n     regular worshipers annually;\n       Whereas the Government of Israel upholds the 1994 Treaty of \n     Peace Between the State of Israel and the Hashemite Kingdom \n     of Jordan, which states in Article Nine that each party \n     ``will provide freedom of access to places of religious and \n     historical significance,'' as well as ``act together to \n     promote interfaith relations among the three monotheistic \n     religions, with the aim of working toward religious \n     understanding, moral commitment, freedom of religious \n     worship, and tolerance and peace'';\n       Whereas Yasser Arafat, Chairman of the Palestine Liberation \n     Organization (PLO), committed in his exchange of letters with \n     Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin on September 9, 1993, \n     that ``the PLO renounces the use of terrorism and other acts \n     of violence and will assume responsibility over all PLO \n     elements and personnel in order to assure their compliance,'' \n     and under the subsequent 1995 Oslo II Accord, the \n     Palestinians pledged to ``abstain from incitement, including \n     hostile propaganda . . . [and to] take legal measures to \n     prevent such incitement by any organizations, groups or \n     individuals within their jurisdiction'';\n       Whereas the President of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud \n     Abbas, wrongly announced during the tenth anniversary of \n     Yasser Arafat's death in November 2014 that Israel has no \n     claim to Jerusalem, that the Temple Mount will not be allowed \n     to be ``contaminated'' by Jews, and that Jewish prayer on the \n     Temple Mount would lead to a ``devastating religious war'';\n       Whereas President Abbas falsely claimed during his address \n     to the United Nations General Assembly in September 2015 that \n     the Government of Israel has used ``brutal force to impose \n     its plans to undermine the Islamic and Christian sanctities \n     in Jerusalem'' and announced that the Palestinian Authority \n     is no longer bound by the Oslo Accords;\n       Whereas Israel has in recent weeks been subjected to an \n     alarming wave of terrorism directed against innocent \n     civilians by Palestinians armed with knives, meat cleavers, \n     guns, and cars;\n       Whereas there have been approximately 69 such attacks since \n     the beginning of October 2015, leaving 11 Israelis dead and \n     another 145 wounded;\n       Whereas United States citizens have lost their lives as a \n     result of these terrorist attacks, including Richard Lakin \n     and Eitam Henkin;\n       Whereas these random, gruesome attacks are intended to \n     instill a sense of fear among the people of Israel leading \n     their normal lives, and also destabilize security for both \n     Palestinians and Israelis;\n       Whereas Israel, Jordan, and the United States have reached \n     an agreement regarding the installation of surveillance \n     cameras on the Temple Mount in accordance with the respective \n     responsibilities of the Israelis authorities and the \n     Jordanian Waqf.\n       Whereas President Abbas has helped to fuel the current \n     violence in recent weeks by falsely casting Israel as the \n     brutal aggressor in multiple public speeches, refusing to \n     condemn the lethal terror attacks, and failing to acknowledge \n     Israel's right to self-defense;\n       Whereas President Abbas' statements are part of a pattern \n     of incitement among Palestinian leaders that includes denial \n     of the Jewish heritage of Jerusalem, paying monthly salaries \n     to the families of imprisoned Palestinian terrorists, \n     praising slain terrorists as martyrs, demonizing Jews in \n     official Palestinian Authority media, and encouraging attacks \n     on social media; and\n       Whereas Palestinian leaders have repeatedly threatened to \n     suspend cooperation and further encouraged violence by \n     blaming Israel for killing Palestinian perpetrators of these \n     heinous crimes: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns these brutal attacks in the harshest terms \n     possible;\n       (2) welcomes Israel's commitment to the continued \n     maintenance of the status quo on the Temple Mount;\n       (3) urges the President and the international community to \n     join in forcefully condemning these Palestinian terror \n     attacks;\n       (4) clarifies that there is no justification for these \n     types of attacks and that there is a direct correlation \n     between the recent upsurge in violence and Arab incitement \n     regarding the Temple Mount;\n       (5) stands with the people of Israel during these difficult \n     days;\n       (6) supports Israel's right to self-defense and rejects any \n     suggestion of the moral equivalence of Israeli security \n     personnel protecting its citizens from senseless violence and \n     terrorists intent to deliberately take innocent lives;\n       (7) supports the agreement reached to install surveillance \n     cameras on the Temple Mount according to the arrangements to \n     be determined between the parties;\n       (8) calls upon President Abbas to stop all incitement by \n     Palestinian officials and by Palestinian media, to strongly \n     and unequivocally demand an end to the violence, and to take \n     all steps necessary to halt these attacks;\n       (9) expresses support and admiration for individuals and \n     organizations working to encourage cooperation between \n     Israelis and Palestinians;\n\n[[Page S7726]]\n\n       (10) encourages President Abbas to continue strengthening \n     and maintaining security cooperation with Israel;\n       (11) reiterates that Palestinian political goals will never \n     be achieved through violence; and\n       (12) calls on all parties to return to the negotiating \n     table immediately and without preconditions, as direct \n     discussions remain the best avenue to ending the Israeli-\n     Palestinian conflict.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/03/senate-section/article/S7726-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 303--DESIGNATING THE WEEK BEGINNING NOVEMBER 8, 2015, \n            AS ``NATIONAL NURSE-MANAGED HEALTH CLINIC WEEK''\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER (for himself and Mr. Merkley) submitted the following \nresolution;

Mr. President, I rise this evening to talk about an \nissue\n\n[[Page S7729]]\n\nthat is critical to keeping jobs here in America and keeping investment \nin this country and not driving it overseas.\n  We had another reminder just last week of just how broken our Tax \nCode is when a huge company, Pfizer, a pharmaceutical company, decided \nit could no longer compete as a U.S. corporation. Instead it is seeking \na merger with an Irish-based drugmaker called Allergan. They want to \nmove their corporate headquarters to Ireland. It is another in a long \nline of companies that have made this decision because our Tax Code is \nbroken.\n  Unfortunately, these kinds of transactions are called inversions, \nwhere a U.S. company buys a smaller company overseas and merges with \nthem to become a foreign company. That is just the tip of the iceberg. \nIt is actually bigger than these inversions. It also has to do with \nforeign companies buying U.S. companies because they can do so because \nthey have a higher aftertax profit and pay a premium. These kinds of \ntransactions are causing our jobs and investments to go overseas.\n  Yesterday we had another indication of that. It was announced that \nthe Irish drug company Shire is going to buy the Massachusetts-based \nbiotech company Dyax for $6.5 billion. By the way, this isn't the first \nacquisition Shire has made this year. In January they acquired a New \nJersey-based company NPS Pharmaceuticals, and in August they bought a \nprivately held company called Foresight Biotherapeutics.\n  A foreign company coming in and buying U.S. companies and moving the \nheadquarters overseas is an example of why what the Obama \nadministration is doing to counter this is not working, because their \nsolution to this is not to reform the Tax Code but rather to change the \nway the tax laws are interpreted and put out regulations they called a \ntax notice that tries to block these so-called inversions. This very \ncompany we are talking about, Shire, was the subject of an inversion. \nIt is true that AbbVie, a company in Illinois, was going to merge with \nthem and do one of these inversions. They chose not to because of the \nadministration's new tax notice--these new regulations. What happened \ninstead, Shire said: Fine, we will not merge with this U.S. company \nthrough an inversion. We will just buy U.S. companies--and they bought \nthree this year. So this is only going to be solved if we actually \nreform the Tax Code.\n  Interestingly, we have also seen this with another pharmaceutical \ncompany. It is called Salex. Salex wanted to do a merger--one of these \ninversions--and they were blocked from doing it by the regulations, so \nthen they decided to become a target for a foreign takeover. Sure \nenough, a Canadian company, Valeant, which had already moved from the \nUnited States to Canada in a merger, in an inversion, came to the \nUnited States and bought, in this case, Salex, which is a North \nCarolina company. This is happening just about every week we are \nhearing about another company that is leaving our shores because of our \nTax Code. To the administration's credit they haven't just put out \nthese regulations saying let's slow down on inversions, they have just \nsaid we do need to reform the Tax Code. That is the truth.\n  This town is not doing its work. We are not doing what the people \nhave elected us to do, which is to fix problems like this. We are \nletting this fester. Again, every week we have another example of this. \nIt is no secret why this is happening. At a combined 39-percent tax \nrate, the United States now has the highest business tax rate of any of \nthe industrialized countries. It is a No. 1 that you don't want to be.\n  Second, we don't let companies that are American companies bring \ntheir profits back here without paying that prohibitively high tax, so \nthey have locked up their profits overseas. You probably heard this, \nbut they say there is about $2.5 trillion in earnings that are locked \nup overseas that could come back to create jobs right here, expanding \nplants and equipment and adding more employees. Instead, because of our \nTax Code, it is not coming back--$2.5 trillion.\n  Importantly, the burden of this falls on American workers--think \nabout it--No. 1, because these companies in America are not as \ncompetitive as they should be because of our Tax Code. According to the \nstudies, wages are lower, benefits are lower, U.S. workers are caught. \nThis is one reason among others that we have wage stagnation in this \ncountry, because our Tax Code is so out of date. Just by fixing the Tax \nCode we could give the economy a shot in the arm and help lift up those \nwages. Instead, so many workers in my home State of Ohio and around \nthis country are working hard, playing by the rules, and doing \neverything right. Yet their wages are flat--even, on average, \ndeclining.\n  This is a new phenomenon for us in this country, but in the last 6 \nyears wages have gone down, on average, not just stayed flat. By the \nway, expenses are up: health care, thanks to ObamaCare, tuition costs, \nenergy costs, electricity bills, food costs. It is called the middle-\nclass squeeze--flat wages, higher expenses. One way to fix that is to \nput forward pro-growth policies that can actually make a difference in \ngetting this economy moving. Specifically, we have an example where if \nwe had a better Tax Code based on the economic analysis, it would \nresult not just in more jobs but better jobs. It is a way we can help, \nnot just to bring back the jobs but to bring back better jobs.\n  Almost all of our competitors--think of the UK, Japan--have lowered \ntheir rates, and they have also gone to a competitive international tax \ncode where their companies can bring their earnings back to invest in \ntheir country. So they are beating us. America is falling behind \nbecause of this problem.\n  American companies are much more valuable as foreign headquarters \nthen they are in the hands of U.S. owners. It is the primary reason, by \nthe way, that last year the number of acquisitions of U.S. companies by \nforeign companies doubled.\n  Let me say that again. Last year there were twice as many foreign \ntakeovers as there was the year before--twice as many. Something is \nhappening here. By the way, this year the $275 billion worth of \ntakeovers we saw last year is likely to go to over $400 billion, we are \ntold. So it is not quite a doubling this year but pretty darn close. \nAgain, there is something happening.\n  My concern is, if we don't do something about this, we are going to \nlook back 4 or 5 years from now and say what happened, all these great \nU.S. companies have gone overseas. It is not just pharmaceutical \ncompanies, it is across the board. It is all kinds of industries. Try \nto buy an American beer. The largest U.S. beer companies are now Sam \nAdams, with about 1.4 percent market share, and Yuengling, with about \nthe same market share. All the rest are foreign-owned--all of them--\nbecause of our Tax Code. Anheuser-Busch went overseas. Miller is \noverseas. Coors is overseas. You go right down the line of American \nbusinesses that are affected by this, and it is thousands and thousands \nof jobs.\n  We did a little investigation of this in the subcommittee that I had, \ncalled the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. I cochair it with \nClaire McCaskill, who is a Democrat from Missouri. We looked into these \nissues, did some research, and said it was worth having a hearing to \nbring some of these facts to light. We did this a couple of months ago. \nThis is what we found out. Having reviewed more than a dozen foreign \nacquisitions of U.S. companies and mergers where the headquarters end \nup being overseas, we found out that jobs are being lost, investments \nare being lost--not a surprise. It is not just the headquarters that \nmove, it is the people, the money.\n  One prominent case study we looked at was the acquisition of this \nValeant pharmaceutical company that I talked about earlier. Valeant is \nnow a company in Quebec. They merged with a company in Canada. When \nthey went up there they decided: You know what. We are now going to \nstart buying U.S. companies because we have such an advantage. We can \npay a premium. They have now managed to acquire more than a dozen U.S. \ncompanies worth more than $30 billion.\n  We reviewed some of the key deal documents to understand how the tax \nadvantages affected these acquisitions, specifically. How did it affect \nthem? We were able to look at the 2013 sale of the New York-based eye \ncare firm, Bausch & Lomb. Anybody who wears contact lenses has probably \nheard of them. We looked at the 2015 sale of this North Carolina \ncompany called Salex that I talked about a moment ago. In\n\n[[Page S7730]]\n\nthose two acquisitions alone, Valeant determined they could shave more \nthan $3 billion off the tax bill just by integrating these companies \ninto their Canadian-based operations. Think about that.\n  What do these deals mean to the American worker? Well, the three \nrecent Valeant acquisitions we studied resulted in the loss of about \n2,300 U.S. jobs, plus a loss of about $16 million per year of contract \nmanufacturing that was moved from the United States to Canada--\nadditional jobs being lost. Again, this is happening as we talk \ntonight. There are companies considering leaving our shores because our \nTax Code is so outdated and so antiquated.\n  We talked about the beer industry. The subcommittee took testimony \nfrom a guy named Jim Cook. Jim Cook is the founder and chairman of the \nBoston Beer Company. You might know him as the maker of Sam Adams. The \nmarket share is about 1.4 percent. Mr. Cook testified that if we fail \nto reform our Tax Code, his company could be next. He explained that he \nregularly gets offers from investment bankers to facilitate a sale. He \ncomes back to his office after being away for a week and what does he \nfind in his inbox, a bunch of proposals from investment banking firms \nsaying: Why don't you go overseas? We will show you how do it. We will \nsave you all kinds of money. Become a foreign corporation. This is \nhappening all over the country.\n  Mr. Cook, to his credit, is a real patriot. He doesn't want to become \na foreign company. He has declined all these offers, but he also \ninformed us that when he is gone he believes that company will be \ndriven by financial pressure to become an overseas company. He owns a \nmajority of the company's voting shares. He is fortunate. Not all CEOs \nare in that position, of course. They can't afford--because they have a \nfiduciary responsibility to their shareholders--to be able to withstand \nthis pressure to go overseas.\n  So in our subcommittee hearing and in some of the dialogue on the \nfloor and elsewhere, we heard a lot of criticism of these companies \nthat have gone overseas. I will say the plain truth, which is, if there \nis any villain in this story, it is not those companies. I wish they \nwould stay here, but it is not those companies. It is our Tax Code and \nit is Washington.\n  Just another example, along with regulatory relief, as we talked \nabout earlier tonight, along with expanding exporting and being sure \nimports are fairly traded, along with dealing with our education system \nand our worker retraining system at the Federal level that is not \nworking--all of these things need to be changed. Our energy approach to \nhave a one-size-fits-all policy, that is Washington that can and should \ndo that.\n  There are so many issues that we are not addressing in terms of the \ndebt and the deficit, economic issues. This is another one and this one \nis just so obvious.\n  Mr. Cook is famous today, the founder and chairman of Boston Beer \nCompany Sam Adams, because he was in a Wall Street Journal editorial. I \ncommend that editorial to you. It talks about exactly what I mentioned \nearlier, which is because the aftertax profit is greater for a foreign \ncompany, they can pay a premium. It talks about the fact that as \ncompared to being able to bring a dollar back from overseas as a U.S. \ncompany and having 39 percent of it taxed, with a foreign entity--for \ninstance, what could happen with Pfizer--they can go overseas, become \nan Irish company, and only pay 12 percent. They can bring 88 cents of \nthat dollar back to this country. What an irony. They can invest more \nin America by being a foreign company. We would like them to be able to \nbe an American company, bring that money back that is overseas, and \nbuild investments, jobs, plants, equipment, and people.\n  The Wall Street Journal editorial was wrong in one regard; that is, \nthey said Jim Cook is a bearded brewer. He doesn't have a beard, but he \nis a brewer. They also said this is an issue that divides Democrats and \nRepublicans. I would say with respect, as a Republican on this side of \nthe aisle, it is not that simple. There are Democrats who actually \nthink we should be reforming the Tax Code. There are a lot of \nRepublicans who think that too. In the Presidential debate you can see \na lot of Republicans talking about it. Hillary Clinton, on the other \nhand, doesn't seem much interested in it. She wants to punish these \ncompanies that go overseas. That is not going to help. That will cause \nmore companies to go overseas. They will vote with their feet, but I \ndon't believe this is a partisan issue.\n  I actually believe there are people of good will on both sides of the \naisle who get this.\n  Senator Schumer and I did a report after a working group that we were \nasked to chair by our leadership where we came up with the conclusion \nthat we had to fix this system. Senator Schumer is a Democrat and I am \na Republican. We don't agree on a lot of things. But we agreed on this \nbecause after hearing testimony from people, including CEOs of \ncompanies that were struggling with this decision, we realized we had \nto deal with it. We have to deal with it. I believe ultimately that \nwhat we have to do is to overhaul our entire Tax Code. We should deal \nwith the individual side of the code, we should lower that rate and \nbroaden the base, in other words, get rid of a lot of the preferences \nand loopholes.\n  On the corporate side, we should do the same thing and get the \ncorporate rate so it is competitive. A 25-percent rate rather than a \n35-percent rate would make a big difference.\n  The overhaul is necessary for us to be able to give the economy the \nreal shot in the arm it deserves. But in the short term, we have a \nPresident who refuses to reform the taxes on the individual side \nwithout raising significant new revenues--in other words, increasing \ntaxes dramatically, a couple of trillion dollars in his budget. We are \nnot going to do that because that would hurt the economy too much. But \neven with a President who believes that on the individual side, there \ndoes seem to be more consensus on this business issue--what to do with \nthe business tax code--particularly as it relates to the international \ntax code we talked about. So my feeling is, let's take a first step. \nLet's do what we can do on a bipartisan basis. Let's build on that \nconsensus that we have reached--that we have to fix this problem now or \nwe are going to see more and more companies and jobs and investment go \noverseas. Let's come up with something that addresses that specific \nproblem.\n  In July, in this report that Senator Schumer and I released, we \nsuggested three things where we can find a consensus. One, let's move \nto that international tax system where we can allow people to bring \ntheir earnings home. Let's not lock those earnings up overseas. Let's \nhave what you would call a permanent repatriation and allow that money \nto come back. By the way, that money could be used for all kinds of \nthings, including infrastructure. So it could be tied to the highway \nbill. But it is important for me that we change the system to allow \nthose funds to come back here and create jobs and opportunity in \nAmerica. There is $2.5 trillion locked up overseas.\n  Second, we said we ought to have incentives to be able to keep \nintellectual property, which is highly mobile, here in America, because \na lot of countries around the world now are setting up what they call \npatent boxes or innovation boxes, and they are attracting our best and \nbrightest. They are creating now a nexus between the lower rate you get \nif you move that intellectual property overseas and the researchers. In \nother words, they will give you a low tax rate, but you have to move \nthe expertise there too.\n  Again, we are going to look back a few years from now if we don't \ndeal with this and say: What happened? Some of our best researchers, \nsome of our best colleges and universities here are now not doing the \nwork anymore because it is being done overseas, because they are \nproviding the inventive and we are not.\n  Third, we agree we do need to have some sensible base erosion \nprotections that would discourage companies from shifting their income \nto low-tax jurisdictions, to tax havens, just for that purpose. By the \nway, the businesses that we talked to around the country agree with \nthat. They would like to see a lower tax rate also. That is incredibly \nimportant. That is the obvious next step. But I do think there is an \nopportunity for us to act and to act now to be able to help give the \neconomy a shot in the arm, to bring back the trillions of dollars from \noverseas, and to\n\n[[Page S7731]]\n\nhelp us stop this exodus of jobs and investment in U.S. companies \noverseas.\n  I also believe we could act this year on this. We know what to do. \nThere have been plenty of reports and studies. There is actually a tax \nproposal introduced by Dave Camp, who was the chairman of the Ways and \nMeans Committee prior to Paul Ryan. Paul Ryan, who is now Speaker of \nthe House, is very interested in this. He has done a lot of good work \non this. The Ways and Means Committee and the Finance Committee have \nheld literally dozens of hearings. We know what to do. It is a question \nof political will to get it done.\n  As we do that, we should also be sure to address the annual tax \nextenders. These are provisions for the Tax Code that are only in place \nfor a short period of time. Right now they have already expired. The \nidea is that at the end of the year we might once again retroactively \nextend these tax provisions. Think of the R tax credit, for instance, \nor the research and development tax credit. That is very important.\n  We think we should make those extenders that are good policy \npermanent. If we did that and we did this tax reform we talked about \nearlier, which by the way would be revenue neutral, this is the one \narea where the President of the United States and other Democrats are \nwilling to say: Let's not try to wring more taxes out of the system; \nlet's try to do this on a revenue-neutral basis.\n  By the way, it is going to be so pro-growth that it will result in \nmore revenue coming in, not because you raise taxes, but because it is \nthe right thing to do to encourage jobs, investment, and opportunity. \nBut if you did these tax extenders along with it, you would be making \nthe policies permanent, which would provide a huge boost to the \neconomy. The Joint Committee on Taxation found that the short-term \nextenders that were passed by the Senate Finance Committee last month--\nthis is just a short-term one for a 2-year extension, would create \n$10.4 billion in new tax revenue over the next 10 years. Think about \nthat. That is just a short-term extension. Imagine the growth if those \nwere made permanent.\n  So we do have the opportunity here to do something good for our \ncountry, for our companies, and, most importantly, for American \nworkers, and one that is going to result in growth in the economy and, \ntherefore, in revenue through growth, not through higher taxes but in \nfact by getting the tax rates down and having a competitive \ninternational tax system.\n  The last thing we want to do is to look back a few years from now and \nsay: We had this opportunity. In this area, at least, we have a \nPresident willing to work with us. We have some Democrats and \nRepublicans willing to join hands and get something done. We missed the \nopportunity. Now we are seeing this unfortunate movement of more and \nmore of our great American companies overseas. We are seeing the \nAmerican tax base being eroded. We are seeing something that would take \naway the opportunity for us to help get this economy back on track for \neverybody, for the shared prosperity that we all seek.\n  If that happens, we will have no one to blame but ourselves here in \nthis town. So I would encourage my colleagues again: Look at what is \nhappening. Look at what happened with Pfizer last week, with Shire this \nweek, and with yet another company I am sure next week. We need to wake \nup and realize that if we don't act--and we alone can act because this \nrequires a change in tax policy. It cannot happen through more \nregulations. It has to happen by changing the law. If we don't act, we \nare not doing our duty to those who sent us here to represent them.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/03/senate-section/article/S7731-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
