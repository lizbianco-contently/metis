Pursuant to the order of the Senate of January \n24, 1901, as amended by the order of February 9, 2015, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, Mr. Hoeven, will now read Washington's Farewell Address.\n  Mr. HOEVEN, at the rostrum, read the Farewell Address, as follows:\n\nTo the people of the United States\n  Friends and Fellow-Citizens: The period for a new election of a \ncitizen to administer the executive government of the United States \nbeing not far distant, and the time actually arrived when your thoughts \nmust be employed in designating the person who is to be clothed with \nthat important trust, it appears to me proper, especially as it may \nconduce to a more distinct expression of the public voice, that I \nshould now apprise you of the resolution I have formed, to decline \nbeing considered among the number of those out of whom a choice is to \nbe made.\n  I beg you at the same time to do me the justice to be assured that \nthis resolution has not been taken without a strict regard to all the \nconsiderations appertaining to the relation which binds a dutiful \ncitizen to his country--and that, in withdrawing the tender of service \nwhich silence in my situation might imply, I am influenced by no \ndiminution of zeal for your future interest, no deficiency of grateful \nrespect for your past kindness, but am supported by a full conviction \nthat the step is compatible with both.\n  The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in, the office to which \nyour suffrages have twice called me have been a uniform sacrifice of \ninclination to the opinion of duty and to a deference for what appeared \nto be your desire. I constantly hoped that it would have been much \nearlier in my power, consistently with motives which I was not at \nliberty to disregard, to return to that retirement from which I had \nbeen reluctantly drawn. The strength of my inclination to do this, \nprevious to the last election, had even led to the preparation of an \naddress to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then \nperplexed and critical posture of our affairs with foreign nations, and \nthe unanimous advice of persons entitled to my confidence, impelled me \nto abandon the idea.\n  I rejoice that the state of your concerns, external as well as \ninternal, no longer renders the pursuit of inclination incompatible \nwith the sentiment of duty or propriety and am persuaded, whatever \npartiality may be retained for my services, that in the present \ncircumstances of our country you will not disapprove my determination \nto retire.\n  The impressions with which I first undertook the arduous trust were \nexplained on the proper occasion. In the discharge of this trust, I \nwill only say that I have, with good intentions, contributed towards \nthe organization and administration of the government the best \nexertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable. Not \nunconscious\n\n[[Page S1018]]\n\nin the outset of the inferiority of my qualifications, experience in my \nown eyes, perhaps still more in the eyes of others, has strengthened \nthe motives to diffidence of myself, and every day the increasing \nweight of years admonishes me more and more that the shade of \nretirement is as necessary to me as it will be welcome. Satisfied that \nif any circumstances have given peculiar value to my services, they \nwere temporary, I have the consolation to believe that, while choice \nand prudence invite me to quit the political scene, patriotism does not \nforbid it.\n  In looking forward to the moment which is intended to terminate the \ncareer of my public life, my feelings do not permit me to suspend the \ndeep acknowledgment of that debt of gratitude which I owe to my beloved \ncountry for the many honors it has conferred upon me, still more for \nthe steadfast confidence with which it has supported me and for the \nopportunities I have thence enjoyed of manifesting my inviolable \nattachment by services faithful and persevering, though in usefulness \nunequal to my zeal. If benefits have resulted to our country from these \nservices, let it always be remembered to your praise and as an \ninstructive example in our annals that, under circumstances in which \nthe passions agitated in every direction were liable to mislead, amidst \nappearances sometimes dubious, vicissitudes of fortune often \ndiscouraging, in situations in which not unfrequently want of success \nhas countenanced the spirit of criticism, the constancy of your support \nwas the essential prop of the efforts and a guarantee of the plans by \nwhich they were effected. Profoundly penetrated with this idea, I shall \ncarry it with me to my grave as a strong incitement to unceasing vows \nthat Heaven may continue to you the choicest tokens of its beneficence; \nthat your union and brotherly affection may be perpetual; that the free \nconstitution, which is the work of your hands, may be sacredly \nmaintained; that its administration in every department may be stamped \nwith wisdom and virtue; that, in fine, the happiness of the people of \nthese states, under the auspices of liberty, may be made complete by so \ncareful a preservation and so prudent a use of this blessing as will \nacquire to them the glory of recommending it to the applause, the \naffection, and adoption of every nation which is yet a stranger to it.\n  Here, perhaps, I ought to stop. But a solicitude for your welfare, \nwhich cannot end but with my life, and the apprehension of danger \nnatural to that solicitude, urge me on an occasion like the present to \noffer to your solemn contemplation, and to recommend to your frequent \nreview, some sentiments which are the result of much reflection, of no \ninconsiderable observation, and which appear to me all important to the \npermanency of your felicity as a people. These will be offered to you \nwith the more freedom as you can only see in them the disinterested \nwarnings of a parting friend, who can possibly have no personal motive \nto bias his counsel. Nor can I forget, as an encouragement to it, your \nindulgent reception of my sentiments on a former and not dissimilar \noccasion.\n  Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your \nhearts, no recommendation of mine is necessary to fortify or confirm \nthe attachment.\n  The unity of government which constitutes you one people is also now \ndear to you. It is justly so; for it is a main pillar in the edifice of \nyour real independence, the support of your tranquility at home, your \npeace abroad, of your safety, of your prosperity, of that very liberty \nwhich you so highly prize. But as it is easy to foresee that, from \ndifferent causes and from different quarters, much pains will be taken, \nmany artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this \ntruth; as this is the point in your political fortress against which \nthe batteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly \nand actively (though often covertly and insidiously) directed, it is of \ninfinite moment that you should properly estimate the immense value of \nyour national Union to your collective and individual happiness; that \nyou should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment to it; \naccustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the palladium of \nyour political safety and prosperity; watching for its preservation \nwith jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may suggest even a \nsuspicion that it can in any event be abandoned; and indignantly \nfrowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any \nportion of our country from the rest, or to enfeeble the sacred ties \nwhich now link together the various parts.\n  For this you have every inducement of sympathy and interest. Citizens \nby birth or choice of a common country, that country has a right to \nconcentrate your affections. The name of American, which belongs to you \nin your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of \npatriotism more than any appellation derived from local \ndiscriminations. With slight shades of difference, you have the same \nreligion, manners, habits, and political principles. You have in a \ncommon cause fought and triumphed together. The independence and \nliberty you possess are the work of joint councils and joint efforts--\nof common dangers, sufferings, and successes.\n  But these considerations, however powerfully they address themselves \nto your sensibility, are greatly outweighed by those which apply more \nimmediately to your interest. Here every portion of our country finds \nthe most commanding motives for carefully guarding and preserving the \nUnion of the whole.\n  The North, in an unrestrained intercourse with the South, protected \nby the equal laws of a common government, finds in the productions of \nthe latter great additional resources of maritime and commercial \nenterprise and precious materials of manufacturing industry. The South \nin the same intercourse, benefitting by the agency of the North, sees \nits agriculture grow and its commerce expand. Turning partly into its \nown channels the seamen of the North, it finds its particular \nnavigation invigorated; and while it contributes, in different ways, to \nnourish and increase the general mass of the national navigation, it \nlooks forward to the protection of a maritime strength to which itself \nis unequally adapted. The East, in a like intercourse with the West, \nalready finds, and in the progressive improvement of interior \ncommunications by land and water will more and more find a valuable \nvent for the commodities which it brings from abroad or manufactures at \nhome. The West derives from the East supplies requisite to its growth \nand comfort--and what is perhaps of still greater consequence, it must \nof necessity owe the secure enjoyment of indispensable outlets for its \nown productions to the weight, influence, and the future maritime \nstrength of the Atlantic side of the Union, directed by an indissoluble \ncommunity of interest as one nation. Any other tenure by which the West \ncan hold this essential advantage, whether derived from its own \nseparate strength or from an apostate and unnatural connection with any \nforeign power, must be intrinsically precarious.\n  While then every part of our country thus feels an immediate and \nparticular interest in union, all the parts combined cannot fail to \nfind in the united mass of means and efforts greater strength, greater \nresource, proportionably greater security from external danger, a less \nfrequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations; and, what is \nof inestimable value! they must derive from union an exemption from \nthose broils and wars between themselves which so frequently afflict \nneighboring countries not tied together by the same government, which \ntheir own rivalships alone would be sufficient to produce, but which \nopposite foreign alliances, attachments, and intrigues would stimulate \nand embitter. Hence likewise they will avoid the necessity of those \novergrown military establishments, which under any form of government \nare inauspicious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as \nparticularly hostile to republican liberty. In this sense it is, that \nyour Union ought to be considered as a main prop of your liberty, and \nthat the love of the one ought to endear to you the preservation of the \nother.\n  These considerations speak a persuasive language to every reflecting \nand virtuous mind and exhibit the continuance of the Union as a primary \nobject of patriotic desire. Is there a doubt whether a common \ngovernment can embrace so large a sphere? Let experience solve it. To \nlisten to mere speculation in such a case were criminal. We\n\n[[Page S1019]]\n\nare authorized to hope that a proper organization of the whole, with \nthe auxiliary agency of governments for the respective subdivisions, \nwill afford a happy issue to the experiment. It is well worth a fair \nand full experiment. With such powerful and obvious motives to union \naffecting all parts of our country, while experience shall not have \ndemonstrated its impracticability, there will always be reason to \ndistrust the patriotism of those who in any quarter may endeavor to \nweaken its bands.\n  In contemplating the causes which may disturb our Union, it occurs as \nmatter of serious concern that any ground should have been furnished \nfor characterizing parties by geographical discriminations--northern \nand southern--Atlantic and western; whence designing men may endeavor \nto excite a belief that there is a real difference of local interests \nand views. One of the expedients of party to acquire influence within \nparticular districts is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other \ndistricts. You cannot shield yourselves too much against the jealousies \nand heart burnings which spring from these misrepresentations. They \ntend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together \nby fraternal affection. The inhabitants of our western country have \nlately had a useful lesson on this head. They have seen in the \nnegotiation by the executive--and in the unanimous ratification by the \nSenate--of the treaty with Spain, and in the universal satisfaction at \nthat event throughout the United States, a decisive proof how unfounded \nwere the suspicions propagated among them of a policy in the general \ngovernment and in the Atlantic states unfriendly to their interests in \nregard to the Mississippi. They have been witnesses to the formation of \ntwo treaties, that with Great Britain and that with Spain, which secure \nto them everything they could desire, in respect to our foreign \nrelations, towards confirming their prosperity. Will it not be their \nwisdom to rely for the preservation of these advantages on the Union by \nwhich they were procured? Will they not henceforth be deaf to those \nadvisers, if such there are, who would sever them from their brethren \nand connect them with aliens?\n  To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a government for the \nwhole is indispensable. No alliances, however strict, between the parts \ncan be an adequate substitute. They must inevitably experience the \ninfractions and interruptions which all alliances in all times have \nexperienced. Sensible of this momentous truth, you have improved upon \nyour first essay by the adoption of a Constitution of government better \ncalculated than your former for an intimate Union and for the \nefficacious management of your common concerns. This government, the \noffspring of our own choice uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full \ninvestigation and mature deliberation, completely free in its \nprinciples, in the distribution of its powers uniting security with \nenergy, and containing within itself a provision for its own amendment, \nhas a just claim to your confidence and your support. Respect for its \nauthority, compliance with its laws, acquiescence in its measures, are \nduties enjoined by the fundamental maxims of true liberty. The basis of \nour political systems is the right of the people to make and to alter \ntheir constitutions of government. But the Constitution which at any \ntime exists, until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the \nwhole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all. The very idea of the \npower and the right of the people to establish government presupposes \nthe duty of every individual to obey the established government.\n  All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and \nassociations under whatever plausible character with the real design to \ndirect, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and action \nof the constituted authorities, are destructive of this fundamental \nprinciple and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize faction; to \ngive it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put in the place of \nthe delegated will of the nation the will of a party, often a small but \nartful and enterprising minority of the community; and, according to \nthe alternate triumphs of different parties, to make the public \nadministration the mirror of the ill concerted and incongruous projects \nof faction, rather than the organ of consistent and wholesome plans \ndigested by common councils and modified by mutual interests. However \ncombinations or associations of the above description may now and then \nanswer popular ends, they are likely, in the course of time and things, \nto become potent engines by which cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled \nmen will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for \nthemselves the reins of government, destroying afterwards the very \nengines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.\n  Towards the preservation of your government and the permanency of \nyour present happy state, it is requisite not only that you steadily \ndiscountenance irregular oppositions to its acknowledged authority but \nalso that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its \nprinciples, however specious the pretexts. One method of assault may be \nto effect in the forms of the Constitution alterations which will \nimpair the energy of the system and thus to undermine what cannot be \ndirectly overthrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited, \nremember that time and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true \ncharacter of governments as of other human institutions, that \nexperience is the surest standard by which to test the real tendency of \nthe existing constitution of a country, that facility in changes upon \nthe credit of mere hypotheses and opinion exposes to perpetual change \nfrom the endless variety of hypotheses and opinion; and remember, \nespecially, that for the efficient management of your common interests \nin a country so extensive as ours, a government of as much vigor as is \nconsistent with the perfect security of liberty is indispensable; \nliberty itself will find in such a government, with powers properly \ndistributed and adjusted, its surest guardian. It is indeed little else \nthan a name, where the government is too feeble to withstand the \nenterprises of faction, to confine each member of the society within \nthe limits prescribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the secure \nand tranquil enjoyment of the rights of person and property.\n  I have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the state, \nwith particular reference to the founding of them on geographical \ndiscriminations. Let me now take a more comprehensive view and warn you \nin the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of \nparty, generally.\n  This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having \nits root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under \ndifferent shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled, \nor repressed; but in those of the popular form it is seen in its \ngreatest rankness and is truly their worst enemy.\n  The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by \nthe spirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which in different \nages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is \nitself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal \nand permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result \ngradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the \nabsolute power of an individual; and sooner or later the chief of some \nprevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, \nturns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation on the \nruins of public liberty.\n  Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind (which \nnevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight) the common and \ncontinual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it \nthe interest and the duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain \nit.\n  It serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the \npublic administration. It agitates the community with ill founded \njealousies and false alarms, kindles the animosity of one part against \nanother, foments occasionally riot and insurrection. It opens the door \nto foreign influence and corruption, which find a facilitated access to \nthe government itself through the channels of party passions. Thus the \npolicy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and will \nof another.\n  There is an opinion that parties in free countries are useful checks \nupon the administration of the government\n\n[[Page S1020]]\n\nand serve to keep alive the spirit of liberty. This within certain \nlimits is probably true--and in governments of a monarchical cast \npatriotism may look with indulgence, if not with favor, upon the spirit \nof party. But in those of the popular character, in governments purely \nelective, it is a spirit not to be encouraged. From their natural \ntendency, it is certain there will always be enough of that spirit for \nevery salutary purpose. And there being constant danger of excess, the \neffort ought to be by force of public opinion to mitigate and assuage \nit. A fire not to be quenched, it demands a uniform vigilance to \nprevent its bursting into a flame, lest instead of warming it should \nconsume.\n  It is important, likewise, that the habits of thinking in a free \ncountry should inspire caution in those entrusted with its \nadministration to confine themselves within their respective \nconstitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one \ndepartment to encroach upon another. The spirit of encroachment tends \nto consolidate the powers of all the departments in one and thus to \ncreate, whatever the form of government, a real despotism. A just \nestimate of that love of power and proneness to abuse it which \npredominates in the human heart is sufficient to satisfy us of the \ntruth of this position. The necessity of reciprocal checks in the \nexercise of political power, by dividing and distributing it into \ndifferent depositories and constituting each the guardian of the public \nweal against invasions by the others, has been evinced by experiments \nancient and modern, some of them in our country and under our own eyes. \nTo preserve them must be as necessary as to institute them. If in the \nopinion of the people the distribution or modification of the \nconstitutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it be corrected \nby an amendment in the way which the Constitution designates. But let \nthere be no change by usurpation; for though this, in one instance, may \nbe the instrument of good, it is the customary weapon by which free \ngovernments are destroyed. The precedent must always greatly \noverbalance in permanent evil any partial or transient benefit which \nthe use can at any time yield.\n  Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political \nprosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain \nwould that man claim the tribute of patriotism who should labor to \nsubvert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of \nthe duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the \npious man, ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not \ntrace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it \nsimply be asked where is the security for property, for reputation, for \nlife, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths, which are \nthe instruments of investigation in courts of justice? And let us with \ncaution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without \nreligion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined \neducation on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both \nforbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of \nreligious principle.\n  It is substantially true that virtue or morality is a necessary \nspring of popular government. The rule indeed extends with more or less \nforce to every species of free government. Who that is a sincere friend \nto it can look with indifference upon attempts to shake the foundation \nof the fabric?\n  Promote then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for \nthe general diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of a \ngovernment gives force to public opinion, it is essential that public \nopinion should be enlightened.\n  As a very important source of strength and security, cherish public \ncredit. One method of preserving it is to use it as sparingly as \npossible, avoiding occasions of expense by cultivating peace, but \nremembering also that timely disbursements to prepare for danger \nfrequently prevent much greater disbursements to repel it; avoiding \nlikewise the accumulation of debt, not only by shunning occasions of \nexpense, but by vigorous exertions in time of peace to discharge the \ndebts which unavoidable wars may have occasioned, not ungenerously \nthrowing upon posterity the burden which we ourselves ought to bear. \nThe execution of these maxims belongs to your representatives, but it \nis necessary that public opinion should cooperate. To facilitate to \nthem the performance of their duty, it is essential that you should \npractically bear in mind that towards the payment of debts there must \nbe revenue; that to have revenue there must be taxes; that no taxes can \nbe devised which are not more or less inconvenient and unpleasant; that \nthe intrinsic embarrassment inseparable from the selection of the \nproper objects (which is always a choice of difficulties) ought to be a \ndecisive motive for a candid construction of the conduct of the \ngovernment in making it, and for a spirit of acquiescence in the \nmeasures for obtaining revenue which the public exigencies may at any \ntime dictate.\n  Observe good faith and justice towards all nations; cultivate peace \nand harmony with all; religion and morality enjoin this conduct, and \ncan it be that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be \nworthy of a free, enlightened, and, at no distant period, a great \nnation, to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a \npeople always guided by an exalted justice and benevolence. Who can \ndoubt that in the course of time and things the fruits of such a plan \nwould richly repay any temporary advantages which might be lost by a \nsteady adherence to it? Can it be, that Providence has not connected \nthe permanent felicity of a nation with its virtue? The experiment, at \nleast, is recommended by every sentiment which ennobles human nature. \nAlas! is it rendered impossible by its vices?\n  In the execution of such a plan nothing is more essential than that \npermanent, inveterate antipathies against particular nations and \npassionate attachments for others should be excluded and that in place \nof them just and amicable feelings towards all should be cultivated. \nThe nation which indulges towards another an habitual hatred, or an \nhabitual fondness, is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its \nanimosity or to its affection, either of which is sufficient to lead it \nastray from its duty and its interest. Antipathy in one nation against \nanother disposes each more readily to offer insult and injury, to lay \nhold of slight causes of umbrage, and to be haughty and intractable \nwhen accidental or trifling occasions of dispute occur. Hence frequent \ncollisions, obstinate, envenomed, and bloody contests. The nation, \nprompted by ill will and resentment, sometimes impels to war the \ngovernment, contrary to the best calculations of policy. The government \nsometimes participates in the national propensity and adopts through \npassion what reason would reject; at other times, it makes the \nanimosity of the nation subservient to projects of hostility instigated \nby pride, ambition and other sinister and pernicious motives. The peace \noften, sometimes perhaps the liberty, of nations has been the victim.\n  So likewise, a passionate attachment of one nation for another \nproduces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation, \nfacilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases \nwhere no real common interest exists and infusing into one the enmities \nof the other, betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels \nand wars of the latter, without adequate inducement or justification. \nIt leads also to concessions to the favorite nation of privileges \ndenied to others, which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the \nconcessions, by unnecessarily parting with what ought to have been \nretained and by exciting jealousy, ill will, and a disposition to \nretaliate in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld. And \nit gives to ambitious, corrupted, or deluded citizens (who devote \nthemselves to the favorite nation) facility to betray or sacrifice the \ninterests of their own country without odium, sometimes even with \npopularity, gilding with the appearances of a virtuous sense of \nobligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable \nzeal for public good, the base or foolish compliances of ambition, \ncorruption, or infatuation.\n  As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, such attachments \nare particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent \npatriot. How many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domestic \nfactions, to practice the arts of seduction, to mislead public opinion, \nto influence or awe the public councils! Such an attachment of\n\n[[Page S1021]]\n\na small or weak towards a great and powerful nation dooms the former to \nbe the satellite of the latter.\n  Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to \nbelieve me, fellow citizens) the jealousy of a free people ought to be \nconstantly awake, since history and experience prove that foreign \ninfluence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government. But \nthat jealousy to be useful must be impartial; else it becomes the \ninstrument of the very influence to be avoided, instead of a defense \nagainst it. Excessive partiality for one foreign nation and excessive \ndislike of another cause those whom they actuate to see danger only on \none side, and serve to veil and even second the arts of influence on \nthe other. Real patriots, who may resist the intrigues of the favorite, \nare liable to become suspected and odious, while its tools and dupes \nusurp the applause and confidence of the people to surrender their \ninterests.\n  The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is, in \nextending our commercial relations, to have with them as little \npolitical connection as possible. So far as we have already formed \nengagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith. Here let us \nstop.\n  Europe has a set of primary interests, which to us have none or a \nvery remote relation. Hence she must be engaged in frequent \ncontroversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to our \nconcerns. Hence therefore it must be unwise in us to implicate \nourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary vicissitudes of her \npolitics or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships \nor enmities.\n  Our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a \ndifferent course. If we remain one people under an efficient \ngovernment, the period is not far off when we may defy material injury \nfrom external annoyance; when we may take such an attitude as will \ncause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon to be scrupulously \nrespected; when belligerent nations, under the impossibility of making \nacquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard the giving us \nprovocation; when we may choose peace or war, as our interest guided by \njustice shall counsel.\n  Why forgo the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why quit our own \nto stand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our destiny with \nthat of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the \ntoils of European ambition, rival-ship, interest, humor, or caprice?\n  It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any \nportion of the foreign world--so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty \nto do it, for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing \ninfidelity to existing engagements (I hold the maxim no less applicable \nto public than to private affairs, that honesty is always the best \npolicy)--I repeat it therefore, let those engagements be observed in \ntheir genuine sense. But in my opinion it is unnecessary and would be \nunwise to extend them.\n  Taking care always to keep ourselves, by suitable establishments, on \na respectably defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary \nalliances for extraordinary emergencies.\n  Harmony, liberal intercourse with all nations, are recommended by \npolicy, humanity, and interest. But even our commercial policy should \nhold an equal and impartial hand: neither seeking nor granting \nexclusive favors or preferences; consulting the natural course of \nthings; diffusing and diversifying by gentle means the streams of \ncommerce but forcing nothing; establishing with powers so disposed--in \norder to give to trade a stable course, to define the rights of our \nmerchants, and to enable the government to support them--conventional \nrules of intercourse, the best that present circumstances and mutual \nopinion will permit, but temporary, and liable to be from time to time \nabandoned or varied, as experience and circumstances shall dictate; \nconstantly keeping in view, that it is folly in one nation to look for \ndisinterested favors from another--that it must pay with a portion of \nits independence for whatever it may accept under that character--that \nby such acceptance it may place itself in the condition of having given \nequivalents for nominal favors and yet of being reproached with \ningratitude for not giving more. There can be no greater error than to \nexpect or calculate upon real favors from nation to nation. It is an \nillusion which experience must cure, which a just pride ought to \ndiscard.\n  In offering to you, my countrymen, these counsels of an old and \naffectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the strong and \nlasting impression I could wish--that they will control the usual \ncurrent of the passions or prevent our nation from running the course \nwhich has hitherto marked the destiny of nations. But if I may even \nflatter myself that they may be productive of some partial benefit, \nsome occasional good, that they may now and then recur to moderate the \nfury of party spirit, to warn against the mischiefs of foreign \nintrigue, to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism--this \nhope will be a full recompense for the solicitude for your welfare by \nwhich they have been dictated.\n  How far in the discharge of my official duties I have been guided by \nthe principles which have been delineated, the public records and other \nevidences of my conduct must witness to you and to the world. To \nmyself, the assurance of my own conscience is that I have at least \nbelieved myself to be guided by them.\n  In relation to the still subsisting war in Europe, my proclamation of \nthe 22d of April 1793 is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by your \napproving voice and by that of your representatives in both houses of \nCongress, the spirit of that measure has continually governed me, \nuninfluenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it.\n  After deliberate examination with the aid of the best lights I could \nobtain, I was well satisfied that our country, under all the \ncircumstances of the case, had a right to take--and was bound in duty \nand interest to take--a neutral position. Having taken it, I \ndetermined, as far as should depend upon me, to maintain it with \nmoderation, perseverence, and firmness.\n  The considerations which respect the right to hold this conduct it is \nnot necessary on this occasion to detail. I will only observe that, \naccording to my understanding of the matter, that right, so far from \nbeing denied by any of the belligerent powers, has been virtually \nadmitted by all.\n  The duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred, without \nanything more, from the obligation which justice and humanity impose on \nevery nation, in cases in which it is free to act, to maintain \ninviolate the relations of peace and amity towards other nations.\n  The inducements of interest for observing that conduct will best be \nreferred to your own reflections and experience. With me, a predominant \nmotive has been to endeavor to gain time to our country to settle and \nmature its yet recent institutions and to progress without interruption \nto that degree of strength and consistency which is necessary to give \nit, humanly speaking, the command of its own fortunes.\n  Though in reviewing the incidents of my administration I am \nunconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my \ndefects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. \nWhatever they may be, I fervently beseech the Almighty to avert or \nmitigate the evils to which they may tend. I shall also carry with me \nthe hope that my country will never cease to view them with indulgence \nand that, after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service \nwith an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be \nconsigned to oblivion, as myself must soon be to the mansions of rest.\n  Relying on its kindness in this as in other things, and actuated by \nthat fervent love towards it which is so natural to a man who views in \nit the native soil of himself and his progenitors for several \ngenerations, I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat, in \nwhich I promise myself to realize without alloy the sweet enjoyment of \npartaking in the midst of my fellow citizens the benign influence of \ngood laws under a free government--the ever favorite object of my \nheart, and the happy reward, as I trust, of our mutual cares, labors \nand dangers.\n                                                      Geo. Washington. \n                                    United States, 19th September 1796.\n\n[[Page S1022]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/23/senate-section/article/S1022-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to H.R. 240, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk (Mary Anne Clarkson) read as \nfollows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 5, H.R. 240, a bill \n     making appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security \n     for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2015, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Majority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, in just a few minutes Democrats will \nhave another opportunity to end their weeks-long filibuster of Homeland \nSecurity. It will be the first opportunity our friends on the other \nside have to show where they stand after a Federal judge preliminarily \nenjoined the administration from moving ahead with actions President \nObama himself referred to as ``ignoring the law.'' President Obama said \nthat just over a year ago.\n  The point is that it is time to allow this Homeland Security funding \nmeasure to come to the floor. Democrats say they want the ability to \namend DHS funding legislation, but then they keep voting to block their \nown ability to offer amendments. It doesn't make any sense. So in a few \nmoments we will give our Democratic friends another opportunity to \nreconsider. They can vote to allow the Senate to debate the Homeland \nSecurity funding bill. They can vote to allow the Senate to consider \namendments from both sides, and that is what they actually should do. \nThat is what constituents have a right to expect. Let's take up this \nfunding bill and get to work.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, in just a few days--5 to be exact--the \nDepartment of Homeland Security will run out of money. This unique \nentity was established right after 9/11. President Bush believed there \nwere too many agencies trying to take care of the security of this \nNation, so he got Congress to work with him, and they came up with 22 \nentities for the Department of Homeland Security. They have protected \nour homeland since 9/11, and they have done a good job.\n  I am very disappointed that the political ploy used by my \ncongressional Republican leadership to force a shutdown of Homeland \nSecurity will only hurt our Nation, but it does make very clear where \nRepublicans stand on fixing our broken immigration system.\n  Twenty months ago some valiant Senators, Democrats and Republicans, \nworked together for almost a year. Democrats were led by Senators \nSchumer, Durbin, Bennet, and Menendez. Republicans were led by Senators \nMcCain, Graham, Rubio, and Flake. They worked night and day. They came \nup with a bill that they presented to us, Democrats and Republicans, \nand we worked hard. We had lots of amendments. There was a wonderful \ndebate. It was one of the great days of this body. And we passed it \nwith a bipartisan vote. It was such a good day for the Senate and our \ncountry. But now, after 20 months, suddenly people are not interested.\n  Even Senators Flake, Graham, and McCain have stated that we should \nfund Homeland Security--fund it. We have all kinds of Republican \nSenators who have said the same thing in the last few days. Senator \nJohnson said it should be fully funded. He said that today.\n  I don't understand what my Republican friends are trying to do. They \nwant to hold up DHS funding in order to deport DREAMers and their \nparents. That doesn't make any sense. Their plan is destined to fail. I \nhave said that many times. Republicans are not listening to me, and I \nunderstand why, but my Republican colleagues are not listening to a lot \nof people.\n  They are not listening to the President of the United States, who has \nwarned them that blocking Homeland Security funding will hurt our \nability to respond to these new threats.\n  Tom Ridge and I came to Washington at the same time in 1982, to the \nHouse of Representatives. Here is a man who was valiant in Vietnam. He \nwas a highly decorated soldier. He has had a stunning career in \ngovernment. He was the Governor of the State of Pennsylvania and the \nSecretary of Homeland Security. He, along with another Republican \nSecretary of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff, who has a great \nrecord of his own as a prosecutor and Federal judge, and a Democratic \nSecretary of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano, who was a former \nGovernor of the State of Arizona--so three former Secretaries of \nHomeland Security--two Republicans and one Democrat--have said the \nRepublicans should do this. In fact, here is what they said in a letter \nSenator McConnell and I received a month ago:\n\n       Funding for DHS is used to protect our ports and our \n     borders; to secure our air travel and cargo; to protect the \n     federal government and our nation's information technology \n     and infrastructure from cyber-security attacks; to fund \n     essential law enforcement activities, and to ensure the \n     safety of the president and national leaders . . . Funding \n     for the entire agency should not be put in jeopardy by the \n     debate about immigration.\n\n  That is what the former Secretaries of Homeland Security said. They \ndid not mince words.\n  In fact, Tom Ridge said yesterday on national TV that the \nRepublicans' plan ``irritates the hell out of me. I think it is bad \npolicy . . . The men and women of Homeland Security deserve better.''\n  Jeh Johnson, who has certainly been as down the middle as anyone \ncould be on this issue, said that to not fund Homeland Security is \n``unacceptable from a public safety and national security view.''\n  The majority leader and Speaker Boehner are not listening. They are \nobviously not listening to me, they are not listening to the President, \nand they are not listening to former Homeland Security Secretaries.\n  They are not even listening to their newspaper--it has been referred \nto as their newspaper--the Wall Street Journal. The Wall Street Journal \nsaid that the Republicans' game of Russian roulette with our homeland \nsecurity is destined for ``a spectacular crack-up.'' Republicans \nobviously are not listening to the Wall Street Journal. The Fraternal \nOrder of Police has lambasted the Republican scheme. The Republicans \nare not listening to the police. The United States Conference of Mayors \nsaid: Please don't do that. If you do not fund the Department of \nHomeland Security, and even if you go with a continuing resolution, it \nis going to affect our ability to protect our cities. The Governors \nhave said the same thing.\n\n  Republicans are not listening to anyone. They are bound and \ndetermined to see this doomed plan to the end. This is all because \nRepublicans want to overturn DHS directives that prioritize the \ndeportation of national security threats, convicted felons, and \nindividuals apprehended at the border. It doesn't make sense. The \nadministration sought a stay of the proceedings in Texas, but the trial \njudge in Texas never ever declared anything the President did as \nunconstitutional. If you read every word he wrote, the word \n``unconstitutional'' is not written. He said the Administrative \nProcedure Act was not followed.\n  The President has the right to determine who is to be deported, and \nthe families of these DREAMers are way down the list. So the President \nis well within his established constitutional authority and legal \nprocess to hear this out. So why would we divert resources from real \nthreats just so Republicans can deport DREAMers, long-term permanent \nresidents, mothers and fathers of U.S. citizen children who pose no \nsecurity risk? Republicans say they are attacking the President's \nactions, but they are really attacking families.\n  I suggest to my Republican colleagues that if they won't listen to \nme, the President, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Wall Street \nJournal, the Fraternal Order of Police, and the United States \nConference of Mayors, maybe they should at least heed what\n\n[[Page S1023]]\n\nour enemies are saying. We can all picture in our minds what happened \njust a few weeks ago. They put a Jordanian pilot in a cage and burned \nhim, and they showed the world that for 22 minutes. We have seen the \nbeheadings. They have not stopped. Twenty-one Egyptian Christians were \nbeheaded just a few days ago.\n  Yesterday on national TV Secretary Johnson said that we must remain \nvigilant against threats because now they told us they are going to go \nto malls around America, including the Mall of America. We must listen. \nWhy would our Republican friends want to shut off funding for Homeland \nSecurity in this environment? Listen to reason. Let's fully fund \nHomeland Security and do it now. Republican Senators are saying the \nsame thing. I don't understand what is going on here.\n  Republicans reportedly have a backup plan--fund Homeland Security by \npassing short-term continuing resolutions. That is not an answer. It is \nnot an answer. A continuing resolution will prevent the Department of \nHomeland Security from working with communities and States and their \nfirst responders in addressing new threats and emergency situations.\n  Our Nation is depending on the Department of Homeland Security, and \nfully funding it is what is needed to keep us safe. More than 230,000 \nHomeland Security employees are depending on a paycheck for their \nfamilies. A simple way of doing this is to fully fund the Department of \nHomeland Security, not some Rube Goldberg procedure where they make \nsomething very simple very complicated. It doesn't need to be \ncomplicated. We simply need to give the Department of Homeland Security \nthe resources it needs to do its job, as said by Republican Senators in \nthe past week.\n  Why are we doing this? Is it to please the House Republicans who \ncannot agree on anything? It is important that we fully fund this \nagency and do it now.\n  Would the chair now announce the business of the day. I am told the \nmotion to proceed is now pending. Is that true?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Tribute to JoAnne A. Epps\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, as I have every year since 2007, I rise \ntoday to commemorate Black History Month. This year we are privileged \nto recognize Dean JoAnne A. Epps, the dean of Temple University's \nBeasley School of Law. Dean Epps is a woman who has made significant \ncontributions to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the Nation by \npromoting opportunity and diversity throughout our legal institutions. \nJoAnne's life and career have been a testament to hard work and \nfollowing her dreams. Her achievements are substantial, and she has \nworked to inspire others to fulfill their dreams, while advancing the \ncause of social justice to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to \nreach their full potential.\n  Today I am proud to honor JoAnne Epps as a leader in law and \neducation and highlight some of the ways in which she has demonstrated \nthe power of dreams by opening doors of opportunity for women and \nminorities throughout her career.\n  JoAnne Epps's story serves as an example of where our dreams can take \nus. She is a native of Cheltenham, PA. For those who don't know the \ngeography of our State, it is in the southeastern corner of our State \nin Montgomery County. She attended Trinity College in Connecticut. As \nan undergraduate JoAnne planned to follow in her mother's footsteps and \nbecome a legal secretary; however, she distinguished herself throughout \nher undergraduate career, and her mother and professors encouraged her \nto dream big. She applied to and was accepted by Yale Law School, where \nshe was one of 40 women and just 10 African Americans in her class of \n150. JoAnne entered law school having never known an adult attorney and \noften experienced discomfort that her background differed so \nsignificantly from those of many of her classmates. Despite these \nchallenges, JoAnne Epps remained focused on the opportunities ahead of \nher.\n  Following graduation in 1976, JoAnne devoted herself to public \nservice, becoming a deputy city attorney for the city of Los Angeles, \nCA, and ultimately returning to Pennsylvania as an assistant U.S. \nattorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\n  After that work as a prosecutor, in 1985 she joined the faculty of \nthe Beasley School of Law at Temple University, utilizing the \nexperience she had gained as a prosecutor to instruct students on \ncriminal procedure, evidence, and trial advocacy. Exhibiting strong \nleadership qualities and a gift for teaching, JoAnne was soon named \nassociate dean of academic affairs, and in 2008 was named dean of \nTemple Law School.\n  As dean, JoAnne has worked tirelessly not only to advance the quality \nof legal education but to instill in students the values she believes \ndefine the legal profession. They are service, integrity, and passion. \nJoAnne has expanded opportunities for students at Temple to apply these \nvalues to a legal career by implementing programs that focus on hands-\non legal experience, both through high-quality clinical programs and \nthrough an innovative experiential first-year course as curriculum. \nThis work has led to the creation of the Stephen and Sandra Sheller \nCenter for Social Justice at Temple Law School, and we are honored \ntoday to have both Steve and Sandy Sheller with us.\n  The Sheller Center encourages early community involvement and a \ncommitment to social justice in Temple Law students by facilitating \ncollaboration with community groups, the university community, and the \nPhiladelphia and Pennsylvania legal communities to improve access to \njustice for underserved communities.\n  It is a truly inspiring project. Even as JoAnne innovates at a \nschoolwide level, she has not lost her dedication to the individual \nconnections fostered through teaching. She continues to share her \nexperience and insight with first-year law students by teaching a \ncourse in litigation basics each fall.\n  JoAnne has employed her talent for teaching not only to the benefit \nof Temple University and the Pennsylvania legal community but to \nfurther social justice objectives on an international scale. JoAnne has \nbeen an advocacy instructor for attorneys at the United Nations \nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and the Beijing Supreme \nPeople's Procuratorate. In 2007 and 2008, she worked with a small group \nof lawyers to provide training for Sudanese lawyers representing \nvictims of the crisis in Darfur on evidence, advocacy, and substantive \ninternational criminal law with a focus on practice before the \nInternational Criminal Court.\n  JoAnne's service and impact on Temple Law School is made all the more \nimpressive in light of the myriad of other roles she has taken on to \nadvance the causes of social justice through legal institutions. In \n2001, JoAnne was appointed by the mayor of Philadelphia to chair the \nMayor's Task Force on Police Discipline, and in 2011 she was appointed \nby the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to \nmonitor the city of Philadelphia's compliance with a settlement \nconcerning stop-and-frisk procedures. She has a long history of service \non various commissions designed to increase access to justice, \nincluding the Philadelphia Bar Association's Committee to Promote \nJustice, the board of directors of the Defender Association of \nPhiladelphia, the advisory board of the Public Interest Law Center, the \nPennsylvania Commission for Justice Initiatives, and too many others to \nname today.\n  In recognition of this work, in 2003 Temple Law School presented her \nwith the Gideon Award, given to acknowledge dedication to the cause of \njustice.\n  JoAnne Epps has had a great career and has had great success as a \nlawyer, as a teacher, as an advocate, and as a prosecutor despite the \nchallenges of being an African-American woman entering a field that is \npredominantly white and male. She consistently worked to open the doors \nof opportunities to women and minorities who face similar challenges. \nAt Temple, JoAnne served as a member of the Women's Studies Program \nSteering Committee, and she remains an affiliated member of the Women's \nStudies Department at the law school. She has also previously served as \nan adviser to both the Women's Law Caucus and the Black Law Students \nAssociation.\n\n[[Page S1024]]\n\n  Outside of Temple Law, JoAnne served as vice chair of the \nPennsylvania Gender Task Force and as a member of the Third Circuit \nTask Force on Equal Treatment in the Courts, also serving on the Third \nCircuit task force commission on race and ethnicity.\n  JoAnne testified on behalf of the National Association of Women \nLawyers at the confirmation hearing of Supreme Court Justice Sonia \nSotomayor. In 2014, she was awarded the Justice Sotomayor Diversity \nAward by the Philadelphia Bar Association in recognition of her work on \nbehalf of women and minorities in the legal profession.\n  JoAnne has said the following about her legal career, and I am \nquoting:\n\n       I spent much of my career not seeing ahead of me someone \n     who was at all like me, and I've had to make my way without \n     that. I want to be a resource for young people entering the \n     profession that I never had.\n\n  Joanne's dedication to both legal education and the legal profession \nhas helped empower countless young attorneys to exceed expectations and \nfulfill their dreams.\n  JoAnne Epps is here today in the gallery of the Senate, and as the \nrules tell us, we are not allowed to acknowledge those in the gallery. \nI am saying that for my friend. But she is joined by family and \nfriends, and I am going to go through a list here. If I miss someone, \nsomeone will tell me later.\n  Starting with her husband L. Harrison Jay, her uncle Harold Ashton, \nand her cousins Eric Ashton, Joan and Tommie Frye, Donnie, Debbie, \nAdrienne, and Christopher Jackson, and Marcia and Glenn Yarbrough--I \nwill hear if I missed someone a little later, but we are honored she is \nhere with us. We are honored her family is here on this special day. \nToday we honor JoAnne Epps, the dean of Temple Law School, for her \nsignificant work to advance access to justice and for inspiring and \nempowering new generations of attorneys to emulate their commitment to \nservice, integrity, and passion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, as I come to the floor today, the \nSenate is continuing to try to debate a bill to fund the Department of \nHomeland Security. We have made no progress on this bill for weeks, as \nDemocrats continue to filibuster our efforts to actually even get on \nthe bill, to have a meaningful discussion on the subject. The bill has \nalready passed the House of Representatives.\n  The way the Senate is supposed to work is that if Democrats don't \nlike something about the bill, then they should offer amendments and \nchange it. That is how the process has worked in the past. It is how \nthe process is supposed to work today.\n  It is the process as it worked about a month ago when we debated the \nKeystone XL Pipeline. We had more than 40 different amendments debated \non the floor, voted on the floor. That is more than double the number \nof amendments the Senate Democrats allowed all last year in debate on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  We could be debating those and voting on those amendments right now. \nMy question is, why aren't we doing that? It is because Senate \nDemocrats are filibustering to keep us from even considering this bill. \nThis is a very important piece of legislation. Funding for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security is scheduled to expire on Friday. \nEveryone in this Chamber, both sides of the aisle, should agree that \nfunding the Department of Homeland Security is something we need to do. \nWhy are Democrats being obstructive in the way that they are? Why are \nthe Democrats so eager to cut off funding for the Department of \nHomeland Security?\n  The answer is this is a disagreement not about funding Homeland \nSecurity, it is about our Nation's immigration policy and the \nPresident's Executive amnesty, an action which I believe is illegal. \nCongress is the appropriate place to make laws about America's \nimmigration policy. It is not something the President gets to decide on \nhis own. It shouldn't be controversial either. At least eight Senate \nDemocrats have said they disagreed with the President's Executive \nactions or they have doubts about them.\n  Senator Donnelly said back in November ``the President shouldn't make \nsuch significant policy changes on his own.''\n  On the same day Senator Heitkamp said the President's actions ``could \npoison any hope of compromise or bipartisanship in the Senate before it \nhas even started.''\n  Even the President himself has on 22 separate occasions said he \nlacked the authority to rewrite immigration law--22 times. He said in \nMarch of 2011:\n\n       There are enough laws on the books by Congress that are \n     very clear in terms of how we have to enforce our immigration \n     system, that for me to simply, through Executive order ignore \n     those congressional mandates would not conform with my \n     appropriate role as President.\n\n  He did it anyway. He knew it wasn't appropriate, but that didn't stop \nhim. Now a Federal judge has made it crystal clear the President does \nnot have the authority to act on his own as he did. The President \ncannot make a new law just because he doesn't like the laws passed by \nCongress. This was a U.S. district court ruling in a lawsuit that 26 \nStates brought against President Obama.\n  Here is how USA TODAY described it in a front-page headline last \nWednesday. They said, ``Obama Immigration Plan Blocked.''\n  Rollcall ran its own headline the same day that said, ``Immigration \nRuling Casts Shadow on Obama's Legacy.'' What the court did was to stop \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security from implementing any and all \naspects or phases of the President's plan. The Federal court said, ``It \nis Congress, and Congress alone, who has power under the Constitution \nto legislate in the field of immigration.'' Let me repeat that. ``It is \nCongress, and Congress alone, who has power under the Constitution to \nlegislate in the field of immigration.''\n  The judge added that the President's plan ``clearly represents a \nsubstantive change in immigration policy.'' This is not just a minor \nchange. It is not the same thing that other Presidents have done \nbefore. The judge completely rejected the Obama administration's claim \nthat it was simply exercising ``prosecutorial discretion.''\n  I know the President did not understand the last election. I am \nstarting to think Democrats in this body do not understand why they \nlost. It is strange that Democrats want to continue trying to protect \nthe President who does not have the strong support of the American \npeople. It was a losing strategy in November and it will be a losing \nstrategy now.\n  Democrats in this body are continuing to prevent the Senate from \ndoing anything, again, in an effort--they are doing it to protect \nPresident Obama. Now that a Federal judge has agreed the President \nexceeded his own authority, it is time for Democrats to stop defending \nthe President and the White House. Senate Democrats have already voiced \ntheir concerns about what the President did and how he did it. It is \ntime for those same Democrats to convince the rest of their Members \nthat enough is enough.\n  It is time for them to stop pretending this is about immigration, \nwhen it is now clear this is about the President's overreach. It is \ntime for Democrats to end their filibuster and to fund the Department \nof Homeland Security.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote for the \nfourth time on a procedural vote to take up the House Homeland Security \nfunding bill. We are going to be voting on the cloture of the motion to \nproceed because it is a parliamentary way of dealing with the funding \nfor the Homeland Security Department, which runs out on Friday.\n  The Presiding Officer is the ranking member on the homeland \nsubcommittee. The Presiding Officer did a fantastic job, working with \nSenator Landrieu, creating a funding framework that had bipartisan and \nbicameral support. I congratulate the Presiding Officer and the way the \ncommittee worked.\n\n[[Page S1025]]\n\n  We should be voting on the final passage for a clean Homeland \nSecurity bill. The bill--when we say ``clean,'' this is Washington \nspeak. People do not know what a clean bill is. Is there a dirty bill? \nIs there a dusty bill? Is there a muddy bill? No. What we are talking \nabout is meaning no riders on the bill. In this case, no poison pill \nriders. There was no disagreement, finally, because of the excellent \nbipartisan work on the funding of the bill, but the Senate is locked in \na game of parliamentary ping-pong on moving this legislation forward, \nwhere the losers are the American people.\n  Look at what is going on in our country right now. We are absolutely \nrelying on Homeland Security for some of the biggest challenges--not \nfacing in the abstract but facing us right now.\n  There are the terrorists and there is cold weather and there are \nother issues. Right now in my Chesapeake Bay there is a Coast Guard \ncutter called Chock. It is out there breaking the Maryland icy \nconditions--frigid and windy. What is it they are doing? This enables \ncommerce to get up and down the Bay so people are working and getting \nimportant supplies. They even work--because the Bay is in both Maryland \nand Virginia. They went out to the famous Tangier Island to free \nresidents that were iced in, to take food and fuel. The Coast Guard is \non the job. They are working in the cold. They are working in the wind. \nThey are breaking up ice not only in Maryland but all over--to these \nfrozen ports. What do we say? Good job, guys. There they are on TV. We \nlove you, but we might not pay you. What is this? They are out there \nsaving lives. We are playing parliamentary ping-pong.\n  Then there is this whole issue of this despicable, barbaric group \ncalled ISIL who essentially says: We are out to get you. Not only are \nthey out to get us, but then they threatened that there could be \nattacks on malls, the shopping malls in the United States.\n  We need then additional security from Homeland Security. We also need \nto be able to work with our local and State partners. What is \nCongress's response? We are going to talk about increasing that defense \nbudget in 2016, but we are not going to fund the appropriations from \n2015 on Homeland Security. What is wrong with that picture?\n  I am for a strong national defense and having the muscular way of \ndealing with the threat of ISIL and any other terrorist group, but they \nare talking about our malls. They also go on their Web--I hate to even \nsay this in public. They say attack anybody who is in uniform. Well, \nthat is my firefighter, that is my police officer, that is my EMT \nperson. I mean, really. We are worried about lone wolves?\n  Well, I am worried too. We need to be able to protect them. One way \nto do it is we need to fund the Homeland Security Department so people \nwho are on the job protecting us can get paid. There are Members on the \nother side of the aisle who continually ask the President what he is \ndoing to defend America. Let's put boots on the ground. Let's put more \nmissiles in the air. Let's put more flights for airplanes.\n  Right here in America we have boots on the ground. They are called \nBorder Patrol agents, Customs officers, TSA personnel, intelligence \nanalysts. We have to fund our own Homeland Security boots on the \nground. I want to make sure we do it now, so we do not have some big \ncrisis at midnight on Friday.\n  Where we are is this: We have agreed on the funding on both sides of \nthe aisle and both sides of the dome. The House has added five riders \non immigration. Immigration is an important topic. I do not minimize \nit. I do not dismiss it. It should be debated but not on this bill.\n  The other issue is that the courts have now made a decision--the \nTexas court--on the Obama action on Executive orders and immigration. \nIt is now going to go through the courts. The Texas judge made a \ndecision. That is America. It will go to the Fifth Circuit for an \nappeal and maybe even higher. While it is working its way through, we \nare debating it. Let the courts decide whether the President exceeded \nhis Executive authority. Whatever the courts decide, I think we will be \nable to accept it. We cannot hold up the bill waiting for the courts to \ndecide.\n  We should not hold up the Homeland Security bill waiting for the \ncourts to decide. So with the court decision pending, I say to my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle--who I know are patriotic, who I \nknow want to protect the homeland--put immigration aside on the \nExecutive orders and all of those others, let the courts decide on the \nExecutive authority, but between now and, say, Wednesday let's pass \nthis Homeland Security bill.\n  We can pass it, send it to the House, and we can get on with the \nprotecting America rather than what we think about President Obama. I \nrespect what other people think about President Obama. I do not also \nrespect what some people say in their attacks on him: Is he American? \nIs he patriotic? I think that is despicable to attack our President. \nBut if you think this is a constitutional question on Executive \nauthority, it is now in the courts. That can be a valid consideration.\n  But right now we have a Homeland Security funding problem. I want to \nfund the Coast Guard. I want to fund Border Patrol. I want to fund \nCustoms. I want to fund the TSA at the airports. I want to protect us \non threats related to cyber security. This is for the 22 subagencies \nthat make up Homeland Security. So I would hope, for the 162,000 people \nwho work for that agency, they do not get IOUs.\n  Given what they are doing in this cold weather and on this incredible \nintensity and escalation of chatter and threats to the United States, \nwe have to help them be them. We have to give them respect. We have to \npay their salaries. We have to give them the right technology to be \nable to do their jobs to protect us. I say to the Presiding Officer and \nto all of my colleagues on the floor: Let's stop playing parliamentary \nping-pong with the Homeland Security bill.\n  The politics in that are over. The issue is going to be resolved in \nthe courts, but what cannot be resolved is the fact that on February 27 \nthe money to fund the salaries for every single man and woman who works \nat Homeland Security will run out. The time is running out. The money \nis running out. We cannot run out on Homeland Security. We have to help \nthem make us a safe country, protect our country, and do their job.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I thank Senator Mikulski. She has been \njoined by Senator Shaheen, both of whom have been leading this very \nimportant bill to pass this funding for Homeland Security. I thought \nthe points Senator Mikulski made were so well taken about the fact that \nthere has been a new development since we left this Chamber; that is, \nthat the courts are taking on some of the immigration provisions our \ncolleagues have been trying to attach to this bill.\n  I would hope they could look at this in a fresh way now and see that \nwe should just simply allow this bill to go forward while the courts \nare considering this matter. To me, that is the answer. I do not think \nthey should see it--our colleagues on the other side--as a concession. \nIt is simply a fact. It is something that has changed. So I come to the \nfloor to talk about the importance of the Mikulski-Shaheen bill. The \ncritical importance of this funding has been driven home in the last \nfew days in my State, the State of Minnesota.\n  Just this weekend the terrorist group al-Shabaab released a video \nencouraging attacks on shopping malls throughout the world--a shopping \nmall in Minnesota, the Mall of America, a shopping mall in Canada, in \nEdmonton, a shopping mall in London. I do not think we could ever think \nthey would be limited in their threats when it comes to shopping malls \nin America.\n  This is the same terrorist group that actually carried out a major \nattack on a shopping mall in Kenya, killing more than 60 people. It has \nalso called for attacks, as I said, in other countries. In this video, \nan al-Shabaab spokesman bragged about his previous attacks and the \nchaos future attacks can cause. He talks about if just a handful of \nfighters could bring Kenya to a complete stop for weeks, he talks about \nwhat they could do to--in his words, obviously not mine--American- or \nJewish-owned shopping centers across the world.\n  That is what we saw this weekend. That is what the people in my State\n\n[[Page S1026]]\n\nawoke to. They awoke to that video and those words. I spoke yesterday \nwith Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, with our U.S. attorney \nfor Minnesota, Andy Luger. We are working with the FBI, and they have \nboosted the security at the Mall of America. It already had good \nsecurity. We have fine law enforcement in Minnesota on the Federal, \nState, and local levels.\n\n  The FBI has advised people, clearly, to go on with their lives in \nMinnesota. The Homeland Security Secretary has clearly said people \nshouldn't be discouraged from going to the mall in any way.\n  So the people in my State are standing tall when it comes to this \nthreat, and our law enforcement is standing tall when it comes to this \nthreat, but in Congress our message to these terrorists cannot be that \nwe are going to shut down the Department of Homeland Security. That \ncannot be the message coming from the Senate of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Rather than acting to protect my State from the threat, there are \npeople who are actively contemplating a shutdown of the Department of \nHomeland Security--the Department we created after 9/11 to protect our \nhomeland, to protect our country from these kinds of terrorist threats.\n  This would mean--if it was to go forward and we weren't to fund it \nthis week--over 1,700 Department of Homeland Security employees in \nMinnesota would be forced to work without pay or be furloughed, \nincluding 472 Customs and Border Patrol personnel, 953 Transportation \nSecurity Administration officers, 156 Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement personnel, and 74 Federal Emergency Management Agency \npersonnel.\n  We need to act to fund Homeland Security. Think of the people in my \nState who were going to spend a normal day going to the mall, waking up \nto see that video. Think about the fact that I have to tell them there \nare people messing around with this bill over extraneous provisions \nthat are now being battled out in court--and not on a bill that funds \nour Homeland Security.\n  Now we also know terrorist organizations such as al-Shabaab and ISIS \nare trying to recruit people in my State to take up arms and do harm to \nAmericans.\n  Why do we know that? The first American who was killed fighting for \nISIS in Syria was from Minnesota. His name was Douglas McAuthur McCain. \nWe also know our law enforcement, because they have worked so well with \nour Somali community--we are so proud of that community. We have half \nthe Somalis in the Nation in the State of Minnesota.\n  They were able to work with our law enforcement over the last few \nyears. Twenty people were indicted. Twenty people were indicted for \nhelping al-Shabaab or trying to go over to fight on the terrorists' \nside. We have already had nine convictions in Minnesota.\n  Those convictions would not have happened without this community. \nThis Muslim community basically said: We don't want our kids to go over \nand be suicide bombers. We don't want our kids to go fight next to \nISIS.\n  That community has worked with law enforcement in Minnesota and they \nwill continue to work with law enforcement. We have already had four \npeople from the Twin Cities area who have been charged for crimes \nrelating to travel for the purpose of going to aid ISIS.\n  But it is not only our national security that the people in my State \nsee as at stake here. I know Senator Shaheen, who is on the floor, is \nalso from a border State and understands how important that work is as \nwe go up to our northern neighbor of Canada. This is 5,500 miles--the \nlongest border in the world. Over 400,000 people and nearly $2 billion \nin goods and services cross our borders every day.\n  That is economically significant for my State. Canada is my State's \ntop international trading partner, with over $19 billion in total \nbusiness across the board. Over 1 million Canadians visit Minnesota \nevery year--by the way, many of them going to the Mall of America--\ncontributing $265 million to the local economy.\n  But that relationship relies on a seamless U.S.-Canadian border, with \nU.S. Customs and Border Patrol keeping that border secure and \nefficiently screening all cross-border traffic. We have made important \nstrides in recent years with trusted traveler programs to make our \nnorthern border more secure, while encouraging the cross-border tourism \nand commerce that is the lifeblood of my State. Withholding critical \nfunding from the Department of Homeland Security could threaten that \nprogress, leading to a less secure border and hindering economic \nopportunity.\n  Without that critical funding, we risk security. Even a cursory look \nat world headlines shows the threats the United States and our allies \nface--from the terrorist attacks in Paris and Sydney to the cyber \nattacks by North Korea. We need to be stepping up our security, not \nstepping down our security.\n  So last night I spoke to a group of workers--about 500 Minnesotans--\nwho were honored in the city of Bloomington, MN, for the work they do \nin the hospitality industry. These were desk clerks, these were pizza \ndelivery people, these were people who man our hotels and clean the \nrooms when we have guests. Many of them work in that Mall of America, \nand I told them I was coming back to Washington and that this Senate \nwould stand tall in the face of threats such as videos from al-Shabaab, \npeople who will not even show their faces but make a video to threaten \nour country.\n  We have to show our faces. We have to stand tall. We now have a very \ngood reason--my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I implore \nthem, they have a good reason. This is in the courts now. It is being \nbattled in the courts. These extraneous measures should not be on this \nbill and we should fund our Homeland Security. I want to go back and \ntell those workers in Bloomington and in Minnesota that we have done \nthat.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I applaud Senator Klobuchar for her \ncomments and for pointing out there are real threats that we heard this \nweekend from al-Shabaab against the Mall of America. I heard a news \nreport this morning about that, and one of the things they have talked \nabout are the very good relations the State of Minnesota and Senator \nKlobuchar have built with the Somali community.\n  But her remarks, just as those news reports, underscore the fact that \nwe have to address funding for the Department of Homeland Security. We \nare just days away from a shutdown, a shutdown of the Department whose \nmission it is to protect the citizens of this country while we are \nunder threat of attack by terrorist groups. That is reckless and it is \ndangerous. What kind of message does it send to ISIS, to cyber \ncriminals, to drug cartels if Congress can't keep the Department of \nHomeland Security open?\n  Because of the real and dangerous threats we face, we need to have \nour counterterrorism, our intelligence, and our law enforcement \nofficials functioning at their highest level.\n  I met this morning with a group of law enforcement officials and \nfirefighters from the sea coast of New Hampshire, and they were talking \nabout how important the funding from the Department of Homeland \nSecurity is to them as they do their jobs. They said two things that I \nthink are very important. First, they said they have been able to be \nproactive about planning to address threats because of the Department \nof Homeland Security, and second is they can share those resources. New \nHampshire, similar to Indiana, is a State with a lot of very small \ncommunities, and we need to be able to share those resources if we are \ngoing to be prepared for the threats.\n  It is time for us to put politics aside. We can debate immigration. \nWe can debate the President's Executive orders. I am pleased to do \nthat, but we should do it in another place. We should not be doing it \non the bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security.\n  I hope my colleagues will come together and support a clean funding \nbill so we can make sure the resources are there to fight the threats \nthat we face.\n  Mr. NELSON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. NELSON. Would the Senator believe that if the Department of \nHomeland Security is shut down that essential personnel will be \nrequired to work,\n\n[[Page S1027]]\n\nbut essential personnel--the following--will not be paid? For the first \ntime people engaged in the war--namely, the U.S. Coast Guard that is in \nfact involved in the Middle East in the war, along with the services \nfrom the Department of Defense--for the first time in the history of \nthis country they will be essential to continue work but will not be \npaid.\n  Would the Senator believe that in addition, Customs and Border Patrol \npersonnel who are essential, as well as TSA, which is essential, will \ncontinue to work but without pay and that is what will happen this \nFriday if we do not fund the Department of Homeland Security?\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. My colleague makes a very important point. I visited \nthe Coast Guard station in Portsmouth, NH, on Friday and heard about \ntheir drug interdiction efforts and their search and rescue efforts. As \nthe Senator points out, they--similar to so many other Homeland \nSecurity employees--will not be paid. We should not let that happen. \nThat is not conducive to making sure we protect this country.\n  I thank my colleague from Florida.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to follow my esteemed \ncolleagues from the State of Florida and the State of New Hampshire in \ndiscussing the legislation before this body. I worked with the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire on the Homeland Security Appropriations \nSubcommittee, and we are working to fund Homeland Security. That is \nwhat this bill does. The bill we are trying to proceed to fully funds \nHomeland Security.\n  My question is, How do we finish a bill if we can't start? All we are \nasking for is to proceed to a bill that fully funds the Department of \nHomeland Security. So I have been listening to my colleagues talk about \nthe need to fund Homeland Security and that is exactly what this bill \ndoes--fully funds the bill.\n  Now I understand they want to make changes to the bill, but again I \nask the question how do they make changes to a bill if they are not \nwilling to proceed to the bill, get on the bill, debate the bill, and \noffer their amendments?\n  So that is where we find ourselves and that is why it is so important \nthat we proceed to this DHS funding bill. This is a bill that has \npassed the House.\n  At the end of the day, both Houses of Congress have to pass the bill. \nWe can't just pass it in the Senate and they can't just pass it in the \nHouse. The House has passed this bill.\n  Now we need to take it up. We need to have the debate, we need to \noffer amendments, have votes on those amendments, and pass the bill--\npass the bill that fully funds DHS. Again, I emphasize, this bill fully \nfunds the Department of Homeland Security.\n  We are ready to legislate. We are willing to go back and forth on \namendments, one Democratic amendment for every Republican amendment, \nbut when that was offered last week on this floor by the majority \nleader, it was rejected by the other side of the aisle.\n  This leads me to believe that what my Democratic colleagues are \nasking for is that the only DHS funding legislation the Senate consider \nis legislation endorsed by the President. Moreover, they don't seem to \nbe interested in amendments, in allowing the Senators and those \nAmericans--whom we represent--to have a voice in this process.\n  My colleagues know that is not how the Senate works. When our \nFounders sought to build a government of checks and balances, with a \nstrong legislative branch and mechanisms to prevent the Executive, the \nPresident, from imposing his or her will on the rest of government, I \ndoubt this is what they had in mind; that we simply rubberstamp what \nthe President wants.\n  Today's cloture vote on the motion to proceed to the DHS \nappropriations bill offers all Senators a choice. We have a choice \ntoday. Senators can choose to legislate a solution to this DHS funding \nimpasse to prevent a DHS shutdown or they can choose to defend the \nPresident's Executive action.\n  That is exactly what is going on. As Senators we must be willing to \nengage with one another to pass a bill. We must be willing to engage, \nto debate, and to vote on amendments.\n  Often there are many sides to an issue. In fact, sometimes it feels \nas though there are 100 different perspectives, and of course there \nare. But the ability to merge our diverse viewpoints into legislation, \nthat is the strength of the Senate. That is the only way, short of one \nparty possessing 60 votes, the Senate can function. Many of our friends \non the other side of the aisle are asking this body to rubberstamp the \nPresident's approach, but the Senate was not intended to be a \nrubberstamp. We must be willing to take that first step toward funding \nDHS together, and that first step is proceeding to a bill. In order to \nconsider amendments and develop consensus, we simply must be able to \nmove to the legislation and consider it on the floor today.\n  Let me remind my colleagues why this funding is so vital.\n  The Department is responsible for so many essential security \nprograms. I think it is important that we take a few minutes to talk \nabout the funding that is in this bill, full funding for the Department \nof Homeland Security.\n  This bill provides $10.7 billion for Customs and Border Protection, \nCBP, including record levels of personnel, tactical infrastructure, \ntechnology, and air and marine assets. It provides $5.96 billion for \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, and maintains a record 34,000 \nadult detention beds and 3,828 family detention beds.\n  This bill strongly supports the vital missions of the Secret Service \nand provides for our cyber security efforts. The bill provides more \nthan $10 billion for the Coast Guard for its many missions, including \nsearch and rescue.\n  Since Homeland Security is a national effort, the bill continues \ncritical funding for grant programs to State and local firefighters, \nemergency managers, and law enforcement. The bill also provides for \nresearch and development, TSA's aviation security screening operations, \nthe Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, and E-Verify, which \nsupports businesses across the United States in hiring legal workers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute to \ncomplete my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing none, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. This bill does not fund the President's Executive \nactions--and rightly so.\n  Since we haven't had regular order in this Chamber in years, it seems \nthere may be some reluctance to allow the Senate to work as it is \ndesigned to do: to proceed to legislation so that we, as a legislative \nbody, can engage in a healthy debate. It is time the Senate proceed to \nthe DHS appropriations bill without further delay. I urge my colleagues \nto vote to proceed to H.R. 240, the DHS appropriations bill.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before \nthe Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The legislative clerk (John Merlino) read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to H.R. 240, making appropriations for the Department \n     of Homeland Security for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     2015.\n         Mitch McConnell, John Cornyn, Thad Cochran, Tom Cotton, \n           Roger F. Wicker, David Vitter, Jerry Moran, Daniel \n           Coats, Michael B. Enzi, Mike Crapo, Bill Cassidy, John \n           Boozman, John Thune, Tim Scott, John Hoeven, James \n           Lankford, Jeff Sessions.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nmotion to proceed to H.R. 240, an act making appropriations for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security for the fiscal year ending September \n30, 2015, and for other purposes, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

On this vote, the yeas are 47, the nays are \n46.\n  Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I enter a motion to reconsider the \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is entered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today Democrats voted to continue \nblocking funding for the Department of Homeland Security to protect \nactions President Obama himself referred to as ``ignoring the law.'' \nThe vote came after a Federal judge enjoined the administration from \nmoving ahead with that overreach. I was certainly glad to see that \ncourt decision. The issue will continue winding its way through our \ncourts. In the meantime, Congress is trying to do what it can. Yet even \nDemocrats who had previously been critical of the President ``ignoring \nthe law'' voted again today to defend his overreach.\n  My preference is still to debate and pass the funding legislation \nthat is currently before us. It has already passed the House. It is the \nsimplest and easiest way forward. If Democrats think it needs to be \namended, I am sure they will try to do that, but first we need to bring \nit to the floor. As long as Democrats continue to prevent us from even \ndoing that, the new bill I described offers another option we can turn \nto. It is another way to get the Senate unstuck from a Democratic \nfilibuster and move the debate forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/23/senate-section/article/S1028-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO ERMA H.

Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to one of the finest \nstaffers I have encountered in my years in the U.S. Senate. Roger \nCockrell is retiring this week after 15 years of service to the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, which was proceeded by more than 20 years \nwith the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, mainly in Vicksburg, MS.\n  I spent many years as either the chairman or ranking Democrat on the \nEnergy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee. It is a great bill. It \nnot only funds a lot of important energy and science priorities, it \nalso provides the annual funding for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \nand the Bureau of Reclamation, both of which are tremendously important \nto my home State of Nevada. Sorting through all of the projects and \nprograms that are funded through these two agencies is tremendously \ntechnical and complicated work.\n  I realized fairly early in my time at the top of that subcommittee \nthat I needed an experienced engineer to ensure that we were \nprioritizing and funding these thousands of projects according to both \ntechnical merit and also national priorities. So, I brought in Roger as \na fellow from the Corps of Engineers and it turned out to be one of the \nbest decisions I ever made. As all Members have been known to do, I \nkept him as a fellow for as long as the Corps would pay him and then I \nhired him away.\n  Roger is exactly what you want in a staffer, particularly one who \nrepresents you on the Appropriations Committee: Smart, extremely well-\nprepared, hard-working, and, in the case of Roger, more willing to work \nwith the staff of other Members to make their priorities work within \nthe rules than anyone I have ever met. If Roger could not make your \nproject work within the rules, regulations, and laws regarding a water \nproject, it is a pretty safe bet that it was a bad project. So far as I \nknow, Roger never turned down a meeting with anyone and his eternally \nsunny and friendly nature always made him a delight to work with.\n  I left that subcommittee many years ago now, but Roger stayed there \nand has gone back and forth to both the Republican and Democratic \nstaffs several times depending upon who is in the majority around here. \nI can think of no higher compliment to a Senate staffer than to be held \nin such high esteem by both sides that he or she is retained by the \nmajority year-after-year, Congress after Congress because of his or her \nexpertise and, more importantly, fairness. And Roger is nothing if not \nfair to all who have appeared in his doorway over the years. The Senate \nis a better place because of people like Roger Cockrell.\n  I wish Roger and his wife Anna Lisa all the best as they move on to \nwhatever is next in their lives. I am sad to see him go, but he has \nearned more time with his family, including his daughter Melissa. I \nhave known him long enough to know that he won't be able to sit still \nfor long. I join my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in expressing \nmy gratitude for his long and dedicated service to our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/23/senate-section/article/S1028-3", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1028-S1029]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO CHRISTINE PRIETSCH\n\n  Mr. REID.

Christy turned this program into an invaluable resource for \nSenate employees experiencing obstacles and struggles in their \nprofessional and personal lives.

It is our hope that the irony is not \nlost, that through the auspices of her professionalism, \nconfidentiality, morality and ethics, we are prevented from hearing \nmany such stories; only those who Christy helped know the true value of \nher service.

I thank her for her dedicated \nservice, her unbridled patriotism and unwavering support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/23/senate-section/article/S1029-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1029]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     STUDENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT\n\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I support the Student Non-Discrimination \nAct, a bill first introduced in the 111th Congress and reintroduced \nagain now in the 114th Congress. This bill represents a critical step \nforward in protecting the rights of our lesbian, gay, bisexual, and \ntransgender youth to receive an education free from bullying and \nharassment on account of who they are and who they love. I thank \nSenator Franken for his leadership on this issue, and I am proud to be \nan original cosponsor of this important civil rights legislation.\n  Education is the cornerstone of our democracy. In order for our \nsystem of government to thrive we must promote the education of our \ncitizenry. It is what allows voters to make informed decisions on who \nthey think is best fit to serve as their Representative, Senator, or \nPresident. It is a critical element of public debate and the free flow \nof ideas and it is what drives our economy forward and makes our \ncountry strong.\n  Given the importance of education, no student should be harassed in \nschool. We must do all we can to make education accessible to all. We \nmust ensure that schools are safe and welcoming to all children so that \nstudents can enter the classroom ready and able to learn.\n  Bullying touches the lives of countless young people. Each school \nyear, LGBT students in New Jersey, and across America, are harassed, \nbullied, and even assaulted based on their perceived or known status as \nLGBT. Occasionally, these youth even experience bullying from teachers \nand administrators. The very people that are supposed to educate and \nprotect these children at times serve as the root cause of the problem. \nBullying a student for any reason--but especially for simply being \nthemselves--is simply unacceptable.\n  The consequences of bullying can be devastating and potentially life \nthreatening. Studies show that discrimination at schools is a major \ncontributor to dropouts, absenteeism, and academic underachievement. \nLGBT youth are twice as likely as their peers to experience verbal \nharassment, assault, and exclusion. Suicide rates are \ndisproportionately high among children and young adults that identify \nas LGBT. In fact, LGBT youth are four times more likely to commit \nsuicide than their peers. Most alarmingly, we have seen bullying and \nharassment tragically lead to suicides in school districts across the \ncountry.\n  Allowing discrimination of LGBT to go unchecked in our schools \ndeprives our youth from the equal access to education that they \ndeserve. Whether that discrimination is in the form harassment or \nassault, we cannot stand idly by and watch our children's lives be torn \napart.\n  The Student Non-Discrimination Act is a critical civil rights bill \nthat would ban discrimination against any student on the basis of his \nor her actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity.\n  The legislation expands the Federal definition of harassment to \nprotect the rights of LGBT students. The bill defines harassment to \ninclude severe, persistent, or pervasive conduct that would limit a \nstudent's ability to participate in a program or activity at a public \nschool.\n  The bill prohibits harassment of LGBT students as a form of \ndiscrimination that is Federally protected.\n  All of these provisions provide the Federal Government with critical \nnew tools to prevent the scourge of persistent and offensive bullying \nof youth simply because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.\n  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Student Non-\nDiscrimination Act. I urge my fellow Senators to support this bill and \npromptly pass it through the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/23/senate-section/article/S1029-2", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1029-S1030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         REMEMBERING WIL SMITH\n\n Mr. KING. Mr. President, I rise today on a sad occasion. \nYesterday, Bowdoin College--indeed, the entire State of Maine--lost a \ntruly great man. Wil Smith, who was a good friend to countless people \nin Maine, passed away yesterday at the age of 46 following a courageous \n3-year battle with cancer.\n  It is difficult to encapsulate in words the remarkable depth and \nbreadth of someone like Wil. He grew up in Jacksonville, FL, the \nyoungest of 10 children. His mother, Mildred, passed away when he was \n15 years old. After high school, Wil briefly attended Florida A \nUniversity before enlisting in the U.S. Navy and becoming an aviation \nelectronics technician. He served in the first gulf war and was later \ntransferred to the Naval Air Station in Brunswick, ME.\n  While stationed in Brunswick, Wil began coaching football at \nBrunswick Middle School. It wasn't long after that when the coach of \nthe Bowdoin College men's basketball team spotted him and was impressed \nby his talent and natural ability to work with kids. He asked Wil if he \nhad ever thought about attending college. After some convincing, Wil \napplied to and was accepted at Bowdoin.\n  It was also during this time that Wil became a father--and only \nmonths before his first semester began, he was granted full custody of \nhis 11-month-old daughter Olivia. To say the least, he was a \nnontraditional student in almost every sense. Matriculating at age 28, \nhe was a decade older than most of his freshmen classmates. He was one \nof just three African-American students in his class. And he was the \nfirst single father in Bowdoin's history to attend the college.\n  He worked tirelessly--carrying Olivia to class and then to basketball \npractice, taking evening shifts at the local Staples store, and \nvolunteering at area high schools. He faced challenges unfathomable to \nmost of his classmates at Bowdoin--struggling to balance a commitment \nto his daughter and his rigorous coursework. But Wil persevered--and he \ndid so with a strength of conviction and determination that would come \nto define the influence he would have on students who would follow in \nhis footsteps at Bowdoin.\n  Following graduation, Wil continued to devote his time and energy to \nhis community, and in particular, to young people of nontraditional or \nunderrepresented backgrounds. He continued to serve in the U.S. Navy \nReserves, and joined the staff of Bowdoin College, serving as director \nof multicultural student programs. Driven to continue his education, he \nthen enrolled in the University of Maine School of Law, where 3 years \nlater, he would graduate with a law degree and once again return to \nBowdoin.\n  At Bowdoin, Wil served as a beacon of light to so many students--many \nof whom, like him, toiled with the challenges of the transition to \ncollege. But as a gifted mentor and as someone who had the rare ability \nto genuinely connect with people, to understand them, and to relate to \nthem, Wil inspired a newfound sense of hope in countless students, and \nhis advice, unfailing support, and encouragement turned around the \nlives of hundreds and perhaps thousands of people.\n  And while students were away from Bowdoin during the summer, Wil \ndedicated his time to the Seeds of Peace International Camp in \nOtisfield, ME. It was an endeavor that he joined in the summer of 1999, \nbefore he graduated from Bowdoin, and it was one he carried on until \nlast summer. At the camp, he mentored children from across the world, \nand challenged them to look at and judge their peers not by their race, \nethnicity, or differences, but by their thoughts and their merit. Wil \nwas truly a team player in this\n\n[[Page S1030]]\n\nwork, serving in numerous positions at Seeds of Peace over the years, \nfrom coach to counselor to associate director. But the title was always \nless important to Wil than knowing he was helping those he worked with \nat the camp. And true to the camp's mission, Wil cultivated seeds of \npeace within the heart of every child he met--his reach and impact \nextending around the world.\n  That same spirit of mentorship drew him to the basketball courts of \nCatherine McAuley High School in South Portland, where he coached the \ngirls' varsity team for a decade, amassing nearly twice as many wins \nthan losses and, in a testament to his talent as a coach, bringing home \na prized state championship in 2007. Through the game he loved, he \ntaught young women about the power and virtue of leadership, character, \nand teamwork--the same traits he worked so hard to instill in students \nat Bowdoin, in young people at Seeds of Peace, or in anyone who came to \nhim in search of help.\n  There is a hole in the heart of our community today. But while Wil's \nloss is felt by countless people, his legacy will be carried on by the \nthousands who were fortunate enough to know him. Indeed, it is that \nlegacy of caring, of hope, and of understanding which he has given to \nus and which we will give to future generations along with his story as \nproof that even the most unlikely of beginnings can yield remarkable \noutcomes. Today, the world is a lesser place for Wil's loss, but we are \nall better for him having been in it.\n  My heart goes out to his daughter Olivia, his partner Maha Jaber, and \nher son, Nim, his family, and to all the people whose lives were \ntouched by this extraordinary man's unfaltering enthusiasm, caring, and \ngenerosity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/23/senate-section/article/S1030-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nRECOGNIZING RUTGERS UNIVERSITY FOR WINNING THE NAFSA 2014 SENATOR PAUL \n           SIMON AWARD FOR COMPREHENSIVE INTERNATIONALIZATION\n\n Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I wish to honor Rutgers \nUniversity for winning the 2014 Senator Paul Simon Award for \nComprehensive Internationalization from NAFSA: The Association of \nInternational Educators. The award is named for the late Senator Paul \nSimon and is among the most prestigious awards for systemwide \ncomprehensive internationalization. The award recognizes Rutgers' \nsignificant strides in providing a global education to its students, \ntackling global challenges through research, and working with diverse \ncommunities at home and abroad.\n  The award honors the university's significant achievements in \nenhancing its global reputation over the course of its nearly 250-year \nhistory. One hundred and fifty years ago, the university first began \nthis process when it welcomed to campus a handful of students from \nJapan. Today, Rutgers hosts nearly 1,500 international undergraduate \nstudents from over 125 countries each year.\n  Through the Rutgers' Centers for Global Advancement and International \nAffairs, GAIA Centers, the university has established hundreds of \nstrong research and education partnerships with key institutions on six \ncontinents. The centers' advising services, cross-cultural social \nevents, and immigration processing have streamlined the arrival and \ncultural adjustment of nearly 7,000 talented international students and \nscholars. The centers have grown service-learning abroad and study \nabroad opportunities from just a couple of programs in the 1960s to \nover 160 semester and year-long courses. The centers also foster unique \nand strong relationships with the United Nations, one of only a handful \nof universities around the globe to do so.\n  Rutgers actively participates in flagship international programs. \nSince January 2012, the university has hosted 73 Brazilian students for \nyear-long, non-degree educational programs under the Brazilian \nScientific Mobility Program. Rutgers was also one of only 20 \nuniversities nationwide selected to host talented young African leaders \nfor a 6-week civic leadership program under President Obama's Mandela \nWashington Fellowship for Young African Leaders.\n  Rutgers students and alumni received 26 Fulbright grants this year, a \nrecord number for the university. The Fulbright U.S. Student Program \nreported that this ties Rutgers for third place among research \nuniversities nationwide.\n  The university's worldwide reception is higher than ever before. In \n2013, the Center for World University Rankings, CWUR, ranked Rutgers \n33rd out of hundreds of international institutions.\n  I congratulate Rutgers University for winning the 2014 Senator Paul \nSimon Award for Comprehensive Internationalization, and I look forward \nto their continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/23/senate-section/article/S1030-2", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE-\n\n  At 3:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 636.

A bill to require the president of the Federal Reserve Bank \nof New York to be appointed by the President, by and with the advice \nand consent of the Senate; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am reintroducing legislation that would \nrequire the head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to be \nappointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.\n  In 2010, I worked to include a provision with similar language in the \nSenate version of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, \nbut it was ultimately not included in the final version of this law.\n  I noted then that, ``if the Governors of the Federal Reserve System \nin Washington are required to be confirmed by the Senate, then the \nPresident of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, who played a pivotal \nand perhaps more powerful role in obligating taxpayer dollars during \nthe financial crisis, should also be subject to the same public \nconfirmation process.''\n  In short, the New York Fed is unlike any of the other 11 regional \nFederal Reserve Banks.\n  For instance, along with the seven Governors of the Federal Reserve \nSystem who each require Senate confirmation, the president of the New \nYork Fed is a permanent member of the Federal Open Market Committee, \nFOMC, and also acts as the FOMC's Vice Chairman. This is a significant \ndistinction because the FOMC establishes the Federal Reserve System's \nmonetary policy, which in the wake of the financial crisis resulted in \nthe Federal Reserve's balance sheet growing to almost five times what \nit was before the crisis in an attempt to reduce long-term interest \nrates.\n  Also, the New York Fed is solely responsible for implementing an \naspect of monetary policy known as open market operations through which \nU.S. Treasury securities are purchased and sold on a secondary basis to \ninfluence the levels of bank reserves. This means that the New York Fed \nis in a position to pick and choose its counterparties in these \nsecondary market transactions, giving considerable advantages to one \nmarket maker over another, which raises the potential for conflicts of \ninterest.\n  In addition, the New York Fed is entrusted with protecting the U.S. \ndollar in foreign exchange markets.\n  According to the New York Fed itself, ``though it serves a \ngeographically small area compared with those of other Federal Reserve \nBanks, the New York Fed is the largest Reserve Bank in terms of assets \nand volume of activity.'' Indeed, the New York Fed in its regulatory \nrole is not only in charge of supervising some of the largest banks in \nthe country, but also some of the most active financial institutions.\n  While this is not a comprehensive list of the New York Fed's special \nand distinctive responsibilities, these examples demonstrate the \npowerful and pivotal role the New York Fed plays in implementing our \nNation's monetary policy and enforcing our banking laws. As such, we \nshould have every expectation that the New York Fed has the public \ninterest in mind to the fullest extent when it conducts its duties.\n  Unfortunately, these expectations have not been met. Last year, the \nOffice of Inspector General, OIG, of the Board of Governors of the \nFederal Reserve System described the New York\n\n[[Page S1033]]\n\nFed's oversight efforts with respect to one large banking institution \nthat eventually suffered billions of dollars in trading losses as a \n``missed opportunity.'' Additionally, a report aired in September of \nlast year on the public radio program ``This American Life'' cast doubt \non whether changes the New York Fed made after the financial collapse \nto address regulatory capture were sufficient to ensure it would be a \nmore proactive banking regulator and could prevent a future financial \ndisaster.\n  All of this is unsettling, and it is past time that we add meaningful \nlayers of accountability so that we can be better assured of the New \nYork Fed's ability to address potential financial pitfalls in advance.\n  By subjecting the president of the New York Fed to the confirmation \nprocess, an important check and balance will be added. The Senate will \nhave an opportunity to evaluate whether a nominee has the experience, \ncharacter, judgment, and skills to serve effectively as one of the most \npowerful banking regulators in the country, if not the world. Also, \nthis legislation requires the New York Fed president to testify before \nthe Senate Banking Committee and the House Financial Services Committee \nat least once a year, so that Congress no longer has to negotiate about \nwhether the New York Fed president will appear before Congress for \noversight hearings.

Res. 83\n\n       Whereas over 7,700,000 student athletes participated in \n     secondary school athletics during the 2012 to 2013 academic \n     year;\n       Whereas it is estimated that in 2012, secondary school \n     student athletes participating in 9 of the most popular high \n     school sports, including football, boys' and girls' soccer, \n     girls' volleyball, boys' and girls' basketball, wrestling, \n     baseball, and softball, suffered over 1,300,000 instances of \n     injury;\n       Whereas every 3 minutes, a child is treated in an emergency \n     department for a sports-related concussion, accounting for \n     more than 8 percent of all sports-related emergency cases;\n       Whereas the number of sports-related concussion injuries \n     has doubled in the last 15 years among student athletes aged \n     8 to 19, despite an overall decrease in the number of \n     students participating in sports;\n       Whereas sudden cardiac arrest (``SCA'') is the leading \n     cause of death for youth participating in sports or \n     exercising, with upwards of 80 percent of those suffering \n     from SCA being asymptomatic prior to cardiac arrest;\n       Whereas instances of heat-related illness have more than \n     doubled since 1997 and affect high school football players at \n     an average rate that is 10 times higher than that of \n     participants in other sports;\n       Whereas approximately 1,500 children aged 12 to 17 were \n     treated in an emergency department for energy drink-related \n     emergencies in 2011;\n       Whereas secondary school student athletes with access to \n     certified athletic health care professionals have lower \n     overall injury rates, lower recurrent injury rates, and lower \n     concussion rates than student athletes without access to \n     certified athletic health care professionals;\n       Whereas in light of the increase in athletic-related \n     injuries to student athletes, schools are encouraged to \n     develop and adopt best practices and standards to prevent and \n     address student athlete injury;\n       Whereas the Secondary School Student Athletes' Bill of \n     Rights sets forth that secondary school student athletes have \n     the right--\n       (1) to be coached by individuals who are well-trained in \n     sport-specific safety and to be monitored by athletic health \n     care team members;\n       (2) to quality, regular pre-participation examinations and \n     each athlete has the right to participate under a \n     comprehensive concussion management plan;\n       (3) to participate in sporting activities on safe, clean \n     playing surfaces, in both indoor and outdoor facilities;\n       (4) to utilize equipment and uniforms that are safe, fitted \n     appropriately, and routinely maintained;\n       (5) to appropriate personnel trained in proper removal of \n     equipment in case of injury;\n       (6) to participate safely in all environmental conditions \n     where play follows approved guidelines and medical policies \n     and procedures, with a hydration plan in place;\n       (7) to a safe playing environment with venue-specific \n     emergency action plans that are coordinated by the athletic \n     health care team and regularly rehearsed with local emergency \n     personnel;\n       (8) to privacy of health information and proper referral \n     for medical, psychosocial, and nutritional counseling;\n       (9) to participate in a culture that finds ``playing \n     through pain'' unacceptable unless there has been a medical \n     assessment;\n       (10) to immediate, on-site injury assessments with \n     decisions made by qualified sports medicine professionals;

which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                               S. Res. 84\n\n       Whereas in 1776, people imagined the United States as a new \n     country dedicated to the proposition stated in the \n     Declaration of Independence that ``all men are created equal, \n     that they are endowed by their Creator with certain \n     unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and \n     the pursuit of Happiness . . .'';\n       Whereas the first Africans were brought involuntarily to \n     the shores of America as early as the 17th century;\n       Whereas African Americans suffered enslavement and \n     subsequently faced the injustices of lynch mobs, segregation, \n     and denial of the basic and fundamental rights of \n     citizenship;\n       Whereas in 2015, the vestiges of these injustices and \n     inequalities remain evident in the society of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas in the face of injustices, people of the United \n     States of good will and of all races have distinguished \n     themselves with a commitment to the noble ideals on which the \n     United States was founded and have courageously fought for \n     the rights and freedom of African Americans;\n       Whereas African Americans, such as Lieutenant Colonel Allen \n     Allensworth, Constance Baker Motley, James Baldwin, James \n     Beckwourth, Simeon Booker, Clara Brown, Ralph Bunche, Shirley \n     Chisholm, Frederick Douglass, W. E. B.

Woodson, the ``Father of Black \n     History'', to enhance knowledge of Black history through the \n     Journal of Negro History, published by the Association for \n     the Study of African American Life and History, which was \n     founded by Dr. Carter G. Woodson and Jesse E. Moorland;\n       Whereas Black History Month, celebrated during the month of \n     February, dates back to 1926 when Dr. Carter G. Woodson set \n     aside a special period in February to recognize the heritage \n     and achievement of Black people of the United States;\n       Whereas Dr. Carter G. Woodson stated: ``We have a wonderful \n     history behind us. . . . If you are unable to demonstrate to \n     the world that you have this record, the world will say to \n     you, `You are not worthy to enjoy the blessings of democracy \n     or anything else.' '';\n       Whereas since the founding of the United States, the \n     country imperfectly progressed towards noble goals; and\n       Whereas the history of the United States is the story of \n     people regularly affirming high ideals, striving to reach \n     such ideals but often failing, and then struggling to come to \n     terms with the disappointment of such failure, before \n     committing to trying again: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) acknowledges that all people of the United States are \n     the recipients of the wealth of history provided by Black \n     culture;\n       (2) recognizes the importance of Black History Month as an \n     opportunity to reflect on the complex history of the United \n     States, while remaining hopeful and confident about the path \n     ahead;\n       (3) acknowledges the significance of Black History Month as \n     an important opportunity to recognize the tremendous \n     contributions of African Americans to the history of the \n     United States;\n       (4) encourages the celebration of Black History Month to \n     provide a continuing opportunity for all people in the United \n     States to learn from the past and understand the experiences \n     that have shaped the United States; and\n       (5) agrees that, while the United States began as a divided \n     nation, the United States must--\n       (A) honor the contribution of all pioneers in the United \n     States who have helped to ensure the legacy of the great \n     United States; and\n       (B) move forward with purpose, united tirelessly as ``one \n     Nation . . . indivisible, with liberty and justice for \n     all.''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/23/senate-section/article/S1034-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 534\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I have come to the floor this evening to \nspeak about the impending shutdown this week of the Federal Department \nof Homeland Security. At a time when the folks I hear from in Delaware, \nand I suspect what all of the Members in this Chamber are hearing, as \nwe return from a week spent in our home States, are concerns about our \nnational security.\n  Whether it is the heinous acts of ISIS abroad, or the real threats of \nthe weather and recent weather-related events here at home, a central \nconcern all of us should share in the Senate here tonight is about \nkeeping our country and our constituents safe. Yet shutting down the \nwhole Department of Homeland Security later this week would show a \nreckless disregard for our national security by the Republican leader \nand some of the hard-line conservatives who are, sadly, setting this \nagenda.\n  In my view, we do not need to be here. The Democrats and Republicans \nworking together on the Appropriations Committee negotiated a strong \nbipartisan Homeland Security funding bill months ago. It is a bill that \nif it got a vote before the full Senate would absolutely pass. It makes \nwide, needed, broad investments in strengthening all sorts of different \norgans of our government at the Federal, State, and local level that \nstrengthen our homeland security.\n  Instead, the other party has insisted on attaching political \nprovisions to the bill that would overturn the President's Executive \naction on immigration. I know I do not need to remind the Presiding \nOfficer or any of our colleagues that we have already debated and \npassed comprehensive immigration reform in this Chamber which, if taken \nup by the House, would have made the President's action completely \nunnecessary.\n  I think we all agree that congressional action is the preferred path \ntoward fixing our broken immigration system. If that is what my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle are really concerned about, \nthen I am eager to discuss how we can fix our badly broken immigration \nsystem in a bipartisan manner by the preferred path of congressional \naction rather than Executive action.\n  But I think we should separate that debate over immigration and what \nis the right path toward a resolution of our broken system from a \ndiscussion about responsibly and sustainably funding our Department of \nHomeland Security. If we fail to fund Homeland\n\n[[Page S1035]]\n\nSecurity, it would have damaging consequences to our economy, to the \nsecurity of our communities, and to our reputation around the world. At \nthis time of heightened concern about our cohesion, about our unity, \nand about our security as a country, failing to fund the Federal \nDepartment of Homeland Security I think sends the worst possible \nmessage to our allies around the world about our capacity as a mature \ndemocracy of reaching responsible resolutions on difficult and divisive \nissues.\n  If the Department of Homeland Security shuts down this week, tens of \nthousands of its staff would be furloughed without pay. They include \nthe FEMA disaster and preparedness staff, the very personnel who check \nthe immigration status of new employees through E-Verify, critical \nsecurity intelligence analysts, and the folks who run the domestic \nnuclear detection offices, just to name a few.\n  The list of these tens of thousands of Homeland Security employees \nand the vital functions they perform would take longer than the evening \ncould take.\n  My own State of Delaware has the lowest mean elevation in the \ncountry. That means we are a really low-lying State. We are incredibly \nvulnerable to storms and to flooding, and we simply can't afford to \nhave FEMA's staff suspended, furloughed, laid off.\n\n  Whether we shut down or just have a short-term funding bill, funding \nfor Homeland Security grants can't go out. Some of the folks who watch \nthis debate in the week ahead will have difficulty discerning between \nfolks on my side who will advocate for a so-called clean bill and \nothers who will advocate for a CR. This is where the difference really \nis: in the areas of grants for State and local emergency preparedness--\nthe difference between actually moving forward the bipartisan bill that \nwas worked through the Appropriations Committee in the last Congress \nand simply continuing by continuing resolution the previous year's \nauthorization. That difference is $1.5 billion for State and local \nemergency management all over this country.\n  In my community, which is part of the Greater Philadelphia area, we \nare about to welcome the Pope. Something like 2 million people are \nexpected in the Greater Philadelphia area as we welcome His Holiness to \nPhiladelphia for the first time in a long time.\n  I have heard from State and local law enforcement, first responders, \nemergency managers, and planners that they are counting on some of the \ngrants from FEMA that are currently on hold, while they wait to \ndiscover the outcome of this week's debates, to prepare for that \nimportant, very large event. In my own home community, there are \nvolunteer fire companies which even now are working on submitting \ngrants. The SAFER Act and the fire grants act have become an important \npart of making sure that our local volunteer fire companies have the \nequipment they need, the training they need to keep our communities \nsafe.\n  In Delaware the overwhelming majority of the crash response, the fire \neducation, and the fire suppression are done by volunteer fire \ncompanies, which often have badly outdated equipment and insufficient \nfunding. To sustain their training and their personnel, they need the \ngrants that have been made available through FEMA and through the \nDepartment of Homeland Security over the last decade to upgrade and \nupdate their equipment, their materials, and their training. They have \nbeen vitally important. They have made a big difference in the fire \nservice in my home State. There are grants to police departments that \nhelp ensure they have the tools, the training, and the equipment to be \npart of emergency preparedness and to keep our communities safe.\n  If we shut down the Department of Homeland Security, 130,000 other \nDHS workers will be compelled to remain at work but without pay. I \nthink the idea that there are Americans who work to keep us safe at the \nborder, at our airports, on our coasts and that we don't value them \nenough to ensure they will receive their pay for a hard day's work just \ngoes against the grain of what we stand for as a country.\n  So are my colleagues really willing to send a message to everyone at \nHomeland Security that their work isn't important enough to our Nation \nto ensure that they can provide for their family? That is the message \nif the Department of Homeland Security shuts down. It hurts families, \nit hurts morale, it hurts our preparedness, and it hurts our safety.\n  I wish to say, as someone who is privileged to serve on the Foreign \nRelations Committee and regularly gets the chance to meet with and talk \nwith leaders from around the world, it sends the message that our \ndemocracy isn't up to the task.\n  I know this isn't what my Republican friends want to do, and I urge \nus to come together and work in a way that will end this era of \npolitics by crisis once and for all--no more shutdowns, no more \nmanufactured crises, and no more demonstrating that we are better at \nstopping progress than at enacting progress.\n  Democrats are ready to work together with Republicans to pass a \nbipartisan, bicameral bill that we all know we can pass and that will \nfund the Department of Homeland Security and keep our country safe. I \nhope that after we--this afternoon--voted down for the fourth time a \nbill that seeks to repeal the President's actions on immigration, we \ncan put aside that partisan issue and come together to find a \nbipartisan solution to fund the Department of Homeland Security.\n  We already know what that solution looks like. We just need to come \ntogether and give it a vote. In my view, this is too important to \ntrivialize as part of the ongoing posturing and partisan games that for \nso long have dominated this Chamber.\n  I urge my colleagues to work with us. Fund Homeland Security and then \nlet's talk meaningfully in this Congress about how we can fix our \nbroken immigration system together.\n  I know we are all eager to continue that conversation. First, we need \nto solve this challenge and make sure that our communities, our States, \nand our country are safe.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise tonight to urge Congress to quit \nplaying political games with our national security. It is time to have \na clean Homeland Security funding bill on the floor of the Senate to be \ndebated.\n  We are only days away from a potential shutdown of the Homeland \nSecurity Department, and it is very clear that the reason is that \nMembers of the House on Capitol Hill have decided they want to make a \nclear statement about certain policy statements. They want to have a \npolicy rider that says young children who came to this country and know \nno other country need to be prioritized for deportation. Why? Well, I \nthink that is just wrong.\n  But if Members of this body want to put that into a bill and want to \nput that on the floor of the House and want to put it on the floor of \nthe Senate, I am quite ready to have that debate.\n  Yet another policy rider says that the President must no longer \nprioritize the deportation of those with criminal backgrounds. Now, I \nhappen to think we should prioritize deportation of any individuals who \nhave conducted criminal acts. If some of my colleagues want to have \nthat policy debate, I am fine with that. Put it in a bill, bring it to \nthe floor of the Senate, and let us have that debate. A vote will then \nbe very clearly on that specific policy and people can have some \naccountability. The American people will have some transparency about \nwhat is being voted on. But do not put these policy riders into the \nmiddle of the funding bill and work to shut down Homeland Security. \nThat is no way to run a country.\n\n  We live in a dangerous world. We lack for many things, but one thing \nwe don't lack is security threats. It was less than 2 years ago that \nterrorists attacked us at the Boston Marathon. It was just weeks ago \nthat we saw a horrific series of terrorist attacks on our friends in \nParis. ISIL is a fierce and growing threat determined to wreak havoc. \nIt is exactly at a time such as this that we should be working together \non a bipartisan basis to fund and strengthen Homeland Security, not \nplaying political games with the Nation's security, but here we are.\n\n[[Page S1036]]\n\n  Is it more important, I ask my colleagues, to have a debate about \ndeporting DREAMers than it is to protect Americans against terrorist \nthreats? If someone feels it is more important, not only do I feel they \nare wrong, but I invite them to have that debate. Put that into a \nseparate policy bill and have the courage to put it on the floor of the \nSenate as a separate policy bill. Do not compromise our national \nsecurity by trying to shut down Homeland Security.\n  This is a misguided strategy, and the resulting fallout isn't just to \nnational security. There are FEMA grants to disaster-stricken areas \nthat will be stopped, local fire departments will be hampered, and \nthousands of essential public servants from Homeland Security to FEMA, \nto our terrific men and women in the Coast Guard will be forced to work \nwithout pay.\n  Just last week I visited a Coast Guard installation in Newport, OR. \nIt is an installation that has advanced rescue helicopters. They have \nfive helicopters that work in rotation to make sure one is in the \nNewport area and a second ready to back it up if it has troubles.\n  This is a port that has so much sea traffic. It is a deepwater port. \nIt has commercial fishing, it has sports fishing, it has tourists who \nplay on the rocks of the beach and get trapped by the tide, and it has \nrecreational swimmers who get swept out by riptides. There is every \nkind of possible ocean-front disaster one could look for and so that \nrescue helicopter is very important.\n  One of the young men I was speaking to is a rescue swimmer, an \nextraordinary individual who does some of the scariest, most courageous \nwork in the world. These folks are not paid very much. They have bills \nto meet, similar to all the rest of us. Is this any way to run a \ncountry, to say you have to keep coming to work, but we are not going \nto send you a paycheck? To say to the thousands and thousands of young \nAmericans who are working for our country in national security, ``you \nare so important that you have to come to work whether or not we pay \nyou,'' is just wrong--wrong that we should be so disorganized, so \npartisan as to compromise our national security.\n  Our folks who work in national security will be asked to continue \nworking. They work in dangerous conditions that many of us could hardly \nimagine. They make sure our safety is improved. At a minimum, can't we \njust have a debate on the funding bill without these political games? \nThey do their work and they feel a sense of duty. Let's have a sense of \nduty in doing our work. Let's put the Homeland Security appropriations \nbill on this floor and let's do so without partisan political riders. \nThat game does no honor to our Nation nor to this institution. The \npublic's opinion of this Chamber has fallen due to exactly these types \nof games. So let's end them.\n  There is bipartisan support for ending these types of political \ntheatrics. One of my colleagues from Arizona said, ``To attempt to use \na spending bill in order to poke a finger in the President's eye is not \na good move in my view.''\n  My colleague from Illinois, who serves across the aisle in this \nChamber, said:\n\n       The American people are pretty alarmed, as they should be, \n     about security . . . the way to go forward is just fund the \n     DHS. We ought to strip the bill of extraneous issues and make \n     it about homeland security.\n\n  That is a sentiment I think virtually every citizen feels at this \nmoment. Let's make it about homeland security. Let's make it about us \nhaving the honor to do our duty. Our job on this floor is to consider \nthis appropriations bill and not to load it down with favorite policy \nriders and political theatrics.\n  Every day that goes by puts us closer to this shutdown. There is no \nlogic in careening from crisis to crisis, but some crises come about \ndue to uncontrollable factors. This one is entirely under our control. \nThis one is entirely under the control of the leadership of the House \nand the leadership of the Senate.\n  Earlier this evening I was on a phone call with many folks back home \nwho serve in police departments and fire departments, in rural \ndepartments, rural emergency departments, and they were relaying the \ndifferent types of grants they get that are so important to their \ncommunities. Some of them are search and rescue, some of them are \ndisaster preparation, some are grants to fund the fire departments, and \nsome for funding personnel. Nobody on the phone could understand why \nthis Chamber is afraid to have a simple budget debate and an \nappropriations debate, a spending debate. They see no reason to load it \ndown with politics that can be debated in separate policy bills.\n  So I say to the leadership of this Chamber: Let's get our act \ntogether. Put policy into policy bills and let's put the spending bill \nbefore this body in a clean fashion and proceed to protect our Nation's \nsecurity, as we are charged to do.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/23/senate-section/article/S1036-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
