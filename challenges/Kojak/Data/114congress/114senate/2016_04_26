Mr. President, when the new majority resolved to get \nthe Senate back to work, we knew we would have to get committees \nfunctioning first. We believed that would be critical to helping \nMembers on both sides rediscover their voices and find common ground \nand then develop real stakes in the outcome. That certainly is what we \nhave seen this appropriations season.\n  The Appropriations Committee has already held dozens of hearings. It \nhas marked up funding bills at a steady clip. It is sending good \nlegislation to the floor.\n  One of those bills is the energy security and water infrastructure \nappropriations measure which is before us now. This legislation is \nimportant for American energy, for American waterways and ports, and \nfor American commerce and safety. It will also maintain our nuclear \ndeterrence posture by ensuring nuclear stockpile readiness, which is \nimportant for national security.\n  I would like to recognize the bill managers for their diligent work \nto bring this legislation to the floor for consideration. I would also \nlike to recognize the leadership of the Appropriations Committee for \nits work in getting this process moving. By returning to regular order, \nwe have opened up the process and empowered Senators--both those who \nsit on the Appropriations Committee and those who do not--to have more \nof a say in the appropriations legislation. That is important because \nthese funding bills can affect each of our States.\n  The progress we have seen already is encouraging. It shows what is \npossible when the Senate gets back to a productive legislative process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/senate-section/article/S2425-6", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2425]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I appreciate the good work, the exemplary \nwork done on the Energy and Water appropriations bill by Senators \nFeinstein and Alexander. I managed that legislation for many years. \nMost of the time, it was with Pete Domenici from New Mexico. I was the \nchair most of the time but not all of the time. But it didn't matter--\nour job was to move the bill forward.\n  What people don't realize about this most important bill is that most \nof the funding is not for energy and water as we look at it, it is \ndefense related--making sure our nuclear weapons are safe and reliable \nand things of that nature, making sure our National Labs are funded. So \nI appreciate their good work. It has been very good. I appreciate it.\n  Last night the Republican leader filed cloture. Cloture was filed not \nbecause of any problems on our side. We should finish the work on the \nbill tomorrow or maybe Thursday. But I am glad we are going to get it \ndone. It is an extremely important piece of legislation. I am glad we \nstarted here. I am glad to hear my friend the Republican leader talk \nabout the appropriations process moving forward. But we have to \nunderstand that we have a lot more bills to go. This is only one--one \nout of many, one out of a dozen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/senate-section/article/S2425-8", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2425-S2426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               ZIKA VIRUS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to be clear about something else, \nsomething that is vitally important, something that is imperative. The \nSenate must do something now to address the outbreak of the Zika virus. \nWe are not going to interfere with the Energy and Water appropriations \nbill, but we must do something to confront this scourge that is facing \nour country and the western part of the world.\n\n[[Page S2426]]\n\n  Anyone who has followed the news over the past few months has \nundoubtedly heard about the spread of Zika. Zika is a virus spread by \nmosquitos in warmer tropical areas. We have warmer areas in the United \nStates--not tropical but warm--and they breed mosquitos. Zika has been \nlinked to many health problems, but most notable is a terrible birth \ndefect called microencephaly. We have all seen pictures of these babies \nwith these small heads, caused by a mosquito bite.\n  Dr. Anthony Fauci from the National Institutes of Health--he is the \nleader of the institute dealing with infectious disease--came to the \nCapitol last Thursday. He briefed us about this thing called Zika. He \ndescribed how dangerous it is. He was accompanied by people from the \nCenters for Disease Control. He is, of course, representing the \nNational Institutes of Health. We also had the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services. They were here to tell us how serious the situation is, \nhow dangerous it is.\n  There are a number of problems as a result of this virus, but the one \nthat has been most illustrated is the fact that in infants the skull \ndoes not fully form. So the skull never completely pushes out to form \naround the brain. So when they are born, these babies have tiny, \nundeveloped skulls. Sometimes the skulls collapse.\n  Aside from the damaged brains and skulls, these babies also have, of \ncourse, developmental delays. Earlier this year a baby in Hawaii was \nborn with this disease, but, sadly, the worst is on its way.\n  We have seen cases of this virus all over the continental United \nStates. These have been linked to travel or transmitted from someone \nwho has traveled to Zika-affected areas. Most Americans are afraid to \ntravel abroad--and, I am sorry to say, rightfully so--for fear of \nmosquitos carrying Zika, that Zika will infect them. But Zika is \nalready upon us in Puerto Rico and in Florida, and it is going to \nspread to other places. These mosquitos can breed in something smaller \nthan a bottle cap of water.\n  Puerto Rico is battling the local transmission of the virus as we \nspeak. As of last Friday, the island already had more than 500 \nconfirmed cases of Zika, and they are concerned that 1 in 5 Puerto \nRicans could have been infected.\n  Our fellow American citizens in Puerto Rico have limited funding to \nfight this growing epidemic. We have heard about the financial problems \nthey are having. The Puerto Rican government doesn't even have enough \nmoney to pay contractors to empty the septic tanks in schools, which \nare breeding grounds for mosquito larvae, capable of producing billions \nof mosquitos--not millions but billions.\n  Experts tell us it won't be long before the mosquitos carrying Zika \nare infecting people here in the continental United States. We can't \nwait for that before we act. This is an emergency situation, if \nanything ever were. The Senate must do something now to counter the \nspread of this virus. The White House has taken money--they asked for \nmoney 2 months ago, but during that period of time, they took money \nfrom Ebola funding, which is also vitally important. We are doing \npretty well stopping the spread of that. But taking that money away, we \nare going to be right back with the problem with Ebola if it is not \nreplaced.\n  We have a bill ready to go. Senator Nelson of Florida, who is going \nto feel this as much as any Senator in the country, has provided a bill \nto give the President the money he has asked for: $1.9 billion in \nemergency supplemental appropriations. Democrats believe this $1.9 \nbillion is a good start. Our Nation's public health and infectious \ndisease experts say this is roughly how much money they need to fight \nthis virus. We would be irresponsible not to provide this money and do \nit now. Senator Nelson's bill will bolster our defense against Zika by \nfunding the development of vaccines, mosquito control methods, and \ntesting and services to those who are infected.\n  So I say to my Republican colleagues, I say to the Republican leader: \nDo we want to wait until more babies are born with these permanent \ndisabilities--disabilities caused by a virus that the vaccine could \nhelp prevent, if not for all children, then for many? Do we want to \nwait until people in the United States start to suffer from paralysis \ncaused by Guillain-Barre syndrome, which is also linked to Zika? It has \nalready been more than 2 months since the President requested this \nemergency funding. The longer we wait, the worse it will be.\n  States are already scrambling to address Zika. A story in the \nWashington Post highlighted the danger of inaction. I quote:\n\n       Cities and states preparing for possible Zika outbreaks \n     this spring and summer are losing millions of federal dollars \n     that local officials say they were counting on, not only for \n     on-the-ground efforts to track and contain the spread of the \n     mosquito-borne virus but also to respond to other emergencies \n     that threaten public health.\n       Los Angeles County, for example, says it won't be able to \n     fill 17 vacancies at its public health laboratory or buy \n     equipment to upgrade its capability for Zika testing. \n     Michigan is concerned about providing resources to help Flint \n     contend with its ongoing water-contamination crisis. \n     Minnesota plans to reduce its stockpile of certain \n     medications needed to treat first responders during \n     emergencies.\n       The across-the-board funding cuts are part of a complicated \n     shift of resources that the Obama administration blames on \n     Congress for its refusal to approve the White House's $1.9 \n     billion emergency request to combat Zika.\n\n  The President is right. He is pointing the finger where it belongs--\nright here at Congress.\n  So I implore my Republican colleagues, I implore my friend the \nRepublican leader: Let's act now. We have done the work. We have a bill \nto provide what experts need to fight this devastating virus. Let's get \nit done.\n  For more than a week, we have heard about Republicans and the \nappropriations folks working toward an agreement. I have yet to see it. \nI have heard about it. If the Republican leader and Appropriations have \nan alternative, they should bring it to the floor now. Democrats are \nhappy to work toward a solution, but we have to get started. We need to \nget the experts the resources they need to prevent the spread of Zika. \nIt is not acceptable to do nothing. The Senate should not leave this \nweek without addressing legislation that fights Zika. We cannot go on \nbreak without taking care of this emergency. When the Senate finishes \nthe work on Energy and Water, we must move to the Zika legislation. The \nNational Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control, the \nentire Health and Human Services Cabinet office--they need Congress to \nsend them the funding necessary to start working on a solution to Zika.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/senate-section/article/S2426-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2426-S2427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               ADDRESSING DROUGHT CONDITIONS IN THE WEST\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Benjamin Franklin said: ``When the well is \ndry, we know the worth of water.''\n  The drought is here. It has been going on for 15 to 20 years in the \nwestern part of the United States. All over the West, we are perilously \nclose to running dry. The water situation is as dangerous as it has \nbeen in our lifetime.\n  The States of California, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, Utah, and \nWyoming don't have these huge rivers like we see west of the \nMississippi. We have, basically, the little Colorado River. It is a \ntiny little river. In the past, it has become mighty, but for very \nshort periods of time. That little river is called upon to respond to \neverything.\n  One of the things that is happening is that Lake Powell, the largest \nmanmade lake in America, is going dry. There is no end in sight. This \ndrought has dropped Lake Mead, which is the resource for water that \ngoes everyplace in the West. Most of the water in California they get \nout of the Colorado. It all comes out of Lake Mead.\n  Lake Mead levels have dropped to levels not seen since the Great \nDepression. That is, of course, when the lake was born. It hasn't been \nfull in over three decades. To make matters worse, El Nino is supposed \nto ease the pain, but it hasn't--only a little bit more.\n  Some say up to 50 million people rely on the Colorado River. We know \nthe State of California, with almost 40 million people, depends on it \nas much as any other source of water. We have to work to reverse \ncurrent trends or face a future where water shortages become the new \nnormal. The Federal Government can and should work with States on \nsolutions that make our precious water supplies more sustainable. We\n\n[[Page S2427]]\n\nneed to work together, as the States of California, Arizona, Nevada, \nUtah, and even Wyoming, which is a long way away, have worked to solve \nthe issues.\n  Today the Senate continues deliberation on the Energy and Water bill. \nLater this morning we will consider three amendments. One is a Reid-\nHeller amendment, which seeks to address drought conditions throughout \nthe West. Our amendment would build on that spirit of collaboration by \ntrying to address the fact that we need to stretch every drop of water \nas far as it will go.\n  This legislation isn't for any one city or region. It will help every \nState that relies upon the water in the Colorado River system: Arizona, \nCalifornia, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming.\n  I hope this amendment will be adopted. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  Mr. President, will the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/senate-section/article/S2427-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               Zika Virus\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, by now we have all seen reports of the \nneurological damage that is done by the Zika virus. We have seen the \ndamage it can do to newborn infants. It has been clinically linked to \nserious birth defects in pregnant women who contract it.\n  Since the start of the outbreak, nearly 900 Americans in 41 States, \nWashington, DC, and 3 U.S. territories--including over 80 pregnant \nwomen--have already contracted Zika. In my State of Illinois, 13 people \nhave already tested positive, including at least two pregnant women.\n  But because we have the best scientists and researchers in the world \nat the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we know more today \nabout the virus and prevention measures than we did when most of us \nfirst heard the word ``Zika'' a few months ago.\n  We know that mosquitoes spread the disease. We know that the arrival \nof warm weather signals the start of mosquito season, but America is \ncurrently unprepared to deal with an outbreak of this dangerous virus. \nWe must improve vector control. We must expand access to family \nplanning, education, and contraception. We must accelerate efforts to \ndevelop a vaccine as quickly as humanly possible.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention desperately needs \nfunding to deal with this crisis, and they need it now before the \nsummer months, when mosquitoes spread north across the United States.\n  Congress has failed to even consider President Obama's emergency Zika \nfunding request. What on Earth is Congress waiting for?\n  Last week Senate Democrats sent a letter to Senate Republican \nleadership calling for immediate action to pass the Zika supplemental \nrequest. I hope this call for action will be heard by all of my \nRepublican colleagues, but I especially hope that it resonates with my \ncolleagues from the Southern States. These are the States that are the \nmost likely to be hit first and hardest by the Zika mosquito virus: \nFlorida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, and the list \ngoes on.\n  In the absence of congressional action--immediate congressional \naction--the administration has been forced to divert funding and \nresources away from other important public health efforts in order to \nrespond to Zika.\n  This morning's Washington Post headline in a few words tells the \nstory: ``Zika crisis costs states funds for emergency preparedness.'' \nWhat does that mean? The President asked for this supplemental request \nweeks ago. The refusal of the Republican-led Congress to respond to the \nPresident's request for emergency public health funds to fight Zika \nmeans that we are cutting back on public health preparedness in States \nall across the Nation. Frankly, we are endangering people whom we \nrepresent because the Republican majority in Congress refuses to give \nthe President his supplemental request to deal with the Zika virus. For \ninstance, the administration just had to divert $2 million in public \nhealth emergency preparedness grants away from Illinois in order to \nfight Zika in Southern States.\n  Well, let me tell you, I want to help people everywhere, including \nthose in Southern States who are likely to be hit first, but not at the \nexpense of the public health of the people I represent.\n  There is an answer. President Obama suggests it--an emergency public \nhealth supplemental for the Zika virus.\n  The Republican majority in Congress has refused to act. Both the \nIllinois Department of Public Health and the Chicago Department of \nPublic Health received grants to prepare for and to respond to all \nkinds of public outbreaks, such as Ebola, Zika, and Elizabethkingia, \nwhich I will talk about in a moment. These cuts, which are being \nproposed in order to have the administration have enough resources to \nrespond, are unacceptable and unexplainable.\n  They come at a time when Illinois, my State, is in the middle of the \nlongest budget crisis in our State's history. This current Governor has \nbeen unable to reach an agreement on a budget for almost 11 months, \nmaking it difficult for Illinois families and State agencies in \nordinary circumstances.\n  But because congressional Republican leaders have failed to pass a \nZika emergency public health supplemental requested by President Obama, \nthe administration has had to divert money away from States such as \nIllinois to respond to the threat of the Zika virus in other States. Is \nthis any way to govern a great Nation?\n  Illinois should not have to lose precious funding to deal with public \nhealth threats because Republican congressional leaders--from Southern \nstates, I might add--have refused to pass the necessary additional \nfunding to deal with Zika, a virus that will likely impact their States \nfirst and hardest.\n  We have to do both. We should pass the Zika supplemental so Illinois \nand other States can keep the funding they need to deal with current \npublic health threats and receive additional funding to deal with Zika.\n  Let me talk about why diverting $2 million from my State of Illinois \nto Southern States for Zika is a challenge.\n  Last week the Illinois Department of Public Health and the Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention confirmed 10 cases of a bacterial \ninfection known as Elizabethkingia. It has resulted in six deaths in my \nState. This bacterial outbreak is separate from an outbreak in \nWisconsin that resulted in over 60 cases of this infection. So in the \nmiddle of this outbreak, Illinois is losing 8 percent in core funding \nfor public health contingencies because of the failure of Republican \nleaders in Congress to pass President Obama's emergency public health \nsupplemental appropriation.\n\n[[Page S2428]]\n\n  This means that the Illinois State Department of health is not going \nto be as prepared as it should be to conduct the needed epidemiology, \nlaboratory testing, and outbreak control. And four of our health \nexperts say there will be major cuts that hurt our ability to respond \nto public health crises. What happens tomorrow if there is another \noutbreak?\n\n  Last year our State dealt with unexpected serious outbreaks of \nLegionnaires' disease. Taking money from one State's public health \ndefense effort to give it to another to deal with a public health \nthreat makes no sense in a great nation, particularly when the \nPresident showed the appropriate leadership in asking for the $1.9 \nbillion emergency supplemental to deal with the Zika crisis, and the \nPresident asked over 2 months ago.\n  I know many Republicans are in denial when it comes to climate \nchange, but if they would have been in Springfield, IL, my home, last \nSunday--just 2 days ago--sitting out on the deck in 80-degree weather \nin April, they might understand warm weather is coming sooner across \nthe United States and with that warm weather, mosquitoes, and with \nthose mosquitoes, the threat of the Zika virus.\n  I don't come to raise an alarm that is unmerited and unwarranted. I \nbelieve this is a serious public health challenge, so serious we should \nnot leave Congress this week and take a recess without passing the \nPresident's emergency budget supplemental for public health and the \nZika virus. The mosquitoes are not going to be on recess next week, \nthey are going to be working, and sadly they are going to be infecting \npeople across the South and across the United States while \ncongressional leaders dither.\n  The supplemental request would provide more than $1.8 billion in \nemergency funding to improve CDC vector control to control the \nmosquitoes that threaten us. It would accelerate efforts at the \nNational Institutes of Health to develop a vaccine. I have heard \ntestimony, so I know it takes time to develop a vaccine. Let's do it in \nan expeditious, safe, thoughtful, and professional way, but let us not \nshortchange NIH or any other agency that is facing this crisis.\n  We need to expand education. We need to expand access to women's \nhealth planning services. The administration provided a comprehensive \nplan. It cannot be implemented successfully without resources, and we \nshould act on it this week--get it done before we leave.\n  I joined my colleagues Senator Nelson, Leader Reid, Senator Schumer, \nand Senator Hirono in introducing a bill to fully fund the \nadministration's request. I am pleased to hear my Republican colleagues \non the Committee on Appropriations are interested in working with \nDemocrats to reach a deal. I see Senator Alexander on the floor. I know \nhe is sensitive to this, and I hope he will join in calling for \nleadership on both sides of the Rotunda to move on this issue before we \ntake our recess.\n  Let us not delay this any longer. We need to ensure we aren't \ndiverting necessary Ebola money to be used for the Zika virus. It is \nnaive to believe the Ebola threat is gone and we can ignore the \npossibility of its reemergence. In my State and others, we know all too \nwell what happens when you divert money from one public health fund to \nanother.\n  This brings to mind the Biblical story of Noah and the great flood. \nNoah built the arc before the rain, not after it started. It is \nreckless, it is dangerous to delay. The cases of Zika are continuing to \ngrow, and inaction and further delay put many families, pregnant women, \nand children in jeopardy.\n  We have seen the Zika threat coming for many months. We have had the \nPresident's request for over 2 months. I urge my colleagues this week, \nbefore we go home, to take this appropriate action to begin to protect \nAmericans in every State.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, at 11 a.m. we will have three votes on \nthe Merkley, Flake, and Reid amendments. That will bring to a total of \n17 the number of amendments we will have disposed of on the floor.\n  Senator Feinstein and I have worked with Members on both sides of the \naisle to include many of their policy suggestions and requests in our \nbasic bill. The last count I saw said 77 Members of the Senate had at \nleast part of their requests or policy suggestions in our basic bill. \nSo we are doing very well. Cloture has been filed. There are only a few \namendments remaining that are in question. We hope to conclude that \nquickly and bring the bill to a conclusion.\n  My hope is that when a Senator has a germane amendment, we can have a \nvote. Sometimes, if they are controversial, they will be at 60. We have \ndone pretty well with that so far--giving Senators a chance to have a \nsay and to have a vote.\n  I would like to spend about 4 or 5 minutes on an amendment we will be \nvoting on at 11, when we will have limited time to talk--unless Senator \nFeinstein has something she would like to say before I do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, as I understand it, the filing deadline for first-\ndegree amendments is this afternoon at either 1:30 p.m. or 2:30 p.m. So \neverybody should get their amendments in.\n  I thank Senator Alexander again for the cooperative spirit with which \nhe is working on this bill. It is very much appreciated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I want to speak to the amendment from \nthe Senator from Oregon, which would increase the funding for the wind \nenergy program by $15.4 million. This is in addition to the $30 million \nthat our subcommittee has recommended at the request of Senator Gardner \nof Colorado for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the $50 \nmillion Senator Collins of Maine has recommended for offshore wind \nresearch. Within the priorities in the bill, we have already put $80 \nmillion, and this would add $15 million more.\n  That may not seem like much, but here is my question: I wonder if the \nAmerican taxpayers wouldn't think that $23 billion is enough to spend \non giant windmills--$23 billion. That is the amount the Congressional \nResearch Service has said Congress has spent of taxpayer money to \nsubsidize wealthy people so they can build giant wind turbines across \nAmerica. That money has been spent from 1992 through 2016 this year. It \nstarted out as an effort to help wind turbines get started in 1992, and \nit has been renewed 10 times. You would think this is a mature \nindustry. In fact, the previous Energy Secretary said it was.\n  What do we get for this $23 billion? Four percent of our electricity \nis produced by wind turbines in the United States. This is a country \nthat uses 25 percent of all the electricity in the world, and we spend \n$23 billion for 4 percent of our electricity. Thirty-seven percent of \nall the subsidies, all the spending we have for different forms of \nenergy produces 4 percent of the electricity.\n  The President of the United States and a number of private people in \nthe United States, such as Bill Gates, have announced they would like \nto double energy research. I support that. The Senator from Illinois, \nMr. Durbin, and I introduced legislation that would authorize increased \nfunding at the level of 7 percent for energy research this year so we \ncan move more rapidly toward the goal of doubling research for energy.\n  We spend $5 billion a year for energy research for the U.S. \nGovernment. We spend nearly $5 billion a year on subsidizing wealthy \npeople so they can build giant wind turbines. We spend as much \nsubsidizing windmills as we spend on all our energy research. If we \nstop the subsidies, we could double the research, which is what we \nshould be doing.\n  What are we getting for this? We are getting energy--electricity--\nthat is true, but it mostly blows at night, when we don't need it. It \ncan't be stored for use when we do need it. So it is unreliable. The \nwind only blows about one-third of the time. In Tennessee it is 18 \npercent of the time. It can't be stored and we don't need it. We don't \nneed it. At the same time, it destroys the landscape.\n  I am astonished at the environmental groups that would support \nputting\n\n[[Page S2429]]\n\nthese huge giant turbines in the most beautiful part of our country and \nthen building transmission lines across the country through everybody's \nbackyard.\n  If we replace the 100 nuclear reactors in this country that produce \n60 percent of the carbon-free electricity we have--60 percent of the \ncarbon-free electricity--it would take enough windmills to cover a \nState the size of West Virginia, and I think you would have to have \nabout 17,000 miles, 19,000 miles of new transmission lines.\n  The Presiding Officer is the Senator from Arkansas. In Arkansas, a \nwindmill company is building 700 miles of transmission lines across \nArkansas that the State doesn't want and has objected to. Yet the \nadministration is allowing the wind mill company to use Federal \npreemption for the first time to build transmission lines where people \ndon't want them.\n  Not only is this a wasteful amount of money, not only is it a kind of \nenergy that a country this big cannot rely on, the size of the \nsubsidies create preposterous results. For example, in some cases the \nsubsidy is so large the windmill-producing companies pay the utilities \nto take their power and they still make a profit. They can pay the \nutilities to take their power and still make a profit because the \ntaxpayers have spent $23 billion subsidizing wealthy people so they can \nbuild windmills.\n  These aren't your grandma's windmills. You can see them for 20 miles \naway--the flashing lights. They are twice as tall as the football \nstadium at the University of Tennessee, and only one of these would fit \nwithin the football stadium at the University of Tennessee.\n  It would take four nuclear reactors, each taking about 1 square mile, \nto produce enough electricity to equal the same amount of electricity \nproduced by wind if you strung 45-foot windmill towers along the entire \n2,178-mile stretch of the Appalachian Trail. You may say that is a \nstretch, that will not happen, except that is exactly where the wind \ntowers would be most likely to go--on our scenic mountain tops where \nmore wind blows, and then the transmission lines come down the mountain \ntops through your backyard.\n  My objection is a very simple one. I think $23 billion is enough to \nspend on windmills. I have other objections to wind. I think we should \nfocus on nuclear power instead of unreliable wind power. I believe \ntrying to use wind turbines to power a country that uses 25 percent of \nall the electricity in the world is the energy equivalent of going to \nwar in sailboats when the nuclear navy is available, but I certainly \nthink there is no need at all for Senators to say yes to an amendment \nthat spends more money for wind than our subcommittee recommended. We \nare already spending $23 billion. The taxpayers have been bamboozled \ninto allowing that to happen, and I don't think they would want us to \nspend more.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of Flake \namendment No. 3820, which would lower the construction appropriation \nfor the U.S. Corps of Engineers by just under $69 million and eliminate \nfunding for environmental infrastructure projects.\n  Ostensibly, the Corps of Engineers uses these funds to build water \nsupply, water treatment, and wastewater projects. I am not here to \nargue against the need for environmental infrastructure projects. There \nare a great many municipalities that consider these projects essential \nand have made an effort to fund them on their own. That is usually done \nthrough a combination of utility bills and municipal bonds. Typically, \nthe users pay for this.\n  However, despite the fact that these projects have traditionally been \nfunded by State and local governments, Federal support is actually \nduplicative. The Federal Government already offers resources for \nsimilar projects through the EPA. Specifically, the Clean Water State \nRevolving Fund and the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund programs \nprovide States with low-interest loans based on the merits of these \nprojects and the needs of the communities.\n  Taxpayers deserve better than to be expected to provide the U.S. \nCorps of Engineers $69 million it never asked for to fund projects they \nalready support in a program that has been described by many as a slush \nfund for parochial interests. That is certainly how the program started \nyears ago. Frankly, it has never seemed clear that the Corps of \nEngineers understands how these projects fit into its mission. Because \nof a years-old congressional carve-out, these environmental \nundertakings are not subject to the environmental studies, economic \nanalyses, and cost-effectiveness standards that are required for more \ntraditional Corps projects. As far as I can tell, there is really no \nrhyme or reason as to how one project gets funding over another.\n\n  With a national debt of over $19 trillion, it is time that we get a \nlittle more serious about putting our fiscal house in order. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment and eliminate this duplicative \nfunding.\n  Mr. President, I wish to say a couple words about Reid-Heller \namendment No. 3805.\n  I support the Colorado River System Conservation Program. Voluntary \nefforts like these in Arizona are estimated to have kept Lake Mead at \nabout 3 feet higher than it would have been otherwise. Not \ncoincidentally, last week the Bureau of Reclamation announced that at \nthe end of this year, Lake Mead is predicted to be 3 feet above the \nlevel that would trigger a shortage declaration. What I want to make \nsure happens is that any conserved water actually stays in Lake Mead \nand keeps these levels up above the shortage declaration area.\n  I note that this amendment simply authorizes funds to go to the \nconservation program. I hope that before this money is actually spent, \nwe can develop assurances that the water will go to its intended \npurpose. The Lower Colorado River Basin States have developed such \nlanguage, and I look forward to ensuring that our Federal dollars are \nwell spent in this area.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3820 to Amendment No. 3801\n\n  Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 3820 and ask unanimous \nconsent that it be reported by number.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report the \namendment by number.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Flake] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3820 to amendment No. 3801.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n      (Purpose: To withhold certain funds for the construction of \n                     environmental infrastructure)\n\n       On page 3, line 11, strike ``$1,813,649,000'' and insert \n     ``$1,744,699,000''.\n\n  Mr. FLAKE. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3812 to Amendment No. 3801\n\n           (Purpose: To provide for funding for wind energy)\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 3812.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Merkley] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3812 to amendment No. 3801.\n\n       On page 23, line 15, strike the period at the end and \n     insert the following: ``:  Provided further, That of such \n     amount, $95,400,000 shall be available for wind energy.''.\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I wish to add a few remarks about this, \nas we are preparing shortly to consider a number of amendments.\n  This particular amendment is a bipartisan amendment, which I am \npleased to sponsor with my partner from Iowa, stating that wind energy \nis particularly important. This amendment would restore funding for \nwind energy research to fiscal year 2016 levels of $95.4 million. \nOtherwise, research in wind energy would suffer a substantial \nreduction.\n  This program is indispensable to the success of wind energy in the \nUnited States. The wind energy program works to advance innovations in \nthe grid integration, manufacturing, and deployment that are key to \nreducing the cost of wind energy. For example, the Wind Program helps \nto address market barriers through including wind-forecasting tools in \npower system operations, which helps utilities and regulators better \nintegrate large amounts of wind energy into the grid.\n\n[[Page S2430]]\n\nThe Wind Program provides research, development, and technical support \nto manufacturers and distributors of wind technologies that are still \nemerging. This enhances small wind manufacturing, supports offshore \ndemonstration projects, and will improve the economic viability of \ndistributed wind.\n  Currently, eight National Laboratories across our Nation conduct \nresearch or testing related to wind energy. The proposed fiscal year \n2017 funding level is only $80 million, which is over $15 million less \nthan last year's funding--thwarting our ability to realize the true \npotential for wind energy.\n  During debates, we have sometimes heard that wind is a mature \nindustry and that is why the funding for research should be revoked or \nlowered. But in fact, as wind is emerging, we are seeing continuous \ninnovations resulting in different designs and different strategies for \nintegrating intermittent wind energy into the grid. As that wind \ncomponent becomes substantially larger, we need to understand the \ndetails of how we accommodate it effectively. If we were to talk about \nmature industries, then we wouldn't be doing studies for the fossil \nfuel industry, which is about as mature as an industry can get. \nClearly, this is an evolving industry with great potential to assist us \nwith clean energy and, moreover, a program that can affect the economy \nof rural America.\n  In 2015 wind energy supplied about 5 percent of the total electricity \ngenerated in the United States. So it is no longer just a fraction of a \npercent; it has grown enormously in the last few years. But the \nDepartment of Energy estimates that wind could provide as much as 35 \npercent--or more than one-third--of the electricity generated in our \ncountry by the year 2050.\n  As my colleague and partner on this bill, the Senator from Iowa, \nknows, wind energy can be a huge boon to a State's economy. Iowa is \nalready getting over 30 percent of its electricity from wind. And \nbecause wind energy is less expensive in the forecast of potential \nother sources, it could result in billions of dollars of savings to \nenergy consumers in that State.\n  In my home State of Oregon, we already have over 10 percent of our \nelectricity being generated from wind energy. The savings for our State \ndown the road could be enormous, but we can only reach these goals if \nwe support wind energy research.\n  With the development of wind energy comes hundreds of thousands of \njobs in manufacturing, in installation, in maintenance, and in \nsupporting services. The estimate is around 600,000 jobs--generally \ngood-paying jobs--by the year 2015.\n  I do a lot of townhalls back home in Oregon, one in every county \nevery year. Much of Oregon is very rural. I hear about the impact \nproperty taxes on these wind installations have on our rural counties, \nenabling them to do things--for example, to build libraries or assist \nin the development of their local schools. There is no question that \nthis is a boon to the rural economy.\n  It is our job in Congress to look at what policies will be the most \nsuccessful and give the most bang for the buck in terms of creating \njobs now and in the future. We should be supporting programs that spur \neconomic development and support families in rural areas. That is what \nthis amendment calls for. When we create jobs, local communities \nbenefit, certainly the energy industry benefits, and our environment \nbenefits. All of this depends upon robust research, and we are simply \nasking that research continue at the same level it did in fiscal year \n2016.\n  Let's back red, white, and blue, American-made wind energy and \nsupport this bipartisan amendment. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  There are now 2 minutes equally divided on amendment No. 3812.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, we will be voting on amendment No. 3812, \nwhich my colleague from Iowa and I have put together to restore \nresearch on wind development to the level it was last year. When you \nsee these wind turbines, what you should see is economic development in \nhighly deserving rural communities, putting clean electrons onto the \ngrid, putting jobs into the community, and putting money into the \nproperty tax coffers in local communities to do good work.\n  I wish to reserve the rest of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Does the Senator from Tennessee wish to use his time on the \namendment?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I do, but I will wait until the end.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If no one uses time, time will be charged \nequally to both sides.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, can I not reserve the rest of my time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Not at this point.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, don't you think $23 billion is enough \nto spend on windmills? That is what we have spent since 1992--$23 \nbillion for 4 percent of America's electricity. This is electricity \nthat is unreliable. The windmills blow about one-third of the time, \noften at night, and it can't be stored. We will spend $5 billion this \nyear and $4.4 billion next year. We could double our energy research \nspending if we would stop subsidizing wealthy people to build giant \nwind turbines. Sixty percent of our carbon-free electricity comes from \nnuclear reactors. Relying on giant wind turbines and new transmission \nlines to power a country that uses 25 percent of all the electricity in \nthe world is like going to war in sailboats when the nuclear Navy is \navailable.\n  We already have $80 million going to research, which Senator Gardner \nand Senator Collins have asked us to include in the legislation. It is \nin the bill. We don't need to spend more.\n  We have already spent $23 billion since 1992. Spending $4 or $5 \nbillion a year is more than enough to spend on giant wind turbines.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on the Merkley amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, these subsidies are a tiny dot compared \nto the $52 billion spent annually on fossil fuel subsidies and the \nmassive subsidies spent on nuclear. Yet these subsidies are creating \njobs in rural America, and that matters. These communities need these \njobs. These are clean electrons, these are terrific middle-class jobs, \nand this is an industry that is still on a curve where research is \ntruly beneficial in making it a success.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Mr. President, this amendment would simply cut $69 million \nin unrequested funding for Corps of Engineers projects. This is kind of \nthe outgrowth of the bad old days when we had earmarks, when all of \nthis funding came about. We now have an earmark ban, but some of the \nfunding still goes to some projects that have not even been requested.\n  If we have a debt of $19 trillion and a deficit of $500 billion, it \nis time that we actually make some cuts somewhere. I would submit that \nthis is a place ripe for cutting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am going to oppose the Flake \namendment. The Army Corps of Engineers rebuilds locks and dams, dredges \nour rivers and harbors, works to prevent floods and storm damage, and \nbuilds environmental restoration projects. There is not a funding line \nin the budget that more Senators seek for their States.\n  Our spending is under control on the discretionary side. It is the \nmandatory spending, the entitlement spending, that is out of control.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I also strongly oppose this amendment. \nThis would eliminate funding for our environmental infrastructure \nprojects of the Army Corps of Engineers. Funding for these projects \nenables communities to solve local problems in a way that protects the \nenvironment.\n  Problems are being solved, such as upgrading wastewater treatment \nfacilities, so that our drinking water and marine resources are \nprotected, and replacing deteriorated distribution systems with \nefficient systems that help conserve water.\n  I hope we will vote this amendment down.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3820.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nominations: \nCalendar Nos. 307, 357, 358, 359, 362, 363, 364, 459, 460, 461, and \n508; that the Senate proceed to vote without intervening action or \ndebate on the nominations in the order listed; that the motions to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no \nintervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order to \nthe nominations; that any related statements be printed in the Record; \nthat the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and \nthe Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I \nunderstand our Democratic friends are going to propound a number of \ndifferent unanimous consent requests here with regard, I assume, to the \njudiciary. The core question here is whether President Obama has been \ntreated fairly, and I think it is noteworthy that at this point in \nPresident Bush's 8 years, 303 of his judicial nominees had been \nconfirmed. At this point in President Obama's term, the number is 324. \nThat is 21 more judges the current President has gotten at this point \nthan President Bush.\n  Clearly, President Obama has been treated fairly and, therefore, I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I am very disappointed the Republicans are \nblocking dozens of qualified nominees--nominees who have been reported \nto the Senate floor on a bipartisan basis. This is certainly, in my \nview, not about whether the President is being treated fairly, but it \nis about the Senate doing its job. The Senate is on track to confirm \nthe lowest number of judicial nominees in our history.\n  Let me mention a nominee from Hawaii: Clare Connors. She was \nconfirmed or voted on unanimously by the Judiciary Committee last \nmonth, a statement to her qualifications. Her wide-ranging experience \nincludes district and appellate venues, criminal and civil arenas, and \nlitigation on issues ranging from tax law to tough cases such as crimes \nagainst children.\n  Clare and the other nominees before us today will be kept from \nserving on the Federal bench because of Republican inaction. My \nRepublican colleagues intend to stop all judicial nominations in July, \nalthough there are 79 vacancies pending, 28 of which are considered \nemergencies. If Ms. Connors is not confirmed, the Hawaii district court \nseat will be left vacant for over a year.\n  Our judiciary should be composed of the full complement of judges \naccorded to each district court. One of the fundamental jobs of the \nSenate to engage in is its advice and consent function with regard to \nthese judicial nominees, and we are not doing that.\n  I call upon my colleagues, my Republican friends, to enable all of us \nto do our jobs and begin again the advice and consent process which we \nare, under the Constitution, required to do.\n  I see some other colleagues on the floor, so I yield to my good \nfriend from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n\n             Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will have a unanimous consent request \nafter I make a few brief remarks. I thank my friends, the Senators from \nHawaii and Maryland, for joining me here today.\n  We all know it is the job of the Senate to keep up with the need to \nconfirm judges, but our friends on the other side of the aisle aren't \nholding up their end of the bargain. The judicial confirmation process \nhas been at a crawl for years. Now it has come to a functional \nstandstill, as noncontroversial nominations--some of which were \napproved out of committee by overwhelming votes, the majority of \nRepublicans and the majority of Democrats--languish on the Executive \nCalendar.\n  Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle did their best to slow \nthe pace of confirmations when the Senate was under Democratic \nleadership, and now they are sluggishly moving nominations under a \nSenate they control. That has culminated in an irresponsible partisan \nblockade of President Obama's Supreme Court pick.\n  Let's talk about some real numbers. More than 1 year into this new \nCongress, the Republican leadership has allowed only 17 judges to be \nconfirmed. How many months do we have here? We had 12 in the last year \nof this Congress, and we are now at the end of April, so that is 4. So \nthat is 16--1 a month.\n  Let me show the contrast. I say to my dear friend, our majority \nleader, this is the number that counts because the analogy was the last \n2 years of the Bush administration when there was a Democratic \nmajority. Then, a Republican President and a Democratic majority; now, \na Democratic President and a Republican majority. They confirmed 17 and \nwe confirmed 68. This has consequences--real consequences.\n  The number of vacancies has risen from 43 to 79 since the Republicans \ntook over the majority. That didn't happen when President Bush was \nPresident and made nominations. Twenty-eight judicial emergencies. For \npeople seeking justice--they can't get it very speedily because of the \nobstruction of judges.\n  There are 20 noncontroversial judges on the Executive Calendar. We \nare urging our colleagues to let these noncontroversial judges go \nthrough. Very simply, we are urging our colleagues to do their job.\n  I know the leader wants to have the Senate move along, and we have \ntried to go along whenever it is possible. But this is a glaring \nexample where it is easy to do your job, where it is easy to move \nthings forward, and all we face is obstruction and for no voiced \nreason.\n  I would like to know why the judges who I will ask for unanimous \nconsent--it is a smaller list than my colleague from Hawaii has asked \nto go forward with. I would love to know a single reason why any of \nthem shouldn't be sitting on the bench.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session \nto consider the following nominations: Calendar Nos. 307, 357, 358, \n359, 362, and 363; further, that the Senate proceed to vote without \nintervening action or debate on the nominations; that if confirmed, the \nmotions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would \nsay to my Democratic friends that no effort to redefine what this is \nabout will be successful.\n  The issue before the Senate is, has President Obama been treated \nfairly with regard to the confirmation of judges during his tenure in \noffice? We are to a point where we know that so far during the Obama \nyears, he has gotten 23 more judges than President Bush got to this \npoint. That is the fundamental question. Has President Obama been \ntreated in some way differently from President Bush? The answer, of \ncourse, is no. Therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n             Unanimous Consent Requests--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I will continue to try here, and I thank \nthe Senate majority leader for his patience.\n  This is really not a matter of fairness to the President but fairness \nto the\n\n[[Page S2433]]\n\nAmerican people. As my colleague Senator Hirono pointed out, this is a \nmatter of justice delayed is justice denied. We have judicial \nemergencies--many on our list--that have not been filled.\n  As Senator Schumer pointed out, this is about comparing what has been \ndone on the workload of this Congress to any previous Congress on the \nconfirmation of judges, and we are dead last as far as action that has \nbeen taken.\n  I think the critical number is the number of vacancies. Compare the \nnumber of vacancies. When the Republicans took the majority, there were \n43 vacancies in our courts. That number has almost doubled to 79 \nvacancies.\n  When we take a look at the pace of confirmation--because we could say \nmaybe there were a lot that had to be taken up over a President's term. \nBut, as Senator Schumer pointed out, there have been only 17 judges \nconfirmed to date. That is one of the lowest numbers in the modern \nhistory of our country. In the last year of President Bush's \nadministration, in the same period of time of that 2-year cycle, 68 \njudges had been confirmed by a Democratically controlled Senate.\n  What makes matters more difficult for the American people to \nunderstand is that 20 judicial nominations have currently passed the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. I believe every one has been passed by \nunanimous voice vote, so they are not controversial. It is just a \nmatter of getting them up for confirmation--20 of them that have yet to \nbe acted on the floor of the Senate.\n  I will make two unanimous consent requests that will deal with 4 of \nthese 20 currently pending. All passed the Judiciary Committee by \nunanimous voice votes. Two are from States that have Democratic \nSenators and two are from States that have Republican Senators.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session \nto consider the following nominations: Calendar No. 307, Xinis of \nMaryland; Calendar No. 357, Martinotti of New Jersey; Calendar No. 358, \nRossiter of Nebraska; and Calendar No. 359, Stanton of Tennessee; that \nthe Senate proceed to vote without intervening action or debate on the \nnominations in the order listed; that the motions to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or \ndebate; that no further motions be in order to the nominations; that \nany related statements be printed in the Record; that the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume \nlegislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, for the reasons previously expressed by \nthe majority leader, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I want to make one further request in the \nseries with Senator Hirono and Senator Schumer, and that is to deal \nwith the next nominee who would be up, considering the length of time \nshe has been on the calendar. It is the nomination of Paula Xinis of \nMaryland made in March 2015--over 1 year ago--by President Obama. She \nwas recommended by Senator Mikulski and me after an exhaustive vetting \nprocess that we go through before making recommendations to the \nPresident of the United States. She was nominated over 1 year ago. She \nhad a hearing in the Judiciary Committee in July of 2015. As I said \nearlier, she was reported out of the committee by unanimous voice vote \nin September of last year, and she has been waiting all this time for \naction on the Senate floor.\n  We need this vacancy filled. We now have two vacancies in the \nMaryland District. The chief judge has related to us several times that \nthis position is critical for the administration of justice for the \npeople of Maryland and our Nation. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the following \nnomination: Calendar No. 307, Xinis of Maryland; that the Senate \nproceed to vote without intervening action or debate on the nomination; \nthat the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the \ntable with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions be \nin order to the nomination; that any related statements be printed in \nthe Record; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's \naction, and the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, for reasons previously given, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to inject a few comments in this \ndiscussion too. This isn't all about Republicans. This isn't all about \nDemocrats.\n  I had a nominee from Wyoming. Incidentally, he wasn't nominated by \nme; he was nominated by our Democratic Governor. It took me about 9 \nmonths to get a hearing in committee. This was for a district judge. \nThis wasn't for the Supreme Court. This wasn't for a circuit court. \nThis was for a district court. It took me about 9 months to get a \nhearing for him. At the end of 2 years, he had not gotten a vote in \ncommittee. His life was in suspense for 2 years. That is not right. \nNeither party should do that. But as long as the other side is saying \nthat we are holding things up, I have to point out that it is not just \na one-sided thing.\n  I hope some of the criticism can end and some of the work can be \ndone.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I just want to share in the frustration of \nmy colleague from Wyoming. This should not be a partisan issue. I \nagree, it is wrong to hold people's lives in abeyance. We are trying to \nget the very best people to serve on our courts. If they have to put \ntheir lives on hold for a year or two, will they come forward and seek \nto serve as a judge?\n  We know that for the ones we are trying to get on the bench, it is \ngoing to be a financial sacrifice. They can make more money in the \nprivate sector. We want the very best on our courts. If someone is put \non hold for 2 years or for 1 year, it compromises their ability if they \nare in the private practice of law, and it is not the right thing to \ndo--whether it is a Democrat or a Republican in the White House. We \nhave to act on these appointments a lot faster.\n  The point I raised is that during this term of Congress, during this \nyear and a half, we have seen the number of judicial vacancies go up \nfrom 43 to 79. At this particular moment, there are 20 nominees on the \nExecutive Calendar who have cleared the committee by voice vote and who \nare not controversial. Some have been waiting over a year since their \nnomination.\n  We can do something about it right now, and we should do something \nabout it right now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I wish to say a few more things regarding \nour request for action on these judicial nominations.\n  The group of nominations on which I requested action includes \nnominees from Maryland, New Jersey, Nebraska, Tennessee, New York, \nCalifornia, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, and Hawaii. They are all \nwaiting.\n  I have just one comment about the Supreme Court vacancy. The last \ntime the Senate refused to deal with a Supreme Court vacancy was during \nthe Civil War. They so objected to dealing with the President's \nnomination that the Congress actually changed the number of Justices on \nthe Supreme Court. The number of Justices is set by law, so the \nCongress changed the law and changed the number of Justices from 10 to \n7 so that they would not have to deal with the President's nominee to \nthe Supreme Court vacancy. The President vetoed that bill, the Congress \noverrode that veto, and so they changed the makeup and number of \nJustices on the Supreme Court. Certainly that is not what I am \nsuggesting Republicans should do. In fact, we have had a nine-member \nSupreme Court for almost 150 years.\n  I agree with my friend, the Senator from Wyoming, that this should \nnot be a partisan issue. Certainly, I agree with my friend from \nMaryland that we should get on with it. We should get on with these \njudicial nominations. We should do our advice and consent role, and \nclearly with regard to the Supreme Court vacancy, where, with this \ninaction, we are going to leave that Court\n\n[[Page S2434]]\n\nwith eight members for a year. That is not acceptable to the people of \nour country. We need to do our job.\n  I ask my Senate colleagues, my Republican friends, to enable the \nSenate to do our advice and consent role and do our job as set forth in \nthe U.S. Constitution.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/senate-section/article/S2434-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                     Nomination of Merrick Garland\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the vacancy on the \nSupreme Court and the majority's ongoing refusal to consider the \nnomination of Chief Judge Merrick Garland. Forty days have passed since \nthe President of the United States nominated Judge Garland to fill \nJustice Scalia's seat. This is longer than it took for the Senate to \nconfirm Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in 1981. In fact, 75 percent of all \nSupreme Court Justices have been confirmed within 31 days, but today--\n40 days after his nomination--many Senators haven't even extended Judge \nGarland the simple courtesy of a meeting. The majority's refusal to \nhold a vote is without precedent, and the majority has cited none. \nInstead, the majority is trying to shift the blame.\n  Incredibly, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee recently came to \nthe floor to blame, of all people, not other Senators, not other \npoliticians, but the Chief Justice of the United States of America for \npoliticizing the Court. Ten days before Justice Scalia's death, the \nChief Justice said: ``The process is not functioning very well.'' That \nturns out to have been something of an understatement. The Chief \nJustice went on and said that the process ``is being used for something \nother than ensuring the qualifications of the nominees.'' Again, he was \nnot referring to what is going on now in the Senate. This happened \nbefore Justice Scalia passed away. There was no way that the Chief \nJustice could have known there was going to be a vacancy. He continued: \n``[Supreme Court Justices] don't work as Democrats or Republicans . . . \nand I think it's a very unfortunate impression the public might get \nfrom the confirmation process.''\n  His words struck me--particularly given what has gone on since then--\nas a candid expression of his concern for the Court as an institution. \nThis concern apparently upset the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. \nHe took to the floor and said:\n\n       The Chief Justice has it exactly backwards. The \n     confirmation process doesn't make the Justices appear \n     political.\n\n  He continued:\n\n       The confirmation process has gotten political precisely \n     because the Court has drifted from the constitutional text, \n     and rendered decisions based instead on policy preferences.\n\n  It is absolutely breathtaking that the Chief Justice would be \ncriticized for ``drifting from the constitutional text'' when, for the \npast 10 weeks, the majority has drifted from article II, section 2, \nclause 2, which sets out our constitutional responsibility to advise \nand consent in very clear terms. Worse, the majority's drift isn't even \nabout policy; it is about politics. It is about rolling the dice on an \nelection instead of following the plain text of the Constitution.\n  This is absolutely unprecedented in the history of the Senate. \nThroughout our history, the Senate has confirmed 17 nominees in \nPresidential election years to serve on the Supreme Court. The last of \nthese was Justice Kennedy in 1988. When the President made this \nnomination, he had more than 340 days left in his term. We are talking \nalmost a quarter of the President's term. That is a lot more time than \nmost of those 17 Justices had before this Senate.\n  In the last 100 years, every nominee to a Supreme Court vacancy who \ndid not withdraw--and a couple did--received a timely hearing and vote. \nOn average, the Senate has begun hearings within 40 days of the \nPresident's nomination and voted to confirm 70 days after the \nPresident's nomination. There is no excuse for not holding a hearing \nand a vote.\n  If that is what we are going to pay attention to in this Chamber and \nif that is what we are going to argue for--originalism, strict \nconstructionism--the plain language of the Constitution is clear. There \nis a reason why no Senate has ever had the audacity to do what this \nSenate is doing right now--because of how clear that mission is and \nbecause there is no one else to do it. The Constitution says: The \nSenate shall advise and consent. It doesn't say: The House of \nRepresentatives shall have a role. It doesn't say: Let the people \ndecide. It says that this is the Senate's job. We should do our job \njust as every Senate, until now, has done its job since the founding of \nthe country, including the Senate that was there when George Washington \nwas in office. Three of those 17 appointments were confirmed by a \nSenate that actually contained people who had been at the \nconstitutional convention, and they were consistent with their \nunderstanding of what the Founders had agreed to. They had a vote on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  I am not saying how people should vote. They should vote their \nconscience, but we should have a vote. The American people expect us to \ndo our job.\n  I want to be clear that I believe there should be hearings. I think \nwe should go through hearings to establish the qualifications of the \nnominee. I think that is really important. The point I am making about \nhaving this vote does not have to do with whom the President nominated. \nIt has to do with our institutional responsibility. It has to do with \nthe rule of law and the image we want to project to our country and \noverseas.\n  Finally, I have a word to say about the President's nominee. Merrick \nGarland is an honored and accomplished judge. Two weeks ago I had the \nopportunity to meet with him and learn about his judicial record and \nphilosophy. I have known Chief Judge Garland for more than 20 years. I \nhave actually worked for him at the Justice Department when we both \nworked for the Deputy Attorney General of the United States. I was \nfresh out of law school, but even then Judge Garland's humility, work \nethic, and commitment to the rule of law inspired me and continue to \ninspire me.\n  Our meeting last week confirmed what I already know. Judge Garland is \nan intelligent and pragmatic judge who is extraordinarily well-\nqualified to serve on the Supreme Court. I have wondered whether that \nis the reason the majority is not holding hearings. They could simply \nhold the hearings and vote against Judge Garland, which is their \nprerogative. Why not hold hearings? Maybe they know that the American \npeople, given the opportunity to hear directly from Judge Garland, \nwould see that he is precisely the type of judge who should serve on \nthe Court.\n  A vacancy on the Supreme Court is a rare thing. It doesn't come \naround very often. For those of us in this country, whether we are in \nthe Senate or in a classroom somewhere, those vacancies, hearings, and \ndebates on the floor present an unparalleled opportunity--a remarkable \nopportunity--for the American people to engage in a debate about the \nCourt, the Constitution, and all kinds of issues that the Court will \nconsider. That is what these hearings are about. That is what could be \ngoing on this summer during this Presidential election year, and we \nwould have a discussion about where we want to head as a country. We \nare not having it. We are not having it because of this unprecedented \naction.\n  Because of what the majority has done here, by not meeting with the \nnominee or holding a hearing, they are denying him the opportunity to \nmake his case to the American people. In the meantime--and this is \nreally critical--the Court will continue to be impaired. Impaired is \nthe word that Justice Scalia himself used when he was asked to recuse \nhimself from a case involving Dick Cheney, then the Vice President of \nthe United States. In that case, he was asked if there would be a \npresumption of recusal. Justice Scalia's answer\n\n[[Page S2435]]\n\nto that was this: Maybe if I were on the court of appeals--because if I \nwere on the court of appeals, there would be somebody to replace me, \nbut that is not how it works on the Supreme Court. When there is a \nvacancy on the Supreme Court, leaving the Court with only eight \nJustices, there is nobody who can fill in. There is nobody to become \nthe ninth Justice. He said that the Court would therefore be impaired.\n  The action that is being taken right now threatens to impair the \nSupreme Court not for one session but for two sessions of the Court \nbefore there is another election. In fact, for the third time since \nJustice Scalia's death, the Supreme Court could not resolve a dispute \nbecause of a 4-to-4 split. The longer this vacancy remains, the more \nuncertainty and confusion the American people will suffer. As I said, \ntwo terms of the Court will be jeopardized by petty politics.\n  Believe me, I know it has become fashionable for Washington to tear \ndown rather than work to improve the democratic institutions that \ngenerations of Americans have built, but to so cavalierly impair the \njudicial branch of our government is pathetic.\n  It is time for the Senate to do its job as every Senate has done \nbefore us. Again, I am not asking my colleagues to support Judge \nGarland's nomination. That is a matter of conscience for each of us. \nBut we must fulfill our basic constitutional obligation of holding a \nhearing and a vote. This is literally--because it is in the \nConstitution and no one else is granted this power--the least we can do \nto demonstrate that we are a legislative body that functions as the \nConstitution requires.\n  We certainly have plenty of time. In view of that, if by contrast we \nleave for our scheduled 7 weeks of summer vacation--which is not \nenshrined in the Constitution but is a schedule that is set by the \nSenate--without having fulfilled our responsibility, the American \npeople should demand that we return to Washington and do our job.\n  It is past time for my colleagues to meet with Judge Garland, hold \nhearings on his record, and give the American people an up-or-down vote \non this judicial vacancy.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate majority whip.\n\n\n                       The Appropriations Process\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I fear that sometimes here in the Senate \nwe get bogged down in the minutia and the process and don't really talk \nabout the why of how things are done here. We talk a lot about the how, \nbut we don't talk about the why. I just want to speak for a couple of \nminutes about why it is so important that we pass the regular \nappropriation bills and put what we are trying to do here in a larger \ncontext.\n  Our colleagues will remember that last year we were unable to pass \nthe 12 regular appropriation bills because our Democratic colleagues \nfilibustered those pieces of legislation in order to force a \nnegotiation to raise the spending caps on discretionary spending. I \nregret that. I wish it hadn't happened, but it did and there is not \nmuch we can do about it. But in the process, what happened is that we \nended up having to pass a fiscal year-end omnibus appropriations bill \nthat lacked any basic transparency. There was about $1 trillion-plus \nworth of spending, and I think most people's reaction is this: Why do \nyou have to do business in such a terrible way that lacks transparency, \ndoesn't let people know what is in the bill, and doesn't let all 100 \nSenators contribute to the product? The reason is because our \nDemocratic colleagues blocked those bills.\n  I hope it is different this year because now those top-line numbers \nfor discretionary spending are fixed in law. What we are trying to do, \nstarting with the Energy and Water appropriations bill that Senator \nAlexander and Senator Feinstein are working through the legislative \nprocess, is to begin the process of passing those regular appropriation \nbills. I hope and trust we will conclude with this piece of legislation \nthis week and then we will move on to the next legislative vehicle, \nwhich will probably be the transportation, housing, and urban \ndevelopment legislation, the so-called THUD bill around here.\n  We have actually demonstrated that by providing an open process, we \ncan actually get some things done. We all recall last Congress--a year \nand a half ago. The fact of the matter is that a decision had been made \nby the then-majority leader, Senator Reid, not to allow Senators to \nparticipate in the amendment process on the floor. As a consequence, it \nwasn't just those of us in the minority who were prohibited from \noffering legislation that would actually improve the product that was \non the floor, it included Members of his own political party. So they \nhad to go home at election time and explain to their constituents back \nhome: I may be in the majority, but I couldn't get an amendment voted \non, on the Senate floor.\n\n  Having learned from that experience, Senator McConnell and we decided \nthat the best thing to do is to have an open process by which Members \nof the majority party and minority party, Democrats and Republicans \nalike--anybody who has a good idea--can come forward and get a vote on \nthat legislation. We had a couple of recent bipartisan successes. Yes, \nI know in some corners ``bipartisanship'' is a dirty word, but the fact \nis, you can't get anything done around here unless it is bipartisan. \nOur Constitution was written in a way to force consensus to be built. \nIn an absence of consensus, nothing gets done.\n  So we have had a couple of recent successes, in addition to our work \non appropriations bills, including the Energy Policy Modernization Act. \nOne of the most important parts of that legislation from my perspective \nis that back in Texas we saw an expedited process for the approval of \nliquefied natural gas export terminals. That is very important to our \neconomy and something that takes advantage of an incredible resource we \nhave in America--natural gas--which we would like to sell to our allies \nand friends around the world when they don't have it. That is something \nthat builds jobs in America. It helps grow our economy. It helps \nprovide a lifeline to many of our allies around the world, for whom \nenergy is being used simply as a weapon by people like Vladimir Putin.\n  We also voted to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration \nbill. Obviously, this is important for public safety--to make sure our \nskies are safe--but also to provide the appropriate regulatory regime \nfor the airline industry.\n  Looked at individually, these bills may not seem like an end-all or \nbe-all, but they are part of a bigger picture and part of a larger \ngoal, which is getting this legislative body back to work again, as it \nwas meant to do, considering and passing legislation that will impact \nour country for the better. Don't get me wrong. Sometimes the right \nanswer is to stop bad ideas. Sometimes the right idea is to stop bad \nideas, but where there is an opportunity for consensus and where we can \nactually craft something that helps move our country forward--I believe \nall 100 Senators came here with that sort of goal in mind.\n  The bottom line is, we are working again to advance the priorities of \nthe American people. In the same way we debate and discuss the Energy \nand Water appropriations bill, we have to keep the bigger picture in \nmind. It is not just about passing a single appropriations bill or to \ncheck items off our to-do list, it is part of a larger process, which \nis to fund the Federal Government in a fiscally responsible way, \nhopefully--that is our goal--and to make sure we review the programs \nthat are funded by Federal appropriations and make sure they are still \nthe priorities we believe they should be. If they aren't, then they \nshouldn't be funded. That is part of the process--to go back and look \nat what the programs are, whether they are still working, whether they \nare still necessary, and if they are not working or no longer \nnecessary, then we simply no longer fund those as part of the \nappropriations process.\n  We know this sets our country's priorities by giving guidance on \neverything we support--from our veterans to how we provide for our \nenergy structure needs, to how we equip and train our troops. Funding \nthe government is actually one of the most important and basic duties \nof the Congress. As the Senator from Tennessee has pointed out, one of \nthe biggest problems we have--one we are not going to solve here today \nor this week, unfortunately--is that so much of the money\n\n[[Page S2436]]\n\nthat gets spent by the Federal Government is on autopilot--so-called \nmandatory spending. In other words, it is not even subject to the \nappropriations process in the Senate. Currently, only about one-third \nof the money the Federal Government spends actually goes through this \nsort of transparent and open process, where everybody knows what is \ngoing on and can offer their input. The rest of the money is spent on \nautopilot, and it is projected to rise, according to one recent \nprojection I saw, at a rate of roughly 5.3 percent over the next 30 \nyears.\n  We know that is far beyond the rate of inflation, and it is an \nunsustainable amount of spending. Some of the most important programs \nthat are government funded, such as Medicare or Social Security, cannot \nbe sustained at the current level of spending unless we do everything \nwe can within our ability to shore them up and save them for the next \ngeneration. That is what we actually need to be doing in the larger \npicture.\n  Until that day, we can continue to do what we can to deal responsibly \nwith discretionary spending, and that is what we are trying to do. If \nwe don't deal with these appropriations bills in a methodical and \ndeliberate sort of way--all 12 of them--we are going to find ourselves \nat the end of September, at the end of the fiscal year, back in the \nsame situation we were in last year--with the need for an omnibus \nappropriations bill or a continuing resolution, which is something I \nknow there is not a lot of appetite for.\n\n\n                               Zika Virus\n\n  Mr. President, let me just say a word about the Zika virus and the \nemergency funding request made by the President. Some of our \ncolleagues--notably the Democratic leader and the Democratic whip--\ntalked about this this morning and raised the question of whether we \nare going to responsibly deal with this threat of the Zika virus. I can \ntell my colleagues we will. We are committed on a bipartisan basis to \ntry to make sure we respond responsibly both from a public safety point \nof view and from a fiscal point of view.\n  The President requested $1.9 billion. Thankfully, there is money that \nhas been identified that was left over from the Ebola threat--some $500 \nmillion--that can be used as a downpayment to make sure our world-class \nscientists, like the ones I have met at the University of Texas medical \nbranch in Galveston and just this last week at the Texas Medical \nCenter, are doing the research that is necessary in order to identify \nhow to stop this threat by controlling the mosquitoes that bring it \ninto the country. We know the mosquito that carries the Zika virus is \ncommon in more temperate and warmer parts of the country, and that is \nwhy it has been primarily a threat in Brazil and places like Haiti and \nPuerto Rico. We also know that in places like Texas, Florida, and \nLouisiana, this mosquito is present and there are already established \ncases of Zika, primarily occurring in, I believe, either people who \nhave traveled to Central America or South America and who have been \nbitten and brought it back with them or, in the case of--apparently it \nhas now been discovered that this virus can be sexually transmitted. So \none of the things we need to make sure of, particularly for every woman \nof child-bearing age, is that they get the sort of protection they need \nso these horrific birth defects that we have seen in the news don't \noccur. We are all committed to doing that.\n  We also ought to make sure we don't overshoot our goal and write a \nblank check for something when we don't even know what the plan of \nattack is. In some ways, this is like the President asking us to fund a \nwar without telling us what his strategy is for fighting and winning \nthat war. I think that is the sort of commonsense question our \nconstituents want us to ask, and which we should ask.\n  I realize not everything is knowable. Hopefully, within a couple of \nyears, our scientific community will have developed a vaccine which can \nprotect people from this virus, but in the meantime we need to continue \nto fund the basic research. We need to continue to fund at the local \nlevel the mosquito eradication, and we need to keep our eye on this \nemerging threat.\n  We can do that, and we will do that in a responsible sort of way. We \ndon't need our colleagues on the Democratic side to say we have to do \nit right here, right now, without even having a plan from the \nadministration on how we will fight and win this war against the Zika \nvirus and hold up the regular appropriations process. I can tell from \nthe saber-rattling going on from some of my colleagues across the aisle \nthat they are looking for a reason to disrupt the regular \nappropriations process and that can be a mistake. First of all, it will \nnot accomplish anything that can't otherwise be accomplished in terms \nof funding our research and the fight against the Zika virus. We are \ncommitted to doing that in a bipartisan sort of way but in a \nresponsible sort of way that doesn't add to the national debt and pass \nthe bill on to the next generation, as well as a proportional response \nto the threat. Just throwing money at it without a plan does not seem \nlike a responsible thing to do.\n  I implore our colleagues across the aisle, do not try to use the Zika \ncrisis to hold hostage our ability to do our regular appropriations \nwork. It is too important to avoid the year-end Omnibus appropriations \nbill that nobody says they like, and it is important for us to \ndemonstrate--as we have tried to and I believe succeeded in doing, in \nlarge part--that we can continue to do our work day in and day out on a \nbipartisan, responsible basis, not that we are all going to agree on \neverything--that is just not the way people are built--nor do they want \nus to agree on everything. This is the place where we have the great \ndebates on the issues that confront our country, both now and in the \nfuture, and that is appropriate. Nobody should take it personally. We \nneed to have those debates. We need to have those verbal confrontations \nso we can get to the truth and figure the best path forward for the \ncountry.\n  So we are not here to kick the can down the road. We are here to do \nthe Nation's business, and we are here to deliver results to the \nAmerican people. I hope we can continue to do that by carefully \ndiscussing, debating, and then voting on all 12 appropriations bills.\n  In addition to talking about how, I hope to explain a little bit of \nthe why it is so important that we do this now in order to avoid that \nyear-end rush to an omnibus appropriations bill later on.\n  Mr. President, I don't see any other Senators seeking recognition, so \nI suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, first, to the majority whip, I thank him \nfor his comments on the Zika virus. He is absolutely right to raise \nawareness of that issue. It is a great concern. In Ohio we happen to \nhave some military assets that have been used in the past for aerial \nspraying, and I know they are interested in being even more involved in \nsome of the eradication of some of these mosquitoes in the southern \npart of the country that may end up causing some of this infection. It \nis a very serious matter, and I am glad to know the Appropriations \nCommittee is working on it as well as our authorizing committees. I \nknow the Senator from Texas has a personal interest in this.\n  I rise to speak about the underlying legislation--the Energy and \nWater appropriations bill. I thank the chairman of that committee, \nSenator Alexander, for working with me to include a couple of important \nprovisions for the State of Ohio.\n  One is the cleanup of what is known as the Portsmouth Gaseous \nDiffusion Plant. This is a site that for half a century enriched \nuranium. This uranium was used by our Navy, for our military, and for \nother purposes, including our nuclear arsenals, but it also has been \nused for our powerplants. So for decades the people in Piketon, OH, \nhave been helping keep Americans safe and also helping thousands of \nOhioans to keep the lights on and to stay warm at a reasonable cost. \nNow we have to clean up this facility. We moved on to other technology. \nIt is an efficient\n\n[[Page S2437]]\n\ntechnology, but it is a heck of a cleanup removing all this gaseous \ndiffusion material and properly disposing of it.\n\n  This cleanup effort employs about 2,000 Ohioans. They are doing their \njob and doing it very well. We have to support them. Unfortunately, \nover the years they have not gotten the support they deserve. In a 2008 \ncampaign trip to Ohio, the President gave a commitment that he would \naccelerate that cleanup. Frankly, that just hasn't happened under the \nPresident's budget, so every year we have to fight for more funding to \nbe sure that we can continue the cleanup, which is so important, but \nalso to ensure that we aren't losing jobs in Pike County. We just had \nthis tragic occurrence where we had four different homes where family \nmembers were present during the horrible shooting out there in Pike \nCounty. This is one of the counties in Ohio that have relatively high \nunemployment. It is a county that has a lot of economic issues. These \n2,000 jobs are good-paying jobs with good benefits, so it is very \nimportant that we keep the jobs there.\n  Just as importantly, it is the right thing to do for the taxpayers \nbecause as the Obama administration has pulled back funding for this \ncleanup, it ends up costing the taxpayers more because delaying this \ncleanup ends up adding huge additional costs as funding is cut back and \nthere is less cleanup going on. Our analysis shows that an accelerated \ncleanup could save the taxpayers $4 billion, getting this done and \nmoving the site on to commercial use. Having adequate funding will save \nthe taxpayers money.\n  Second, cleaning up the radioactive waste and other hazardous waste \nthere is incredibly important for the community. It makes that site \ncleaner, of course, and is better for the environment. It is important \nfor the community and these people who have for many years been \nproviding us with the enriched uranium for our military and for our \npowerplants to know they are not going to be left with this \nenvironmental problem.\n  Third, these are good-paying jobs in a county that really needs them.\n  Finally, we owe it to the community to clean up the site so they can \nredevelop it. They want to reindustrialize this site, and it is a great \nlocation to do maybe an energy project or maybe a nuclear powerplant at \nsome point and other exciting opportunities, but they have to clean up \nwhat is there in order for the site to be used for that.\n  The people of Piketon have helped shore up our economy and our \nnational defense. We owe it to them to clean up this site. I am pleased \nthat in this legislation we are considering an increase of $20 million \nover this year's level of cleanup work and an additional $20 million \nover this year's level for constructing a needed onsite disposal cell. \nWe are at the point where we need to dispose of this material, and we \nneed more money for that disposal cell. I am hoping that the House will \nincrease the funding for the disposal cell even more, and if so, we \nwill work in conference to get that number up further because that \nmakes a lot of sense in order to actually move forward on this cleanup \nfor all the reasons I have stated.\n  Again, I thank the chairman, Senator Alexander, for his help on this. \nOne thing the chairman knows well is that part of the funding for the \ncleanup work comes from the Department of Energy's barter of uranium. I \nask that as we move forward with the completion of this legislation \nover the next few months, if the price of uranium should change--should \ndrop--that the chairman continue to work with us to ensure that there \nare no job losses and to ensure that the cleanup work is not delayed as \nit has been in the past.\n  Second, I thank the chairman for including another provision that is \nincredibly important to Ohio and to Lake Erie. For many years the Army \nCorps of Engineers has been dredging the Cuyahoga River. It is \nnecessary to do that for commercial purposes. They have a big steel \nplant there, which anybody who comes to the Republican Convention will \nsee. It is very important, for that plant and other commercial \npurposes, to keep this waterway open for boat traffic, including \nbringing iron ore in for the steel mills.\n  Unfortunately, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers wants to take the \ndredge from the river and dump it into Lake Erie. Time and time again, \nthe Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and others have said this is \nnot good for the environment. Specifically, the dredge has PCB \nmaterial. The PCB pollutants get into the fish, and the Ohio EPA has \ntold them that if they keep dumping it into the lake, at some point \nthey will have to issue a warning that the walleye in Lake Erie, which \nis our great game fish, is not to be eaten more than a certain number \nof times per month. This would kill the fishing industry. It is also \nthe wrong thing to do with all the algal bloom problems we have in the \nlake because that is driven by nitrogen and phosphorous mostly, and \nthose nutrients would get into the lake through this dumping. So we are \nsaying: Let's use an onsite disposal facility. We have one on land that \nthey can use. They are refusing to do that.\n  The Army Corps of Engineers has gone so far as to, in the last \nappropriations bill, actually cut their own funding--which is something \nI have never seen before--to not be able to meet the requirement we put \ninto law, saying that they have to provide for the disposal of this \nproduct not into the lake but onto a land facility.\n  We have now worked with Chairman Alexander to include language in \nthis legislation before us. Senator Sherrod Brown and I were successful \nin getting that in last year. Once again we are working with the \nchairman to get that language in this year. I thank Senator Alexander \nfor including it. It maintains the requirement that ensures that the \nCorps uphold its funding obligations to dispose of this dredge material \nupland and not in the lake.\n  Again, it concerns me that the Corps seems to want to try to get \naround this. In fact, instead of putting money into the operations and \nmaintenance account, as they are required to do to comply with not just \nwhat Congress says but, frankly, what the court has ordered them to \ndo--because the court has consistently said they have to dredge and \nthen dump on land, they have actually put that into a risky position by \nsaying they don't need the funding. They have gone so far as to \nindicate that maybe other dredging projects on Lake Erie or other Lake \nErie funding could be in jeopardy of not receiving the full amount of \nmoney they need if there is a need to dispose of this on land.\n  There is a better way. The Corps should request use of unallocated \nfunds provided by Congress in order to dispose of the dredge material \nat Cleveland Harbor safely without putting other projects at risk. They \ncan do that.\n  Our Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, is \ncurrently investigating whether the Corps intentionally requested a \ndecrease in funding in last year's spending bill so that they would \nhave no choice but to dump this dredge material into the harbor. I hope \nthat is not true. I hope we find out that is not what happened, but \nthere are indications of that. Again, doing so would threaten the \nhealth of the area, the city of Cleveland, Lake Erie's ecosystem, and \nspecifically our fishing industry in Lake Erie, which is so critical to \neconomic growth in that area. Lake Erie is the most productive of all \nof our Great Lakes in terms of fishing. It has a $6 billion fishing \nindustry and is the No. 1 tourist attraction in Ohio.\n  I urge the Corps to revise its work plan for this year to request the \nadditional funds necessary to safely dispose of the dredge sediment at \nthe Cleveland Harbor during the 2016 dredging season if, as I suspect, \nthe Federal judge again rules that the Corps cannot place it in Lake \nErie. I urge them to work with us to come up with a solution so we can \nhave this dredge material disposed of on land and actually recycle that \nmaterial so that it has value. A couple of weeks ago when I was at the \nsite, I saw how some of the material is being mixed with other fill and \nbeing used not just for landfill but also for gardens and for farming \nand agriculture purposes. This is a way to take the dredge and to \nactually have it have value and be able to recycle it.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer for allowing me to give \nthis statement today and for his patience. I also thank Chairman \nAlexander and others who have worked with us on this so that we can \nindeed be sure that we clean up this site and that we are able to get \nthis dredge material coming out\n\n[[Page S2438]]\n\nof the Cuyahoga River onto a site on land to avoid the environmental \ndamage that would otherwise occur.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business for up to 17 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Portman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                               Zika Virus\n\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I first want to talk about the Zika public \nhealth emergency that is coming to the United States of America. We \nhave to act now to fund the administration's request of $1.9 billion in \nsupplemental funding.\n  Zika is a disease carried by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, a vector \nthat has already caused a dengue epidemic in my State of Hawaii. The \nAedes mosquitoes are in more places than we previously thought \nthroughout the United States.\n  Zika is the first mosquito-borne illness to be associated with a \ncongenital birth defect. We are continuing to learn more about this \ndevastating disease every day, including its association with Guillain-\nBarre syndrome--a type of paralysis--eye abnormalities, and more.\n  While there have not yet been any locally transmitted diseases of \nZika in the continental United States, we do have hundreds of travel-\nrelated cases and up to 500 cases of active transmission in Puerto \nRico, American Samoa, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. As I mentioned, \nHawaii is recovering from a dengue epidemic. So we must provide \nemergency funding for mosquito-borne illnesses, and we must do it now. \nThis is an emergency.\n  The administration has clearly laid out its request to combat Zika, \nwhich includes the following: $830 million for the CDC. This money \nwould include grants and technical assistance to Puerto Rico and the \nU.S. territories and help our domestic and international response \nactivities; about $250 million for the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services, or CMS, to increase the Federal match rate to Puerto \nRico; and several hundred million dollars for the National Institutes \nof Health and BARDA to invest in vaccine research and development. That \nis the long-term solution. There is a high degree of competence that we \nwill be able to get a vaccine but not without the funding. This is an \nabsolute emergency. We need $10 million for the FDA vaccine and \ndiagnostics development and review, which is absolutely critical--we \ndon't have diagnostic tests that are quite as efficient and effective \nas we are eventually going to need--and $335 million for USAID efforts \nabroad in public health infrastructure.\n  I was fortunate to visit the CDC in Atlanta a couple of weeks ago to \nlearn more about their efforts to combat Zika, dengue, and other \nvector-borne diseases. I saw firsthand how the CDC has activated its \nLevel 1 Emergency Operations Center to combat Zika. During my questions \nat the Labor-HHS appropriations hearings, I heard how the CDC is \nstrapped for funds and has already programmed its Ebola funds and how \nthese Ebola funds are critically needed to prevent another Ebola \ncrisis. I have total confidence in the CDC, but they need this \nemergency funding request to be granted.\n  We are about to go on a 1-week recess. There is no reason that we \ncan't at least get on the supplemental this week. This is an absolute \nemergency. There are a lot of things we are doing that are important \nthis week in terms of individual appropriations bills, but let's be \nclear: None of these appropriations bills are going to pass in the next \nweek or even the next month. We still have the House that needs to take \naction, and there is no doubt we are going to go to conference. So in \nterms of whatever other legislative vehicles are pending or about to be \npending, there is no urgency for us to move to those instead of what is \nhappening right now in terms of a public health emergency with Zika. \nThis is an absolute emergency.\n  The reason this is not smashing through every headline online, on \ntelevision, in the newspapers, and on the radio is that it is still \ncold outside in a lot of places and the mosquitoes haven't come out. \nThis is about to be a very serious public health crisis.\n  For those of us who have differing views about the size and scope of \ngovernment, I just want to say this: We have arguments about the EPA's \nrole, about the Department of Human Services' role, about the \nDepartment of Education's role, and the size and scope of government \nacross the board, but can't we agree that government's basic job is to \nprotect its citizens, and can't we agree that the CDC is one of the \nbest agencies in the government across the board, and can't we agree \nthat this is a real emergency and ought not to wait until May or June \nor July and ought to be taken up immediately?\n  Mr. President, this is an emergency, and we ought to fund the \nsupplemental on a big bipartisan vote.\n\n\n                       Trans-Pacific Partnership\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to talk about the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership. Many promises were made about the TPP. Before the final \ntext was available, I received dozens of phone calls from advocates of \nthe deal asking for my support. They said that this trade agreement was \ngoing to be different; that it would raise standards rather than lower \nthem; and that my concerns about labor, the environment, climate \nchange, public health, and consumer protection would be addressed. But \nsince the text was released, I have read it, and unfortunately this \ndeal does not turn out to be any different from the previous deals. It \nlooks like just another race to the bottom.\n  Proponents claimed that the labor and environment chapters would \ncontain enforceable commitments, and I know a lot of people worked very \nhard to make that true. But when you look closely at the wording of \nthese chapters, you see that the commitments are basically just \nstrongly worded suggestions. There are very few requirements. Instead, \nthe countries have promised to ``promote,'' ``encourage,'' \n``cooperate,'' ``strive,'' and ``endeavor'' to do various things. I \nhave no clue how one can enforce an obligation to encourage something \nor discourage something. Many of the provisions contain this weak \nlanguage, carefully written by lawyers to be unenforceable.\n  Here are a few examples from the environment chapter, which is \nparticularly weak.\n  First, the chapter opens with a general commitment that ``each Party \nshall strive to ensure that its environmental laws . . . provide for, \nand encourage, high levels of environmental protection.'' That is \nright; they are to ``strive to ensure.''\n  On transitioning to a low-emissions economy, ``Parties shall \ncooperate to address matters of joint or common interest.'' There is \nnothing more on climate change whatsoever.\n  On marine animal conservation, ``Each party shall promote the long-\nterm conservation'' of sharks and various marine animals through ``such \nmeasures'' considered appropriate. I don't even know what that means. \nWhat is clear is that none of this is enforceable. So the problem is, \nno accountability. There is no requirement that countries meet their \nobligations before Congress has to vote on the agreement and no \nindependent verification of whether those obligations are ever met.\n  We will vote to open our markets on day one to goods made under \nterrible labor and environmental conditions and hope that over time, \nafter we have forfeited our leverage, these countries will implement \nand enforce the kinds of labor laws our country has had for decades.\n  What this means is that we are giving them the deal, and after we \nforfeit all of our leverage, we hope they will see the light and do the \nright thing. Take Vietnam as an example. The economic benefits to \nVietnam of reduced or eliminated U.S. duties are enormous. Importers \nfrom Vietnam currently pay around $2 billion in annual tariffs. Most of \nthat comes from imports of apparel and footwear--industries that \nfrequently utilize forced and child labor. Although Vietnam is supposed \nto comply on day one with the labor side agreement it signed with the \nUnited States, there is no independent verification. The side agreement \nsets up a long process of consultation before punitive action can be \ntaken. At that point, Vietnam will already be enjoying the benefit of \nthe elimination of the tariff, and the United States will have lost \njobs that cannot compete\n\n[[Page S2439]]\n\nwith forced child labor. No punitive action will bring back those jobs.\n  Now let's talk about the enforcement side. Our track record, \nunfortunately, is not good. In the limited instances in which there are \nenforcement mechanisms in our trade agreements, we rarely utilize them. \nRecently, the GAO reported a systemic failure to enforce labor and \nenvironmental commitments across several trade agreements, even in \nlight of compelling evidence of violations. The reason for this is that \nwe don't really provide the resources for enforcement. But more \nimportantly, there is a real lack of political will. For instance, the \ninclusion of Malaysia in this trade zone gives us insight into the lack \nof political will.\n  When we debated fast-track authority last year, Congress agreed on an \nimportant negotiating objective: No trade deals with countries that \nearn the worst human trafficking ranking, according to the U.S. State \nDepartment. This seems like something everyone ought to agree to. At \nthe time, this included Malaysia, which had the lowest ranking. But \njust after fast-track became law, Malaysia's ranking was upgraded--to \nthe surprise of human rights experts everywhere. The upgrade allowed \nthe circumvention of Congress's will and the continued inclusion of \nMalaysia in TPP. This came just a few months after the discovery of \nhuman cages and 130 graves at a human trafficking detention camp on the \nMalaysia-Thailand border. Against this backdrop, it is hard to have \nconfidence that we will ever prioritize labor rights, human rights, or \nenvironmental protection over commercial interests.\n  I am also deeply concerned about the inclusion of investor-state \ndispute settlement provisions, or ISDS for short. ISDS provides a \nspecial forum outside of our court system that is just available to \nforeign investors. These investors are given the right to sue \ngovernments over laws and regulations that impact their businesses--a \nlegal right that is not granted to a labor union, an individual, or \nanyone else.\n  Here is how it works: If a decision is made by a national government \nthat is contradicted by a provision in a trade agreement, the trade \nagreement wins. If a law that we pass contradicts a provision in TPP, \nTPP trumps our law. Corporations are increasingly seeing this as a \nviable legal strategy to increase profits and undermine public health \nand environmental and labor protections.\n  The ISDS forum is not available to anyone other than foreign \ncorporations. It is not open to domestic businesses, labor unions, \ncivil societies, or individuals who allege a violation of a trade \nagreement obligation.\n  The arbitrators in ISDS who preside over these cases are literally \nnot accountable to anyone. Their decisions cannot be appealed. By \nprofession, the arbitrators usually make their living working as \nlawyers for multinational corporations. The arbitrators cannot force \nthe government to change its laws, but they can order the government to \npay the investor when they lose money as a result of a law that \ncontradicts a trade agreement, which can have the same effect.\n  It is one thing for the United States to decide to pay a penalty to \nkeep a law in place, but small countries cannot afford to go up against \nthese multinational corporations in the ISDS context. Not only will \nthey repeal their national laws, they sometimes will not enact national \nlaws knowing that they will be subject to fines under this ISDS \nprocess.\n  The government often agrees to change the law or regulation that is \nbeing challenged, in addition to paying compensation. The threat of a \ncase can be enough to convince a government to back away from \nlegitimate public health, safety, or environmental policies. The \npractical implication is potentially sweeping. ISDS could prevent us \nfrom addressing climate change, raising the minimum wage, protecting \nconsumers from harmful products, or preventing another financial \ncrisis.\n  Each time we pass a law or regulation to improve the lives of the \nAmerican people, foreign investors will effectively have the final say. \nThese risks are not theoretical. In fact, for the United States, the \nrisk of ISDS has become very real. In January, TransCanada--the \nCanadian company behind the Keystone XL Pipeline--filed a claim against \nthe U.S. Government under NAFTA's ISDS provisions for failing to \napprove the pipeline. If TransCanada wins, taxpayers--U.S. taxpayers--\nwould be on the hook for $15 billion in damages being demanded by \nforeign corporations.\n  Make no mistake. This is a new strategy for fossil fuel companies to \nchallenge laws and regulations that are attempting to reduce carbon \nemissions and combat climate change. There are hundreds of billions of \ndollars at stake, and with that on the line, you have to believe that \nlaw firms are spending hours systematically scouring every trade and \ninvestment agreement for provisions they can use to invalidate Federal \nlaw. This is the legal strategy to bust up laws designed to protect \npublic health, the environment, and consumers.\n  Corporate interests should not be the driving force for public policy \ndecisions. Yet that is exactly what this trade agreement would allow. A \nlot of us had hopes that this trade agreement would be different, but \nin a lot of ways, it is the same as the bad agreements that have come \nbefore it, and in some ways, it is actually worse.\n  We are forfeiting valuable leverage across a huge area of the Asia \nPacific that we could have used to lift labor and environmental \nconditions and level the playing field for our workers. This is not a \nquestion of whether you are for trade or whether you believe we should \nbe engaged in the Pacific region, it is a question of how.\n  This deal is, unfortunately, a lowest common denominator agreement. \nFor these reasons, I must oppose the TPP.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                       The Republican-Led Senate\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I head home to Wyoming just about every \nweekend. Lots of people from Wyoming come here to Washington to visit \nas well. When I am home, I get a chance to talk to people, and here in \nWashington, I get to talk to people. So yesterday is a day I flew here. \nI had talked to folks in Wyoming early in the morning and then \nyesterday afternoon got off the plane, and there were a number of \nstudents here from Sheridan High School from ``We the People.'' One of \nour pages here is also from that high school. So you get to hear a lot \nfrom people. Some folks have been asking: What has the Republican \nCongress actually accomplished? So I would like to take a few minutes \nto talk a little bit about what the Senate has actually done this year \nand during this Congress since the Republicans have taken over the \nmajority.\n  We are not even 4 months into this year, and we have already had a \nvery productive year in the Senate. It is true. We have been active, we \nhave been effective, and it is only April.\n  In February, we passed legislation to add tough new sanctions against \nNorth Korea. As the Presiding Officer knows, the President in the White \nHouse was very reluctant when we started proposing these sanctions--\nhesitant about the sanctions that we proposed against North Korea. \nLet's face it. North Korea has been aggressively testing missiles, \ntesting nuclear weapons, and needs to be stopped.\n  When other countries threaten their neighbors, as North Korea has \ndone in their general geographic area, what happens is the United \nStates must stand up and stop them. President Obama has done far too \nlittle. I am very concerned about the aggression and the ambitions of \nNorth Korea. That is why the Senate had to act. So Congress has stood \nup and pushed against this action. We had more action against North \nKorea; that is exactly what we did.\n  The Senate also acted by passing a Defend Trade Secrets Act to help \nbusinesses protect their confidential information.\n  We passed a piece of legislation called the Comprehensive Addiction \nand Recovery Act, a bipartisan piece of legislation to help fight the \nmisuse of prescription drugs, in terms of prescription pain killers \ncalled opioids. Now, look, it has been a huge problem in our country--\ncommunities all around the country. Senator Ayotte from New Hampshire \nand Senator Portman of Ohio were two of the main sponsors of this \nlegislation. I know\n\n[[Page S2440]]\n\nSenator Portman was on the floor recently, talking about different \nlegislation. But he has shown heroic leadership in an area that \ncertainly needed to be addressed.\n  The Senate worked and reauthorized the Older Americans Act. This was \nanother bipartisan piece of legislation. It works to help provide \nsenior citizens with things like meals, transportation--ways to help \npeople live in their own homes longer and ways to help in terms of \ntheir quality of life, which is very important for Americans all across \nthe country.\n  We passed legislation to overhaul and reauthorize the Federal \nAviation Administration. This is a significant accomplishment. This \nlegislation promotes U.S. aerospace jobs by cutting through some of the \nredtape that has been hurting airplane designers.\n  Then, just last week, we passed a comprehensive overhaul of American \nenergy policy, something we had not done in about 8 years. Over the \npast few years, hard-working Americans have made this country into an \nenergy superpower. Yet we had not passed any kind of major energy \nlegislation for about 8 years because Washington's regulations have \nsimply not kept pace, and they have actually worked against the energy \nproducers, people that are getting back to work, getting this country's \neconomy returned.\n  The legislation we passed is going to rein in some of this needless, \nwasteful bureaucracy that the Federal Government has imposed on the \npeople creating energy jobs and working to produce more energy because \nenergy is called a master resource for a reason. We have it in great \nabundance.\n  One of the very important parts was language to expedite the shipment \nof America's natural gas to buyers around the world. It is good for our \neconomy, and it is good for our allies who will be able to decrease \ntheir dependence on Russian gas.\n  Senator Lisa Murkowski from Alaska did an outstanding job of making \nsure that this legislation had ideas from both sides of the aisle. That \nis a big part of why this piece of major energy legislation--first time \nin 8 years--passed 85 to 12--85 to 12. That is another big \naccomplishment of the Senate this year that does not get enough \nattention. It is not just that we are passing important legislation \nthat helps Americans, but we are doing it in a bipartisan way that \nallows every Senator--every Member of this body--to represent the \npeople back home with their ideas and their suggestions.\n  We have voted on 129 amendments so far this year--129 amendments \nvoted on this year. When the Democrats under Harry Reid were in \ncontrol, a lot of people around here got used to the idea that people \ndid not actually get to vote on amendments. In 2014, the last year \nunder Democratic control under Harry Reid, the Senate had only 15 up-\nor-down votes on amendments all year--full calendar year 2014.\n  When Republicans took the majority, we changed that. The Senate has \nbeen working this year just as we worked last year. We could have done \na lot more if a few Democrats had not blocked progress on some very \nimportant pieces of legislation. The people in Wyoming now know that \nthere are some important things they really care about, and they were \nactually blocked by President Obama. In January, the President vetoed \nlegislation that we had passed to improve health care in this country \nby repealing major parts of ObamaCare.\n\n  Remember, the President said to Democrats that they should forcefully \ndefend and be proud of that health care law, but one out of four \nAmericans--25 percent of Americans--say they have been personally \nharmed by the President's health care law. So we put it on his desk to \ndo a repeal, and he vetoed that.\n  Now, only about one in eight people in this country say they have \nbeen helped by the health care law. When you take a look at major \nlegislation that impacts the country, it is no surprise that this \nhealth care law continues to be very unpopular, especially when you see \nthat for every one person who says they have been helped, there are \nalmost two people who said they have personally been hurt by the law.\n  The President also vetoed legislation that we passed here to bring \nsome sanity to something called the waters of the United States rule--\nagain, a rule put out in regulation by the President, a \nreinterpretation of the law. The law is very clear to me, but the \nPresident had his own approach. We put a bill on his desk to overturn \nwhat he has tried to do. The courts have actually stopped him in his \ntracks, but he once again vetoed our efforts.\n  Last year the President actually vetoed five different bills passed \nby Congress. This kind of obstructionism from President Obama doesn't \nhelp our country move forward. It is not helpful when the Democratic \nleaders do everything they can to convince people that nothing is being \ndone in the Senate, but we hear that day after day from Minority Leader \nHarry Reid.\n  It is interesting, because when Senator Reid was the majority leader, \nhe had a very firm strategy, and the strategy seemed to be to do as \nlittle as possible.\n  Well, he is now the minority leader, and I think he went from the \nmajority to the minority for a reason. It seems to me that he is still \nhanging on, clinging on to that losing strategy. The plan didn't work \nthen, and I think that one of the reasons that he continues to try to \ntalk down and slow down some of our progress is because, actually, he \nis envious--envious of anyone who gets things done in the Senate.\n  Republicans in the Senate are not interested in working at Harry \nReid's pace and neither are the Democrats--many of the Democrats. Most \nSenators agree that we have a lot of work to do and that it is good for \nAmerica when we actually do the work.\n  That is why we have been working our way through the appropriations \nbills. This year we got the earliest start ever to appropriations \nbills--and really in the history of the modern budget process. So we \ncontinue to work on that.\n  I wish to be clear on one important point. Doing our job in the \nSenate doesn't mean setting aside the priorities of the American people \njust to help President Obama build a political legacy. That is why the \nSenate is going to stand firm and strong to give Americans a voice in \nwho gets to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. Now President Obama \nwants us to set aside everything else and let him appoint his Justice \nto the Supreme Court. It is not going to happen.\n  We do our job every day, doing the things that will make an immediate \ndifference to the families all across the country, things that \nRepublicans and Democrats agree on and that everybody knows we should \nbe doing. That is what you are seeing with this Republican-run Senate. \nThat is what the people want us to do. That is what they expect us to \ndo, and that is what we will continue to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, today is the 135th time I have come to \ngive voice to the issue that I feel will most significantly define this \ngeneration of leadership in the United States and, frankly, around the \nglobe.\n  I know that there are many people in Washington who would prefer to \nignore what our carbon emissions are doing to our oceans and to our \nclimate, but we disregard nature's warnings at our peril.\n  The changes to our environment, fueled by our carbon pollution, are \nfar-reaching--from the coastlines to the prairies, from mountain tops \nto deep oceans, from pole to pole. As a terrestrial species, we \nnaturally pay more attention to what is happening on land, such as \nincreasing average global temperatures and upheavals in extreme \nweather. We don't so much see what is happening in our oceans.\n  Every year we emit into the Earth's thin atmosphere tens of gigatons \nof carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels--nearly 36 gigatons of \ncarbon dioxide in 2014. Not all of that carbon dioxide stays in the \natmosphere. Our oceans--the Earth's oceans--absorb approximately one-\nthird of all our carbon pollution. That means they have absorbed \nroughly 600 gigatons in our industrial era.\n  For the record, a gigaton is a billion tons--not a thousand tons, not \na million tons, but a billion tons--and 600\n\n[[Page S2441]]\n\nbillion tons of carbon dioxide have gone into our oceans. We know what \nthat does. All that carbon dioxide in the oceans changes the ocean's \nvery chemistry, and it makes ocean water more acidic. The chemical \nreaction, carbon dioxide reacting with water to form carbonic acid, is \nsimple. You can replicate it in a middle school science lab, but its \neffects in the oceans are profound.\n  According to research published in the journal Nature Geoscience, the \nrate of change in ocean acidity is already faster than at any time in \nthe past 50 million years on Earth. We are rapidly spiraling into \nunknown territory. By way of context, the human species has been around \non Earth for about 200,000 years. The human species started farming and \nherding, went from hunting and gathering to the basics of socialized \nhuman life less than 20,000 years ago. We are doing something to our \nplanet now that has no precedent for 50 million years.\n  This line shows the increasing CO2 in the atmosphere in \nparts per million. This line shows the absorption of the CO2 \nby the ocean, and this line shows the pH change in the oceans as a \nresult. I would point out that pH is actually measured on a logarithmic \nscale. So if you were to adjust this to the standard percentage-type \ndisplay of information, you would see this falling much more steeply. \nThis is a very conservative way of showing what is happening to our \noceans. The logarithmic scale is a multiple, not just a steady line. So \nas you move down the pH numbers, you are actually creating much more \nmassive effects in the ocean.\n  People have measured this drop in ocean pH from climate change. This \nis not a theory. You can go out and measure it with equipment that is \nnot very different, again, from what a middle school with an aquarium \nwould use to measure pH in the aquarium.\n  People measure something else in our oceans also. They measure the \nrise in ocean temperature. For decades, the oceans have absorbed over \n90 percent of the excess heat trapped in the atmosphere by greenhouse \ngas emissions. The heat that comes in, that gets trapped in our thin \natmosphere when the Sun's warmth gets trapped by these greenhouse \ngasses, lands in a variety of places. The Antarctic ice sheet gets two-\ntenths of a percent of the heat. The Greenland ice sheet gets two-\ntenths of a percent of the heat. Arctic sea ice gets eight-tenths of a \npercent of the heat. Glaciers and icecaps take up nine-tenths of a \npercent of the heat. All of our continents together, the land mass of \nthe Earth, take up 2.1 percent of the added heat from climate change.\n  The atmosphere, that thin membrane that allows us to live and breathe \non this planet, has taken up 2.3 percent of the heat. All the rest of \nit, 93 percent, has been taken up by the oceans. They are our \nrefrigerant. They are our cooler. They are the air conditioner for the \nplanet. But when you take up that much, things begin to change, and \nocean heat is ramping up.\n  A study published in the journal Nature Climate Change found that in \nthe last 20 years--actually, less than 20, from 1997 to now, to be \nexact--the oceans absorbed the same amount of heat energy just in that \n20-year period as they had in the previous 130 years. That is a \ndramatic increase in heat uptake by the oceans. It is our human \nactivity, specifically our unfettered burning of fossil fuels, that has \nmade our oceans both warmer overall and more acidic.\n  One result of this is the calamity now taking place in the world's \ncoral reefs. A healthy coral reef is one of the most productive and \ndiverse ecosystems on Earth. It is an engine for the propagation of \nlife. Coral depends on a symbiotic relationship with tiny, \nphotosynthetic algae called zooxanthellae. They live in the surface \ntissue of the coral. Within a limited range of temperature, pH, \nsalinity, and water clarity, this symbiosis can thrive, and it gives us \nreefs all over the world--these engines of life in the ocean. Living \ncoral has evolved for millions of years to maintain its symbiosis \nwithin that range. We are now measurably--not theoretically but \nmeasurably--altering the ocean in ways too fast for coral to adapt.\n  Push corals out of their comfort range for very long, and the corals \nget stressed and they evict their algae. This process is what is known \nas coral bleaching. Because corals get most of their food out of that \nsymbiotic relationship with these algae, if the algae can't be \nreabsorbed quickly, the corals die. Coral bleaching sounds benign, but \nit is like cardiac arrest for a reef. There is a good chance it dies \nand, even if it doesn't, it is a long recovery. We are currently in the \nmiddle of a massive bleaching of the world's coral reefs--cardiac \narrest at a global scale.\n  Dr. Mark Eakin of NOAA's Coral Reef Watch Program says of this coral \ncataclysm: ``It very well may be the worst period of coral bleaching we \nhave seen.'' And when he says ``we have seen,'' he means that which we \nhave ever seen in the human record.\n  Worldwide, coral has already declined by approximately 40 percent. \nCloser to home, across the Caribbean and the Florida Keys, two key \ncoral species have declined by an astonishing 98 percent in the last \nfour decades.\n  In my lifetime, I have seen once-radiant underwater ecosystems \nteeming with life become barren fields of white skeletons reaching into \nan empty ocean. One of my climate trips took me down to Monroe County, \nFL, where I met Mayor Sylvia Murphy, the Republican mayor of Monroe \nCounty, home to the famous Florida Keys. I asked her how the reefs were \noff the Keys. ``Beautiful,'' she said, ``unless you were here 15 years \nago.''\n  Australia's Great Barrier Reef is the largest coral ecosystem on \nEarth. It is one of the seven wonders of the natural world. Severe \nbleaching is now hitting ``between 60 and 100 percent of corals'' on \nthe Great Barrier Reef, according to Dr. Terry Hughes of James Cook \nUniversity in Queensland, Australia.\n  Professor Hughes tweeted out a map of the current devastation, \nwriting in the text: ``I showed the results of aerial survey of \nbleaching on the Great Barrier Reef to my students, and then we wept.''\n  As with many other effects of climate change, it can be difficult to \nconvey the magnitude of events when they aren't taking place in front \nof our terrestrial human faces. In his 2010 TED talk, one of the great \nmarine scientists we have, leading coral ecologist Dr. Jeremy Jackson, \ntried to bring this coral bleaching calamity a little closer to home. \nHe put it like this:\n\n       Imagine you go camping in July somewhere in Europe or North \n     America, and you wake up the next morning, and you look \n     around you, and you see that 80 percent of the trees, as far \n     as you can see, have dropped their leaves and are standing \n     there naked. And you come home, and you discover that 80 \n     percent of all the trees in North America and in Europe have \n     dropped their leaves.\n\n  Remember, this is his example from July.\n\n       And then you read in the paper a few weeks later, ``Oh, by \n     the way, a quarter of those trees died.'' Well, that's what \n     happened in the Indian Ocean during the 1998 El Nino, an area \n     vastly greater than the size of North America and Europe, \n     when 80 percent of all the corals bleached and a quarter of \n     them died.\n\n  Jeremy came to speak to our caucus recently. He told us that every \nocean ecosystem he studied in his career is gone, as he first found it, \nchanged dramatically from his first visit.\n  Coral reefs are one of the first places that truly irreversible \neffects of climate change seem to be manifesting themselves--the \nproverbial canary dying in the coal mine of our carbon-ridden planet. \nTo say the ocean we knew in our childhood is already gone is not \ndoomsaying or pessimism, it is a grimly realistic assessment of where \nwe stand, sadly.\n  In the Senate, there will likely be snickering about this. Some will \nsay: Who gives a damn about coral reefs? If it can't be monetized by a \ncorporation, the hell with it, is too often our motto here. Well, God \nmade these glories. God made them on our planet. In some cases, they \nhave been growing for tens of thousands of years. We are wrecking them \nin a single generation, and if that doesn't mean something to us, a \nlong look in the mirror might be in order.\n  Even those who can only see this tragedy through their monetizer \ngoggles ought to know that a decline in healthy coral reefs is a huge \nblow to us all. According to an article last month in The Atlantic, \ncoral reefs are home to 25 percent of the world's fish biodiversity. \nReefs are incubators for ocean life, support systems for fisheries we \ndepend on, tourist attractions for divers and snorkelers who fill local \ncommunities with their visiting and\n\n[[Page S2442]]\n\ntheir spending, and they are coastal protection for coastal \ninfrastructure and homes against storm waves. It is not nice to fool \nwith Mother Nature. As Pope Francis warned, ``God always forgives; \nmankind sometimes forgives; nature never forgives. You slap her and she \nwill slap you back.'' As he says, we are sinning with our actions \nagainst nature, and nature will not forget.\n  We just don't have that right. We are making a mark on the Earth in \nthis generation that will not go away. If mankind lasts 10,000 years, \nwell, 10,000 years from now they will see and know the mark of this \ngeneration on our planet, and they will justly inquire: How could we \nhave been such fools? How could we, in this generation, have been such \ngreedy, reckless, self-infatuated fools?\n  In 1954, the United States detonated a hydrogen bomb over the Bikini \nAtoll in the Marshall Islands. The explosion vaporized everything on \nthree islands, raised water temperatures to as much as 55,000 degrees, \nand left a crater over a mile wide and 240 feet deep. More than 60 \nyears have gone by and scientists observe the corals in this part of \nthe Pacific flourishing again. If you give it a chance, life finds a \nway.\n  Dr. Zoe Richards, one of the scientists involved in the study, said: \n``The healthy condition of the coral at Bikini Atoll today is proof of \ntheir resilience and ability to bounce back from massive disturbances, \nthat is, if the reef is left undisturbed and there are healthy nearby \nreefs to source the recovery.''\n  So that is the caveat. Reefs can recover but not if we continue to \nstack the deck oceanwide against them by pumping so much heat and \ncarbon pollution into the oceans.\n  Senator Schatz of Hawaii--not coincidently another ocean State--\nintroduced, along with me, the American Opportunity Carbon Fee Act last \nyear to address climate change with a market-based solution built on \nprinciples espoused by leading Republican economists. We went to \nRepublicans--former Cabinet officials, former Members of Congress, \neconomists, think tanks--and we said: How should we do this? If you \ndon't like the President's plan, if you don't like the regulatory way, \nwhat is your way? Virtually every single person on the Republican side \nwho has thought this problem through to a solution has come to the same \nplace, a revenue-neutral carbon fee with an appropriate border \nadjustment. So that is what we wrote. When you are ready, we are here. \nWe did it your way.\n  As a Senator, John F. Kennedy once said:\n\n       Let us not despair but act. Let us not seek the Republican \n     answer or the Democratic answer but the right answer. Let us \n     not seek to fix the blame for the past--let us accept our own \n     responsibility for the future.\n\n  This is particularly true for our oceans. As one Florida mayor put \nit: ``The ocean is not Republican, and it's not Democratic . . . it's a \nnonpartisan ocean,'' and that nonpartisan ocean is screaming warnings \nat us that we ought to heed in nonpartisan fashion.\n  We have a clear scientific understanding of the problem, and we have \na moral obligation to act. Time is not on our side. We need to pay \nattention to the evidence. We need to accept the reality of our \npredicament as it is communicated to us by the laws and signs of \nnature--God's signals to us on this Earth.\n  That is what healthy coral looks like under the water. Here it is \nbleached out and dying. It is our ocean. It is our responsibility. I \nurge this body to wake up and lead.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Tribute to Dr. Emily Lembeck\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate to do \nsomething I periodically like to do when a citizen of my State deserves \nrecognition for the contributions they have made to my State and the \ncitizens of my State. Today is such a day.\n  Dr. Emily Lembeck is the superintendent of the Marietta City Public \nSchool System. Recently, she was inducted into the Hall of Fame for \nEducation, and her palm print is embedded in the walk around Glover \nPark Square in Marietta, GA.\n  I am close to Emily in more ways than one. When I chaired the State \nboard of education in 1996, she was an elementary school principal at \nDunleith Elementary in Marietta, GA. She had been at West Side, she \nmoved on to Marietta Middle School, and later became superintendent of \nthe Marietta Public Schools--8,900 students, 1,200 employees--a \nchallenge but a wonderful community.\n  Throughout her career, she has gifted more to children in our \ncommunity than any person I know of. In particular, she has taught \nthose who didn't know how to read to read. She has made reading a \npassion in our community. She has made children's ability to read and \ncomprehend and understand and move forward in life a reality, in a \nplace where at one time it was no reality at all.\n  In fact, let me tell you, when I was chairman of the State board of \neducation we were working hard to make Reading First a movement in this \ncountry. She came forward with this idea about adopting something \ncalled Marietta Reads. It was a very simple program but a program where \nleaders in the community, such as I, would come to elementary schools \nin Marietta, GA, sit down ``Indian style'' on the floor with first \ngraders and teach them to read, read with them, and help them identify \nwith the joy of reading and the understanding of reading. From that \nday, I gained a greater appreciation for the challenge every teacher \nfaces as they teach our children in classrooms.\n  Emily Lembeck has been awarded almost every award you can possibly \nget, from the chamber of commerce to the Kiwanis Club, to the Rotary. \nShe has received the Living the Dream Award from the NAACP during King \nWeek a few years ago, she received the Whitney M. Young Jr. Service \nAward from the Boy Scouts for her leadership.\n  Time and again, Emily Lembeck has been represented to be the great \nperson she is--a leader in education, a leader of children, somebody \nour community is proud of. So on this day in Washington, DC, on the \nfloor of the Senate, I want the name of Emily Lembeck to ring from one \ncorner to the other for all she has contributed and all she has done to \nmake our community a better, more wholesome, and more meaningful \ncommunity, and for what she has done to make the lives of our \ncommunity's children just a little bit better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Indian Health Service\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, for years now, patients on Indian \nreservations in the Great Plains area have been receiving substandard \nmedical care.\n  The most recent example of the Indian Health Service's failure \noccurred in December of 2015, when I was notified that two federally \noperated Indian Health Service facilities in my State were at risk of \nlosing their Medicare provider agreements. In other words, these two \nfacilities have been delivering such a poor level of care, the \ngovernment isn't sure it is willing to continue paying these facilities \nto care for Medicare patients.\n  In February, at the request of several Senators, myself included, the \nSenate Committee on Indian Affairs held a hearing to address the state \nof patient care at the Indian Health Service in the Great Plains area. \nThanks to the graciousness of our colleague from Wyoming, Senator \nBarrasso, who chairs the Indian Affairs Committee, I was able to \nparticipate in this hearing and question several Indian Health Service \nofficials. I wish I could report that this hearing reassured me that \nthe Indian Health Service is on track to solve the problems facing \npatients on the reservations, but it just left me more concerned. The \nhearing underscored the government's massive failure on this issue: its \nfailure to deliver quality care, its failure to ensure patient safety, \nand its failure to live up to treaty responsibilities.\n\n[[Page S2443]]\n\n  I have read the reports from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices, and some of the stories really are beyond comprehension. \nIncredibly, a report of dirty, unsanitized medical equipment left \nexposed in an emergency room isn't even the most shocking of those \nstories.\n  One patient who had suffered a severe head injury was discharged from \nthe hospital mere hours after checking in, only to be called back later \nthe same day when his test results arrived. The patient's condition was \nso serious that he was immediately flown to another facility for care.\n  One health service facility was in such disarray that a pregnant \nmother gave birth on a bathroom floor--a bathroom floor--without a \nsingle medical professional nearby, which shockingly wasn't the first \ntime this had happened at this facility.\n  I wish I were able to stand here today and report that conditions are \ngetting better. Unfortunately, I cannot. Since February's hearing, we \nhave been made aware of another tragic event that occurred at Pine \nRidge Hospital. Reports from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices indicate that a 23-year-old patient complaining of nausea and \ncramping in his hands and lower extremities died from cardiac arrest 2 \nhours after he was discharged from the emergency department. An \ninvestigation conducted by CMS verified that this young man failed to \nreceive an adequate medical screening evaluation before his discharge. \nEven worse, the report indicated that there was no documentation \nshowing nurse and doctor communication.\n  It hasn't helped that Congress's attempts to address these problems \nhave been hampered by less-than-honest reporting from the Indian Health \nService. Time and again, we have found that conditions on the ground \nhave not matched up to information reported to Congress.\n  In 2014, I requested a status update from the then-Acting Director of \nthe Indian Health Service. In her response, she stated that ``the Great \nPlains Area has shown marked improvement in all categories'' and that \n``significant improvements in health care delivery and program \naccountability have also been demonstrated.''\n  Significant improvements? Sending a man home with bleeding in his \nbrain and having a mother give birth prematurely on a bathroom floor \nare not signs of significant improvements.\n  On December 4, 2015, officials from the Indian Health Service stated \nthat a majority of the concerns at Rosebud Hospital had been addressed \nor abated. Yet, mere hours later, I was informed that the Rosebud \nHospital emergency department was functioning so poorly that emergency \npatients would be diverted to other hospitals beginning the next day. \nIt has now been 143 days, and the Indian Health Service leadership has \nbeen unable to reopen the Rosebud Hospital's emergency department.\n  For the last 143 days, incoming emergency patients have had to travel \nbetween 44 and 55 miles to receive care. That is similar to requiring a \nresident of Harpers Ferry, WV, to travel to Washington, DC, to receive \nemergency services. And to date, the Indian Health Service has been \nunable to tell us when it anticipates emergency department services \nwill resume.\n  The Rosebud Sioux Tribe informs me that since this emergency \ndepartment has been on diverted status, six individuals have lost their \nlives in ambulances while being transported to a hospital farther away. \nSix families are now left to wonder whether their loved ones could have \nbeen saved if the Indian Health Service had been doing its job. This is \nunconscionable.\n  The Indian Health Service has one last chance this Friday to reach an \nagreement with CMS to set the Rosebud Hospital back on a path to \ncompliance with basic safety and administrative requirements. If the \nIndian Health Service fails to do so, Rosebud will lose its status as a \nMedicare provider.\n  Additionally, the Indian Health Service has until Friday to address \nEmergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act violations found at \nPine Ridge Hospital.\n  The administration has drafted report after report promising to \ncorrect these issues, yet time and again it has failed to follow \nthrough. During the recent Indian Affairs Committee hearing, the former \nPrincipal Deputy Director of the Indian Health Service could not \nremember that he was in charge of implementing a 2011 report. Where is \nthe accountability? Who is in charge? We have got to do better.\n  Simply shifting staff between positions and offices, as the Indian \nHealth Service has done in response to these problems, is not enough. \nIt is time for action. We must do everything within our power--we will \ndo everything within our power--to hold the Indian Health Service \naccountable and to make sure this never happens again.\n  I continue to work with my colleagues in the Senate on a path forward \nto demand accountability from an agency that, by all accounts, is \ndisconnected and unresponsive to the needs of our Native Americans.\n  I will also continue to consult with the nine tribes in South Dakota. \nOur tribes are in the best position to help figure out the path forward \nfor their own health care, and I believe the Indian Health Service must \ndo a better job of consulting with our tribes when it comes to the care \nthey receive.\n  I am going to do everything I can within my power to get all of our \ntribal citizens the quality care they deserve.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Burr pertaining to the introduction of S. 2854 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BURR. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n               Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Bill\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I rise today to speak on behalf of the \none in three Ohioans who knows somebody who is struggling with \naddiction to heroin or prescription drugs.\n  I rise today on behalf of the over 5,000 Americans who have lost \ntheir lives to a prescription drug overdose since the Senate passed the \nComprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act back on March 10.\n  I rise today to talk about an epidemic which is affecting my home \nState of Ohio, which is affecting all our States, whichever it is, and \nwhich is affecting our country and must be dealt with.\n  This is the fourth time I have come to the floor of the Senate since \nwe passed CARA, which is the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, \nand I come to floor to talk about our legislation and to ask the House \nof Representatives to please pass that legislation, which would then go \nto the President for his signature and could begin to help in \ncommunities all across the country.\n  The legislation I am talking about is legislation that the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, now who is the Chair right now, the Presiding \nOfficer, has been involved with in a very deep way in her own State of \nNew Hampshire and also here on the Senate floor. I appreciate all the \nhard work she has put into this, and I know she agrees with me that it \nis time for the House to act.\n  We passed it on March 10. That means it has been 47 days since the \nSenate acted. About 120 Americans die every day of a drug overdose. It \nhas been 47 days. That means we have lost 5,600 Americans to drug \noverdoses since the Senate passed this bill.\n  By the way, it is not just about that tragic loss of life, it is \nabout so many people who may not have overdosed but have this addiction \nand are not taking care of their families, are not able to work and be \na productive citizen, are not achieving their God-given potential. It \nis about those who have overdosed but have been saved by this miracle \ndrug that police and firefighters and other first responders and \nsometimes family members now are administering called Narcan or \nnaloxone.\n  It means that since the Senate passed this bill, this epidemic is \ngetting worse, not better. That is based on\n\n[[Page S2444]]\n\nall of the information I get back home. Last week in Lebanon, OH--it is \na small town north of Cincinnati, OH, where my family has roots going \nback to the 1920s--in Lebanon, OH, a 34-year-old woman, who was engaged \nto be married, overdosed and died in front of her children, one aged 10 \nand one baby girl who was still learning to walk. By the way, that \nlittle girl's father has now been arrested. Within days of her mother's \naddiction--she has now lost both her mom and her father.\n  Last week, from Tuesday afternoon to Wednesday morning--Tuesday \nafternoon to Wednesday morning--six people died of overdoses in one \nsmall town called Elyria, OH. It is not a big city; there are about \n53,000 people in Elyria. We lost six people in 24 hours. That does not \ninclude the 14 people who were saved by this miracle drug I talked \nabout, Naloxone, that reverses the effects of an overdose.\n  That is what has been happening. That is happening on our streets, \nand in the case of my home town of Cincinnati, it is happening in our \nparking lots. At noontime on Sunday, in my hometown, a man overdosed in \nthe parking lot of the Museum Center in Cincinnati, OH. First \nresponders moved quickly and were able to save his life. But it is \nhappening in broad daylight, unfortunately, more and more frequently.\n  Since 2007 drug overdoses have killed more people in Ohio than car \naccidents, making it the No. 1 cause of accidental death. I am told \nthat nationally, now, it is the leading cause of accidental death in \nthe country. It is not car accidents, which we would might have \nassumed, it is overdoses. They have more than tripled in Ohio from 1999 \nto 2010.\n  We are told that 200,000 Ohioans are addicted to opioids--200,000 \npeople. That is the size of a major city like Akron, OH. That is \nsomething which should concern us all.\n  Last week there was a poll that showed that 3 in 10 Ohioans know \nsomeone who has abused prescription drugs, and 1 in 8 knows someone who \nhas overdosed. We are talking about more than 1.3 million Ohioans.\n  According to NIDA--the National Institute on Drug Abuse--the United \nStates, even though we make up about 5 percent of the world's \npopulation, consumes 75 percent of the prescriptions drugs, including \nthe vast majority of the world's prescription painkillers, the narcotic \npainkillers. They say four to five of the people who are heroin addicts \nstarted on prescription drugs.\n  We have heard more about this this week in the news, about the fact \nthat so many people get addicted to the opioid, which is the \nprescription drug. Sometimes it is actually prescribed to them; \nsometimes they obtain it illegally. They turn to heroin as a less \nexpensive alternative and then end up overdosing. The results are \ntragic.\n  If this is not an epidemic, I don't know what is. It is affecting \nevery area. It knows no ZIP Code. So when you think about drugs and \ndrug abuse and the effects of it, you might think inner city. That is \nnot so. It is everywhere--in the suburbs, in the rural areas. It knows \nno ZIP Code.\n  I mentioned that this legislation we worked on here for a few years \npassed the Senate. It was bicameral legislation, meaning it was the \nHouse and Senate working together for 3 years. We had five conferences \nhere in Washington. We brought in experts on the issues of prevention \nand education and treatment and recovery and how to deal with our \nveterans who are coming back, who have a high rate of addiction, how to \ndeal with women and their babies. In my home State of Ohio, we have had \na huge increase in the rate of babies being born addicted, and what do \nyou do about that?\n  We put together this legislation in a comprehensive manner to handle \nnot just one part or one sector but to be something that would deal \nwith the holistic approach so that we could actually get at this issue.\n  In the House, by the way, the identical legislation was introduced, \nand they now have over 120 cosponsors of that legislation in the House. \nYet they have not been able to move on that legislation. Instead, they \nare moving on other legislation to deal with the issue. That is good. I \nam sure there are a lot of other things that can and should be done. \nSome of what they are doing is consistent with CARA. But we know CARA \nworks. We know that if we can pass it, the President would sign it. We \nknow it would help immediately in our communities. So I again call on \nthe House to move quickly.\n  Last week a subcommittee in the House chaired by Joe Pitts marked up \none dozen bills that have to do with how we fight this epidemic. Joe \nPitts is a man who cares a lot about this issue. He has a passion for \nit. This week my friend and full committee chairman Fred Upton is going \nto mark up those 12 bills. The House has a lot of good ideas. That is \nfine. That is good.\n  I joined Congressman Bill Johnson of Marietta, OH, who has been a \npassionate advocate on this issue, to introduce something called the \nPreventing Abuse of Cough Medicine Act, which would restrict the sale \nof certain cough medicines that are frequently abused. That is good. It \nis a commonsense Ohio idea. I thank my friend and colleague for doing \nhis part to help our constituents. That should be passed in addition to \nCARA, along with other legislation.\n  I certainly respect my colleagues over there very much, as I said, \nbut let's just give CARA a vote, and then let's move on this other \nlegislation as well. It takes a while, as all of us are painfully \naware, to get something through the process around here. This one went \nthrough with a 94-to-1 vote. It is comprehensive. It was introduced in \nboth the House and the Senate. They have over 120 cosponsors. Let's \njust move that. Then, if there are other things to be dealt with, like \nthe one I talked about, we can work on those as well and find ways to \nwork together to find common ground. I will support that. I cannot \nspeak for all of my colleagues, but I can speak for all of them--with \nthe exception of one who voted the other way--to say that we will help \nget CARA to the President. In fact, it doesn't need to come back to the \nSenate if they pass the CARA legislation.\n\n  More and more Members in the House are focused on this issue. That is \ngood. Tomorrow, the House Judiciary Committee is also marking up \nlegislation in this area. So this is a separate committee--the Energy \nand Commerce Committee--and now the Judiciary Committee. They are going \nto mark up five related bills, including what they consider the \nalternative to CARA. It has some of the CARA provisions but not all of \nthem.\n  Let me tell you what the experts out there are saying. There are over \n120 groups who have endorsed our legislation, helped us to get our \nlegislation through.\n  Yesterday, the policy director of the Harm Reduction Coalition sent a \nletter to the Judiciary Committee saying that its alternative ``omits \nvital provisions in CARA addressing recovery, collateral consequences, \nprevention, and education. These omitted provisions represent critical \ncommunity priorities, which truly relate to the comprehensiveness of \nCARA's approach. CARA was developed through a thorough process of \nextensive consultation with dozens of stakeholders . . . and has \nsecured the broad support of national, state, and local addiction and \nrecovery, public health, and criminal justice organizations. . . . The \nversion of CARA passed by the Senate represents substantial consensus \namong both community stakeholders and bipartisan lawmakers.''\n  The House Judiciary's alternative to CARA does contain some of CARA's \nbest proposals. I appreciate that. But unfortunately it dropped out a \nnumber of really important ones as well. Some of the most important \nideas that are missing include provisions expanding drug takeback \nprograms. Again, we talked about this earlier. These prescription drugs \nare at the heart of this problem. These takeback programs get these \nprescription drugs off the bathroom shelf, allow us to pull these drugs \naway from our communities so that people are not using these drugs to \nget into more drugs, to get into heroin. That is not in there.\n  There is also a heroin law enforcement task force that was dropped \nout and a drug court for veterans called the veterans court. That is a \nvery important issue for all of us. The veterans' testimony we got made \nit clear to us that these courts are working. I have toured some of \nthese courts. I have had a chance to sit down at a roundtable \ndiscussion in Ohio with one of our\n\n[[Page S2445]]\n\ngreat veterans courts to talk to veterans whose lives have been \nentirely turned around by these veterans courts. After years and years \nof bouncing around in the prison system or at the VA, finally they get \ninto these drugs courts for veterans, where they are surrounded by \nother veterans and they are able to pull their lives together, to get \ntheir families back together, and in one case go back to school. There \nis one guy who is about to graduate from Ohio State University after \nyears and years of not being able to find a way to move forward.\n  Here is another one. Patty McCarthy Metcalf of Faces and Voices of \nRecovery wrote in a letter today that taking out the CARA recovery \nprovisions ``will prolong the crisis of addiction by not providing the \ncritical support in communities across our nation where it is most \nneeded. Recovery services provided by recovery community organizations, \nincluding recovery coaching and emergency rooms and drug courts and \nrecovery education and awareness, are desperately needed and highly \neffective in getting people with addiction on a long-term path to \nrecovery.''\n  What does she mean by all that? She means that these recovery coaches \nand the services that are supported by the CARA bill help people who \nmight go, as she said, to an emergency room because they have an \noverdose to be confronted by somebody who says: Look, we can help you \nget better. You don't have to do this again. You don't have to overdose \nagain. You don't have to go through this near-death experience. We can \nget you into a program where you can get treatment and recovery.\n  Someone has to provide the resources for those coaches. We want those \ncoaches. All of us as citizens should want them. We don't want people \nto keep overdosing again and again. We want to break that cycle. That \nis what our legislation would do.\n  Patty makes the critical point that our response has to be \ncomprehensive. I think she is right. She says:\n\n       Prevention, treatment and enforcement cannot solve the \n     opiate problem without recovery supports. National experts on \n     addiction, and millions of people in recovery, will agree \n     that a comprehensive approach is critical.\n\n  That is what we do. CARA is comprehensive. There are 71 recovery \ngroups, including the Ohio State University Collegiate Recovery \nCommunity, which sent a letter to the House Judiciary Committee and the \nEducation and Workforce Committee today expressing concern that two \nsections of CARA which expand recovery supports for students in high \nschool and in college were dropped out. These are amazing programs. I \nam so impressed with these brave young men and women who stand up and \nsay: I have a problem. I have an addition. For other students at this \nhigh school or at this college, who, like me, have this addiction, have \nthis disease, I want to help you. We should work together and come \ntogether in support groups.\n  There did not use to be any of these hardly, as far as I know. Now \nthere are a number of them. Ohio State University is one of the places \nthat took the lead in this. I am so proud of those students who stood \nup and said: Despite the stigma around this, I am going to stand up and \nsay that I have this problem, and I know many of you do too. If you do, \ncome, and we can work together to work through this problem.\n  Again, what they say is, ``We support a comprehensive approach to \naddressing this epidemic, which must include providing recovery \nsupports that enable individuals to enter and sustain their recovery.'' \nAgain, CARA is comprehensive. No other bill comes close.\n  As this process moves forward, I hope we will insist that any final \nagreement represents a comprehensive approach because this epidemic has \nto be combated from all angles. The approach we took to writing CARA \nwas to say we are going to take the best ideas regardless of where they \ncome from. We don't care who brings them. We just care what the idea \nmeans to help address this problem.\n  We had ideas from Democrats. We had ideas from Republicans. We had \nideas from House Members, from Senators, from experts in law \nenforcement, and from patients in recovery. We didn't ask who had the \nidea, we asked if it was a good idea. That is how you cobble together \ngood legislation that makes a difference in our communities.\n  On Friday I was in Ohio chairing a hearing of the Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs Committee. It was at University Hospitals of \nCleveland, OH. We heard from law enforcement experts such as the \nattorney general, Mike DeWine, and the acting U.S. attorney, Carole \nRendon. She was great, as was Senator DeWine. Law enforcement, \nincluding the Fraternal Order of Police, has been strongly supportive \nof CARA because they believe this comprehensive approach works.\n  We also provide training for the administering of this naloxone we \ntalked about, the Narcan, and being sure that law enforcement has what \nthey need to be able to help combat this issue. We also create these \nlaw enforcement task forces to combat heroin and methamphetamines. They \nwant better tools, law enforcement does, so they can save lives. We owe \nthem that.\n  In Ohio I am that our first responders have used naloxone more than \n16,000 times in the last year alone. Thank God for those first \nresponders because they have saved thousands and thousands of lives.\n  On Friday we also heard from Tracy Plouck from the Ohio Department of \nMental Health and Addiction Services. We heard from Dr. Nancy Young of \nChildren and Family Futures and Dr. Margaret Kotz, who is the director \nof Addiction Recovery Services at University Hospitals in Cleveland, \none of the experts we have relied on. They talked about the recovery \nprocess.\n  Their point was that probably 9 out of 10 people who need treatment \nare not getting it. That is a clear sign the status quo is not working. \nSome of it is the stigma we talked about earlier, people are not coming \nforward. Some of it is not having treatment programs that are \naccessible. We heard about waiting lists, sometimes 3 or 4 days, \nsometimes 14 days, sometimes a couple of months--and people being at \nthat point in their lives where they are willing to come forward and \nsay: I need to solve this problem. Yet there is a waiting list.\n  Last night I had a tele-townhall meeting. We had 25,000 Ohioans on at \nany one time. It was a big group. People were talking about all kinds \nof issues, from the terrorist threat we face to energy and environment \nissues, to the jobs issue.\n  One guy called in and he asked: What are you doing about treatment \nfor people who have drug problems?\n  So I told him about the CARA legislation and he seemed to have a \nquiver in his voice.\n  I asked him: You seem to have a lot of interest in this and some \ninformation about it. Can you tell us your background?\n  I thought perhaps he was a doctor or a treatment specialist.\n  Unfortunately, he said what you hear more and more from parents, \nwhich is: I lost my child to addiction. She had an overdose. She died. \nAnd the reason I am so focused on treatment, Senator Portman, is \nbecause we got her to the place in her life where she was willing to \ngo, finally, to a treatment center and get the treatment and recovery \nservices she needed to deal with this disease that had gripped her--and \nthere was no room at the inn. There was a waiting list. We couldn't get \nher in, and it was during that period that we couldn't get her into the \ntreatment center that would have helped her that she overdosed.\n  This is a caller from last night who--on a call--was willing to say \nthis in front of 25,000 people. I told him I appreciated the fact that \nhe had the courage to call in and the courage to talk about it. Of \ncourse, I expressed my sympathy to him and his family but asked him to \ncontinue talking about it, to channel that grief into something \npositive.\n  Until we get more people into treatment, this is going to continue to \nbe a huge problem in every one of our communities. Until we change the \nlaw, until we get legislation passed in Washington so we can be better \npartners, we are not going to be doing our part. Will Washington solve \nthis problem? No. This problem is going to be solved in our \ncommunities, it is going to be solved in our families, and it is going \nto be solved in our hearts. We have to get people to pull away from \nthis, to understand the dangers, better prevention and education.\n  In our legislation, we have a prevention program to build awareness \nabout the connection with prescription drugs and heroin. I bet most \npeople listening\n\n[[Page S2446]]\n\nright now didn't know about that connection, a lot of people don't. Why \nwould you, if you hadn't faced this issue? That awareness alone is \ngoing to make people make better decisions for themselves, for their \nchildren.\n  Friday in Cleveland we had a man testify whose son died of an \noverdose. Do you know why? Because he had his molars--his wisdom \nteeth--taken out. When he had his wisdom teeth taken out, what \nhappened?\n  You know where I am going.\n  They gave his son, a kid, Percocet--a narcotic, a painkiller. The \nrest of the story you know, which is he started taking more of those \nand more of those. Then he took some from the bathroom shelf of one of \nhis relatives. He developed this addiction and eventually turned to \nheroin and overdosed.\n  Now his father, God bless him, is out there talking to high \nschoolers, talking to middle schoolers, talking to young people about \nthe dangers.\n  We can address this issue. We know we can. There has been success \nwith other awareness programs. Think of smoking and teen smoking. We \nhave made great progress there. We have to make progress on this one. \nThis is about life and death.\n\n  We heard testimony on Friday from Dr. Michele Walsh, the director of \nneonatology at University Hospitals. She talked about how she is \nincreasingly seeing babies who are born with what is called neonatal \nabstinence syndrome. That is a fancy way of saying these poor babies \nare born with an addiction. She said the symptoms are the same you \nwould see with an adult. It is the fidgeting. It is the sweats.\n  These are little babies. I have gone to these neonatal units, and I \nknow some of my colleagues have. You see these babies. They are so \nsmall they can fit in the palm of your hand, and they are addicted. You \nhave these doctors and nurses with incredible passion, such as Dr. \nMichele Walsh, who are taking care of them. In my home State of Ohio we \nhave had a 750-percent increase in the last 12 years with babies born \nwith neonatal abstinence syndrome--a 750-percent increase. Every single \nneonatal unit in Ohio is facing this.\n  I have been to Rainbow Babies & Children's in Cleveland, which is at \nthis hospital. I have seen what they do. I have been to St. Rita's \nspecial care nursery in Lima, OH. I have been to Children's Hospital in \nmy own hometown. They are doing great work, but wouldn't it be great if \nwe didn't have to deal with this issue because we had better prevention \nand education to let mothers know what the danger is when they are \npregnant and they could have better treatment and recovery to get those \nwomen out of this grip of addiction so their babies can be born without \nthese issues.\n  Frankly, the long-term effects we talked about at our hearing, \ntalking to experts and doctors, I don't think people know what the \nlong-term effects are--and of course that is scary. They basically take \nthese babies through withdrawal. We have to provide babies with the \nmedication at a lower level--but that you would provide an adult--to \ntake them through the withdrawal process.\n  CARA, the legislation we are talking about, would help these women. \nIt would help these babies by expanding treatment for expectant and \npostpartum women as well as awarding grants to evidence-based treatment \nservices and residential treatment programs for pregnant women who are \nstruggling with addiction. It would create a pilot program to provide \nfamily-based services to women who are addicted to opiates in a \nnonresidential outpatient setting. It is what we learn from experts--\nhow to help address this problem--that is in this legislation.\n  I know there are other ideas out there, and that is great, but \nstripping out some of CARA's core provisions just didn't make any sense \nto me. Let's keep it comprehensive. Let's be sure and get this \nlegislation done and then work on additional legislation.\n  The House could simply put CARA on the suspension calendar and have a \nvote on it. That is the calendar where you have to have a two-thirds \nvote, but something like this with all the cosponsors and all the \ninterest in this issues now, I think it would pass. That means we are \none vote away of getting this help to our communities.\n  That is how close we are to a historic achievement to help begin to \nturn the tide, to make the Federal Government a better partner with our \nStates, our local communities. Our great nonprofits are out there in \nthe trenches doing the work and our families. There is no reason it \ncouldn't happen today, tomorrow, or the next day before we go into \nanother congressional recess.\n  After 3 years of work, it doesn't make sense to start from scratch \nand try to rewrite this. Let's work together to come up with additional \nideas that are course appropriate. Nobody has a monopoly on good ideas \naround here.\n  Believe me, I know some of these House Members. They have the right \nintentions. They are trying to help. I appreciate that, but I also \nthink we all need to appreciate the fact that this is a crisis. We are \nlosing more and more Americans, 5,600 since CARA was passed in the \nSenate. Roughly every 12 minutes we lose someone else. People's lives \nare on the line. Communities are being impacted. Families are being \ntorn apart. It is time for us to act and act quickly.\n  I appreciate the time today. I urge the House to move quickly on this \nlegislation so we can begin to help our communities in need.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          ``El Faro'' Tragedy\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I come to the floor today to discuss, \nfirst of all, the successful location of the El Faro voyage data \nrecorder by the NTSB. As you all recall, that was the ship that had \nsailed from Jacksonville and was lost at sea and everyone perished. \nToday, the NTSB found the data recorder.\n  The U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Navy, and other search partners were \nalso involved. That gives me hope that we will soon have more answers \nabout this terrible disaster and how to prevent a similar one from \nhappening again. So I want to thank the men and women of the \ninvestigative team who worked together to find this important piece of \nthe El Faro puzzle.\n  Today we are also reminded of those who were lost on the El Faro and \nthe loved ones they left behind. They remain in our thoughts and \nprayers.\n\n\n                               Zika Virus\n\n  Madam President, on a different topic, I wanted to come to the floor \ntoday and talk again about the Zika virus. Once again there was an \nannouncement that there had been additional cases identified in \nFlorida.\n  Just to recap where we stand now, Zika has now spread to over 43 \ncountries. There are 500 cases in U.S. territories, most of them on the \nIsland of Puerto Rico. In my home State of Florida, there are now 93 \ncases--the most of any State--and the peak mosquito season is directly \nahead.\n  A lot has happened regarding Zika. We have learned more and more \nabout this disease. For example, we are now learning the virus has a \ndirect link to Guillain-Barre syndrome, a very debilitating, often \nfatal, illness, and it is striking people affected with it. We are \nlearning through recent science that it is not just the first trimester \nof pregnancy but also potentially in the second trimester that unborn \nchildren can be impacted by this, and the impacts are devastating.\n  We are learning that of the two species of mosquitoes that spread the \ndisease, one of them has developed an immunity, a resistance to the \nmost commonly used pesticide to remove them. So there is real concern \nas we head into the summer months and mosquitoes begin to appear that \nsoon we will wake up to the news that there has now been a mosquito-\nborne transmission within the continental United States.\n  Here is the bottom line: We don't know everything about this disease. \nWe already know it is bad, but we don't know how bad it is. Every day \nwe find out more things. We know during these summer months it will be \nincreasingly warm in many parts of the country where the two mosquito \nspecies that spread the virus can be found--in 30 out\n\n[[Page S2447]]\n\nof 50 States. We know those mosquitoes tend to grow even faster during \nwarm seasons and when there is a lot of water on the ground. And we \nknow one of the countries most impacted by it--Brazil--will soon host \nthe Summer Olympic Games, which means there is going to be a tremendous \namount of travel to and from Brazil, and, in fact, there already is. We \nknow the disease is not just spread through mosquitoes, but it is also \nsexually transmitted.\n  The result of all this is that there is a real concern about what \ndirection we are headed. The President has asked for $1.9 billion in \nfunding, and I am generally supportive of that request. I believe we \nneed to deal with these issues on the front end as quickly as possible. \nWe don't want to wake up one morning to the realization that we are now \nin the middle of summer, this has become an epidemic or a catastrophe, \nand we didn't do anything on the front end. Everyone here will have to \nexplain what their position was at the time.\n  I also think you can be for Zika funding--you can even be for Zika \nfunding at $1.9 billion--and you can also ask questions about how this \nmoney is going to be spent and, if possible, how we are going to pay \nfor it because we are facing a debt situation in this country. I \nbelieve we can find $1.9 billion to pay for it. I have suggested some \nof my own.\n  What we don't want to do is to play political games with this. I \nthink it is important. On the one side, you can't just say: Look, I am \nagainst anything they are asking for that comes up unless you prove \notherwise. I think it is important that we now admit this is a serious \nissue that needs to be confronted. But it is also not being an \nobstructionist to ask: How is the money going to be spent? What \nprograms will be funded? Where is the prioritization going to be? I \nthink it is not too much to ask to have a level of detail about that \n$1.9 billion.\n  What I am concerned about is some of the reports in the news that \nthere are games being played with this. We have heard the news that the \nadministration has redirected $44 million in emergency preparedness \ngrants promised to State and local governments this summer. Oftentimes \nin politics this is a very typical maneuver. What you do is, you cut \nmoney from an organization somewhere and you blame it on congressional \ninaction--or in the States, on legislative inaction. And they say the \nreason you are losing this money is that someone is not doing what we \nwant, so you find the most painful, alarming cuts and use them as a \nleverage point to get pressure built on Congress. So I want to make \nsure that this is not part of some game. We shouldn't be playing games \nwith this. I think it is also important to understand why, in addition \nto the $1.9 billion, they are also saying on top of that we also have \nto repay the $510 million in Ebola funds since the Ebola situation is \nnow under control.\n  These are all legitimate issues that need to be confronted. But in \nthe end, we have to do something about this. I know the Senate and the \nCongress were not meant to move at warp speed, to say the least. It is \na place in which action takes time, and I understand that. But there \nare things we don't have time for. This issue has to be dealt with on \nthe front end. Summer is here already. If you have been in South \nFlorida, as I have on weekends, and back in my home State, as I will be \nagain this Friday and into the weekend, it is already hot. That heat, \ncombined with a wet season, means mosquitoes.\n\n  This is mosquito season. We have a disease that is already creating \nthis catastrophic impact in countries neighboring us to the south. We \nknow it is spread by mosquitoes. Mosquito season is rapidly \napproaching, and we have to get ahead of this. None of us wants to be \nin a position in June, July, and August where this thing breaks out and \nwe start seeing cases in the continental United States, as we are \nalready seeing in Puerto Rico and in Brazil, and we have no answer for \nwhy we did nothing during these months we were here.\n  I don't know what all the impediments are. I know there are \nconversations going on at the committee level, but I hope we can bridge \nthis rather quickly. There are so many other issues we can argue about. \nThere are so many other issues we can have debates about in the \npartisan season. But I don't think a disease of this magnitude, with \nthis level of risk, is one we should be playing games with.\n  My hope is that cooler heads will prevail and that over the next few \ndays we will find it within ourselves to find out how to appropriate \nthe necessary money so we can begin to deal with this, at least on the \nfront end. Maybe there is a chunk of money on the front end so we can \nbegin to address it and then we can come back later and fund the rest \nof it. I think it is incumbent upon the administration and others to \nsay ``This is what the money is going to be spent on'' so we can judge \nwhether the money and the funds are actually going to things that work. \nBut this needs to happen. This problem can't wait, and it shouldn't be \na partisan fight.\n  Combating Zika is an appropriate use of public dollars. It is an \nappropriate use of public dollars. I am for limited government. I am \nfor a very limited Federal Government. But one of the things the \nFederal Government is tasked with is keeping our people and country \nsafe, particularly from external threats. Traditionally, what that \nmeans is an invading army or some military threat from abroad or \nwhatever. In this case, this is a threat emerging from abroad, but it \nis coming toward the United States. There is nothing that prevents the \nUnited States from becoming like some of these other countries that \nhave been impacted by this--nothing. Our people are not genetically \nimmune to Zika. It is a matter of time. It is not a question of if, it \nis a question of when there will be a mosquito-borne transmission of \nthe Zika disease here in the United States. And when that happens, if \nthe posture of the Congress has been that we did nothing--nothing has \nhappened on this; we are still debating over $200 million or $50 \nmillion--people will not be satisfied with that answer.\n  So my hope is that this is dealt with according to the level of \nurgency it deserves. As I said, in my home State of Florida we already \nhave 93 cases, with 2 new ones over the weekend. Those numbers are only \ngoing to grow. It is just a matter of time before there is a mosquito-\nborne transmission somewhere in the United States--the continental \nUnited States, because, as I said, this has already occurred in Puerto \nRico--and I hope we get ahead of it before it is too late.\n  As I speak to the appropriators and those involved in this, my hope \nis that we can find our way forward on this rather quickly. There are \nso many other issues to argue about; this should not be one of them. \nThe money needs to be spent the right way, but it needs to be spent and \nit needs to be appropriated, and we should endeavor to pay for as much \nof it, if not all of it, as we can. It needs to get quickly to the \ntarget. We need to move from this process and on to those programs so \nwe can get ahead of it in May and June, before we get into the summer, \nbefore we get into mosquito season, and before we have an outbreak in \nthe United States. If not, we then will have to answer to the people as \nto why nothing happened when we knew the risk was growing and the \nthreat was emerging.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n             Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, it has been nearly 9 months since the \nUnited States had an Ambassador to Mexico. The President's nominee to \nthat post, Roberta Jacobson, is eminently qualified for the post.\n  The Arizona Republic noted in an editorial from March that ``she's \nqualified, respected and needed to do an important job.'' They are \nright.\n  For more than 20 years, Ms. Jacobson has been immersed in the \nregional, political, economic, and security issues related to the \nWestern Hemisphere. In fact, as part of her extensive background, she \nserved for a time as Director of the Office of Mexican Affairs at the \nState Department. She is obviously\n\n[[Page S2448]]\n\nfluent in Spanish and has earned the respect of her colleagues. She \nserved for 3 years as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Canada, Mexico, \nand NAFTA issues within the Bureau of Western Hemisphere--experience \nthat would later serve the United States well given that Mexico is \nAmerica's third largest trading partner, with bilateral trade totaling \nmore than half a trillion dollars. However, she has been waiting for \nthe Senate to confirm her nomination since the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee reported it to the Senate in November of last year by a vote \nof 12 to 7.\n  It should be incomprehensible to anyone around the country to have a \npost of the top diplomat to one of our most important bilateral \nrelations open for this long, but for Arizonans, it is particularly \nbaffling. Arizona alone enjoyed a trade relationship with Mexico of \nnearly $17 billion last year. On the export side, Arizona exports about \n$9 billion in goods and services to Mexico every year, which, according \nto the Arizona Republic, ``accounts for 41 percent of the state's \nexports, and four times more than our state exports to our next biggest \ntrading partner, Canada.''\n  According to the Arizona-Mexico Commission:\n\n       With an economy that now surpasses $1.3 trillion, Mexico \n     ranks as one of the top 20 economies in the world. Mexico's \n     economy has been increasingly focused on manufacturing, \n     particularly since the signing of the North American Free \n     Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994.\n\n  More than $1 billion in goods are exchanged between the United States \nand Mexico every day. But the U.S.-Mexico relationship is about more \nthan just our economies; transportation issues, security threats, and \nnatural resource management are just some of the fronts on which we \ncooperate with Mexico.\n  The Arizona Republic notes that ``the Arizona Department of \nTransportation recently signed a memorandum of understanding to study \nways to improve the trade corridor that spans the border.'' Arizona \nalone shares six ports of entry with Mexico, and Phoenix's Sky Harbor \nAirport facilitates 122 flights a week to and from Mexico. All of this \ncooperation requires a close partnership between our two countries. The \nlonger the United States goes without having an Ambassador to Mexico, \nthe greater that partnership will suffer.\n  To my knowledge, the holdup in this process is not based on any \nconcrete concerns with the qualifications of this specific nominee. She \nenjoys overwhelming support. There is no reason not to move forward \nwith this nomination. If there is opposition, then Members should have \nthe opportunity to express it. As such, I will be asking unanimous \nconsent for a time agreement with a rollcall vote on her confirmation. \nThere is simply no reason we should not have an Ambassador to Mexico \nwhen we have a candidate as qualified as Roberta Jacobson.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, at a time to be \ndetermined by the majority leader, in consultation with the Democratic \nleader, the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the \nfollowing nomination: Calendar No. 365; that there be 30 minutes for \ndebate only on the nomination equally divided in the usual form; that \nupon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on the \nnomination without intervening action or debate; that if confirmed, the \nmotion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, the \nPresident be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the \nSenate then resume legislative session without any intervening action \nor debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I agree that the U.S.-Mexico relationship \nis one of our most important bilateral relationships. We do need an \nambassador in Mexico City who has a track record of effectively \nadvancing U.S. interests. I do, however, have serious questions about \nthe policies that Assistant Secretary Jacobson has pursued during her \ntenure in the Western Hemisphere Bureau. I have had conversations with \nthe administration and others, such as Senator Corker, about the \nconcerns, and I remain hopeful that we can find a way to resolve this \nissue in the very near future, but until then, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I plan to return frequently for as long as \nit takes to shed a light on this nomination and to make sure it moves \nforward, so I expect to be here tomorrow to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                    World Intellectual Property Day\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the United States is one of the most \ndynamic and innovative countries in the world. Our Nation's success in \nareas such as agriculture, manufacturing, computer technology, and \nmedicine can be traced in large measure to our respect for, and \nprotection of, intellectual property.\n  Every year on this day, April 26, we have the opportunity to \nrecognize the important role of intellectual property rights in the \nfabric of our society when we celebrate World Intellectual Property \nDay.\n  Nearly 230 years ago, our Founding Fathers recognized the importance \nof intellectual property and made provisions for its promotion and \nprotection in the Constitution. Article I, section 8, clause 8 empowers \nCongress ``to promote the Progress of Science and Useful arts, by \nsecuring, for limited Times, to Authors and Inventors, the exclusive \nRight to their respective Writings and Discoveries.''\n  Since that time--and stemming from these values--intellectual \nproperty has played a vital role in our economy, supporting jobs and \nadvancing creative and scientific industries.\n  In our modern, innovation economy, patents, trademarks, copyrights, \ntrade secrets, and other forms of IP are more critical than ever. As \nthe Global Intellectual Property Center recently pointed out in their \nbroad survey of Intellectual Property in America, IP-intensive \nindustries employ over 40 million Americans, accounting for 38 percent \nof total U.S. gross domestic product. Workers in IP-intensive \nindustries are paid better than the national average, earning an \naverage salary of over $50,000 compared to those in non-IP-intensive \nsectors where the average is roughly $39,000. In fact, intellectual \nproperty is so important to the American economy that the collective \nworth of all of the intellectual property in the United States is now \nabove $5.8 trillion.\n  In Iowa, we have seen how intellectual property has become an \nintegral part of our economy. Our system of strong intellectual \nproperty protection has led to $11.2 billion in annual IP-related \nexports from the State, a total of 667,557 IP-related jobs, and 19.9 \npercent higher wages for direct IP workers than non-IP workers. Just as \nIowans utilized strong IP laws 75 years ago when they were discovering \nhow to feed the world through cutting-edge science, today's Iowans \nbenefit from our system of IP protection as they start companies and \ncreate new tech success stories.\n  The Judiciary Committee plays an important role in protecting \nintellectual property. The committee exercises jurisdiction over our \nNation's intellectual property laws including those governing patents, \ntrademarks, and copyrights. We consider legislation that helps to \nensure that intellectual property rights continue to promote jobs and \ninnovation. The committee also exercises important oversight of the \nPatent and Trademark Office, ICANN, the Office of the Intellectual \nProperty Enforcement Coordinator, and various law enforcement entities \ncharged with protecting IP.\n  Some recent examples of important legislation that helps promote \nintellectual property rights are the PATENT Act of 2015 and the Defend \nTrade Secrets Act of 2016. The PATENT Act, which passed the committee \nby a vote of 16 to 4 last June, takes important steps to stop abusive \npatent litigation practices. As bad actors are exploiting the high \ncosts of litigation and using deceptive tactics to prey on businesses, \nit is important that this legislation be considered in the Senate.\n  Just 3 weeks ago, the Senate unanimously passed the Defend Trade \nSecrets Act of 2016, sponsored by Senators Hatch and Coons. Building \nupon the bipartisan consensus generated in the Judiciary Committee, the \nbill passed on the Senate floor by a vote of 87 to 0. It is estimated \nthat the American economy loses 2.1 million jobs and over\n\n[[Page S2449]]\n\n$300 billion in economic losses every year because of trade secret \ntheft. The Defend Trade Secrets Act brings much-needed uniformity to \ntrade secret litigation. This will allow the creators and owners of \ntrade secrets to more effectively address the growing problem of trade \nsecret theft. The House of Representatives is expected to pass our bill \nthis week and I hope it will be immediately signed by the President.\n  Tomorrow, the Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing on counterfeits \nand their impact on consumer health and safety. We will hear from a \npanel of experts, including witnesses from the Patent and Trademark \nOffice, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and industry. These \nbusinesses include companies that provide home health care products and \nequipment to our troops. They will discuss how counterfeits can harm \nconsumers and what their impact is on the economy. We will hear how law \nenforcement is addressing this problem as well as how stakeholders are \neducating consumers to protect themselves from counterfeits.\n  The focus of this year's World Intellectual Property Day is ``digital \ncreativity.'' As the World Intellectual Property Organization notes, \nthe current era of Internet connectivity is transforming how consumable \nculture such as films, TV, music, books, art, and other cultural works \nare created and distributed. This has led to radical changes in the way \nwe access content and in how businesses operate. As challenges emerge \nas to how we protect intellectual property rights in these new economic \nmodels, we must continue to search for effective solutions that promote \ncreativity across different mediums.\n  So on this World Intellectual Property Day, it is important to once \nagain recognize the significance of our Nation's robust system of \nintellectual property protection and enforcement. This system has \nhelped create the United States' enduring role as a leader in \ninnovation and creativity. As the chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, I will continue to embrace my role as a promoter of \nintellectual property rights and American jobs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/senate-section/article/S2449-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES \n              APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2016--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I am not sure of the man's name, but I \nwant to thank a public policy professor at Western Illinois University.\n  About a decade ago, this astute professor was talking with one of his \nbest graduate students about his future.\n  The professor knew that the young man was hoping to put his talent \nand training to good use working as a city planner or city manager in a \nsmall Illinois town--maybe a town like the one in which the young man \nhad grown up.\n  The professor suggested another possibility. He asked his student: \n``Have you ever considered going to Washington and working on Capitol \nHill? I think you might like it, and you'd be good at it.''\n  Fortunately for me and for countless others in my State of Illinois, \nthat young man Bart Ellefritz, loves new challenges and adventures, so \nhe decided to trust his professor's advice.\n  He moved to Washington and landed a job as an intern in Senator Harry \nReid's personal office. That is when my office first became aware of \nhim.\n  Before long, I hired Bart to work as a staff assistant on my \nJudiciary Committee staff.\n  Bart mastered that job in no time flat and was ready for his next \nchallenge, so he moved home to Illinois to work in my Springfield \noffice doing casework.\n  For those who may be unfamiliar with that term, ``casework'' is a \nword we use to describe efforts by our staff members who work to help \npeople with specific problems--to try to cut through red tape and make \ngovernment work better for people.\n  Bart Ellefritz is a master of casework because he is smart and he \nbelieves that government can be a force for good. Most of all, he cares \nabout people.\n  In 2009, Bart got an offer that was too good to turn down. It was the \nbeginning of President Obama's first term. Former Illinois Congressman \nRay LaHood was the new U.S. Secretary of Transportation, and he asked \nBart to come work for him, so he left--with my blessing.\n  About 5 years ago, I succeeded in hiring Bart back to be the director \nof my Springfield office, which serves all of downstate Illinois.\n  Let me tell you, being my downstate director is no 9-to-5 job for \nBart Ellefritz. Somedays, it is a 5-to-9 job--from 5 in the morning \nuntil 9 at night.\n  Bart is my representative--my eyes and ears--for a large part of my \nState. He drives hundreds of miles every week in his Mitsubishi \nOutlander Sport--made in Normal, IL--to meet with people on my behalf, \nlisten to their ideas and concerns, and try to help them solve their \nproblems.\n  I can't begin to count the number of people whom Bart has helped, but \nlet me tell you about one of them.\n  Judy--I won't use her last name--works as a housekeeper at a motel \nwhere I often stay, and we have become friends.\n  Several years ago, Judy confided to me that she was 62 years old and \nhad never in her whole life had health insurance--not for a single day. \nShe had worked her whole life in manual labor, working as a cook, a \nwaitress, a housekeeper, and she had never known the security of having \nhealth insurance.\n  I asked Bart to see if there was some way to help Judy. Bart spend \nhours and hours talking on the phone with Judy, driving to see Judy in \nperson, talking with folks at Medicare and Medicaid.\n  A final hurdle came when Judy needed an email account to sign up for \nhealth care. Judy had never used email before, so Bart helped her set \nup her account.\n  Finally, at the age of 62, because of Bart's persistence and the \nAffordable\n\n[[Page S2450]]\n\nCare Act, Judy was able to afford health insurance. She was able to \nsleep more easily knowing that she was no longer just one bad illness \nor accident away from total financial ruin.\n  I am sorry to report that Bart Ellefritz is leaving my office again \nnext month. He is off on another great challenge. He will be working \nfor CTA, the Chicago Transit Authority, one of the largest transit \nsystems in the world, in one of the greatest cities in the world.\n  I want to thank Bart publicly for the countless ways in which he has \nhelped me and, more importantly, helped the people of Illinois.\n  I also want to thank Bart's wife, Ashley, and their son, Charley, who \nis just 21 months old, for sharing Bart with the people of Illinois.\n  Bart and Ashley are what some folks in Washington refer to as a mixed \nmarriage.\n  Ashley Messick was working as assistant secretary of the Senate \nRepublican caucus, helping Senator McConnell run the Senate floor, when \nshe and Bart met.\n  Bart was sharing a house in Washington with some other young \nprofessionals--one of whom happened to be a close friend of Ashley's. \nThey met at the house, and hit it off immediately.\n  I also want to thank Bart's parents, Keith and Terri Ellefritz, for \nraising two wonderful sons. Their other son, Bart's brother Ben, is a \nminister.\n  Keith and Terri raised their two boys in west central Illinois, in a \ntown called Carthage, population 2,605.\n  Bart played on his high school football team, the Carthage Blueboys, \nin 1998, the year they won the State football championship.\n  Keith and Terri Ellefritz raised their boys to have big hearts and \nsmall-town values.\n  Somewhere along the way, Bart also developed a passion for traveling, \nmeeting new people, and seeing the world through their eyes.\n  He has visited all seven Wonders of the World.\n  He took 3 months off after he left the Department of Transportation \nto hike through sub-Saharan Africa. He ended that trip in Tanzania, \nwhere Ashley met up with him and together, they climbed more than \n19,000 feet to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro.\n  Bart once took his mom skydiving in Australia.\n  This past October he spent 2 weeks hiking in Ethiopia.\n  When Charley was born 21 months ago, his parents got him a passport, \nalong with his birth certificate. At 7 months old, Charley got his \npassport stamped for the first time--for a trip to Colombia, South \nAmerica.\n  Bart Ellefritz pours his whole heart into whatever he does, whether \nhe is riding a camel in the desert, spending time with Ashley and \nCharley, or listening to people of my State and helping to solve \nproblems. And he is almost always smiling.\n  In closing, I want to thank Bart again for the great skill, caring, \nand tenacity he has always brought to his job as a member of my staff, \nand I want to wish him the best of luck as he begins his next \nprofessional adventure with CTA in Chicago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/senate-section/article/S2450-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO PAUL DETTMAN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, after decades of committed service to the \nimportant cause of providing public housing for those in need, Paul \nDettman is retiring this month as executive director of the Burlington \nHousing Authority.\n  Throughout Paul's career, he has worked tirelessly in the field of \npublic service. Public housing has not been a fashionable cause for \nmany years, and our communities have certainly seen the effects of this \nsometimes forgotten priority. Paul Dettman was never deterred by these \nattitudes, however, and has been dedicated to finding creative \nsolutions to provide for our most vulnerable friends and neighbors.\n  Paul's leadership has resulted in a series of public-private \npartnerships and innovative initiatives have helped revitalize \ncommunities across the Green Mountain State. Before joining the \nBurlington Housing Authority as its executive director in November \n1995, Paul served for many years with the Vermont State Housing \nAuthority. It was here that Paul created the State's first lead hazard \nreduction program, which now stands as a model for providing families \nof all incomes with safe housing.\n  Since the beginning of Paul's tenure at Burlington Housing Authority \n20 years ago, Vermont's oldest and largest municipally based housing \nauthority, the organization has grown vastly in size and scope. The \nBurlington Housing Authority has taken on new development projects, \nimproved homebuyer education, and negotiated critical agreements to \nprevent homelessness in recent years. Under Paul's direction, the \nBurlington Housing Authority has upheld a strong mission to support all \nresidents, including refugees, those in transition, or in need of long-\nterm supportive services.\n  Paul's commitment also resulted in a critical partnership with \nanother local organization, Women Helping Battered Women, to create \nSophie's Place. Together, these two organizations devised a plan to \nprovide victims of domestic violence easier access to public housing \nsubsidies so that they could move directly from violent homes into safe \ntransitional housing. This solution simultaneously eased suffering, \nstreamlined services, and saved money. This program now functions as a \nkey component of the local economic justice and housing plans and \nserves as a model for valuable partnerships in my home State. This \nprogram is only one of many that I could provide as reference to Paul's \ngreat work in Burlington and beyond.\n  Like his many colleagues and friends, I know that the Burlington \nHousing Authority and the greater housing community will miss Paul's \nexpertise, spirit, and compassion. Marcelle and I extend our best \nwishes as Paul begins his retirement after a long and distinguished \ncareer. I surely hope that Paul will take time to enjoy one of his \ngreatest hobbies in the years ahead--sugarmaking among the sweet \nsugarbush.\n  Paul Dettman's standard of distinction should be an inspiration to \nothers, just as it has been to the city of Burlington and the State of \nVermont.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/senate-section/article/S2450-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I am very pleased with the Senate's show \nof support for the Isakson-Bennet amendment, which was a modified \nversion of the Sensible Accounting to Value Energy Act. We have been \nworking on this bill together for more than five years.\n  The SAVE Act simply creates a voluntary program to encourage people \nto include energy efficiency in the purchase price of a new or existing \nhome. It allows sellers the option of providing a HUD-qualified energy \nefficiency report to prospective buyers who are applying for a home \nmortgage. If that loan is backed by FHA, the energy efficiency of the \nhome and the cost of a borrower's future energy bills will be taken \ninto account by the mortgage lender.\n  Builders and manufacturers are constantly creating new energy \nefficient products and features, but the enhanced value and energy \nsavings achieved by these innovations are not fully realized by the \nmarket. The passage of this amendment will for the first time provide a \nmechanism to account for those saving and unlock demand for new energy \nefficient products\n\n[[Page S2451]]\n\nand significantly reduce homeowner's utility bills.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a question?\n  I would like to commend my colleagues for their support for energy \nefficiency programs that reduce residential energy consumption. \nExpanding the use of these technologies in our everyday lives is a \ncommitment to our future and will create jobs in Ohio.\n  However, I am also concerned that adjusting underwriting or appraisal \nrequirements without sufficient protections to ensure a family has the \nability to repay their loan could have unintended consequences that put \nour housing market at risk, which I know is not the intention of the \nsponsors.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I would like to associate myself with the \ncomments made by the Senator from Ohio. I also support the need for \ngreater energy efficiency and applaud the sponsors of this amendment \nfor promoting greater energy efficiency. At the same time, I do have \nsome concerns.\n  Specifically, I am concerned about whether and how potential energy \nsavings can safely be incorporated as part of the mortgage underwriting \nprocess at the FHA, especially when there may not be a consensus on how \nto define and accurately quantify future energy savings.\n  Another concern is the interaction of estimated energy savings in the \nunderwriting and appraisal processes. This could happen because the \nSAVE Act requires expected energy cost savings to be used as an offset \nto certain regular expenses, such as property taxes, while also \nrequiring the estimated energy savings of a home to be added to the \nhome's appraisal. While not the intent of the authors, I am concerned \nthat this could tilt the mortgage market towards more expensive \nproducts without adequate safeguards to protect borrowers.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, we would ask the sponsors of this amendment \nto work with us to ensure that we can accomplish our shared goals of \nencouraging investment in energy efficient homes while also maintaining \na safe and sound mortgage market for homebuyers.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, moving forward, we intend to work with the \nSenate Banking Committee and HUD to address any technical or \nsubstantive concerns that have arisen. Specifically, it is our \nintention to ensure that FHA has the ability to insure loans for energy \nefficient homes while also including protections to maintain accurate \nevaluations of a borrower's ability to repay.\n  Additionally, as this amendment is being implemented, we understand \nthat HUD's ability to test and modify the savings that may be counted \nshould be considered. In fact, we considered these concerns while \ndrafting this legislation. The methodology we included for measuring \nenergy efficient savings is an ANSI certified standard and the most \nwidely accepted technology in today's marketplace. Over 1 million homes \nhave already been energy rated using this technology. And this is the \nsame underlying technology successfully utilized by the EPA's Energy \nStar program.\n  Again, we are pleased that the Senate passed our amendment, and we \nlook forward to working with the Banking Committee and HUD on \nimprovements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/senate-section/article/S2451-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am deeply disappointed that my \nRepublican colleagues continue to play politics with our judicial \nsystem.\n  There are currently 79 judicial vacancies in this country--28 of \nwhich are judicial emergency vacancies. In each of these districts \nacross the country, Americans are waiting for their cases to be heard, \nbut instead of justice, they are left hanging in the lurch.\n  I have said it before, and I will say it again: Justice delayed is \njustice denied.\n  Senate Republicans refuse to act to confirm Judge Merrick Garland--\nwho has more Federal judicial experience than any other Supreme Court \ncandidate in history--to the Supreme Court, and they refuse to act on \nthe 20 judicial nominees who were reported out of the Judiciary \nCommittee by voice vote. It is outrageous that Senate Republicans \nstubbornly refuse to move these nominations forward, letting these \naccomplished and qualified nominees languish.\n  One of those judges is Mark Young, an excellent nominee for the \nCentral District Court of California, which is ranked 11th in the \nNation in weighted case filings per judgeship.\n  We need to fill this seat as soon as possible, and Judge Young is an \nextraordinary candidate. I was honored to introduce him at his \nnomination hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee last October \nand go over his impeccable resume.\n  He has served as a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge since 2008 \nand has 10 years of experience as a prosecutor in the U.S. attorney's \noffice in Los Angeles.\n  He holds degrees from the University of California, Los Angeles, and \nthe University of Southern California Gould School of Law; and he has \nwon numerous awards from organizations including the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Attorney \nGeneral's Distinguished Service Award--one of the Department of \nJustice's highest honors.\n  The people of the Central District of California need his leadership, \nand the overworked judges of the Central District need his help.\n  We also have two additional candidates from California who are \nawaiting Judiciary Committee hearings.\n  Judge Paul L. Abrams was nominated by President Obama in December \n2015 to serve as the U.S. District Court Judge for the Central \nDistrict. Judge Abrams is currently a U.S. magistrate judge for the \nCentral District, a post he has held since 2002.\n  He began his career in private practice and then worked as a legal \naid lawyer before serving in the Federal public defender's office, \neventually becoming a supervising deputy Federal public defender. He \nholds degrees from the University of California, Berkeley, and Boalt \nHall School of Law.\n  Judge Lucy Koh, currently serving in the Northern District, was \nnominated by President Obama for the Ninth Circuit Court in February of \nthis year. The daughter of Korean immigrants and a Harvard graduate, \nJudge Koh began her legal career as a Women's Law and Public Policy \nFellow for the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  At the U.S. Department of Justice, she served as a special assistant \nto the Deputy Attorney General before spending 3 years as a Federal \nprosecutor in Los Angeles, where she was awarded the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation Director Louis J. Freeh Award for Demonstrated Excellence \nin Prosecuting a Major Criminal Case. She then spent 9 years in private \npractice. She served on the Superior Court for Santa Clara County until \n2010, when she was appointed to the Northern District, becoming the \nfirst Korean American woman to serve as a Federal district court judge.\n  Each of these excellent candidates has flawless credentials, broad \nsupport, and they are ready to serve. So what are we waiting for? The \nAmerican people cannot wait for justice--and they shouldn't have to.\n  Let's move forward with giving each of these excellent judicial \ncandidates the consideration and vote that they deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/senate-section/article/S2451-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2451-S2452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE RELEASE OF THE CHURCH COMMITTEE REPORT\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the 40th \nanniversary of the release of the report by the Senate Select Committee \nto Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence \nActivities, better known as the Church Committee.\n  On this day in 1976, the first of five books detailing egregious \nabuses of power by the intelligence community was released by the \nChurch Committee. The report was the first ever comprehensive oversight \nstudy of the intelligence community, which had operated largely without \nany oversight since its founding during World War II. Prior to this \nstudy, the Intelligence Committees did not exist in either the Senate \nor the House, and there was no formal apparatus to check the actions of \nthe Nation's intelligence community.\n  The Church Committee truly was the first of its kind. It grew out of \nextraordinary circumstances during a period\n\n[[Page S2452]]\n\nof national soul-searching in the shadow of the Vietnam war and \nWatergate scandal. In the early 1970s, a series of abuses were revealed \nin the press, including an expose alleging that the CIA had been spying \non antiwar activists around the country.\n  The American people were understandably outraged, and in response, \nthe Senate convened a committee to conduct a comprehensive review of \nall intelligence activities.\n  The committee--under the chairmanship of Idaho Senator Frank Church, \nwith Texas Senator John Tower as vice chairman--was comprised of 11 \nSenators and 133 dedicated staff members. Over the next 15 months, the \nstaff poured over millions of CIA and FBI records to produce a 2,500-\npage report broken into 6 unique books, each covering a different topic \nincluding foreign assassinations, domestic spying, and an investigation \ninto the killing of President Kennedy.\n  What they discovered was shocking, including vast abuses both \ndomestic and abroad that showed the intelligence community operated \noutside the framework of the Constitution and undermined the Bill of \nRights.\n  The committee found that, in the decades leading up to and including \nthe 1970s, the CIA and FBI had been conducting a massive, illegal \ndomestic spying operation, which included the following: The CIA opened \nand photographed over one-quarter million pieces of domestic mail, the \nFBI maintained extensive files on over half a million American \ncitizens, and the NSA wiretapped all international calls from the \nUnited States and documented the callers.\n  In addition to mass data collection, the agencies conducted targeted \noperations as well. Civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., was \nthe subject of an aggressive surveillance program overseen by FBI \nDirector J. Edgar Hoover. Hoover sought to compile a detailed record of \nKing's personal life in order to blackmail and delegitimize him as a \npublic figure. King's phone was tapped without a warrant, for example.\n  The NAACP, Black Panthers, and antiwar groups were also all spied \nupon. In fact, President Eisenhower on several occasions received \nadvanced copies of NAACP speeches from informants.\n  The abuses didn't stop at our border. The Church Committee uncovered \nevidence that the CIA had plotted or engaged in assisting in the \nassassination plots of the leaders of Cuba, the Congo, the Dominican \nRepublic, Chile, and South Vietnam.\n  In the Congo, the CIA reached the final stages of a plot to \nassassinate Patrice Lumumba and had even delivered poison to its \nagents. However, before the plan was carried out, Lumumba was executed \nfollowing a coup.\n  Most infamously, the United States conspired in numerous plots \nagainst Fidel Castro, though none were ever carried out.\n  The public airing of these--and other--allegations shook our country \nand our partners abroad and prompted swift action by Congress and the \nexecutive branch.\n  On February 18, 1976, President Ford issued Executive Order No. \n11905, banning all assassinations. The order has stood ever since.\n  Within months of the release of the Church Committee report, the \nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence was formed by a vote of 72 to \n22. The committee was established to conduct constant and vigorous \noversight over the intelligence community.\n  In addition, in 1978, Congress passed the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act which established the FISA Court to oversee requests \nfor intelligence warrants within the United States.\n  The Church Committee study revealed to the world the danger of \nallowing intelligence agencies to operate in the shadows and with \nunchecked power.\n  Our duty to conduct oversight is one I take very seriously. As the \nchairman of the Intelligence Committee from 2009 to 2015 and as vice \nchairman since 2015, I have undertaken this responsibility with the \nawareness that, without the efforts of the Church Committee, \ncongressional oversight of the intelligence community would never have \nbeen possible. We must also remember that the Church Committee and its \nreports had their vocal and adamant opponents. Oversight is, at times, \nresisted, a fact we discovered firsthand in completing and \ndeclassifying as the Committee's Study of the CIA's Detention and \nInterrogation Program.\n  The legacy of the Church Committee report lives on in the study the \nIntelligence Committee released in 2014.\n  The study reviewed over 6.3 million cables, emails, memoranda, and \ntranscripts. It is a documentary history of the CIA's words and actions \nin the years during which the CIA conceived of, carried out, and made \nrepresentations about its Detention and Interrogation Program. The \npublic is familiar with the report's 500-page executive summary and \nfindings and conclusions that were declassified and released. The full \nstudy is over 6,700 pages long and includes 38,000 footnotes. To this \nday, critics of the study have not demonstrated a single factual \ninaccuracy.\n  Among many revelations, the study showed that, contrary to the CIA's \nclaims, the use of torture was brutal and did not result in otherwise \nunavailable intelligence that ``saved lives.''

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 101st \nanniversary of the Armenian genocide.\n  Between 1915 and 1923, the Ottoman Empire executed a deliberate \nmassacre of more than 1.5 million Armenians. Over the course of 8 \nyears, Armenians were marched to their deaths in the deserts of the \nMiddle East, murdered in concentration camps, drowned at sea, and \nforced to endure unimaginable acts of brutality. These barbaric acts \nwere systematic, methodical, and intentional.\n  More than 100 years have passed since the start of that horrific \nmassacre, which an overwhelming number of academics and institutions \nhave recognized as genocide, and there are countless testimonies from \nvictims who lived to tell of their harrowing experiences.\n  Pope Francis called the massacre against the Armenians ``the first \ngenocide of the 20th century,'' declaring that ``concealing or denying \nevil is like allowing a wound to keep bleeding without bandaging it.''\n  However, despite an irrefutable body of evidence, the U.S. Government \nhas refused to call the deliberate massacre of the Armenians by its \nrightful name: genocide.\n  For years, I have urged both Democratic and Republican \nadministrations to acknowledge the truth of the Armenian genocide. \nToday I reiterate my call, and I hope that, this year, the United \nStates will finally correct this century-old injustice.\n  By affirming the Armenian genocide, the United States would join more \nthan 20 countries across the globe--including Russia, France, and \nGermany--as well as the Vatican and 43 U.S. States standing on the \nright side of history.\n  Recognizing the Armenian genocide is much more than a symbolic \ngesture. It will provide solace and relief to the descendants of the \nvictims, particularly the hundreds of thousands of Armenian American \ncitizens and residents. It will support a more equitable reconciliation \nbetween the Turkish and\n\n[[Page S2453]]\n\nArmenian people. And most importantly, it will reaffirm U.S. leadership \nin preventing and responding to similar atrocities and in advancing the \nrights of vulnerable populations around the world.\n  This year, as we take time to remember and honor the victims of the \nArmenian genocide, I hope the United States will finally stand on the \nright side of history and affirm the incontestable fact of the Armenian \ngenocide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/senate-section/article/S2453-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO REAR ADMIRAL STEPHEN P. METRUCK\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I wish to honor U.S. Coast Guard RADM \nStephen P. Metruck and highlight his service to country and his \ncontribution to the State of Delaware. Rear Admiral Metruck retired on \nApril 22 from commanding the Fifth Coast Guard District after 34 years \nin the U.S. Coast Guard. The fifth district includes North Carolina, \nVirginia, Maryland, New Jersey, Delaware, Washington, DC, and much of \nPennsylvania. Rear Admiral Metruck led 67 units made up of 2,475 Active \nDuty members, 1,010 Reservists, 6,800 auxiliary members, and 120 \ncivilians.\n  One of Rear Admiral Metruck's most notable accomplishments occurred \nduring his tenure at both Sector San Diego and Sector Seattle. In these \ndual roles, Rear Admiral Metruck was responsible for advancing Coast \nGuard operations in a post-9/11 environment. He forged interagency \npartnerships to enhance safety and security measures in each port and \ncoordinated the sensors and systems into a common operational picture \nto allow all agencies to coordinate and understand potential threats in \nthe maritime environment.\n  Rear Admiral Metruck and I got to know each other well during harsh, \nback-to-back winters that damaged navigation aids along the Delaware \nRiver, which assisted ships traveling to and from Wilmington, DE. From \nthis experience, I learned that it is not easy budgeting for ice flows. \nBeing an expert at budgeting and solving problems, he and his team \nforged solutions that replaced damaged buoys and aids to navigation \nwithout a huge burden on taxpayers. The result was ships could again \ntravel safely to ports in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware.\n  Rear Admiral Metruck is a very humble man, and he will be the first \nto understate his contribution to the U.S. Coast Guard and leadership \nof the men and women under his command. Nevertheless, I have found him \nto be an extremely devoted public servant and skilled at working with \nother agencies, solving problems, and being responsive to inquiries \nfrom Senators.\n  Rear Admiral Metruck also spent 2\\1/2\\ years serving this great \ninstitution as a fellow with then-Senator John Kerry. He worked on \npolicy issues related to the Commerce Subcommittee on Oceans and \nFisheries and also supported Senator Kerry's staff on environmental, \nmaritime, and Coast Guard issues and legislation.\n  Prior to arriving at the Fifth Coast Guard District, he was the \nassistant commandant for resources and chief financial officer for the \nU.S. Coast Guard. During this assignment, he was responsible for all \nCoast Guard financial management and resource activities including \nplanning, programming, budgeting, and execution of the service's $10 \nbillion annual appropriation.\n  While he has been a friend of commerce and the environment on the \nDelaware River, his career has resulted in him living in and serving a \nnumber of other States. He has served in Coast Guard Headquarters; \nPortsmouth, VA; Brownsville, TX; Tampa, FL; Buffalo, NY; San Diego, CA; \nand Puget Sound, WA. Rear Admiral Metruck also helped oversee Coast \nGuard missions across waterways encompassing the states of California, \nArizona, Nevada, Utah, and the offshore waters of Mexico and Central \nAmerica. Additionally, he served as U.S. Coast Guard Liaison to the \nU.S. Mission to the United Nations in New York City.\n  Rear Admiral Metruck is from Massena, NY, and graduated in 1982 from \nthe U.S. Coast Guard Academy, where he earned a bachelor of science \ndegree in ocean engineering. He was awarded a master's degree in public \nadministration from Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of \nGovernment. He has also served as a military fellow at the Center for \nStrategic and International Studies in Washington, DC, and the Coast \nGuard fellow on the Chief of Naval Operation's Strategic Studies Group \nbased in Newport, RI.\n  There are many of us in this Chamber who have worked with him and his \nstaff on important issues over the years. Today I express our \ncollective gratitude to him for devoting his career to keeping us safe. \nI speak for many in the Senate, in Delaware, and around our Nation in \nwishing Rear Admiral Metruck and his wife Peggy Duxbury a great next \nchapter in their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/senate-section/article/S2453-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO COLONEL MICHAEL FRANCIS\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, today I wish to honor a man who has served \nfaithfully for 27 years in the U.S. Air Force, with the vast majority \nof that service in the Missouri Air National Guard. It is a big loss, \nbut Col. Michael Francis is scheduled to depart the 131st Bomb Wing at \nWhiteman Air Force Base on May 15, 2016, after a long and distinguished \nrecord of service in the unit beginning July 28, 1998.\n  I think it is important to note that Colonel Francis has been \nassociated with a unit whose history has spanned over nine decades and \nwhose former members have included the likes of aviation pioneer \nCharles Lindbergh.\n  Colonel Francis commissioned in the U.S. Air Force in 1989 as a \ngraduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy and, after almost a decade, \ntransitioned from Active Duty to the Air National Guard, continuing his \ndream of a career as a fighter pilot in the F-15 Eagle.\n  Throughout Colonel Francis's service at the 131st, he has seen the \nunit transition from the F-15, the Nation's premier homeland defense \nand air superiority aircraft, to the B-2, the Nation's lethal stealth \nbomber involved in global missions. Since being chosen to command the \nfirst B-2 Operations Group in the Air National Guard when the 131st \ntransitioned from the F-15 Eagle to the B-2 Spirit, Colonel Francis has \nbeen a standout leader in the nuclear community. His achievements boast \nnothing less than perfection. As the present wing commander, Colonel \nFrancis paved a new path for the National Guard by leading his unit to \nbe the first bomb wing certified for full-spectrum nuclear operations \nand was entrusted with strategic nuclear deterrent operations for our \ncountry.\n  Throughout his long career at the 131st, Colonel Francis remained \ndedicated to the vital missions of the Air National Guard. However, he \nalso never forgot his commitment to his wife, Jane, and sons, Greg and \nBrian.\n  While Colonel Francis might be leaving the 131st Bomb Wing, he will \ncontinue his selflessness in service to this great country. Colonel \nFrancis will be reassigned to the Missouri National Guard Headquarters \nand promoted to brigadier general.\n  Again, I wish to extend Col. Michael J. Francis my sincere \ncongratulations upon his new assignment and thanks for the years of \nservice he has rendered to the 131st Bomb Wing, the State of Missouri, \nand the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/senate-section/article/S2453-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2453-S2454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ALASKA MISSION 6 HONOR FLIGHT\n\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize six veterans \nfrom Alaska who are in Washington this week as part of the Alaska \nMission 6 Honor Flight. These veterans are here to witness and \nexperience our Nation's most hallowed memorials--built to honor their \nservice and sacrifice and that of their brothers and sisters in arms.\n  On behalf of Alaska's congressional delegation, our State, and our \ncountry, I welcome these heroes to Washington and extend to them my \nsincere gratitude for their service.\n  Participating in the Alaska Mission 6 Honor Flight are John J. \nBoulette and William K. Zimmer, U.S. Navy veterans of the Korean war; \nAlexander Crockett Blanchard and Alfred Dawkins, U.S. Army veterans of \nthe Vietnam war; Neal Henry Dallman, a U.S. Navy veteran of the Vietnam \nwar; and Arnold Patrick McDonald, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran of the \nVietnam war.\n  Without the sacrifices of these six men and so many others, defending \npeace and liberty in some of the most dangerous corners of the world \nduring\n\n[[Page S2454]]\n\nharrowing and dark times, we would not be able to enjoy the prosperity \nand freedom that are hallmarks of our great Nation to this day.\n  Since 2005, more than 170,000 veterans have participated in Honor \nFlights to Washington. Giving veterans the opportunity to make this \ntrip is a small endeavor in comparison to the gravity of the challenges \nthey faced, but it is an important gesture to let them know that their \nfellow Americans have not forgotten the hardships they endured on our \nbehalf, nor the many men and women in uniform who made the ultimate \nsacrifice for our freedom. Honor Flights are made possible principally \nthanks to the generous donations of patriotic Americans who want to \ngive veterans the honor they deserve.\n  On behalf of all Alaskans, I wish to extend my sincerest thanks to \nthe Alaska Mission 6 veterans, for the selfless dedication they have \nshown to our country, the often unheralded sacrifices of their \nfamilies, and the enduring example they have given to future \ngenerations.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the outstanding \nservice of Black Hills National Forest supervisor, Craig Bobzien, as he \nretires from the U.S. Forest Service. Craig was placed in charge of \nmanaging the Black Hills National Forest in May 2005, and for more than \n10 years, the Black Hills National Forest has been under Craig's direct \nsupervision.\n  Craig began his path to South Dakota as a 1973 graduate of Raytown \nSouth High School in Raytown, MO. After high school, he pursued his \nbachelor's degree in forest science at Colorado State University and \nthen went on to a serve in many roles in conservation and forestry. \nPrevious to his appointment at the Black Hills National Forest, he \nserved in other capacities for the U.S. Forest Service in Idaho, \nMontana, Washington State, and at the U.S. Forest Service headquarters \nin Washington, DC.\n  Since being appointed to oversee the Black Hills National Forest, \nCraig has been its longest serving supervisor. Over his tenure of \nalmost 11 years, Craig has done an exceptional job as a steward of the \nBlack Hills National Forest's 1.2 million acres in South Dakota and \nWyoming. He managed those 1.2 million acres of forestland during some \nof the toughest fire seasons in recent memory.\n  Craig's leadership during the Rocky Mountain Region's devastating \npine beetle epidemic has been instrumental as he coordinated with other \nFederal, State, and private stakeholders to combat one of the largest \nepidemics of this pest since the 1900s. Craig initiated the first \nlarge-landscape management area in the Black Hills National Forest for \nmountain pine beetle treatment, which has set an example of topline \nmanagement others are now following.\n  Over the years, I have appreciated the cooperation of Craig and his \nteam of over 300 employees in our efforts to assess and address the \nmany threats to the health of the Black Hills.\n  Craig, thank you for your service to South Dakota and our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/senate-section/article/S2454-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO HUGH McDONALD\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Hugh \nMcDonald, president of Entergy Arkansas, as he prepares to retire.\n  Hugh McDonald is a resident of Little Rock and has been with Entergy \nsince 1982. He holds a bachelor's of science degree in construction \nmanagement from North Dakota State University and a master of business \nadministration degree from the University of New Orleans.\n  Hugh began his career at Entergy over 30 years ago in Louisiana, \nwhere he rose through the ranks before being promoted to director of \nregulatory affairs for Entergy Texas and then senior vice president of \nenergy retail operations. He came to Arkansas 16 years ago to accept \nhis current position.\n  Entergy Arkansas provides electricity to approximately 700,000 \ncustomers in 63 counties and is a subsidiary of Entergy Corporation. As \nthe head of Arkansas' largest utility, McDonald demonstrated excellent \nleadership during his 16-year tenure. He led its decision to withdraw \nfrom the system agreement that forced Arkansas ratepayers to partially \nbear the cost of producing electricity in other Entergy States.\n  He also spearheaded the movement to join the Midcontinent Independent \nSystem Operator, which allowed greater access to economic generation \nresources and saved Arkansas customers $46 million in the first year of \nparticipation.\n  Hugh is a past board member and board chair of the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce. He also serves on the boards of the Arkansas State Chamber of \nCommerce, the Arkansas Research Alliance Board, the Little Rock \nRegional Chamber of Commerce, and Fifty for the Future. In addition, \nHugh serves on the boards of the University of Arkansas Sam Walton \nCollege of Business Advisory Board, the UALR College of Business \nAdvisory Council, the UAMS BioVentures Advisory Board, and the Nature \nConservancy of Arkansas.\n  Let me reiterate how grateful I am for Hugh McDonald's management and \nvision during his time at the helm of Entergy Arkansas. His guidance \nand stewardship of the company has resulted in vital, reliable \nelectricity for thousands of Arkansans across the State.

Mr. President, I would like to honor Mary Lorraine \nWood Borman of Fayetteville, AR, as this week's Arkansan of the Week \nfor her commitment to the National Down Syndrome Society as a self-\nadvocate ambassador for the great State of Arkansas. Her advocacy to \nimprove the quality of life for those living with down syndrome is \nnoteworthy, and she is a joy and inspiration to many across the state.\n  Outside of her work as an activist, Mary is an involved and \nmultitalented junior at Fayetteville High School in Fayetteville, AR. \nNot only does she excel academically--as indicated by her track record \nas an honor roll student--but she is also a gifted athlete and has won \nawards in swimming events at the Arkansas State Special Olympic Games \nfor 3 years. Mary is also a talented dancer and actress, specializing \nin hip-hop, jazz, and the waltz.\n  I recently had the pleasure of meeting Mary when she visited my \nWashington, DC, office while in town for the Buddy Walk hosted each \nyear by the National Down Syndrome Society. Because of Mary's advocacy \nand compelling reasoning, I cosponsored the ABLE to Work Act of 2016 \nshortly after our meeting.

It \nspans 135 miles and boasts many outdoor trails along which visitors \nexperience beautiful bluffs, adventurous rapids, and have the \nopportunity to take part in a whole host of outdoor recreational \nactivities. Undoubtedly, visitors to the Buffalo National River leave \nwith an understanding of why Arkansas is proudly billed as ``the \nNatural State.''\n  This year the Buffalo National River has planned several celebratory \nevents to commemorate the National Park Service's 100th birthday. These \ninclude\n\n[[Page S2455]]\n\nthe Centennial Iron Ranger Challenge 2016, which is taking place in all \nArkansas national parks this year.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 50th \nAnniversary of the Associated Logging Contractors of Idaho.\n  The Associated Logging Contractors, Inc., of Idaho, ALC, have an \nimportant voice in advocating for policies that support an essential \nsector of Idaho--the logging and wood-hauling industry. Throughout the \npast 50 years since its organization, the association has worked to \nserve its purpose of ``developing programs that are instrumental in \nhelping members to reduce costs of operation and to craft creative \nsolutions to problems confronting the industry.'' ALC represents nearly \n400 independent logging contractor businesses from across Idaho.\n  From Endangered Species Act reform, to boosting rural economies, to \naddressing forest health and much more, the ALC has been involved in a \nwide range of discussions central to Idaho. I value the organization's \nand its members' input and involvement in shaping solutions to our \nnatural resources challenges. We have much work ahead, but progress is \nbeing made on public lands issues to the benefit of Idahoans and our \neconomy. Positive developments in job opportunities and more timber \nidentified for harvest for the betterment of forest health are the \nresult of the State and Federal Government working more closely with \nprivate landowners and the logging community to make progress toward \nthe removal of salvage timber from last year's fires.\n  While challenging, collaboration is working, and ALC members have \nbeen instrumental in advancing this effort. The organization has much \nto be proud of for its efforts in bringing folks together to achieve \nsolutions and working toward their implementation. Collaboration is \ndifficult but indispensable work, as it brings lasting advancements for \nhabitats, recreation, rural economies, and job production. I have \ngreatly valued ALC member's support of local collaborative efforts.\n  Congratulations to the members of the Associated Logging Contractors \nof Idaho on 50 years of accomplishments. Thank you for your hard work \nbuilding up our great State and Nation. I wish you all the best for \ncontinued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/senate-section/article/S2455-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/senate-section/article/S2455-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/senate-section/article/S2455-4", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2455-S2457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n        EC-5223.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Tennessee urging the United States Congress to \n     mandate, and provide an adequate budget for, the Department \n     of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to establish \n     rules for manufacturing, siting, and licensing of small \n     modular reactors and liquid core molten salt reactors to be \n     built and operated in the United States by private industry \n     for the production of energy and medical isotopes; to the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution No. 507\n\n       Whereas, Tennessee has many finite natural energy \n     resources; and\n       Whereas, world energy demand and usage are expected to \n     increase; and\n       Whereas, is vital to the country's energy future to provide \n     abundant base-load power and peaking energy-on-demand power \n     affordably; and\n       Whereas, extending Tennessee's current energy boom will \n     require the creation of a long-term energy plan and the \n     development of clean and affordable energy technologies such \n     as liquid core molten salt reactors and small modular \n     reactors; and\n       Whereas, the United States of America possesses a nearly \n     inexhaustible supply of thorium and uranium (more than a \n     billion years' supply of energy) that dramatically exceeds \n     all known potential energy reserves; and\n       Whereas, the elements thorium and uranium have the \n     practical potential to provide unlimited energy resources for \n     Tennesseans and Americans on demand in the near future and to \n     provide many other tangible benefits; and\n       Whereas, better utilization of thorium and uranium in \n     specially designed reactors such as molten salt reactors, \n     including liquid fluoride thorium reactors, can provide \n     energy security from other nations by utilizing Tennessee \n     coal and a reactor's nuclear heat energy to produce an \n     abundance of synthetic liquid transportation fuels. These \n     synthetic fuels can be produced for many future generations \n     of Tennesseans in a safe, affordable, and most \n     environmentally friendly manner; and\n       Whereas, the efficient use of thorium or uranium in a \n     specially designed molten salt reactor allows for greatly \n     increased environmentally friendly energy production that \n     improves the economics of many recycling technologies and \n     raises the standard of living; and\n       Whereas, it is incumbent upon this body to be forward-\n     thinking in addressing the future energy challenges for the \n     next generation of Tennesseans; and\n       Whereas, Tennessee is uniquely capable to commercialize \n     small modular reactors, liquid core molten salt reactors, and \n     integral fast reactors with its research and development \n     assets of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, where such \n     technology was first developed, and other private companies \n     and nonprofit organizations that specialize in nuclear \n     technology development in Tennessee; and\n       Whereas, the academic, scientific, manufacturing, and \n     business communities in Tennessee have some of the best \n     talent and research and development records in the world. \n     Development of this groundbreaking and economic game-changing \n     technology would serve Tennessee's and America's economics \n     better than current federal efforts to develop this \n     technology in partnership with China; and\n       Whereas, advanced technology using thorium and uranium can \n     affordably provide medical isotopes of materials for medical \n     uses such as treating cancer and HIV/AIDS, diagnostic \n     procedures, and improved health care; and\n       Whereas, S.99, the ``American Medical Isotopes Production \n     Act of 2011,'' was signed into law by President Barack Obama \n     on January 2, 2013, and mandates a reliable domestic supply \n     of molybdenum-99 for medical imaging and diagnostics; and\n       Whereas, molybdenum-99 is used in more than sixteen million \n     medical procedures annually in the United States; and\n       Whereas, no domestic supply of molybdenum-99 currently \n     exists, and present suppliers use old reactors that result in \n     frequent supply disruptions; and\n       Whereas, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, charged with \n     licensing nuclear reactors, is not well-funded for \n     establishing procedures for new, advanced reactor designs \n     based on different architectures from today's fleet of light \n     water reactors; and\n       Whereas, small modular reactors and liquid core molten salt \n     reactors represent a business opportunity that Tennessee's \n     manufacturing base is well-suited to exploit. This could \n     potentially result in creating forty thousand manufacturing \n     jobs in total within Tennessee, because these jobs have the \n     ability to complement Tennessee's coal industry, oil \n     industry, and natural gas hydraulic fracturing industry by \n     increasing jobs in those industries: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the One Hundred \n     Ninth General Assembly of the State of Tennessee, the Senate \n     Concurring, That the General Assembly supports the creation \n     of a long-term energy plan that addresses the long-term \n     energy needs of the state; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the General Assembly encourages and supports \n     the research and development of liquid-core-molten-salt-\n     reactor and small-modular-reactor technologies as a long-term \n     solution to Tennessee's energy needs; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the General Assembly urges the Congress of \n     the United States to mandate, and provide an adequate budget \n     for, the Department of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory \n     Commission to establish rules for manufacturing, siting, and \n     licensing of small modular reactors and liquid core molten \n     salt reactors to be built and operated in the United States \n     by private industry for the production of energy and medical \n     isotopes; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the General Assembly supports investing in, \n     acquiring grants for, implementing programs for, encouraging \n     Tennessee institutions of higher learning to conduct research \n     into, and attracting companies for the development of future \n     technologies that will provide greater energy resources more \n     affordably, abundantly, and in a more environmentally \n     friendly manner than is being done at present; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Clerk of the House of Representatives \n     transmit certified copies of this resolution to the President \n     of the United States, the Secretary of the United States \n     Department of Energy, the Commissioners of the Nuclear \n     Regulatory Commission, the Speaker and Clerk of the United \n     States House of Representatives, the President Pro Tempore \n     and Secretary of the United States Senate, and each member of \n     the Tennessee Congressional delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/senate-section/article/S2457-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. ALEXANDER, from the Committee on Health, Education, \n     Labor, and Pensions, with an amendment in the nature of a \n     substitute:\n       S. 2680.

A bill to reauthorize the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights \nCrime Act of 2007; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, today I, along with Senator Leahy, Senator \nMcCaskill, and Senator Blunt, will introduce the reauthorization of the \nEmmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act.\n\n[[Page S2461]]\n\n  To give a little bit of history for my colleagues on this, this \nreally stems from 1955, and it was the summer of 1955 when a young 14-\nyear-old left Chicago, IL, and traveled to Mississippi to visit \nrelatives. While on that trip, he made a grave mistake. He whistled at \na White woman. Because of that, Emmett Till was killed. The \ninvestigation that resulted from his death culminated in a 67-minute \ndeliberation by a jury that found both men and acquitted them. Both \nindividuals, Roy Bryant and J.W. Milam confessed to the murder in 1956. \nIn our criminal justice system, when you are found not guilty, you \ncan't be retried. There was an injustice that was done. In this \nparticular case, the injustice was done to Emmett Till, a 14-year-old.\n  Without an understanding of how many people might have been affected \nby the same lack of justice applied equally, there was a self-taught \nindividual that became an activist. His name was Alvin Sykes. Alvin \nSykes became a civil rights advocate. He was a cold case researcher. \nThrough the frustration of trying to get a bill to the U.S. Senate that \nmy good friend Tom Coburn held up, Alvin Sykes did what most people \ndon't do in this town. Rather than hold a press conference to talk \nabout a civil rights bill, he called Tom Coburn and said: I would like \nto see you.\n  He sat down with Tom Coburn, and Tom said: What is it you are trying \nto do?\n  The two bonded at that point, and they rewrote the bill to reflect \nwhat Tom felt was the right legislative approach to create in this \ncountry--and fund, I might add--an effort to look back at all potential \ncivil rights cases that were pre-1969.\n  Since the bill's passage, I think in 2008, the Department of Justice, \nalong with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, along with local law \nenforcement, has gone through 113 cases. I might add that 15 are still \nopen, and in one they found a reason to convict an individual in the \nyear 2010 from a case pre-1969.\n  So let me say for my colleagues, we will introduce a bill to \nreauthorize this act. Why? Very simply, because just last year, the \nCold Case Justice Initiative at Syracuse University identified 196 \npotential cases that weren't caught when the Justice Department and the \nFBI looked at their cold case files.\n  Now, when Senator Coburn and Alvin Sykes put this legislation \ntogether, they funded the effort with a mere $13 million. With that $13 \nmillion, it created an effort within the Justice Department in the \nCivil Rights Division and in the FBI. What we found is that it is never \ntoo late to go back and fix mistakes that you make.\n  So I will ask my colleagues at some point in the not too distant \nfuture, probably by unanimous consent, to pass the Emmett Till Civil \nRights Crime Reauthorization Act of 2016. What this does differently \nthan what the original piece of legislation did that Tom Coburn and \nAlvin Sykes hammered out is that it reauthorizes within the existing \noffices of the FBI and the Department of Justice and it more clearly \ndelineates the responsibility of the deputy crime chief of the DOJ \nCivil Rights Division and provides for a joint task force for enhanced \ncollaboration. It eliminates the pre-1970 date, and says that if the \nlaw was applied unequally, it doesn't matter when it was, and we should \nlook at it. It eliminates the sunset provision on the Emmett Till law.\n  This is a permanent piece of legislation, where the DOJ and FBI will \nconsult with civil rights organizations, universities, and other \nentities to reach out and pull in potentially any other cases that \nshould be reviewed. Of course, it allows for the Department of Justice \nto reopen certain cold cases that merit a second review as necessary, \nand it maintains the current funding levels. It is a very worthy bill \nto support.\n  As much as I would really like to make my comments about Emmett Till, \nI can fill in a number of potentially different names. But the name I \nwant to come to the floor to talk about is Alvin Sykes. Alvin Sykes is \na self-taught civil rights advocate, a person who taught himself how to \ndo these investigations into civil rights cases, a guy who is \npassionate about trying to bring justice to individuals who are no \nlonger here.\n  We are lobbied on Capitol Hill all the time by people who have an \ninterest--it could be personal or it could be professional--in a \nparticular issue. Alvin Sykes had nobody lobbying. They were dead. \nAlvin Sykes saw a potential injustice in our judicial system and spent \na lifetime passionately pursuing how he as one individual could make \nthis right.\n  This is a tremendous success story about something that Congress has \ndone that is good. What we need to do is extend the good work of Tom \nCoburn and, more importantly, the passion of Alvin Sykes to say that \nnot only was this needed then but it is needed now and into the future.\n  So I come to you today to give you a preview before this bill is \npresented and to thank my cosponsors, Senator Leahy, Senator McCaskill, \nand Senator Blunt, but more importantly, to thank Alvin Sykes. Without \nAlvin Sykes' passion and commitment, this injustice wouldn't have been \nbrought to the attention of Tom Coburn, and Tom Coburn wouldn't have \nused his incredible passion to pass this bill originally.\n  It is my hope that we can make not only Alvin Sykes proud of the work \nof the Senate but that, in a small way, it might send a message to \nthose who are related to Emmett Till and to the hundreds of others who \nmight have been served an injustice and so that their relatives can \nunderstand that they did have value and that value is for others--that \nthey may not be exposed to an injustice in the future.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to be part of the bicameral and \nbipartisan introduction for the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights \nCrimes Reauthorization Act of 2016. There has been no stronger advocate \non this bill than my friend, John Lewis, and I am proud to stand with \nhim on this effort. In 2008, we passed this bill to strengthen the \nFederal Government's ability to investigate and prosecute unsolved \nmurders from the civil rights era. The bill expires in fiscal year \n2017, but it is important that we reauthorize the bill prior to its \nexpiration so that the Department of Justice can continue its work on \nthese unsolved cases, uninterrupted.\n  More than 60 years ago, Emmett Till, a 14-year-old African-American \nteenager, was brutally murdered, but no one was ever punished for it. \nHis death was a pivotal--and tragic--moment in the Civil Rights era, \nand it continues to serve as a reminder that too many families suffer \nfrom the unsolved murders of their loved ones during the civil rights \nera without receiving justice. The way to best serve these families is \nto provide our Federal Government with the tools it needs to \ninvestigate these unsolved crimes, and to hopefully, bring some sense \nof closure for these families. The bill we are introducing today does \njust that.\n  Since the bill's passage in 2008, the Justice Department and others \nhave been assisting families in their quest for justice in resolving \nthese unsolved murders. Specifically, the Civil Rights and Restorative \nJustice Project of Northeastern University and the Cold Case Justice \nInitiative at the Syracuse University College of Law have both served \nas invaluable resources and guides for these families. I thank them for \ntheir work on these cases, as well as their input in improving this \nbill. Besides reauthorizing the bill, we have made some changes to \naddress the issues that the families and the organizations have raised. \nThis bill will improve coordination between the various law enforcement \nbranches and the organizations involved; increase transparency and \naccountability; and continue to resolve these cases without concern of \nthe legislation sunsetting.\n  I thank Congressman Lewis for his tireless work on behalf of the \nfamilies of these victims of unsolved murders from the civil rights \nera. I also thank Senator McCaskill of Missouri, Senator Burr of North \nCarolina, and Senator Blunt of Missouri, who have joined us in \nintroducing this bipartisan bill. I hope that Senators Burr and Blunt \ncan convince the Republican Chairman to move this bill through the \nJudiciary Committee and Republican Leadership to give this bill a vote \non the floor.\n  The road to justice can be long and winding, but we must continue to \ndo our part to help these families obtain justice and closure for their \nlosses.\n\n[[Page S2462]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/senate-section/article/S2462-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 440--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE ABOUT THE \n  IMPORTANCE OF EFFECTIVE CIVIC AND GOVERNMENT EDUCATION PROGRAMS IN \n                      SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Wicker, and Mr. \nWhitehouse) submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 440\n\n       Whereas civic and government education is essential to the \n     preservation and improvement of the constitutional government \n     of the United States;\n       Whereas civic and government education programs foster \n     understanding of the history and principles of the \n     constitutional government of the United States, including \n     principles that are embodied in certain fundamental documents \n     and speeches, such as the Declaration of Independence, the \n     Constitution of the United States, the Bill of Rights, the \n     Federalist Papers, the Gettysburg Address, and Dr. Martin \n     Luther King, Jr.'s ``I Have a Dream'' speech;\n       Whereas research shows that too few people in the United \n     States understand basic principles of the constitutional \n     government of the United States, such as the natural rights \n     set forth in the Declaration of Independence, the existence \n     and functions of the 3 branches of the Federal Government, \n     checks and balances, and other concepts fundamental to \n     informed citizenship;\n       Whereas, since the founding of the United States, schools \n     in the United States have had a strong civic mission to \n     prepare students to be informed, rational, humane, and \n     involved citizens who are committed to the values and \n     principles of the constitutional government of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas a free society relies on the knowledge, skills, and \n     virtue of the citizens of the society, particularly the \n     individuals elected to public office to represent the \n     citizens;\n       Whereas, while many institutions help to develop the \n     knowledge and skills and shape the civic character of people \n     in the United States, schools in the United States, including \n     elementary schools, bear a special and historic \n     responsibility for the development of civic competence and \n     civic responsibility of students;\n       Whereas student learning is enhanced by well-designed \n     classroom civic and government education programs that--\n       (1) incorporate instruction in government, history, law, \n     and democracy;\n       (2) promote discussion of current events and controversial \n     issues;\n       (3) link community service and the formal curriculum; and\n       (4) encourage students to participate in simulations of \n     democratic processes; and\n       Whereas research shows that the knowledge and expertise of \n     teachers are among the most important factors in increasing \n     student achievement: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) civic and government education is essential to the \n     well-being of the constitutional government of the United \n     States;\n       (2) comprehensive and formal instruction in civic and \n     government education would provide students a basis for \n     understanding the rights and responsibilities of citizens in \n     the constitutional government of the United States;\n       (3) elementary and secondary schools in the United States \n     are encouraged to offer courses on the history and theories \n     of the constitutional government of the United States, \n     using--\n       (A) innovative programs and curricula; or\n       (B) programs and curricula with a demonstrated \n     effectiveness in fostering civic competence, civic \n     responsibility, and a reasoned commitment to the fundamental \n     values and principles underlying the constitutional \n     government of the United States; and\n       (4) all teachers of civics and government are well served \n     by having access to adequate opportunities to enrich teaching \n     through professional development programs that enhance the \n     capacity of teachers to provide effective civic and \n     government education in the classroom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/26/senate-section/article/S2462-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 441--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT, DURING \n PUBLIC SERVICE RECOGNITION WEEK, PUBLIC SERVANTS SHOULD BE COMMENDED \n    FOR THEIR DEDICATION AND CONTINUED SERVICE TO THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP (for herself, Mr. Lankford, Mr. Carper, Mr. Johnson, Mr. \nTester, Ms. Ayotte, Mr. Peters, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Coons, Mr. Booker, Ms. \nBaldwin, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Brown, Mrs. \nMurray, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. King, Ms. Mikulski, and Mrs. Shaheen) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

and\n       (2) are on the front lines in the fight to defeat terrorism \n     and maintain homeland security;\n       Whereas public servants work in a professional manner to \n     build relationships with other countries and cultures in \n     order to better represent the interests and promote the \n     ideals of the United States;\n       Whereas public servants alert Congress and the public to \n     government waste, fraud, and abuse, and of dangers to public \n     health;\n       Whereas the individuals serving in the uniformed services, \n     as well as the skilled trade and craft employees of the \n     Federal Government who provide support to their efforts--\n       (1) are committed to doing their jobs regardless of the \n     circumstances;
