Mr. President, as colleagues have no doubt already \nnoted, a fiscal agreement has been filed that addresses a number of \nimportant issues. Members currently have the opportunity to review it. \nI hope they will take that opportunity. I will certainly have more to \nsay on the matter later. But for now, I encourage all our colleagues to \nexamine the agreement.\n  On the legislation before the Senate today, the challenges posed by \ncyber attacks are real and they are growing. They don't just threaten \ngovernments and businesses; they threaten individuals as well. Everyone \nunderstands that a cyber attack can be a deeply invasive attack on \npersonal privacy. Everyone understands that a cyber attack can be \nfinancially crippling. That is why everyone should want to see the \nbipartisan cyber security bill before us pass today.\n  Its voluntary information sharing provisions are key to defeating \ncyber attacks and protecting the personal information of the people we \nrepresent. We also know the bill contains measures to protect civil \nliberties and individual privacy.\n  It is no wonder the Senate voted to advance it by a large bipartisan \nvote of 83 to 14 last week. I want to thank Chairman Burr and Vice \nChairman Feinstein of the Intelligence Committee for their continued \nhard work on this legislation. We will consider a number of amendments \nfrom both sides of the aisle today. Then we will proceed to a final \nvote on the underlying bill. I urge every colleague to join me in \nvoting to protect the personal data, privacy, and property of the \nAmerican people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/senate-section/article/S7497-6", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ENERGY REGULATIONS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on one final matter, the Obama \nadministration recently published massive energy regulations that will \nnot do a thing to meaningfully affect global carbon levels. It will not \nmake a noticeable difference to the global environment. But it will \nship more middle-class jobs overseas. It will punish the poor. It will \nmake it even harder for coal families in States such as Kentucky to put \nfood on the table. In other words, it is facts-optional extremism \nwrapped in callous indifference. Senators from both parties are saying: \nEnough is enough.\n  We filed bipartisan measures that would allow Congress to overturn \nthese two-pronged regressive regulations. I joined Senator Heitkamp and \nSenator Capito on a measure that would address the prong that pertains \nto the existing energy sources. Senator Manchin joined me as I \nintroduced a measure that would address the prong that pertains to new \nenergy sources. Together these measures represent a comprehensive \nsolution. Colleagues will join me to speak about these resolutions \nlater today. I am sure they will say more about the measures we filed \nand the process associated with them.\n  But what everyone should know is this: The publication of these \nregulations does not represent an end but a beginning. It is the \nbeginning of a new front to defend hard-working middle-class Americans \nfrom massive, massive regulations that target them. That front is \nopening here in Congress, and it is opening across the country as \nStates file lawsuits and Governors stand up for their own middle-class \nconstituents. The battle may not be short, and the battle may not be \neasy, but Kentuckians and hard-working Americans should know that I am \ngoing to keep standing up for them throughout this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/senate-section/article/S7497-7", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It helps us avoid a major threat to \njobs and the general economy. The time to do away with the devastating \nsequester cuts that are harming our middle class and military is not in \nthe future. It is right now. Democrats hope to end sequestration for \nthe good of our great country.\n  Our work is not done.

Mr. President, it was 3 years ago this month that then-\nSecretary of Defense Leon Panetta warned the United States of a \npotential ``cyber Pearl Harbor.'' A cyber Pearl Harbor would be \ncrippling, and it would be a cyber attack on our Nation's banks, power \ngrid, government, and communications network.\n  If it sounds scary, that is because it is scary. Cyber terrorists \ncould potentially bring the United States to its knees. This \npotentiality is upon us. A catastrophic cyber attack is not farfetched. \nTed Koppel, the renowned journalist, has written another book, and the \nauthor reveals that our Nation's power grid is extremely vulnerable to \ncyber terrorism. Imagine the toll of these attacks: massive power \nblackouts, no telephone, no Internet capability--that is on your cell \nphones or whatever phones exist--overwhelmed first responders and an \ninfrastructure system reduced to chaos.\n  How vulnerable is our Nation to a cyber attack of this magnitude?\n  Former Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano, in the book \nthat was written, as I indicated, by Ted Koppel, stated that the \nlikelihood of an attack on our Nation's power grid is 80 to 90 \npercent--80 percent to 90 percent.\n  Craig Fugate, the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency, has had to think about a potential cyber attack. It is his job. \nListen to his assessment:\n\n       We're not a country that can go without power for a long \n     period of time without loss of life. Our systems, from water \n     treatment to hospitals to traffic control to all these things \n     that we expect every day, our ability to operate without \n     electricity is minimal.\n\n  A number of years ago we had, at the direction of Senator Mikulski--a \nlong-time member of the Intelligence Committee--a meeting where such an \nattack was discussed and the implications of it. That was years ago. It \nwas frightening then, and it is even more frightening now. But as Mr. \nFugate indicated, that is the scale of threat the United States faces \nwith cyber terrorism.\n  We as a country must do more to protect ourselves against this cyber \nterrorism. It can be done if Republicans will work with us. Democrats \ntried to pass comprehensive cyber security legislation years ago. What \nhappened? It was filibustered by the Republicans. They wouldn't even \nlet us on this legislation. They wouldn't even allow us to debate the \nbill. Whatever their reasoning, I am glad the Republicans have finally \nchanged course in this decision and allowed this simple bill to move \nforward. We support this legislative effort, but we recognize that it \nis far, far too weak.\n  Cyber terrorism and cyber attacks are part of today's world. But \nRepublicans are denying the seriousness of this, as they are denying \nsomething clear to everyone in the world except my Republican Senate \nand House Members. We have climate change taking place that is really \nhurting everybody, with rare, rare exception. Cyber terrorism and cyber \nattacks are part of today's world, just like climate change. To not \nmove forward with more comprehensive cyber security legislation and to \nignore what is happening in our world dealing with climate change will \nin the years to come be considered legislative malpractice. I am sorry \nto say that legislative malpractice is not on our shoulders. We wanted \nfor years to do something with climate change. We can't. It is not even \nsomething that the Republicans will allow us to discuss. We wanted for \nyears to do something with cyber security. They refused to do so. We \nhave a bill before us that is better than nothing, and we support it. \nBut it is far, far too weak.\n  Mr. President, I see the assistant Democratic leader on the floor. \nWould the Chair announce before he talks to us what we are going to do \nhere today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/senate-section/article/S7498-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until 11 \na.m. will be equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees.\n  The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the debate which we will engage in today \non the floor of the Senate is really one that parallels the historic \ndebates that have occurred in the course of our Nation's history. When \na great democracy sets out to defend its citizens and to engage in \nsecurity, it really is with a challenge: Can we keep our Nation safe \nand still protect our rights and liberties? That question has been \nraised, and that challenge has been raised time and again.\n  It was President Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War who suspended \nthe right of habeas corpus. It was challenged by some as an \noverextension by the executive branch, but President Lincoln thought it \nwas necessary to resolve the Civil War in favor of the Union. In World \nWar I, the passage of the Alien and Sedition Acts raised questions \nabout the loyalty of Americans who question many of the great issues \nthat were being raised during that war. We certainly all remember what \nhappened during World War II when, even under President Franklin \nRoosevelt, thousands of Japanese Americans were interned because of our \nconcerns about safety and security in the United States. It continued \nin the Cold War with the McCarthy hearings and accusations that certain \nmembers of the State Department and other officials were, in fact, \nCommunist sympathizers. That history goes on and on.\n\n  So whenever we engage in a question of the security and safety for \nour Nation, we are always going to be faced\n\n[[Page S7499]]\n\nwith that challenge. Are we going too far? Are we giving too much \nauthority to the government? Are we sacrificing our individual rights \nand liberty and privacy far more than we should to keep this Nation \nsafe? That, in fact, is the debate we have today on the most \nsophisticated new form of warfare--cyber war.\n  Cyber security is an enormous concern not just for private companies \nbut for every American. Data breaches happen almost every day. We read \nnot that long ago that 21 million current and former Federal employees \nhad their records breached and stolen from the Office of Personnel \nManagement. Just this month more than 700,000 T-Mobile users in my home \nState may have had their information compromised by hackers. It seems \nthere isn't a month that goes by where we don't hear of another \nsecurity breach. That is why we need to take steps to improve data \nsecurity and share cyber threat information.\n  Chairman Burr and Ranking Member Feinstein worked long and hard to \nput together a bill to encourage private and governmental entities to \nshare potential threat information. This bill has evolved over 5 years. \nNo one has worked harder during that period of time than my colleague, \nSenator Feinstein of California. Senator Burr is now joining her in \nthis effort.\n  Many are skeptical about the bill before us. Some have raised those \nconcerns on the floor. But we look at the major companies that are \nopposing this bill as currently written--Apple, IBM, Microsoft, Google, \nFacebook, and Amazon--just a few of the major companies that have said \nthey can't support the bill that is on the floor today. They note that \nthe bill does not require companies or the Federal Government to \nprotect private information, including personal emails, email \naddresses, and more. In fact, this bill preempts all laws that would \nprevent a company or agency from sharing personal information.\n  I am encouraged that the managers of this bill have moved in the \ndirection of addressing this concern. They have limited the \nauthorization to share cyber threat information to ``cyber security \npurposes''--a valuable step toward making sure the bill is not used as \nsurveillance. They have included a provision requiring government \nprocedures to notify Americans if their information is shared \nmistakenly by the government. They have clarified that the \nauthorization to employ defensive measures--or defensive ``hacking''--\ndoes not allow an entity to gain unauthorized access to another's \ncomputer network.\n  There will be some amendments before us today that I will support \nwhich I think strengthen the privacy protections that should be \nincluded in this bill.\n  I am a cosponsor of the Franken amendment to improve the definitions \nof ``cyber security threat'' and other cyber threat indicators. \nNarrowing this definition from information that ``may'' be a threat to \ninformation that is ``reasonably likely'' to pose a threat would reduce \nthe amount of potentially personal information shared under the bill.\n  I also urge my colleagues to support the Wyden amendment to \nstrengthen the requirement that private companies remove sensitive \npersonal information before sharing cyber threat indicators. Again, \nthis amendment would limit the amount of potentially personal \ninformation shared under the bill.\n  I support the Coons amendment to give the Department of Homeland \nSecurity time to remove or scrub personal information from the \ninformation it shares with other Federal agencies. There is simply no \nneed for personal information unrelated to a threat to be shared with \nlaw enforcement agencies such as the Department of Justice and NSA.\n  These amendments would strengthen privacy protections in the bill \nmuch more than the original managers' package. I look forward to \nworking with Senators Burr and Feinstein and others to ensure that the \nfinal bill addresses our cyber security concerns while still protecting \nprivacy--something I know we all want to do.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nbe charged equally on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, shortly we will once again begin the process \non the cyber security bill. We will start votes hopefully right at 11 \no'clock. We will try to work through five amendments this morning and \nreturn this afternoon with a short period of debate, and once again, at \n4 o'clock, we will take up five additional votes--or possibly four--and \nbe at the point where we could conclude this legislation.\n  Let me say to my colleagues that the Senate has tried for several \nyears now to bring cyber security legislation to the Senate floor and \nfind the will to pass it. With the work of the vice chairman, I think \nwe have been able to succeed in that. We enjoyed a 14-to-1 vote out of \nthe committee, showing tremendous bipartisan support. Thousands of \nbusinesses and almost 100 organizations around the country are \nsupportive of the bill. But, more importantly, in the last several days \nthe bill has gained the support of the Wall Street Journal and the \nWashington Post--not necessarily publications that chime in on the need \nfor certain pieces of legislation from the Senate floor, but in this \nparticular case, two publications understand the importance of cyber \nsecurity legislation getting signed into law.\n  This is the first step, and conferencing with the House will come \nshortly after. I am proud to say that we already have legislation the \nWhite House says they support. So I think we are in the final stretches \nof actually getting legislation into law that would voluntarily allow \ncompanies to partner with the Federal Government when their systems \nhave been breached, when personal data is at risk.\n  I still say today to those folks both in this institution and outside \nof this institution who are concerned with privacy that I think the \nvice chairman and I have bent over backward to accommodate concerns. \nSome concerns still exist. We don't believe they are necessarily \naccurate and that only by utilizing this system will, in fact, we \nunderstand whether we have been deficient anywhere.\n  There are also several companies that are not supportive of this \nbill, as is their right. I will say this: From the beginning, we \ncommitted to make this bill voluntary, meaning that any company in \nAmerica, if its systems are breached, could choose voluntarily to \ncreate the partnership with the Federal Government. Nobody is mandated \nto do it. So I speak specifically to those companies right now: You \nmight not like the legislation, but for goodness' sakes, do not deprive \nevery other business in America from having the opportunity to have \nthis partnership. Do not deprive the other companies in this country \nfrom trying to minimize the amount of personal data that is lost \nbecause there has been a cyber attack. Do not try to stop this \nlegislation and put us in a situation where we ignore the fact that \ncyber attacks are going to happen with greater frequency from more \nindividuals and that the sooner we learn how to defend our systems, the \nbetter off personal data will be in the United States of America.\n  This is a huge deal. The vice chairman and I from day one have said \nto our Members that we will entertain any good ideas that we think \nstrengthen the bill. On both sides of the aisle, we have said to \nMembers that if this breaks the agreement that we have for the support \nwe need, because they don't believe the policy is right, then\n\n[[Page S7500]]\n\nwe will lock arms and we will vote against amendments.\n  We have about eight amendments today. On a majority of those, we will \ndo that. I am proud to tell my colleagues that during the overnight and \nthis morning--we will announce today that we have taken care of the \nFlake amendment with a modification. We are changing the sunset on the \nlegislation to 10 years, and we will accept the Flake amendment on a \nvoice vote later this morning. We continue even over these last hours \nto try to modify legislation that can be agreed to on both sides of the \naisle but, more importantly, without changing the delicate balance we \nhave tried to legislate into this legislation.\n  I am sure Members will come down over the next 35 minutes, but at \nthis time I will yield the floor so the vice chairman can seek time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I wish to begin by thanking the chairman for his work on the bill.\n  For me, this has been a 6-year effort. It hasn't been easy. It hasn't \nbeen easy because we have tried to strike a balance and make the bill \nunderstandable so that there would be a cooperative effort to share \nbetween companies and the government.\n  Last Thursday the Senate showed its support for moving forward with \ntwo strong votes. We had a vote of 83 to 14 to invoke cloture on the \nsubstitute amendment, showing that there is, in fact, deep bipartisan \nsupport for moving significant legislation to the President's desk.\n  To that end, I ask unanimous consent that editorials from the two \nmajor U.S. newspapers be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 22, 2015]\n\n      The Senate Should Take a Crucial First Step on Cybersecurity\n\n                          (By Editorial Board)\n\n       After years of failure to find a consensus on \n     cybersecurity, the Senate is expected to vote early next week \n     on a bill that would enable the government and the private \n     sector to share information about malicious threats and \n     respond to them more quickly. The legislation is not going to \n     completely end the tidal wave of cyberattacks against the \n     government and corporations, but passing it is better than \n     doing nothing--and that is where Congress has left the matter \n     in recent years.\n       The legislation, approved by the Senate Select Committee on \n     Intelligence on a bipartisan 14-to-1 vote in March, is \n     intended to iron out legal and procedural hurdles to sharing \n     information on cyberthreats between companies and the \n     government. Private-sector networks have been extremely \n     vulnerable, while the government possesses sophisticated \n     tools that might be valuable in defending those networks. If \n     threats are shared in real time, they could be blunted. The \n     legislation is not a magic wand. Hackers innovate destructive \n     and intrusive attacks even faster than they can be detected. \n     The information sharing would be voluntary. But the bill is \n     at least a first step for Congress after several years of \n     inconclusive debate over how to respond to attacks that have \n     infiltrated networks ranging from those of Home Depot to the \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n       The biggest complaint about the bill is from privacy \n     advocates, including Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who cast the \n     sole dissenting vote on the intelligence committee. His \n     concerns have been amplified recently by several tech giants. \n     Apple told The Post this week that it opposes the legislation \n     because of privacy concerns. In a statement, the company \n     said, ``The trust of our customers means everything to us and \n     we don't believe security should come at the expense of their \n     privacy.'' Some other large technology firms are also \n     opposing the bill through a trade association. Separately, \n     alarmist claims have been made by privacy advocates who \n     describe it as a ``surveillance'' bill.\n       The notion that there is a binary choice between privacy \n     and security is false. We need both privacy protection and \n     cybersecurity, and the Senate legislation is one step toward \n     breaking the logjam on security. Sponsors have added privacy \n     protections that would scrub out personal information before \n     it is shared. They have made the legislation voluntary, so if \n     companies are really concerned, they can stay away. Abroad \n     coalition of business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of \n     Commerce, has backed the legislation, saying that cybertheft \n     and disruption are ``advancing in scope and complexity.''\n       The status quo is intolerable: Adversaries of the United \n     States are invading computer networks and hauling away \n     sensitive information and intellectual property by the \n     gigabyte. A much stronger response is called for in all \n     directions, both to defend U.S. networks and to punish those, \n     such as China, doing the stealing and spying. This \n     legislation is a needed defensive step from a Congress that \n     has so far not acted on a vital national concern.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 26, 2015]\n\n                     A Cyber Defense Bill, at Last\n\n\n         Data sharing can improve security and consumer privacy\n\n       By now everyone knows the threat from cyber attacks on \n     American individuals and business, and Congress finally seems \n     poised to do something about it. As early as Tuesday the \n     Senate may vote on a bill that would let businesses and the \n     government cooperate to shore up U.S. cyber defenses.\n       This should have been done long ago, but Democrats blocked \n     a bipartisan bill while they controlled the Senate and \n     President Obama insisted on imposing costly new cyber-\n     security mandates on business. The GOP Senate takeover in \n     2014 has broken the logjam, helped by high-profile attacks \n     against the likes of Sony, Home Depot, Ashley Madison and the \n     federal Office of Personnel Management.\n       Special thanks to WikiLeaks, the anti-American operation \n     that last week announced that its latest public offering \n     would be information hacked from the private email account of \n     CIA chief John Brennan. We assume Mr. Brennan's government \n     email is better protected, but then this is the same \n     government that let Hillary Clinton send top-secret \n     communications on her private email server.\n       Democrats have decided it's now bad politics to keep \n     resisting a compromise, and last week the Cybersecurity \n     Information Sharing Act co-sponsored by North Carolina \n     Republican Richard Burr and California Democrat Dianne \n     Feinstein passed the filibuster hurdle. A similar bill passed \n     the House in April 307-106.\n       The idea behind the legislation is simple: Let private \n     businesses share information with each other, and with the \n     government, to better fight an escalating and constantly \n     evolving cyber threat. This shared data might be the \n     footprint of hackers that the government has seen but private \n     companies haven't. Or it might include more advanced \n     technology that private companies have developed as a \n     defense.\n       Since hackers can strike fast, real-time cooperation is \n     essential. A crucial provision would shield companies from \n     private lawsuits and antitrust laws if they seek help or \n     cooperate with one another. Democrats had long resisted this \n     legal safe harbor at the behest of plaintiffs lawyers who \n     view corporate victims of cyber attack as another source of \n     plunder.\n       The plaintiffs bar aside, the bill's main opponents now are \n     big tech companies that are still traumatized by the fallout \n     from the Edward Snowden data theft. Apple, Dropbox and \n     Twitter, among others, say the bill doesn't do enough to \n     protect individual privacy and might even allow government \n     snooping.\n       Everyone knows government makes mistakes, but the far \n     larger threat to privacy is from criminal or foreign-\n     government hackers who aren't burdened by U.S. due-process \n     protections. Cooperation is voluntary, and the bill includes \n     penalties if government misuses the information. Before \n     either side can share data, personal information that might \n     jeopardize customer privacy must be scrubbed.\n       The tech giants are the outliers in this debate, while \n     nearly all of the rest of American business supports the \n     bill. The White House has said Mr. Obama will sign the \n     legislation, which would make it a rare example of bipartisan \n     cooperation. The security-privacy debate is often portrayed \n     as a zero-sum trade-off, but this bill looks like a win for \n     both: Helping companies better protect their data from cyber \n     thieves will enhance American privacy.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The first is from the Washington Post dated October \n22, entitled ``The Senate should take a crucial first step on \ncybersecurity.'' The second is in today's Wall Street Journal, and it \nis entitled ``A Cyber Defense Bill, At Last: Data sharing can improve \nsecurity and consumer privacy.''\n  I also note the endorsement from Secretary Jeh Johnson on October 22.\n  I have been privileged to work with our chairman. We have really \ntried to produce a balanced bill. We have tried to make it \nunderstandable to private industry so that companies understand it and \nare willing to cooperate. This bill will allow companies and the \ngovernment to voluntarily share information about cyber threats and the \ndefensive measures they might be able to implement to protect their \nnetworks.\n  Right now, the same cyber intrusions are used again and again to \npenetrate different targets. That shouldn't happen. If someone sees a \nparticular virus or harmful cyber signature, they should tell others so \nthey can protect themselves.\n  That is what this bill does. It clears away the uncertainty and the \nconcerns that keep companies from sharing this information. It provides \nthat two competitors in a market can share information on cyber threats \nwith each other without facing anti-trust suits. It provides that \ncompanies sharing\n\n[[Page S7501]]\n\ncyber threat information with the government for cyber security \npurposes will have liability protection.\n  As I have said many times, the bill is completely voluntary. If a \ncompany doesn't want to share information, it does not have to.\n  Today, we will vote on up to seven amendments. As late as this \nmorning, Senator Burr and I have been working to see if we can reach \nagreement to accept or voice vote some of them, and I hope these \ndiscussions will be successful. However, I remain in agreement with \nChairman Burr that we will oppose any amendments that undo the careful \ncompromises we have made on this bill. Over the past 10 months, we have \ntried to thread a needle in fact to draft a bill that as I said gives \nthe private sector the insurances it needs to share more information \nwhile including privacy protections to make sure Americans' information \nis not compromised.\n\n  I see on the floor the ranking member of the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, the distinguished Senator from \nDelaware, and I thank Senator Carper for all he has done to help us and \nalso to make what I consider a major amendment on this bill, which as \nyou know has been accepted.\n  Several of today's amendments would undo this balance. Senators \nWyden, Heller, and Franken have amendments that would lead to less \ninformation sharing. Each of them would replace clear requirements that \nare now in the bill on what a company or a government must do prior to \nsharing information with a new subjective standard that would insert \nthe concern of legal liability.\n  I would offer to work with these Senators and others as the bill \nmoves forward and hopefully goes into conference to see if there is a \nway to achieve their goals without interfering with the bill's goal of \nincreasing information sharing.\n  Senator Leahy's amendment would similarly decrease the amount of \nsharing by opening up the chances of public disclosure through the \nFreedom of Information Act of cyber threats shared under this bill. \nWhile the bill seeks to share information about the nature of cyber \nthreats and suggestions on how to defend networks, this information \nshould not be made widely available to hackers and cyber criminals who \ncould use it for their own purposes.\n  Senator Burr and I worked closely with Senators Leahy and Cornyn in \nputting together the managers' package to remove a FOIA exemption that \nthey viewed as unnecessary and harmful. I am pleased we were able to \nreach that agreement. However, the FOIA exemption that remains in the \nbill is needed to encourage companies to share this information, and I \nwould oppose this amendment.\n  The President has an amendment on the other side of the spectrum \nwhich I will also strongly oppose. This amendment would basically undo \none of the core concepts of this bill. Instead of requiring cyber \ninformation to go through a single portal at the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, it would allow companies to share cyber information directly \nwith the FBI or the Secret Service and still provide full liability \nprotection.\n  This change runs afoul of one of the most important privacy \nprotections in the bill, which was to limit direct sharing of this \ncyber information with the intelligence community or with law \nenforcement. In other words, everything will go through the portal \nfirst, where it will receive an additional scrub to remove any residual \npersonal information and then go to the respective departments. In this \nway the privacy is kept by not being able to misuse the authority to \nprovide unrelated information directly to departments.\n  If there is a crime, companies should be able to share information \nwith law enforcement--I agree with that--but that is not what this bill \nis about. This bill is about sharing cyber information on threats so \nthere can be greater awareness and better defenses.\n  When there is a cyber crime and law enforcement is called in, we are \ntalking about very different information. When the FBI investigates, it \ntakes entire databases and servers. It looks at everything--far beyond \nthe cyber information that could be lawfully shared in this act. So \nsharing with the FBI outside of the DHS portal may be appropriate in \ncertain cases but not as a parallel option for cyber threat \ninformation.\n  In fact, our bill already makes clear in section 105(c)(E) that it \n``does not limit or prohibit otherwise lawful disclosures of \ncommunications, records, or other information, including reporting of \nknown or suspected criminal activity.'' I would just refer to this \nchart which quotes section 105(c). It says exactly that.\n  This amendment would undo the key structure of this bill--the central \nportal for sharing information located at the Department of Homeland \nSecurity--and decrease the ability of the government to effectively \nmanage all the cyber information it receives. So I will oppose this \namendment and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I very much appreciate that the Senate will complete its \nconsideration of this bill today. We still have a long way to go. We \nhave to conference the House bill with our bill. I want to make this \noffer, and I know I think I speak for the chairman as well, that we are \nhappy to work with any Member as we go into conference, but I hope we \ncan complete these last few votes without upsetting the careful \nnegotiations and compromise we have been able to reach.\n  Again, I thank the Chair.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Let me start off by saying to Senator Feinstein, 6 years \nago, you, along with Senators Susan Collins, Joe Lieberman, Jay \nRockefeller, and others started leading the effort to put in place \ncomprehensive cyber security legislation and offered the first \ncomprehensive bill dealing with information sharing. We had a vote in \nlate 2012. It came up short, and we started all over again in the last \nCongress. You have shown great leadership right from the start. I thank \nyou and I thank Senator Burr, the chair of the committee. I thank you \nfor cooperating with us and with others to make sure that we have not \njust a good bill but a very good bill that addresses effectively the \ngreatest challenges we face in our country.\n  I have heard Senator Feinstein say this time and again, and I will \nsay it again today: If companies don't want to share information with \nthe Federal Government, they don't have to. It is elective. In some \ncases they can form their own groups called ISOCs that will share \ninformation with one another. They don't have to share information on \nattacks with the Federal Government. They can share it with other peers \nif they wish to, but if they do share it with the Federal Government, \nwith a couple of narrow exceptions, we ask that it be shared with the \nDepartment of Homeland Security because the Department of Homeland \nSecurity is set up in large part to provide a privacy scrub.\n  Next month the DHS will have the ability, when these threat \nindicators come through that are reported by other businesses across \nthe country, in real time to be able to scrub that information through \nthe portal and remove from it personally identifiable information that \nshould not be shared with other Federal agencies, and just like that, \nbingo, we are off to the races. It is a smart compromise that I am \npleased and grateful to have worked out with Senators Burr and \nFeinstein and their staff. I thank both their staff and ours as well.\n  The other piece is the legislation we literally took out of the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs that has been \npending. I think the entire title 2 of the managers' amendment is the \nlegislation that Senator Johnson and I have worked on. We are grateful \nfor that.\n  One piece of it is something called EINSTEIN 1, 2, and 3--not to be \nconfused with the renowned scientist, Albert Einstein. But we have \nsomething called EINSTEIN 1, EINSTEIN 2, and EINSTEIN 3. What do they \nmean? What this legislation does is it means we are going to use these \ntools--we are going to continue to update and modernize these tools--\nto, No. 1, record intrusions; No. 2, to be able to detect the bad stuff \ncoming through into the Federal Government; and No. 3, block it.\n  We are going to make sure it is not just something that is positive \nwork on a piece of paper but that 100 percent of\n\n[[Page S7502]]\n\nthe Federal agencies are able to use these new tools. Senator Johnson \nand I worked on legislation included in this package that uses \nencryption tools and doubles the number of processes we have available \nto better protect our information.\n  Finally, I would mention that Senator Collins, the former chair of \nthe Homeland Security Committee--she and a number of our colleagues, \nincluding Senator Mikulski, Senator McCaskill, and others, have worked \non legislation that we added to and all of that was reported out of the \ncommittee. All of this together is a very robust defender of our dot-\ngov domain and could be used to help those outside the Federal \nGovernment as well.\n  Going back to the last Congress, Tom Coburn and I worked together to \ndo three things to strengthen the Department of Homeland Security to \nlet it do its job. Growing up, I remember seeing cartoon ads in a \nmagazine about some guy at the beach kicking sand on a smaller guy. The \nsmaller guy in this case would have been the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, with respect to their ability to provide robust defense \nagainst cyber attacks. If I can use that cartoon as an analogy, in the \npast, the Department of Homeland Security was the 98-pound weakling, \nand it is no weakling anymore. Legislation that Dr. Coburn and I \noffered, passed in the Congress, to, No. 1, say the cyber ops center in \nthe Department of Homeland Security is real. We are standing it up. We \nare making it real and robust.\n  The Federal Information Security Management Act for years was a \npaperwork exercise and was a once-a-year check to make sure our cyber \ndefenses were secure. We are transforming that into a 24/7, robust, \naround-the-clock operation by modifying legislation and improving \nlegislation called FISMA. We also in that legislation make clear what \nOMB's job is and we make clear what the job of the Department of \nHomeland Security is.\n  Finally, for years the Department of Homeland Security hired and \ntrained cyber warriors, and just as they were getting really good, they \nwere hired away because we couldn't retain them. We couldn't pay them \nor provide retention bonuses or hiring bonuses. We need to make sure we \nhave some of the best cyber warriors in the world working at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. Now DHS has that authority, and we \nwill be able to hire these people.\n  Putting all this together, folks, what we have done is move the \nneedle. With passage of this legislation we will move the needle and we \nneed to do that.\n  There will be discussion later on of amendments. There are a couple \nof them that for this Senator are especially troubling. Senator \nFeinstein has mentioned a couple of them, and I suspect Senator Burr \nhas mentioned them as well. We will look at them as we go through, but \na couple of them set this legislation back and I will very strongly \noppose them.\n  Having said that, regarding the old saying--I am tired of hearing it \nand I am tired of saying it, but ``don't let the perfect be the enemy \nof the good.'' This isn't just good legislation, this is very good \nlegislation, and it has gotten better every step of the way because of \nthe willingness of the ranking member and the chairman of the Intel \nCommittee to collaborate. The three C's at work are communicating, \ncompromising, and collaborating. We should work out these amendments \ntoday and pass this bill.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2548, as Modified\n\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, this Senator, like everyone else in this \nChamber, realizes the need to address the threat of cyber attacks. The \nimpact of these attacks is a matter of individual financial security as \nwell as America's national security, and I contend that these efforts \nmust not interfere with Americans' privacy. In doing so, the cure, \nwhich is this piece of legislation, is worse than the problem.\n  I have said it before and I will continue saying it, privacy for \nNevadans is nonnegotiable. Nevadans elected me in part to uphold their \ncivil rights and their liberties, and that is what I am on the floor \ndoing today. That is why I fought for passage of the USA FREEDOM Act. \nThat is why I offered my amendment being considered on this floor this \ngiven day. Hundreds of Nevadans have reached out to my office \nexpressing concerns about the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, \nsaying it did not do enough to safeguard their personal information.\n\n  Also tech companies, including Google, Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, and \nBSA Software Alliance, all expressed the same concerns about privacy \nunder this piece of legislation. It is our responsibility in Congress \nto listen to these concerns and address them before allowing this piece \nof legislation to become law. I recognize the chairman of the \nintelligence committee does not support my amendment and has been \nencouraging our colleagues to oppose it.\n  With respect, however, I believe my amendment is a commonsense, \nmiddle-ground amendment. It ensures that we strike an appropriate \nbalance that guarantees privacy, but also allows for real-time sharing \nof cyber threat indicators. My amendment would simply require the \nFederal Government, before sharing any cyber threat indicators, to \nstrip out any personally identifiable information that they reasonably \nbelieve is not directly related to a cyber security threat.\n  This standard creates a wide protection for American's personal \ninformation. Furthermore, it also improves the operational capabilities \nof this cyber sharing program. DHS has stated that removing more \npersonally identifiable information before sharing will help the \nprivate sector meaningfully digest that information as they work to \ncombat cyber threats.\n  Again, I respect what Chairman Burr and Ranking Member Feinstein are \ntrying to do here, which is why I have carefully crafted this amendment \nto meet the needs of both sides--those fighting for privacy and those \nfighting for our national security. I would like to take a moment to \naddress the concerns expressed by the chairman, who has argued that \nthis amendment is a poison pill for this piece of legislation. I want \nto be clear: This amendment is not creating legal uncertainty that \nwould delay the sharing of cyber threat indicators. In fact, the term \n``reasonably believes'' is used as the standard for the private sector \nin the House-passed cyber bill. Let me repeat that. This phrase, \n``reasonably believes,'' is the standard applied to the private sector \nin the House-passed bill. Our counterparts on the House Intelligence \nCommittee felt that this standard was high enough to protect privacy \nwhile also meeting the goal of the bill which is real-time sharing.\n  If this standard is good enough for the private sector, it should be \ngood enough for the Federal Government. Just 6 months ago, the chamber \nof commerce released a strong statement of support and praise for the \nHouse-passed cyber legislation. Not once did they release statements of \nconcern over using the term ``reasonably believes'' as it applies to \nthe private sector, the industry which they represent. I ask again: If \nit is good enough for the private sector, should it not be good enough \nfor the Federal Government?\n  Finally, I am proud to have the support of two of the Senate's \nleading privacy advocates, Senators Leahy and Wyden, who have been \nfighting with me to make key changes to this bill to maintain \nAmericans' rights. I strongly urge my colleagues today to vote in \nsupport of my simple fix. Let's keep our oath to the American people \nand make this bill stronger for privacy rights and civil liberties.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after Chairman \nBurr has spoken, I be recognized for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I want to say to my colleague Senator \nHeller, I wish we could accommodate all of the amendments. The fact is \nthat even a word here and there changes the balance of what Senator \nFeinstein and I have tried to put together. Although on the surface it \nmay not look like a big deal--I understand we have two competing bills \nthat were passed in the House, and one has the language. The fact is, \nour language for the entirety of the bill does not match the House \nbill.\n  When you change something, we have to look at the cause and effect of \nit.\n\n[[Page S7503]]\n\nHere are the realities. This is a voluntary bill. I will start backward \nwith some of the things Senator Heller said. Technology companies are \nopposed to it. They are. I cannot do anything about that, but I can \nplead with them: Why would you deprive thousands of businesses that \nwant to have a partnership with the Federal Government from having it \nbecause you have determined for your business, even though you are a \nlarge holder of personal data, that you don't want a partnership with \nthe Federal Government.\n  I would suggest that the first day they get penetrated, they may find \nthat partnership is worthy. I cannot change where they are on the \nlegislation. The reality is that for a voluntary bill, it means there \nhas to be a reason for people to want to participate. Uncertainty is \nthe No. 1 thing that drives that away. We believe the change the \nSenator proposes provides that degree of uncertainty, and therefore we \nwould not have information shared either at all or in a timely fashion. \nIf it is not shared in a timely fashion, then we won't reach the real-\ntime transfer of data which gives us the basis of minimizing data loss \nin this bill.\n  I think it is easy to look at certain pieces of the bill and say: \nWell, this does not change it that much. But it changes it in a way \nthat would cause either companies to choose not to participate, or it \nmay change it in a way that delays the notification to the Federal \nGovernment. Therefore, we are not able to accomplish what we set out to \ndo in the mission of this bill, which is to minimize the amount of data \nthat is lost not just at that company but across the U.S. economy.\n  Again, I urge our colleagues--we will move to amendments shortly. We \nwill have an opportunity to debate for 1 minute on each side on those \namendments. I would urge my colleagues to keep this bill intact. If we \nchange the balance of what we have been able to do, then it changes the \neffects of how this will be implemented, and, in fact, we may or may \nnot at the end of the day----\n  Mr. HELLER. Will the chairman yield time so I can respond to his \ncomment?\n  Mr. BURR. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. HELLER. I appreciate everything the Senator is doing. I \nunderstand the importance of fighting against cyber attacks. I want to \nmake two points--clarify two points that I think are very important. \nThe language in this bill is the same standard the private sector is \nheld to in the House-passed bill. The chamber had no problem 6 months \nago when that bill was passed out of the House of Representatives.\n  So I continue to ask the question: If it is good enough--if this \nlanguage is good enough for the private sector, why is it not good \nenough for the public sector, for the Federal Government? The second \nthing is that I believe my amendment does strike a balance, increasing \nprivacy but still providing that real-time information sharing. I just \nwanted to make those two points.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator's input. I can only \nsay to my colleagues that it is the recommendation of the vice chair \nand myself that this not be supported. It does change the balance, it \nputs uncertainty in the level of participation, and any delay from real \ntime would, in fact, mean that we would not have lived up to the \nmission of this bill, which is to minimize data loss.\n  I think, though, that there are similarities between the House and \nSenate bills. Ours is significantly different, and therefore it has a \ndifferent implication when you change certain words.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Before he leaves the floor, I want to commend my colleague \nfrom Nevada. I strongly support his amendment.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2621, as Modified\n\n  Colleagues, the first vote we will have at 11 o'clock is on my \namendment No. 2621. This amendment is supported by a wide variety of \nleaders across the political spectrum, progressive voices that have \nfocused on cyber security and privacy as well as conservative \norganizations. FreedomWorks, for example, an important conservative \norganization, announced last night that they will consider the privacy \namendment that I will be offering. It will be the first vote, a key \nvote on their congressional scorecard.\n  It was the view of FreedomWorks that this amendment, the first vote, \nwould add crucial privacy protections to this legislation. The point of \nthe first amendment we will vote on is to strengthen privacy \nprotections by requiring that companies make reasonable efforts to \nremove unrelated personal information about their customers before \nproviding data to the government. It says that companies should take \nthese efforts to the extent feasible. Let me say that this truly offers \na great deal of flexibility and discretion to companies. It certainly \ndoes not demand perfection, but it does say to these companies that \nthey should actually have to take some real responsibility, some \naffirmative step.\n  We will have a chance, I guess for a minute or so, when we get to the \namendments, but for purposes of colleagues reflecting before we start \nvoting, the first amendment I will be offering is backed by important \nprogressive organizations, such as the Center for Democracy and \nTechnology, and conservative groups, such as FreedomWorks, which last \nnight said this is a particularly important vote with respect to \nliberty and privacy. It says that with respect to the standard for \nAmerican companies, you just cannot hand it over, you have to take some \naffirmative steps--reasonable, affirmative steps--before you share \npersonal information.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, we are going to go to these amendments, and \nwe will have five amendments this morning and possibly up to five this \nafternoon starting at 4 o'clock.\n\n\n               Amendment Nos. 2626, as Modified, and 2557\n\n  I want to take this opportunity--there are two pending amendments \nthat are not germane. I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to \nraise those points of order en bloc at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURR. I make a point of order that the Whitehouse amendment No. \n2626 and the Mikulski amendment No. 2557 are not germane to amendment \nNo. 2716.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The points of order are well taken and the \namendments fall.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity before we \nstart the final process to thank the vice chairman. She has been \nincredibly willing to participate, even when we started in a different \nplace than where we ended. She brought to the table a tremendous amount \nof experience on this issue because of the number of years she had \nworked on it. She was very accommodating on areas that I felt were \nimportant for us to either incorporate or at least debate.\n  What I really want to share with my colleagues is that we had a \nwholesome debate in the committee. The debate the vice chair and I and \nour staffs had was wholesome before it even came to the Presiding \nOfficer or to Senator Wyden. That is good. It is why some of the \nMembers might have said in committee: Gee, this looks like a good \namendment. Yet it did not fit within the framework of what the vice \nchair and I sat down and agreed to.\n  So this has been a process over a lot of months of building support, \nnot just within this institution but across the country. It is not a \nprocess where I expected to get to the end and for there to be nothing \nbut endorsements of the legislation. I have never seen a piece of \nlegislation achieve that coming out of the Senate. But I think the vice \nchair and I believed when we actually put legislation together that we \nwere on the same page. The fact is, it is important that today we are \nagain still on the same page, that we have stuck there. I thank the \nvice chairman.\n\n  I also thank Senator Johnson and Senator Carper, the chairman and the \nranking member of the homeland security committee. They have been \nincredibly helpful and incredibly accommodating. We have tried to \nincorporate everything we thought contributed positively to this \nlegislation, and they were huge contributors.\n  Lastly, let me say to all of my colleagues that it is tough to be put \nin a situation--the vice chair and myself--where we have Members on \nboth sides\n\n[[Page S7504]]\n\nwho are going to offer amendments--I understand that to them those \namendments are very reasonable, and I would only ask my colleagues to \nunderstand the situation the vice chair and I are in. We have \nnegotiated a very delicately written piece of legislation, and any \nchange in that that is substantive we feel might, in fact, change the \noutcome of what this bill accomplishes.\n  We will have votes on amendments this morning. One of those \namendments, Senator Flake's amendment--overnight we were able to \nnegotiate a change in the sunset provision to 10 years. We will modify \nthat on the floor and accept it by voice vote. The others will be \nrecorded votes.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2621, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). Under the previous order, the \nquestion occurs on amendment No. 2621, as modified, offered by the \nSenator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden.\n  There is 2 minutes of debate equally divided.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, virtually all agree that cyber security \nis a serious problem. Virtually all agree that it is useful to share \ninformation, but sharing information without robust privacy standards \ncreates as many problems as it may solve.\n  The first amendment I am offering is supported by a wide variety of \norganizations across the political spectrum because they want what this \namendment would do; that is, reasonable efforts have to be made to \nstrike unrelated personal information before it is handed over to the \ngovernment. Without that, you have a flimsy standard that says: When in \ndoubt, hand it over.\n  I urge colleagues to support this amendment. It is backed by \nprogressive groups and conservative groups.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Warren as a \ncosponsor to my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a letter of support from FreedomWorks, a leading \nconservative voice on these issues.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                 FreedomWorks,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 26, 2015.\n\n           Key Vote YES on the Wyden Amendment #2621 to CISA\n\n       As one of our over 6.9 million FreedomWorks activists \n     nationwide, I urge you to contact your senators and ask them \n     to vote YES on the Wyden amendment to add crucial privacy \n     protections to the Cyber Information Sharing Act (CISA), S. \n     754.\n       CISA purports to facilitate stronger network security \n     across the nation by facilitating the interchange of \n     information on cyber threats between private companies and \n     government agencies. But one of CISA's several gaping flaws \n     is the incentive it creates for some companies to share this \n     data recklessly.\n       The personally identifiable information (PII) of a \n     company's users can be attached to cyber threat indicators \n     after a hack--potentially sensitive information that is \n     generally unnecessary to diagnose the threat. But since \n     companies which share cyber threat data are completely immune \n     to consequence if that shared data should be misused, their \n     incentive is to share the data as quickly as possible--even \n     if that means some would be sharing PII.\n       And if that personal data is irresponsibly shared with the \n     government, it gets spread far and wide between government \n     agencies (including the NSA) in real time, thanks to CISA's \n     mandatory interagency sharing provision.\n       The Wyden amendment goes a long way toward addressing the \n     potential misuse of this personal information by requiring \n     companies which share cyber threat data to review said data \n     to ensure that all PII that is not directly necessary to \n     counter the cyber threat is deleted before it is shared.\n       Passing the Wyden amendment wouldn't fully fix the problems \n     with CISA, but it is an important protection against \n     potential distribution and misuse of innocent consumers' \n     private information.\n       Please contact your senators and ask that they vote YES on \n     the Wyden amendment to CISA. FreedomWorks will count the vote \n     on this amendment as a Key Vote when calculating our \n     Congressional Scorecard for 2015. The scorecard is used to \n     determine eligibility for the FreedomFighter Award, which \n     recognizes Members of Congress who consistently vote to \n     support economic freedom and individual liberty.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Adam Brandon,\n                                                CEO, FreedomWorks.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise to oppose the amendment. This \namendment would replace a key feature of the underlying bill. Right \nnow, under section 104(d) of the managers' amendment, a company is \nrequired to conduct a review of any information before it is shared and \nremove any personal information that is not ``directly related to a \ncybersecurity threat.''\n  Senator Wyden's amendment, while well-intentioned, would replace that \nreview with a requirement that a company must remove personal \ninformation ``to the extent feasible''--and there is the rub. This is a \nvery unclear requirement. In this bill, we are trying to provide \nclarity on what a company has to do so that it is understandable. \nCompanies understand what it means to conduct a review to see whether \nthere is personal information and then strip it out. They don't know \nwhat may or may not be feasible, and they worry that this lack of \nclarity could create the risk of a lawsuit where the current language \ndoes not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Therefore, I ask my colleagues to join with me in \nvoting no on the Wyden amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Wyden \namendment, as modified.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Under the previous order, the question occurs \non amendment No. 2548, as modified, offered by the Senator from Nevada, \nMr. Heller.\n  There is 2 minutes of debate equally divided.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. HELLER. Madam President, the chairman has stated that this piece \nof legislation has privacy protections. But I don't believe it goes far \nenough or we wouldn't be in this Chamber, vote after vote after vote, \ntrying to move this so there is some personal privacy and so there are \nsome liberties that are protected.\n  This amendment in front of us right now is a commonsense, middle-\nground approach that strengthens the standards for the Federal \nGovernment removing personal information prior to sharing it with the \nprivate sector.\n  I want to leave my colleagues with two points. This is the same \nstandard\n\n[[Page S7505]]\n\nthat the private sector is held to in the House-passed bill, supported \nby the Chamber. If this amendment is good enough for the private \nsector, the question is, Why isn't it good enough for the Federal \nsector or the government? No. 2, my amendment strikes a balance between \nincreasing privacy but still providing for real-time information \nsharing.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, Senator Feinstein and I have tried to \nreach a very delicate balance. We think we have done that. Senator \nHeller raised one specific issue. He said the chamber is supportive of \nthe language. Let me just read: The chamber opposes Senator Heller's \namendment for much of the same reason that we oppose comparable \namendments being offered. It says: The difficulty with seemingly simple \ntweaks and wording is that interpreting the language, such as `` \nreasonably believes'' and ``reasonable efforts'' in legislation, is far \nfrom simple. It would create legal uncertainty and is contrary to the \ngoal of real-time information sharing. The chamber will press to \nmaintain NOS as the standard.\n  Hopefully, this shares some texture with my colleagues about how \ndifficult this has been. As I said earlier, I would love to accept all \nof the amendments. But when it changes the balance of what we have been \nable to put--when we take a voluntary bill and provide uncertainty, we \nhave now given a reason for either companies not to participate or for \nthe government to delay the transmission to the appropriate agencies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BURR. We believe we have the right protections in place. I urge \nmy colleagues to defeat the Heller amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nas modified.\n  Mr. THUNE. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the question occurs \non amendment No. 2587, as modified, offered by the Senator from \nVermont, Mr. Leahy.\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I would ask that my remarks be under \nleader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n       Congratulating Senator Leahy on Casting His 15,000th Vote\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today my friend and colleague Pat Leahy has \nreached another milestone in an extraordinary career. He just cast his \n15,000th vote. That is remarkable. He is only the sixth Senator in the \nhistory of this great body to have done that. In 226 years, he is one \nof 6.\n  Today's momentous occasion should come as no surprise because his \nentire career in public service has been history in the making. He \ngraduated from St. Michael's College, which is a Vermont institution. \nHe graduated from Georgetown University Law Center.\n  He was first appointed as the State's attorney when he was 26 years \nold. He was then reelected on two separate occasions. During that time, \nPat Leahy was a nationally renowned prosecutor. In 1974--his last as a \nState's attorney--he was selected as one of the three most outstanding \nprosecutors in America.\n  At age 34, Pat became the first Democrat in U.S. history to be \nelected to the Senate from Vermont. After he was elected, the \nRepublican Senator he was to succeed, George Aiken, was asked by some \nto resign his seat a day early--which you could do in those days--to \ngive Senator Leahy a head start in seniority among his fellow freshmen. \nHere is what Senator Aiken said: ``If Vermont is foolish enough to \nelect a Democrat, let him be number 100.''\n  Senator Leahy's career has proven that the people of Vermont were \nwise in selecting him. From No. 100, Senator Leahy over time ascended \nto the rank of President pro tempore of the Senate. Senator Leahy has \nspent four decades in the Senate fighting for justice and equality. As \nthe chairman of the Judiciary Committee, he became a national leader \nfor an independent judiciary, the promotion of equal rights, and the \nprotection of our Constitution.\n  His main focus, though, has always been Vermont. He carries with him \na picture of what he calls his farmhouse, which is on lots of acres. It \nlooks like a picture you would use if you were trying to get somebody \nto come and stay at your place--it is just beautiful. It doesn't remind \nme of the desert, but it is beautiful.\n  Over the years, he has done everything he can to protect the State's \nnatural beauty, the resources, land and water, through conservation \nefforts. When people visit Vermont, they see these beautiful green \nvistas, pristine lakes and rivers, and picturesque farms. Senator Leahy \nhas worked hard to keep Vermont that way.\n  Senator Leahy has done everything in his power to promote agriculture \nin his home State. As former chair of the agriculture committee, I can \nremember what he has done to protect the dairy industry. It is legend \nwhat he has done to protect the dairy industry. We all remember holding \nup the Senate for periods of time until he got what he wanted for \ndairy. He wrote the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990, which helped \nfoster Vermont and America's growing organic food industry. Today, \norganic foods are a $40 billion industry. Many of those organic farms \nand businesses are based in Vermont.\n  After Tropical Storm Irene, I remember, graphically, his fighting for \nthe State of Vermont. That storm devastated parts of Vermont. Roads \nwere underwater for weeks. He helped secure $500 million in assistance \nfor the people of Vermont to overcome a brutal natural disaster.\n  I am fortunate to be able to serve with Pat Leahy here in the Senate. \nHe is more than a colleague; he really is a dear friend, as is his wife \nof 52 years, Marcelle, whom Landra and I know well. We have helped each \nother through our times of joy and our times of travail. Senator Leahy \nand his wife Marcelle have three wonderful children and five \ngrandchildren. Give Pat a minute alone and he will start telling you \nabout them.\n\n  Senator Leahy, congratulations on your 15,000th vote in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank my colleague.\n\n[[Page S7506]]\n\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, as the Democratic leader has pointed \nout, this is indeed the 15,000th vote of the Senator from Vermont. That \nmeans he has taken the largest number of votes among all of us \ncurrently serving here in the Senate. It means he has taken the sixth \nlargest number of votes in Senate history. It certainly means he has \ntaken more votes than any other Senator from his State, and Vermont has \nbeen sending Senators here since the late 1700s.\n  That is not the only thing that sets him apart from every other \nVermonter to serve here in the Senate. He was the first Democrat \nelected to serve from Vermont. Unfortunately, that is a habit that has \nnot continued. I think we can safely assume he is Vermont's first \nBatman fanboy to serve as well; the first Bat fan and probably the \nfirst Dead Head as well.\n  There is no doubt that our colleague is the longest serving current \nMember of the Senate from any State. We are happy to recognize today \nhis 15,000th vote.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. May I have 1 minute to speak to that point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I wish to commemorate my friend and \ncolleague for casting his 15,000th vote today in the Senate.\n  Senator Leahy has been a stalwart Member of this body since joining \nthe Senate at the age of 34 in 1975. Four decades later, Senator Leahy \ncontinues to serve his State and our Nation with great passion and \nconviction.\n  Senator Leahy has been a good friend as we work together in leading \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  So, Senator Leahy, congratulations on this tremendous milestone. I \nhope we can cast many more votes together as we continue to work in a \nbipartisan way on the committee.\n  I applaud the Senator from Vermont for his great commitment to \nservice, and I wish him many more votes in the future.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I rise to say a few words in \ncongratulating Senator Leahy, not just for his 15,000th vote but on his \nmany years of service serving the people of the State of Vermont. \nVermont is very proud of all of the work Pat Leahy has done.\n  As we all know, Senator Leahy has been a champion on agriculture \nissues, on protecting family farmers, especially in dairy and organics. \nHe has been a champion in fighting for civil liberties in this country. \nHe has been a champion on environmental issues, making sure the planet \nwe leave our kids is a clean and healthy planet. He has been a champion \non women's issues, and on so many other issues.\n  Senator Leahy, on behalf of the people of Vermont, I want to thank \nyou so much for your years of service.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I want to thank my dear friends, Senator \nReid, Senator McConnell, Senator Sanders, and Senator Grassley for \ntheir comments, and I appreciate the opportunity to be able to serve \nwith them. I thank the members of the Senate for this opportunity to \nmake a very few observations about this personal milestone.\n  You know, the Senate offers both great opportunities and \nresponsibility for both Senators from Vermont and all who serve here. \nWe have a chance, day after day, to make things better for Vermonters \nand for all Americans. We can strengthen our country and ensure its \nvitality into the future. We can forge solutions in the unending quest \nthroughout this Nation's history to form a more perfect Union.\n  I cast my first vote in this Chamber in 1975 on a resolution to \nestablish the Church Committee. The critical issues of the post-\nWatergate era parallel issues we face today--proof of the enduring fact \nthat, while the votes we cast today address the issues we face now, \nproblems will persist, threats will continue, and improvements to the \ndemocracy we all revere can always be made.\n  I think back on the 15,000 votes I have cast on behalf of Vermonters. \nA lot of them come quickly to mind today--some specific to Vermont and \nsome national and some global--writing and enacting the organic farm \nbill, the charter for what has become a thriving $30 billion industry; \nstronger regulations on mercury pollution and combating the effects of \nglobal warming; emergency relief for the devastation caused by Tropical \nStorm Irene; adopting price support programs for small dairy farmers; \nfighting for the privacy and civil liberties of all Americans; \nsupporting the Reagan-O'Neill deal to save Social Security; nutrition \nbills to help Americans below the poverty line; bipartisan--strongly \nbipartisan--campaign reform in McCain-Feingold; the bipartisan Leahy-\nSmith Act, on patent reform; reauthorizing and greatly expanding and \nstrengthening the Violence Against Women Act; opposing the war in Iraq, \na venture that cost so many lives and trillions of taxpayer dollars.\n  The Senate at its best can be the conscience of the Nation. I have \nseen that when it happens, and I marvel in the fundamental soundness \nand wisdom of our system every time the Senate stands up and is the \nconscience of our Nation. But we cannot afford to put any part of the \nmechanism on automatic pilot. It takes constant work and vigilance to \nkeep our system working as it should for the betterment of our society \nand the American people. And we can only do it if we work together.\n  I am so grateful to my fellow Vermonters for the confidence they have \nshown in me. It is a measure of trust that urges me on. I will never \nbetray it, and I will never take it for granted. Reflecting on the past \n15,000 votes reminds me about the significance every time we vote, why \nI feel energized about what votes lie ahead, and how we can keep making \na difference.\n  I thank my friends, the two leaders, for their remarks, my respected \nSenate colleague, Senator Sanders, my friend, Senator Grassley, with \nwhom I've served a long time. I appreciate my friendship with them and \nhave appreciated my friendship with other leaders, including Senators \nMansfield, Byrd, Baker, Dole, Lott, and Daschle, and lifelong gratitude \nto my former colleague, Senator Stafford, a Republican, who took me \nunder his wing and guided me. And I am privileged to serve now--I mean, \nour whole Vermont delegation is here: Senator Sanders, Congressman \nWelch, and myself. Not many other States could do that and fit all of \nthem in this body. And lastly I remember what a thrill it was to tell \nmy wife, Marcelle, when I cast my first vote. And now 40 years later, I \ncan still tell her about the 15,000th vote, and she knows, she and our \nchildren and grandchildren are the most important people in my life.\n  I do not want to further delay the Senate's work today, and I will \nreflect more on this milestone later. I thank you for your friendships \nthat have meant more to me and my family than I can possibly say, and I \nlook forward to continuing serving here. Thank you very, very much.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I want to add my voice to the well-\ndeserved chorus of congratulations for our colleague and friend from \nVermont.\n  Of the 1,963 men and women who have ever served in the U.S. Senate, \nonly six have the distinction of casting 15,000 votes. And of those \naugust six, only Patrick Leahy continues to serve in this body today. \nThe only other members of the 15,000-vote league are Senators Robert C. \nByrd, Strom Thurmond, Daniel Inouye, Ted Kennedy, and Ted Stevens.\n  More important than the number of votes Senator Leahy has cast, \nhowever, is the wisdom and courage reflected in his votes.\n  He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1974--part of an historic group \nof new Senators known as the ``Watergate Babies.''\n  He has voted time and again to uphold the values of our \nConstitution--even when it contained some political risk.\n  His very first vote in this Senate was to authorize the Church \nCommittee--the precursor to today's Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence. The Church Committee was created to investigate possible \nillegalities by the CIA, the FBI, and the National Security Agency--and \nit resulted in major reforms.\n\n[[Page S7507]]\n\n  As you may know, Senator Leahy is a major Batman fan. In fact, he has \nmade several cameo appearances in Batman movies.\n  His affinity for the Caped Crusader makes sense. You see, Batman is \none of the few superheroes with no superhuman powers. He is simply a \nman with unusual courage and determination to fight wrongdoing. That is \nPatrick Leahy, too.\n  I have served on the Senate Judiciary Committee for more than 18 \nyears. During that time, Senator Leahy has been either our committee \nchairman or its ranking member.\n  I have the greatest respect for his fidelity to the rule of law and \nhis determined efforts to safeguard the independence and integrity of \nAmerica's Federal courts.\n  He is a champion of human rights at home and abroad.\n  According to the nonpartisan website GovTrack, Senator Leahy has \nsponsored more bipartisan bills than any other current member of this \nSenate. Sixty-one percent of his bills have had both Democratic and \nRepublican cosponsors. In this time of increasingly sharp partisanship, \nthat is a record that we would all do well to emulate.\n  I am particularly grateful to Senator Leahy for his strong support of \na bipartisan bill that I am cosponsoring, along with a broad array of \nSenators, from Chairman Chuck Grassley to Senator Cory Booker. The \nSentencing Reform and Corrections Act would make Federal sentencing \nlaws smarter, fairer, more effective, and more fiscally responsible. It \npassed the Judiciary Committee last week by a vote of 15-5. Senator \nLeahy's leadership has been critical in building this broad support, \nand I look forward to the day--in the near future, I hope--when we can \ncelebrate passage of this important measure.\n  I learned recently that Senator Leahy dedicates all of his fees and \nroyalties from his acting roles to charities. A favorite charity is the \nKellogg-Hubbard library in Montpelier, VT, where he read comic books as \na child. I hope that there are young boys and girls discovering in that \nlibrary the same uncommon courage and love of justice that Patrick \nLeahy found there.\n  America needs more heroes like Pat Leahy.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2587, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question occurs \non amendment No. 2587, as modified, offered by the Senator from \nVermont, Mr. Leahy.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  There will now be 2 minutes equally divided.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise regretfully to speak against \nthe amendment directly following the important monument of 15,000 votes \nby one of the idols of my life, but so be it.\n  As it might become very clear, Senator Burr and I, on a bill that \ncame out of committee 14 to 1, have tried to keep a balance and have \ntried to prevent this kind of information sharing from being a threat \nto business so they won't participate. Therefore, the words that are \nused are all important as to whether they have a legal derivation. \nSenator Leahy's amendment would essentially decrease the amount of \nsharing by opening up the chance of public disclosure through the \nFreedom of Information Act of cyber threats shared under this bill.\n  Now, we seek to share information about the nature of cyber effects \nand suggestions on how to defend networks. This information clearly \nshould not be made available to hackers and cyber criminals who could \nuse it for their own purposes. So Senator Burr and I worked closely \nwith Senator Leahy and Senator Cornyn in putting together the managers' \npackage to remove a FOIA exemption that they viewed as unnecessary and \nharmful. That has been removed in the managers' package.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, as much as I hate to disagree with my \ndear friend from California, I will on this amendment.\n  I don't like to see unnecessary exemptions to the Freedom of \nInformation Act.\n  Today I offer an amendment to the Cybersecurity Information Sharing \nAct that would remove from the bill an overly broad and wholly \nunnecessary new FOIA exemption. That new exemption to our Nation's \npremier transparency law was added without public debate and in a \nclosed session by the Senate Intelligence Committee. Any amendments to \nthe Freedom of Information Act should be considered openly and publicly \nby the Senate Judiciary Committee, which has exclusive jurisdiction \nover FOIA--not in secret by the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n  I expect that much of the information to be shared with the \ngovernment under CISA would be protected from disclosure to the general \npublic. A thorough committee process, including consideration by the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, would have made clear that the vast \nmajority of sensitive information to be shared under this bill is \nalready protected from disclosure under existing FOIA exemptions. This \nincludes exemption (b)(4), which protects confidential business and \nfinancial information; exemption (b)(6) which protects personal \nprivacy; and exemption (b)(7), which protects information related to \nlaw enforcement investigations.\n  In case there is any doubt that this information would be exempt from \ndisclosure, the underlying bill already makes clear that information \nprovided to the Federal Government ``shall be considered the \ncommercial, financial, and proprietary information'' of the entity \nsubmitting the information. Commercial and financial information is \nexempt from disclosure under FOIA pursuant to exemption (b)(4), and \nadditional protections are unnecessary. The comprehensive exemptions \nalready in law have been carefully crafted to protect the most \nsensitive information from disclosure while prohibiting the Federal \nGovernment from withholding information the public is entitled to. \nCreating unnecessary exemptions will call into question the existing \nFOIA framework and threaten its twin goals of promoting government \ntransparency and accountability.\n  The new FOIA exemption in the cyber bill also includes a preemption \nclause that is overly broad and sets a terrible precedent. As drafted, \nit applies not only to FOIA, but to all State, local, or tribal \ndisclosure laws. By its very terms, this provision applies not just to \ntransparency and sunshine laws, but to any law ``requiring disclosure \nof information or records.'' Because this broad preemption of State and \nlocal law has not received careful, open consideration, there has not \nbeen adequate consultation with State and local governments to consider \nthe potential impacts. Such a sweeping approach could impact hundreds \nof State and local laws and lead to unintended consequences.\n  Amending our Nation's premier transparency law and preempting State \nand local law deserves more public debate and consideration. If we do \nnot oppose this new FOIA exemption, then I expect more antitransparency \nlanguage will be slipped into other bills without the consideration of \nthe Judiciary Committee. Just a few months ago, I was here on the \nSenate floor fighting against new FOIA exemptions that had been tucked \ninto the surface transportation bill, and I have no doubt I will be \ndown here again in the future fighting similar fights. But an open and \ntransparent government is worth fighting for. I believe in transparency \nin our Federal Government, and I believe that FOIA is the backbone to \nensuring an open and accountable government. I urge all Members to join \nme in this effort and vote for the Leahy amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, the Franken, Leahy, Durbin, and Wyden \namendment addresses concerns raised by privacy advocates, tech \ncompanies, and security experts, including the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  The amendment tightens definitions of the terms ``cyber security \nthreat'' and ``cyber threat indicator,'' which are currently too broad \nand too vague, and would encourage the sharing of extraneous \ninformation--unhelpful information.\n  Overbreadth is not just a privacy problem; as DHS has noted, it is \nbad for cyber security if too much of the wrong kind of information \nfloods into agencies.\n  My amendment redefines ``cyber security threat'' as an action that is \nat least reasonably likely to try to adversely impact an information \nsystem. It is a standard that tells companies what is expected of them \nand assures consumers that CISA imposes appropriate limits.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 20 more \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. The amendment also tightens the definition of ``cyber \nthreat indicator'' to avoid the sharing of unnecessary information. The \namendment is intentionally modest. It makes only changes that are most \nneeded for the sake of both privacy and security.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, let me say to my colleagues, again, we are \ntrying to change the words that have been very delicately chosen to \nprovide the certainty that companies understand and need for them to \nmake a decision to share.\n  Like some other amendments, if you don't want them to share, then \nprovide uncertainty. That is in language changing from ``may'' to \n``reasonably likely,'' changing from ``actual'' or ``potential'' to \n``harm caused by an incident.'' The Department of Homeland Security is \nfor this bill. The White House is for this bill. Fifty-two \norganizations representing thousands of companies in America are for \nthis bill. We have reached the right balance. Let's defeat this \namendment and let's move to this afternoon's amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nfloor for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, last week I came to the floor to express \nmy support for the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, which we are \ndealing with today. The bipartisan vote of 83 to 14 that happened later \nthat day was an important step in the right direction to deal with this \nissue. The debate has been encouraging. We need to deal with this \nthreat to our economy. It is a threat to our security, it is a threat \nto our privacy, and we need to deal with it now.\n  As I and others have said before, if we wait until there is an event \nthat gets people's attention in such a dramatic way that everybody \nsuddenly realizes what is at stake, there is no telling what kind of \noverreaction Congress will make. This has been a good debate at the \ntime we should have it. Now, of course, we need to move on.\n  There have been a lot of amendments offered. Many amendments have \nbeen accepted by the managers of the bill. With almost all certainty, \ntoday we will finish the remaining amendments pending on the bill and \nhopefully finish the bill itself. A lot of these amendments have been \nvery well-intentioned--in fact, I suspect they all have been well-\nintentioned--but in many cases they fundamentally undermine the core \npurpose of the bill, which is to have voluntary real-time sharing of \ncyber threats, to allow that sharing to be between private entities and \nthe Federal Government, and even for private entities to be able to \nshare with each other.\n  This is a bill that creates the liability protections and the anti-\ntrust protections which that particular kind of sharing would allow. Of \ncourse, throughout this whole debate, there has been much discussion \nabout how we protect our liberty in an information age. How do we have \nboth security and liberty?\n  Having served for a number of years on both the House Intelligence \nCommittee and the Senate Intelligence Committee, having served on the \nArmed Services Committee in the last Congress and in this Congress on \nthe Defense Appropriations Committee, there is no argument in any of \nthose committees that one of our great vulnerabilities is cyber \nsecurity and how we protect ourselves.\n  We saw in the last few days that the head of the CIA had his own \npersonal account hacked into apparently by a teenager who is in the \nprocess of sharing that information. If the head of the CIA and the \nhead of Homeland Security do not know how to protect their own personal \ninformation, obviously information much more valuable than they might \npersonally share is also in jeopardy.\n  We do need to ensure that we protect people's personal liberties. We \nneed to do that in a way that defends the country. Both of those are \nprimarily responsibilities that we accept when we take these jobs, and \nit is certainly our responsibility to the Constitution itself.\n  I think Chairman Burr and Vice Chairman Feinstein have done a good \njob of bringing that balance together. This bill is carefully crafted \nin a way that creates a number of different layers of efforts to try to \ndo both of those things.\n  First, the bill only encourages sharing; it doesn't require it. It \ndoesn't require anybody to share anything they don't want to share, but \nit encourages the sharing of cyber threats. It works on the techniques \nand the malware used by hackers. It specifically does not authorize the \nsharing of personal information, and in fact the bill explicitly \ndirects the Federal Government to develop and make available to the \npublic guidelines to protect privacy and civil liberties in the course \nof sharing the information.\n  The Attorney General is required to review these guidelines on a \nregular basis. The bill mandates reports on the implementation and any \nprivacy impacts by inspectors general and by the Privacy and Civil \nLiberties Oversight Board, to ensure that these threats to privacy are \nconstantly looked at.\n  Senator Flake's amendment, which we accepted as part of the bill just \na few minutes ago, guarantees that this issue has to be revisited.\n  I gave a speech at Westminster College in Fulton, MO, about a month \nago at the beginning of the 70th year of the anniversary of Winston \nChurchill giving the ``Iron Curtain'' speech on that campus and talking \nabout liberty versus security there. I said I thought one of the things \nwe should always do is have a time that forced us as a Congress to \nrevisit any of the laws we have looked at in recent years to be sure we \nprotect ourselves and protect our liberty at the same time. This is a \nvoluntary bill. Maybe that wouldn't have been quite as absolutely \nnecessary here, but I was pleased to see that requirement again added \nto this bill, as it has been to other bills like this.\n  This is a responsible bill. The people the Presiding Officer and I \nwork for can feel good about the responsible balance it has. It defends \nour security, but it also protects our liberty. I look forward to its \nfinal passage today. The debate would lead me to believe, and the votes \nwould lead me to believe, that is going to happen, but of course we \nneed to continue to work now to put a bill on the President's desk that \ndoes that.\n  There still remain things to be done. One of the things I have worked \non for the last 3 years--Senator Carper and I have worked together, \nSenator Warner has been very engaged in this discussion, as has \nChairman Thune--is the protection of sensitive personal information as \nwell as how do we protect the systems themselves.\n  Clearly this information sharing will help in that fight. There is no \ndoubt about that. In addition to supporting this bill, I want to \ncontinue to work with my colleagues to see that we have a way to notify \npeople in a consistent way when their information has been stolen.\n  There are at least a dozen different State laws that address how you \nsecure personal information, and there are 47 different State laws that \naddress how you tell people if their information has been stolen. That \nis too much to comply with. We need to find one standard. This \npatchwork of laws is a nightmare for everybody trying to comply and \nfrankly a nightmare for citizens who get all kinds of different notices \nin all kinds of different ways.\n  Without a consistent national standard pertaining to securing \ninformation, without a consistent national standard pertaining to what \nhappens when you have a data breach and your information is wrongly \ntaken by someone else, we have only done part of this job. So I want us \nto continue to work to find the solutions there. We need to find a way \nto establish that standard for both data security and data breach. I am \ngoing to continue to work with the Presiding Officer and my other \ncolleagues. Our other committee, the commerce committee, is a critical \nplace to have that happen. I wish we could have done this on this bill. \nWe didn't get it done on this bill, but I would say that now the first \nstep to do what we need to do is dealing with the problem of cyber \nsecurity in the way this bill does and then finish the job at some \nlater time.\n\n  So I look forward to seeing this bill passed today. I am certainly \nurging my colleagues to vote for it. I think it has the protections the \npeople we work for would want to see, and I am grateful to my \ncolleagues for giving me a few moments here to speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/senate-section/article/S7510-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until 4\n\n[[Page S7511]]\n\np.m. is equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I wish to comment briefly on the \nCybersecurity Information Sharing Act that the Senate is considering. \nLet me first commend the sponsors, Senator Burr and Senator Feinstein, \nfor their extraordinary work.\n  This bill will help ensure greater sharing of cyber threat \ninformation, more rapidly and broadly, across industry and government. \nAs we have seen with large-scale attacks against the Federal Government \nand companies such as Sony, there is an urgent need to start addressing \nthese breaches. While such legislation is not going to eliminate our \ncyber security challenges, it should materially help to defeat and \ndeter cyber attacks and assist law enforcement in tracking down and \nprosecuting cyber criminals. Information sharing will also assist the \nintelligence agencies and law enforcement to detect and trace the \nattacks originating from foreign actors, which is a crucial step in \nholding other countries accountable.\n  Many of our citizens and corporations are understandably concerned \nabout the impact of information sharing on privacy. But we also must \nrecognize that rampant cyber crime is a monumental threat to the \nprivacy of the American people, and that sharing information about \nthese criminal acts cannot only protect privacy but also protect our \npublic safety and national security.\n  With respect to the specific privacy protections in the legislation \nbefore us, the managers of this bill have come a long way toward \nimproving the balance between security and privacy protection, \nespecially the changes made to the base bill by the managers' \nsubstitute.\n  A major area of concern was whether the government should be \nauthorized to use information shared under this bill to investigate or \nprosecute a host of crimes unrelated to cyber security. Now the bill is \nmore narrowly tailored and focused on using information gathered under \nthis bill to go after crimes that are specifically related to cyber \nsecurity.\n  The managers' substitute also adds a requirement that the information \nsharing procedures, required to be issued under this bill, include a \nduty to notify individuals when the Federal Government shares their \npersonally identifiable information, or PII, erroneously.\n  The managers' substitute also includes an improved reporting \nrequirement that will show the number of notices sent because the \ngovernment improperly shared an individual's PII and the number of \ncyber threat indicators shared automatically and, in addition, the \nnumber of times these indicators were used to prosecute crimes.\n  So the managers' substitute has come a long way toward being more \nprotective of individual privacy, and I would like, once again, to \nrecognize Senators Feinstein and Burr's hard work here and their \nwillingness to listen to their colleagues. While I might personally \nhave set the balance slightly different in some places, which is why I \nhave supported some of the amendments before us, I think they have done \na significant job in improving the bill and providing privacy \nprotection.\n  I do want to draw my colleagues' attention to one important \nadditional fact here, which in some cases has been largely overlooked. \nThe cyber information sharing system established by this bill will \nrequire Federal dollars to implement. Many of the agencies involved--\nthe Department of Homeland Security being the primary portal for shared \nthreat indicators--are funded on the nondefense discretionary side of \nthe ledger. This is an example of why I and many of my colleagues have \nbeen urging for sequester relief for both defense and nondefense \nspending--because we cannot defend our homeland without funding \nnondefense agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security and a \nhost of other key Federal agencies. Indeed, I am encouraged that we are \nclose to voting on a budget solution that will provide 2 years of \nsequester relief on a proportionally equal basis for defense and \nnondefense spending, and that protects the full faith and credit of the \nUnited States by taking the threat of default off the table until March \nof 2017.\n  For this reason, I look forward to final passage of this legislation. \nI once again commend the principal authors, Senator Burr and Senator \nFeinstein, for their extraordinary effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2581, as Modified\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I want to go back in time a little more \nthan 12, 13 or 14 years ago, to 9/11. One of the lessons learned by the \ncommittee on which the Presiding Officer and I serve, now the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee, was learned from former \nGovernor Tom Kean of New Jersey, cochair, along with former Congressman \nLee Hamilton from Indiana, former chair of the House Foreign Affairs \nCommittee. They were the cochairs of the 9/11 Commission. One of the \nthings they brought to our committee and to the Congress, after a lot \nof work by a number of good men and women who served on that \ncommission, was the root causes for how that disaster occurred: How \ncould those four aircraft take down the Twin Towers, crash into the \nPentagon, and crash into a field in Shanksville, PA, instead of this \nbuilding right here? How could that have happened?\n  There are a number of reasons why it happened. But one of the reasons \nwhy it happened is that we had stovepiped our intelligence services. \nWhat the folks over at the FBI knew wasn't necessarily known or shared \nwith the Department of Homeland Security. What the folks at the \nNational Security Agency knew was not shared with either of the other \ntwo agencies. What the Defense Information Agency knew or what other \nagencies knew simply didn't get shared--stovepiped--because we did a \nlousy job of sharing the real story, the full truth on what was being \nplotted, what was going to come down and literally take thousands of \nlives in one day and change in many ways our country--in profound ways \nthat still exist today. ``Stovepiping''--I have heard that word a \nhundred times in hearings and before our committee and in talking to \nfolks in the 9/11 Commission. The legislation that we passed on the \nheels of that disaster was designed to make sure we didn't end up \nstovepiping again with intelligence information that might lead us to \navert that kind of disaster. So far, it seems to be working and is much \nneeded, and I think it has been helpful.\n  Today, I want to talk about a different kind of stovepiping that I am \nafraid we may end up with--not to avert or block an aviation takeover \nof an aircraft and disasters involving the aviation sector but a \ndisaster in cyber space in the face of cyber threats to our country.\n  We are working here today and will be voting later today on an \namendment or two and then on final passage of the Cybersecurity \nInformation Sharing Act. Again, just to remind everybody, the reason \nwhy we are considering this is there needs to be a better sharing of \ninformation when businesses come under cyber attack from those within \nour country, outside of our country, cyber nations, and criminal \norganizations. We need to do a better job of sharing that information--\nbusiness to business and business to government--and for the government \nto share that information within the government to agencies that need \nto know so we can respond to those attacks.\n  Shortly after the 9/11 Commission recommendations were enacted, one \nof the things that we did was we stood up a new department called the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. It is a civilian agency, as we know. \nIt is not the Department of Defense. It is not the Department of \nJustice. It is not the FBI, and it is not the National Security Agency. \nIt is a civilian organization.\n  When the Department of Homeland Security was created, one of the \nideas behind it was that it would not be just a civilian operation, but \nit would be a civilian operation that could receive, from businesses \nand from other governmental entities, information relating to cyber \nattacks. That information could come through a portal--think about it; \nalmost like a window--through which those threat indicators would be \nreported. Those threat indicators would come through that portal at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. The Department of Homeland Security\n\n[[Page S7512]]\n\nwould do, almost in real time, a privacy scrub to strip off from the \ninformation--the threat indicators submitted from other businesses or \nother government entities--Social Security numbers or other personally \nidentifiable information or information that just shouldn't go to other \nFederal agencies or other businesses. They would strip it out--not in a \nweek, not in a day, not in an hour, not even, in many cases, in a \nminute, but just like that--immediately--real-time privacy scrub.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, we tried for years to be able to \nenact legislation that incentivizes businesses that have been victims \nof cyber attacks to share that information with one another, with other \nbusinesses, and with the Federal Government. A bunch of them have been \nreluctant to do it. Some of them have been reluctant to do it because \nthey don't want to get sued. If they disclose that they had a breach \nand maybe their competitors didn't, how would that be used against \nthem? How could they be named in lawsuits if attacks occurred?\n  So in order to get them to be willing to share information, we had to \nincent them. And the way we decided to incent them is to say: Share the \ninformation. You don't have to worry if you share it with the \nDepartment of Homeland Security through the portal established in this \ncivilian agency. Share it with the Department of Homeland Security, and \nyou have liability protection or, as it turns out, if you already \nshared it previously, if it has been shared previously with the Federal \nGovernment, you can share it again and still enjoy liability \nprotection. You can share it with companies that are victims of cyber \nattacks, share it with their regulator, and still enjoy liability \nprotection.\n  What we want to do is to make sure companies and businesses that are \nhacked don't just sit on the information, that they do something with \nit. This is a saying we have on Amtrak: If you see something, say \nsomething. If something happens to a business--a cyber attack \nintrusion--we want them to share it so other businesses and other \nFederal agencies can be prepared for it, look out for it, and stop it.\n  Where does this take me? This takes me to an amendment that we are \ngoing to be voting on later this afternoon offered by one of our \ncolleagues, Senator Cotton. It would, I fear, risk revisiting \nstovepiping--not the kind of stovepiping that led to the disaster of 9/\n11 but stovepiping that could lead to cyber threats--threat indicators \nshared with the Federal Government but not with the Department of \nHomeland Security, which receives these threats and immediately \ndisburses them to other agencies that have a need to know. But what the \nCotton amendment would do is that it would say that a business that is \na victim of a cyber attack could share with the FBI, could share with \nSecret Service, but wouldn't have to share with the Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  The reason why in our legislation, which Senator Burr, Senator \nFeinstein, I, and others have worked on, we have it going through the \nDepartment of Homeland Security is because, more than any Federal \nagency, they are set up to do privacy scrubs. That is one of the things \nthey do, and, frankly, they do it really well. Their job is to then \nspread that information and share that information back to the private \nsector, in some cases, and in other cases, just with relevant \nagencies--NSA, FBI, Department of Justice, Treasury, whoever else needs \nto know that information.\n  As part of the authors of the legislation, I join them in this. Our \nfear is if the information isn't shared with the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, which will then broadly share it in real-time and share that \ninformation with those who need to know it, and if it ends up that the \nFBI or, frankly, any other agency that doesn't have that ability to do \na great privacy scrub maybe, that doesn't have maybe the mission to \nimmediately share that information in real time to other relevant \nplayers, then the news--the word about that cyber attack--could \nliterally stay at that agency--the FBI or the Secret Service, for that \nmatter. We don't want that to happen. We don't want to see that \ninformation stovepiped in one agency. We want to make sure that it goes \nto one agency that does the privacy scrub. We want to make sure the \nagency that does the privacy scrub shares that information in real time \nwith relevant Federal agencies and the private sector.\n  I probably shouldn't pretend to speak for Senator Feinstein and \nSenator Burr. They will be here to speak for themselves. But I know \nthey share my concerns about this legislation. I ask, on behalf of \nthem, and, frankly, for others of us who believe that this is a \ndangerous amendment--and I don't say that lightly. We have worked \nreally hard. We have worked really well across the aisle--literally for \nmonths now--to get to this point. To use a football analogy, we are not \njust in the red zone passing this legislation; we are on the 10-yard \nline, and it is first down and goal to go. Let's not muff the play. \nLet's get the ball to the end zone. Let's pass this legislation. Let's \nvote down the Cotton amendment, and let's go to conference. Let's go to \nconference and provide the kind of protection against cyber attacks \nthat this country desperately needs and deserves.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                           Carbon Regulations\n\n  Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, today I rise on behalf of West Virginian \nworkers, families, communities, and all hardworking Americans who will \nbear the burden of these onerous carbon mandates. The bipartisan \nresolution of disapproval, which I have introduced with my colleague \nSenator Heidi Heitkamp from North Dakota and 47 other cosponsors, will \nblock EPA's greenhouse gas regulation targeting existing power sources. \nI also strongly support Leader McConnell's companion resolution to \nblock the regulations targeting new power limits.\n  As I was thinking about the speech today and as I rise to give this \nspeech, I realize I have said many of these same words so many times \nbefore. I have expressed the same frustrations and spouted off similar \nstatistics. What is the difference this time? The difference is we have \nalready seen the devastating effects and the callous nature of \nregulatory overreach. We know what the new reality would be. The new \nreality would be what we are facing with these new carbon regulations: \nthe reality of the families, the faces, and the hardships that we have \nalready endured; the thousands of layoffs in my State of West Virginia \nthat have already been issued; the jobs that have been lost and will \nnever come back.\n  Just this morning, nearly 200 West Virginia coal miners in Randolph \nCounty were informed that their jobs will be gone by Christmas. Think \nabout how those families will spend their Christmas holiday. Then \nconsider how those realities will be magnified and felt throughout many \nhouseholds across the country if these carbon mandates move forward--\nthe higher electricity bills that will result, the squeeze that already \nis squeezing struggling middle-class families who are living on fixed \nincomes, and the squeeze that those who live on fixed incomes will \nfeel. Our most vulnerable will bear the burden. Consider the far-\nreaching effects these regulations will have on schools that are now \nseeing their budgets shrink, home values that are now on the decline, \nand fewer dollars that are available for public safety and law \nenforcement.\n  It is reality that the policies emanating from this government--from \nour government--are causing this destruction. This is not a natural \ndisaster. This is not a fiscal crisis. This is not an uncontrollable \nevent but a carefully crafted, precise, and very meditated assault on \ncertain areas of the country. These are policies that help some States \nand truly hurt others, policies that target States like West Virginia \nand North Dakota where we produce some of the most reliable and \naffordable energy, and policies that are ripping the American dream \naway from families in my State and communities. Our families want and \ndeserve healthy, clean air and water, and they want to live in a great \nenvironment. But policies from Washington that pit one State against \nanother and prioritize certain communities and certain jobs over others \nare bringing the livelihoods of many to a halt. On behalf of Americans \nacross the country, Members of Congress now have the opportunity to \nexpress our concerns with these carbon mandates. We have an opportunity \nto weigh in about whether these burdensome regulations should go into \neffect.\n\n[[Page S7513]]\n\n  I believe that a majority of my colleagues understand the need for \naffordable and reliable energy, and that is why I am confident that \nCongress will pass these resolutions and place this critical issue of \nAmerica's economic future squarely on President Obama's desk. With the \ninternational climate negotiations in Paris scheduled for December, the \nworld is watching whether the United States will foolishly move forward \nwith regulations that will do virtually nothing to protect our \nenvironment and will tie one hand behind our back economically. Even if \nthe President vetoes these resolutions--and we recognize the likelihood \nthat he will--passing them will send a clear message to the world that \nthe American people do not stand behind the President's efforts to \naddress climate change with economically catastrophic regulations.\n  I am pleased to be joined by several colleagues on the floor who \nunderstand the need for affordable and reliable energy. I would like to \nrecognize Senator Heitkamp.\n  I ask unanimous consent to engage in a colloquy with my colleagues \nfor up to 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you to my great \ncolleague from the great State of West Virginia, a State that has been \npowering America for many years--in fact, from the very beginning. My \nthanks go to all of the great workers and coal miners in her State who \nhave added to our economic opportunity, not just for the people in West \nVirginia but for the people of an entire region.\n  That is one thing we forget--that in America a great miracle happens \nevery day. We turn on a light switch and the lights come on. If that \ndoesn't happen or if it is too expensive to turn on that light switch, \nwe will not be the country that we are. With this regulation, I think \nwhat we have done is cede the all-important role of electrical security \nand energy security to an environmental agency that does not have the \nexperience or expertise to understand what it takes to get an electron \nin the wire.\n  I am proud to stand today with my colleague Senator Capito and \nintroduce a bill to roll back the EPA rule on carbon emissions--that \nrule which threatens the supply of abundant, affordable, and reliable \nelectricity in North Dakota. I pledge to register my displeasure \nthrough multiple channels. This legislation today is the most public \nway of expressing not just my frustration but the frustration and \nconcern of my State regulators and my State utilities.\n  Although this rule will have dramatic consequences across the \ncountry, it unfairly targets North Dakota utilities. During the \noriginal draft rule, North Dakota's allocation was 11 percent. This is \nnot something we were happy with given the extent of the jurisdictional \nreach but something that people started rolling up their sleeves saying \nif we have to reduce by 11 percent, how are we going to do it and how \nare we going to meet this challenge? That is the North Dakota way, to \nnot only fight for our rights but also look at what the alternatives \nare. Unfortunately, when the draft rule went from an 11-percent to a \n45-percent reduction in the final rule, that was the straw that broke \nthe camel's back.\n  I am trying to do everything I can to push back against EPA's \nburdensome powerplant rules to find workable solutions so North \nDakotans can continue to have low-cost, reliable electricity. This CRA \nis one of the many different avenues I am taking to make sure that \nNorth Dakota is treated fairly.\n  I want to talk about what is unique about North Dakota. In fact, a \nlot of the generation that happens in North Dakota is generation that \nis generated by rural electric co-ops. These co-ops own and operate \nabout 90 percent of the State's coal-based generation facilities, and \nthey provide electricity to rural areas that in the past other \nutilities would not serve, not just rural areas in North Dakota but \nrural areas all through the region. These are people at the end of the \nline, as we call them, the very people that this rule will most impact \nand that EPA and this administration failed to consider when they made \nthis final rule.\n  North Dakota's utilities are heavily invested in coal-based \ngeneration for a good and historic reason. I think this is an important \npoint to make because a lot of people may say: Well, what is the \ndifference? You can fuel switch. But at the time our electric co-ops \nbuilt these generation facilities, they used coal because it was \nagainst Federal law to use natural gas. The fuel use act made it \nillegal to use natural gas for power generation, virtually forcing \nthese power companies to make the investment that they made in this \nfuel source of coal. Now, after making billions of dollars of \ninvestments to meet the mandates under the fuel use act and to meet the \nnumerous emissions standards that have been put forth by EPA, the \nadministration once again is straining these assets, causing them in \nmany cases to be stranded. If the administration were willing to pay \nfair market value to strand these assets, then maybe we could have a \ndiscussion, but I don't see that deal on the table. These utilities \nbuilt, modified, and retrofitted all at great cost and according to \nFederal law at the time, and now they are threatening the very \nexistence of this generation.\n  These assets are not just critical to North Dakota. Our coal-based \ngeneration provides dependable, affordable, reliable baseload \nelectricity to millions of people in the Great Plains with roughly 55 \npercent of electric power generated in North Dakota being shipped \noutside our border.\n  When this final rule came out, I simply said that it was a slap in \nthe face to our utilities and our regulators. This final rule was so \nvastly different from the rule that was proposed, it was almost \nlaughable that EPA said it wasn't in any way informed by any real input \nor any real comment. How can you take a utility and a State from 11 \npercent to 45 percent and not reissue that rule? How can that be the \nmovement in the final rule?\n  I think this final rule is a rule that jeopardizes close to 17,000 \ngood-paying jobs in my State. It provides power for rural communities \nthat otherwise would struggle for affordable, reliable baseload power. \nWe have some of the lowest power costs in the country because we have \nsome of the best utilities in the country, which are always looking out \nfor the consumer at the end of the line.\n  North Dakota has never stepped down from a tough challenge, \nespecially when the challenge is fair, the goal is attainable, and the \ntimeline is achievable, but that is not this rule. The goal is not \nfair, the challenge is not fair, the goal is not attainable, and the \ntimeline is unachievable in my State--unachievable. That is not \nanything the Clean Air Act ever anticipated--that we would set a goal \nwith no feasible or possible way of meeting that goal, given current \ntechnology. Yet that is the position we are in.\n  At the end of the day, what matters most is making sure that our \nutilities can do their jobs, making sure that when a North Dakotan or a \nSouth Dakotan or someone from Wyoming or Colorado, where we deliver \npower--and certainly those in Minnesota--reaches over to turn on that \nlight switch, regardless of the time of the day, that light comes on. \nThat is called baseload power. People who think this is easy, people \nwho think this is just switch fuels or switch technology, have never \nsat in a boardroom as I have and listened to the challenges of putting \nthat electron on that wire.\n  I stand with my colleague from West Virginia and my colleague Joe \nManchin here on our side of the aisle saying enough is enough. This is \na problem we need to address. Maybe that is the difference in how we \nlook at this. This is an issue that we can tackle and achieve results \nover time, but this rule is wrong. It is wrongheaded. It will, in fact, \ncause huge disruption to the economy of my State and the economy of the \nmiddle of this country. We have to do everything we can to prevent this \nrule from becoming a reality.\n  Thank you for letting me join you, the great Senator from West \nVirginia. We have two great Senators from West Virginia here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, there is a war on coal in America--a \nwar on coal in America. The leader is the President of the United \nStates. A number of us were in the Senate in 2009 and 2010, and the \nadministration\n\n[[Page S7514]]\n\ncouldn't pass their cap-and-trade proposal through the Senate. They had \n60 votes in the Senate. The President and his party had 60 votes in the \nSenate, but they couldn't pass the cap-and-trade proposal through this \nbody, so they decided they were going to do it anyway. They decided \nthey were going to do it anyway.\n  As the two Senators from West Virginia can attest, we have a \ndepression in central Appalachia, created not because of anything we \ndid here in Congress but because of the President's zeal to have an \nimpact worldwide on the issue of climate. I suspect that even if we \nfollow this path all the way to the end, this effort by the United \nStates would have about as much impact as dropping a pebble in the \nocean. Yet we are paying a real price for it here at home. Eastern \nKentucky looks like the Dust Bowl during the thirties--no jobs, no \nopportunity, no future, not as a result of anything we passed through \nthe people's elected representatives but by this sort of arrogant, \nsinglehanded messianic goal to deal with worldwide climate.\n  Our options to stop it are quite limited. We do have the possibility \nof the Congressional Review Act, but the weakness of that obviously is \nthat even though we can pass it with a simple majority, he is likely to \nveto it.\n  We are here today to stand up for our people, the ratepayers of \nAmerica, and not only the ratepayers--90 percent of the electricity in \nKentucky comes from coal--but the communities that have been devastated \nby this. I have never seen anything like it. I heard my parents talk \nabout what the Depression was like. It sounds and looks a lot like the \nstories they told me about America in the 1930s.\n  This is a venture that will have no impact on the issue for which it \nis being pursued but is having a devastating and current adverse impact \non the people we represent.\n  We have representatives from both parties here on the floor today \nworking toward overturning the administration's deeply regressive \nenergy regulations. These regulations are going to ship more middle-\nclass jobs overseas. I told my constituents last year: Coal has a \nfuture; the question is, Does coal have a future in this country? The \nIndians and the Chinese are not going to give up their future by not \nusing this cheap and abundant source of power. The Germans--one of the \ngreenest countries in Europe--are now importing coal. So coal has a \nfuture. The question is, Does it have a future here after this \nadministration?\n  My folks can't even put food on the table. The ones who can find a \njob somewhere are leaving. The population continues to decline.\n  As I said earlier, it is not going to have much of an impact on the \nenvironment of our planet. This isn't going to do anything meaningful \nto affect global carbon levels. It just seems that someone wants to be \nable to pat themselves on the back for doing something even if they \naccomplish hardly anything at all, except hurt a whole lot of \nAmericans. Higher energy bills and lost jobs may be trivial to some \nfolks out on the political left--not their jobs; they don't care--but \nit is a different story for the middle-class Kentuckians whom I \nrepresent.\n  So here we have on the floor Senators from both parties who are \nsaying it is time to take off the ideological blinders and instead \nthink about those who have already suffered enough over the past few \nyears. We have worked together to file bipartisan measures that would \noverturn the administration's two-pronged regulations. I have joined \nwith Senator Heitkamp and Senator Capito on a measure that would \naddress one of those prongs, the one that pertains to existing energy \nsources. Senator Manchin is here on the floor and joined me as I \nintroduced a measure that would address the other prong, the one that \npertains to new sources. These bipartisan measures together represent a \ncomprehensive solution. As I said, I am pleased to be joined here on \nthe floor by Senators from West Virginia and North Dakota. Senator \nDaines from Montana is here--another important coal State. The chairman \nof our Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator Inhofe, is here, \nand some have already spoken and some will speak after me. I am proud \nand pleased to be here on the floor with all of my colleagues standing \nup for our aggrieved constituents who have been mightily abused by this \nadministration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, first of all, I want to thank my \ncolleagues, Senator McConnell, Senator Capito, who is my colleague from \nthe State of West Virginia, Senator Daines, Senator Inhofe, and my good \nfriend Senator Heitkamp.\n  This is a bipartisan approach. Not often do we see a bipartisan \neffort, a bipartisan colloquy on the floor of the Senate anymore, and \nthere should be because we all have the same interests. Basically, how \ndo we provide affordable, dependable, and reliable energy? That is what \nthis country was built on. We have defended this country by having \nresources that we could use to basically defend ourselves, and that \nresource has come from what the Good Lord gave us. Coal has been in \nabundance in the United States of America. We have fought every war, we \nhave defended, we have energized, and we have built a middle class \nunlike at any time in the history of this world.\n  So now it comes to the point where there is a group--basically the \nones on an ideological pathway--who says we can do it differently. If \nsomeone came to me and said: We have this new great energy, and I am \nsorry, West Virginia and North Dakota and Oklahoma and Montana, we have \nthis new energy--and maybe it is commercial hydrogen, which will be \nwater vapor--that is wonderful. We will figure a way. We will embrace \nthat. We will figure a way to make it. We will do something. We will \ndiversify. That is not the case. The case is simply this: This country \nhas depended and will depend--even by this administration's admission, \nthis country will depend on fossil fuel for at least the next three \ndecades. It is in the EIA report. They are going to have to have it. \nBaseload, as the Senator from North Dakota said, is simply this: \nsomething that will give us power 24/7, day and night, rain or shine. \nThere are only two things in the world that can do it: coal and \nnuclear. Gas is coming on and gas will be a baseload when the \ndistribution lines and the pipelines are there to provide it. Right now \nit is not, but it is coming on strong.\n  Just look no further than Japan. Japan was mostly moving toward \nnuclear. Fukushima happens. When that happened, Japan had to change. \nWhat did they do? They changed to coal. But they decided the new plants \nthey would build would be ultra super critical. That means 40 percent \nefficiency, burning at the highest levels to reduce the emissions. They \nare moving in technology ways.\n  Now, what does the plan that we are talking about and we have our \ncolleagues talking about--existing source, which means they can't \ncontinue with what we have today, and new source, which means any new \nplant has to be built to certain standards. Carbon capture \nsequestration has not been proven commercially, not at one plant in \nAmerica. Yet these rules are based on using carbon capture \nsequestration.\n  All we have said--some of us have said this: Why don't you at least \ndemonstrate that you can have that type of commercial operation and \nthat it can withstand 1 year under commercial load and show us those \nare the new limits you want us to meet? That, to me, is reasonable.\n  Let me tell my colleagues this: If you were in the business of \nproducing power and you desired not to do that even though we had \ntechnology, then you would have to close your plant. I understand that. \nThat is not the case. They can't show us technology and show us that it \nhas a commercial feasible pathway to be able to perform and provide the \nenergy we need. There is no way they can do it.\n  So I have said this: If it is unobtainable, it is unreasonable. That \nis all. Don't expect me to do something that has never been done. If \nthe Federal Government says: Fine, we have $8 billion lying down at the \nDepartment of Energy--$8 billion that hasn't been tapped--does that not \ntell us something?\n  The private sector has not stepped up to take those types of loans \nand to use those types of loans to find the new technology for the \nfuture because they don't believe the administration wants\n\n[[Page S7515]]\n\nus to find any new technology that might be able to adhere to the \nstandards they have set.\n  So we sat back and we have done nothing. Then, on top of that, they \nexpect these plants, 30 years from now--if they are expecting to get \ncommercial power, electricity, fill the grid with power coming from \ncoal for the next 30 years--most of our plants average 50 years of age. \nThey can't produce the power they are going to produce--that we will \nneed for this country to have for 30 more years. An 80-year-old plant \njust won't do it. So that means they come off the line, off the grid. \nWhen that comes off the grid, what we call dependable, reliable, and \naffordable energy goes away. It goes away.\n  I have said this: Someone needs to respectfully ask our President, \nthis administration, the EPA, the DOE: If for the next 90 days not \nanother ton of coal was delivered to a coal plant in America--not \nanother ton of coal because--and I have said this to the \nadministration. They have been very eloquent in basically telling the \nAmerican people: We don't like coal, we don't want coal, and we don't \nneed coal. If those were the facts, then make sure you tell the \nAmerican people, if they didn't have coal for 90 days, what the United \nStates of America would look like. Just tell me what it would look \nlike. Ask anybody what it would look like. The lives of 130 million \npeople would be in jeopardy tomorrow--130 million people. This system \ncould collapse. The east coast could be dark. Now, you tell me how you \nare going to fill that in. And if you are not willing to be honest with \nthe American people and tell them that, don't make them believe there \nis something that is not there, that you can run this off of wind and \nsolar.\n  We have a lot of wind in West Virginia, and we are proud of that. I \nwill give an example. My colleagues will remember the hottest days this \npast summer, that very hot spell we had, 90 to 100 degrees. We have 17 \nacres of a wind farm on top of a beautiful mountain in West Virginia, \n560 megawatts. We have a coal-fired plant sitting there, the cleanest \nsuper-critical coal-fired plant on Mount Storm, 1,600 megawatts. Guess \nhow many megawatts of power the wind produced during the hottest times \nof the summer when we needed the power. Two megawatts. Two. The wind \ndidn't blow. It was so hot and stagnant, it didn't blow. That poor \nlittle coal-fired plant was giving it everything it had to try to \nproduce the power the Nation needed.\n  I am just saying the facts are the facts whether we like them or not. \nSo when this plan comes out and says that any new coal-fired plant \nbeing built has to be--you can basically be assured they are not going \nto build any. When they are saying existing plants have to meet certain \nstandards, they won't invest and try to hit a moving target.\n  So now what happens? For the 35 to 40 percent of the power you are \ntelling the United States of America, the people in this great country, \nthat we have--don't worry, we are going to take care of you, it is not \ngoing to happen. We are not going to stand by and say we are not going \nto fight for that. We are not only fighting for a way of life for West \nVirginia, we are fighting for a way of life for this country.\n  This country depends on energy we have been able to produce. We have \nalways depended on our little State. North Dakota, now one of the best \nenergy-producing States we have in the country--Montana, Wyoming, \nOklahoma--we have been the heavy lifters. We will continue to work for \nthis great country. We just need a little help. That is all we are \nasking for.\n  So I would say, ask the question: What would the country look like \ntomorrow? The standards they are setting are basically unreasonable, \ntotally unreasonable, because they are unobtainable.\n  The impact is going to be devastating, basically. The system is going \nto be to the point to where we can't depend on it, it is not reliable, \nand we don't have the power of the future yet. Maybe our children or \ngrandchildren might see that. I hope so. But until the time comes where \nwe are going to transition from one to the other, make sure it is a \nsmooth transition. Make sure it is a dependable transition. Make sure \nit is one that keeps this country the superpower of the world. If we \ndon't, I guarantee we will be the last generation standing as a \nsuperpower saying that we are energy independent; we are not fighting \nwars around the world basically for the energy this country needs. We \nhave the ability to basically take care of ourselves. We can be totally \nindependent with energy if we have an energy policy that works, but it \nhas to be realistic. This is not.\n  That is why I totally oppose this new power plan which is coming out. \nIt is a shame that we have to rely on the courts to protect something \nwe should be doing in the Halls of this Senate. It is a shame that the \ncourts have to step in to protect us.\n  With that being said, I yield the floor, and I thank my colleagues \nfor being here on this important issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, I appreciate the fact that \nmy colleagues from West Virginia, North Dakota, Kentucky, and Montana--\nall of us are getting together on this in a bipartisan way. I think it \nis worth repeating, to make sure everyone understands where we are on \nthis, what a CRA is. The CRA is the Congressional Review Act. It is an \nact that allows an elected person who is answerable to the public to \nweigh in on these decisions that are made by the President--who can't \nrun again for office--and by the unelected bureaucrats who are \ndestroying this country.\n  As was pointed out by the Senator from Kentucky, I do chair the \ncommittee called the Environment and Public Works Committee. On this \ncommittee, we deal with these regulations. We have jurisdiction over \nthe EPA. It is interesting I would say that because we tried to get the \nEPA to come in and testify as witnesses as to how the President plans \nto move to the percentage of power that is going to be generated by the \nyear 2030 by renewables, and they won't testify because they don't have \na plan. They don't know how they are going to do it.\n  The CRA is significant because there are a lot of people in this case \nwho would be the liberals in this body who like the idea of being \noverregulated, who like the idea of having the regulators run our \nlives, and they are the ones who would love to go home when people are \ncomplaining about the cost of all of these things and they can say: \nWell, wait a minute. Don't blame us. That was a bureaucrat who did \nthat; that wasn't me.\n  Well, this forces accountability, and these guys don't like it. I can \nassure you right now that we are going to give everyone an opportunity \nto weigh in on what these issues are. They would much prefer to go home \nand say: I know we are overregulating and I know it is destroying the \nStates--whatever the States happen to be--but it wasn't me, don't look \nat me.\n  Now we are going to see who is responsible because what is going to \nhappen is we are going to have a vote. The vote is going to take place, \nand I think our leader is correct when he says the President will \nprobably veto this. If the President vetoes it, it comes back for a \nveto override, and then people will know who is for it and who is \nagainst it. So I think a CRA has another great value. It forces \naccountability by people who are answerable to the public.\n  On the issue we are discussing today, the interesting and the \nconsistent pattern we have is that what this President does is he gets \nthe things they tried to do through over--through legislation, and \nthose things that fail through legislation he tries then to do by \nregulation.\n  Let me give you an example. Another issue--not the issue we are \ntalking about today--is the WOTUS issue, the waters of the United \nStates. Historically, it has been the States that have regulations over \nthe waters except for navigable waters. Well, of course, liberals want \neverything in Washington. So 5 years ago a bill was introduced, and the \nbill would have essentially taken the word ``navigable'' out so that \nthe Federal Government would have control over all the waters in my \nState of Oklahoma and throughout America. Two of them introduced a \nbill, one was Senator Feingold of Wisconsin and the House Member was \nCongressman Oberstar from one of the Northern States. I don't know \nwhich one it was. They introduced a bill to take the word ``navigable'' \nout. Not only did we overwhelmingly defeat the legislation, but the \npublic defeated the two of them in the next election.\n\n[[Page S7516]]\n\n  Now the President is trying to do what he was not able to do through \nlegislation through regulation. The same thing is true--the Senator \nfrom West Virginia is right when he talked about what they are trying \nto do. It is very interesting when you look at this bill. We are \ntalking about the emissions of CO2. The first bill that was \nintroduced was in 2002. It was the McCain-Lieberman bill. We defeated \nthat. The next one was the McCain-Lieberman bill in 2005, and the third \none was the Warren-Lieberman bill in 2008. Then we had the Waxman-\nMarkey bill that we never even got to vote on because nobody was going \nto vote for it.\n  So what they fail to be able to do legislatively, they are now trying \nto do through regulations, and that is why a CRA is significant because \nit does force accountability.\n  Let me make one other statement. This thing about Paris that is going \nto take place in December. This is the big party that the United \nNations puts on every year. It is the 21st year they have done this. I \ncan remember when they did it in 2009. That was going to be Copenhagen. \nSeveral people went over there at that time. President Obama was in the \nSenate, Hillary was in the Senate, Pelosi was there, and John Kerry \nwent. They went over there to tell the 192 countries that were meeting \nin Copenhagen--the same 192 countries that will be meeting in 2 \nmonths--went over to tell them we were going to pass cap-and-trade \nlegislation that year. That was 2009.\n  I went over after they had given their testimony there. I went all \nthe way over to Copenhagen, spent 3 hours, and came all the way back on \nthe next flight. I probably had the most enjoyable 3 hours I ever had \nbecause I was able to talk to 192 countries and tell them they had been \nlied to; that we are not going to be passing it. The same thing is \ngoing on in December of this year.\n  By the way, let me just mention one thing that hasn't been said. \nThere are people out there listening to this who actually believe this \nstuff, that the world is going to come to an end because of \nCO2 manmade gases. This is something we have been listening \nto for a long period of time. I remember right before going to \nCopenhagen in 2009--at that time the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency was Lisa Jackson, an appointee by President Obama, \nand I asked her this question on the record, live on TV. I asked: If we \nhad passed any of the legislation or the regulations that we are \ntalking about passing, would this have an effect of lowering the \nCO2 worldwide? She said--now keep in mind this was an Obama \nappointee--by the way, Obama was President at that time when he went to \nCopenhagen. She said: Well, no, it wouldn't reduce emissions worldwide \nbecause it just pertains to the United States.\n  This isn't where the problem is. The problem is in India, it is in \nChina, it is in Mexico. The problem we would have there is, yes, we \nmight lower our CO2 emissions in the United States. However, \nthose other countries will not, and it could have the effect of \nincreasing, not decreasing, CO2 emissions because as we \nchase our manufacturing base overseas to places they don't have any \nrestrictions, we would have the effect of increasing it.\n  So I am just saying I appreciate the fact we are all together on this \nand making the necessary efforts to make people accountable. I think it \nmight surprise a lot of people as to who changes their mind on this \nonce they know they have to cast a vote and be accountable.\n  I applaud, certainly, my friends from West Virginia and the other \nStates that are involved in this. I think this is the right thing to \ndo. Let's keep in mind the Utility MACT--that is the maximum achievable \ncontrol technology--was the first shock to put coal under. At that time \nwe did a CRA, and we actually came within four votes of getting the \nbill passed, and that was when Republicans were not a majority. I look \nfor some good things to happen, and I think we are doing what is right \nand responsible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for additional \ntime so the Senator from Montana can join the colloquy. As he reminds \nme, the Senator has the largest recoverable tonnage of coal in the \nNation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAINES. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  This administration is shutting down coal-fired powerplants in the \nUnited States. I thank the Senator from West Virginia, Mrs. Capito, the \nother Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Manchin, and we have Senator \nHeitkamp here. We had Democrats and Republicans in colloquy talking \nabout what is going on with coal-fired plants and the Clean Power Plan \nof this administration.\n  This is what is happening. It is killing good-paying jobs for union \nworkers, for pipefitters, for boilermakers, and tribal members in my \nState with these so-called Clean Power Plan regulations. At the same \ntime, it is stifling investment that could lead to innovation to make \ncoal cleaner in the United States.\n  As I travel across Montana, I have heard Montanans describe the EPA \nas--a rancher once told me it stands for ``Eliminate Production \nAgriculture.'' A union member recently told me it stands for the \n``Employment Prevention Agency.'' President Obama and his ``Employment \nPrevention Agency'' continues to wage war on American energy, American \nfamilies, and on American jobs. This so-called Clean Power Plan is an \nall-out frontal assault on affordable energy and good-paying union jobs \nas well as tribal jobs. This will leave President Obama directly \nresponsible for skyrocketing energy bills, a loss of tax revenue for \nour schools, teachers and our roads and the unemployment of thousands \nof hard-working Americans. The President ignores the fact that more \nthan half of Montana's electricity comes from coal, as do thousands of \njobs and $120 million in tax revenue every year.\n  In fact, 40 percent of our Nation's energy comes from coal. When a \nyoung person plugs their iPhone or their smartphone into the wall and \ncharges it, most likely it is being charged by coal.\n  In my hometown of Bozeman, we have a Tesla charging station at one of \nour hotels. Elon Musk at Tesla did an amazing, innovative job creating \nelectric vehicles, but when they plug those Tesla vehicles into those \nchargers, those Tesla vehicles in Montana are likely powered by coal.\n  The facts are that coal production in the United States is much safer \nand less carbon intensive than coal from other nations. As had been \nmentioned, this is a global challenge we must think about and address. \nThe Powder River Basin in Southeast Montana has coal that is among the \ncleanest in the world. It has lower sulfur content and cleaner than \nIndonesian coal. Shutting down U.S. coal will have a negligible impact \non global coal demand and global emissions. However, it will ultimately \nmake it more likely that less technologically advanced coal production \ntechniques will be used around the world.\n  This is the way to think about it. The United States consumes about \n10 percent of the world's coal. Said another way, 90 percent of the \ncoal consumption in the world occurs outside the United States, and the \nglobal demand for coal-fired energy will not disappear even if the \nUnited States were to shut down every last coal mine and every last \ncoal-fired plant.\n  Again, individuals are entitled to their own opinions but not to \ntheir own facts. Here are the facts. Coal use around the world has \ngrown about four times faster than renewables. There are 1,200 coal \nplants planned across 59 countries. About three-quarters of them will \nbe in China and India. China consumes 4 billion tons of coal per year \nversus the United States at 1 billion tons. China is building a new \ncoal-fired plant every 10 days, and that is projected to last for the \nnext 10 years.\n  In Japan--I used to have an office in Tokyo. My degree was in \nchemical engineering, and I was part of a software company with offices \naround the world. I remember the big earthquake that struck Japan--the \n9.0 quake. The Fukushima nuclear reactors were disabled. How is Japan \ndealing with that? They are building 43 coal-fired powerplants. By \n2020, India may outbuild 2\\1/2\\ times more coal capacity as the United \nStates is about to use. So it is shortsighted and misguided to move \nforward on an agenda that is going to devastate\n\n[[Page S7517]]\n\nsignificant parts of the economy. It is going to raise energy prices \nand destroy union jobs and tribal jobs.\n  We are seeing that already in Montana. Earlier this month, in the \nmonth of October, a customer of the Crow Tribe, the Sherco Coal plant \nin Minnesota announced it needs to shut down two units. This cuts off a \nsignificant portion of the customer base for Crow coal. Because the \nCrow Tribe relies on coal-fired Midwest utilities for most of its non-\nFederal revenue and for good-paying private jobs at the Absaloka Mine, \nthe unemployment rate on the Crow reservation today is in the high 40 \npercent. Without these coal mining jobs, that unemployment rate will go \nto 80 to 85 percent.\n  Ironically, some of the first impacted by the Obama administration's \nnew regulations are those who can least afford it. You have heard it \nfrom Senators on both sides of the aisle today. Under the final rule, \nthe Colstrip powerplant in Montana will likely be shuttered, putting \nthousands of jobs at risk. We must take action. We need to stop these \nsenseless rules.\n  This past weekend I joined the Montana attorney general, Tim Fox, in \nHelena to announce that Montana, along with 23 other States, has filed \na lawsuit against the Federal Government because of Obama's recent \ndecision. There are currently 26 States--the majority of the States in \nthis United States--through three different lawsuits that have \nrequested an initial stay on the rule.\n  As Leader McConnell mentioned in 2010, a Democratic-controlled \nCongress could not pass these regulations. The people's House stopped \nit, but now President Obama and the EPA are moving forward without the \npeople's consent.\n  I am thankful to partner with a bipartisan group of my colleagues, \nLeader McConnell, Senator Capito, Senator Inhofe, Senator Manchin, and \nSenator Heitkamp, who are speaking out and working to stop this harmful \nrule. I am proud to stand and join them as a cosponsor of two \nbipartisan resolutions of disapproval under the Congressional Review \nAct that would stop the EPA from imposing the anti-coal regulation.\n  Coal keeps the lights on, it charges our iPhones, and it will \ncontinue to power the world for decades to come. Rather than dismissing \nthis reality, the United States should be on the cutting edge of \ntechnological advancements in energy development. We should be leading \nthe way in using clean, affordable American energy.\n  America can and should power the world. We can only do it if the \nObama administration steps back from the out-of-touch regulations and \nallows American innovation to thrive once again. In summary, we need \nmore innovation, not more regulations.\n  Thank you, and I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleagues for \njoining me in a colloquy, particularly the Senator from North Dakota, \nwho is cosponsoring the Congressional Review Act legislation with me on \nexisting coal-fired powerplants, and certainly my colleague from West \nVirginia Senator Manchin. We have worked very well together in a \nbipartisan way on these issues--Leader McConnell, Chairman Inhofe, and \nSenator Daines from Montana.\n  I think we have presented a clear picture of the impact of these \nrules. So I ask unanimous consent that any time spent in a quorum call \nbefore the 4 p.m. vote series be charged equally against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CAPITO. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                              Puerto Rico\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I want to talk about the financial crisis \nthat is going on in Puerto Rico. We have all heard about the current \nsituation that Puerto Rico finds itself in. They are suffering. They \nare having trouble paying their bills and their economy is in shambles. \nSome people have the attitude ``Well, that is not our problem,'' but \nthey are forgetting the fact that Puerto Rico is part of the United \nStates. It is a territory. It is not a foreign country. Puerto Ricans \nare American citizens.\n  If a problem exists in Puerto Rico, it exists in the United States. \nIt is not something we can just ignore. It impacts the entire country. \nIf the economy continues to suffer in Puerto Rico, the people there \nwill just move to another part of the country. I want to repeat that. \nIf things are bad in Puerto Rico economically, they--Puerto Ricans--can \nmove to another part of the country. This is not immigration; this is a \nmove to the mainland. Many Puerto Ricans are leaving Puerto Rico \nbecause of it is troubles.\n  Happily, many of the people who live on the island are moving to \nFlorida. They are adding to the diversity and immense fabric of Florida \nthat reflects the entire country, but our gain in Florida is Puerto \nRico's loss. There are more than 1 million people in Florida alone who \nmay have preferred to stay at home on the island with their friends and \ntheir families. People who otherwise would be opening small businesses \nor new doctors' offices in San Juan are opening them in Orlando. This \nonly hurts Puerto Rico's economic future.\n  We need to give Puerto Rico the tools it needs to get its economy \nback on track. Puerto Rico cannot do that alone. Congress needs to \npitch in. I have joined a number of our colleagues--Blumenthal, \nSchumer, and Menendez--in being a sponsor of the Puerto Rico Chapter 9 \nUniformity Act. It fixes a glitch in the Federal bankruptcy law that \nstops Puerto Rico's municipalities and public corporations from \nrestructuring their debt through the Federal bankruptcy court, \nsomething that is law in all of the States. That is why we have a \nbankruptcy law, but there is a glitch that you cannot do that in Puerto \nRico. That is simply unfair. The people of Puerto Rico should get equal \nprotection under the law.\n  Both the Finance Committee and the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee have held hearings in the past few weeks about the economic \ncrisis in Puerto Rico. Two of Puerto Rico's elected officials, Governor \nGarcia Padilla and Congressman Pierluisi, have testified at these \nhearings. Both said that Puerto Rican public corporations need access \nto Chapter 9 debt restructuring.\n  It is this Senator's strong desire that we see them treated equally \nunder the law and that this legislation to fix this glitch comes to the \nfloor soon. We also need to help Puerto Rico's health care system. The \nMedicaid Program in Puerto Rico serves nearly 1.7 million residents. It \nis in terrible shape. In 2010, Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, \nwhich provided Puerto Rico with a $5.4 billion one-time payment to \ncover health care costs. That money is set to expire in 2019, but it \ncould even run out sooner.\n  Under Medicare Part D, Puerto Rican residents are being treated like \nsecond-class citizens. They don't get the same financial support that \nState residents get for prescription drug coverage. This has an effect \non their economy, stifling their ability to emerge from the crisis, not \nto speak of the fact that they are not getting the health care other \nAmerican citizens have.\n  I remind you, Puerto Ricans are American citizens. So this kind of \ntreatment under Medicare flies in the face of the most basic American \nvalue--equality. That is why several of us have joined Senator Schumer \non a bill to improve the way Puerto Rico is treated under Medicare and \nMedicaid.\n  Last week, thankfully, the White House released a set of legislative \nproposals to help Puerto Rico. Included in that list were some of the \nbills I have mentioned here that I support. I urge our colleagues to \ngive this problem the attention it demands. We should move the \nproposals that we can move in this legislative body. We should do it \nwith haste. There are more than 3\\1/2\\ million people in Puerto Rico. \nThey are U.S. citizens who, unlike most U.S. citizens, have no one to \nrepresent them in this Chamber and only have a nonvoting delegate in \nthe House of Representatives. They have no voice here, but even with no \nvoice, there are some of us in this Chamber who will make sure that \ntheir voice is heard. We cannot turn our backs on fellow Americans. By \nthe way, when it comes time to defend this country and our national \nsecurity, look at the percentage of Puerto Ricans who sign up for the \nmilitary. They are fellow Americans. I ask my colleagues to look deep \nin their hearts\n\n[[Page S7518]]\n\nand find a way to come together to help the island of Puerto Rico, a \nterritory, our fellow American citizens, to get through this troubled \ntime.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Budget Agreement\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, since I see no one is waiting to speak, I \nmight offer a couple of comments about the proposed budget agreement. \nWe are still evaluating this, looking at the details, but first things \nfirst. This seems to me to be something we should agree to. It \ncertainly gets us past this artificial debt crisis that would cause the \nUnited States to go into economic cataclysmic fits.\n  If we do not raise the debt ceiling, America cannot pay its \nobligations it has already incurred. It would be the first time the \nU.S. Government went into default. That time has already run out, but \nthrough extraordinary measures the Secretary of the Treasury has been \nable to keep the cashflow going, but he is running out of all of his \ntricks of the trade next week, November 3. That is the first thing it \nwould do most immediately.\n  The second thing it would do is it would get us over this budgetary \nimpasse of a budget that lays out the blueprint--for the flushing out \nof that blueprint, which are the appropriations bills. So in the case \nof the budget, what had been brought forth was a budgetary gimmick of \nsaying we were going to raise the amount of money we needed for \ndefense, but it was not going to meet this arbitrary budget cap that \nhad been set 3 years ago by the cuts across the board called the \nsequester. But oh, by the way, we were going to increase that defense \nspending a little more by creating an additional account over and above \nwhat we spend overseas called the overseas contingency fund, OCO, and \ntherefore money was going to be supplied--the increases we need in \ndefense--with in fact not increasing the budgetary caps on spending.\n  Well, that was budgetary fakery. That was budgetary sleight of hand. \nThat was not budgetary truth. This agreement stops that for the next 2 \nyears. Two years from now we will have to face the same thing and get \nrid of this artificial cut across the board. That is no way of dealing \nwith trying to cut the budget. You ought to be cutting the budget with \na scalpel, not with a meat cleaver, where you come across the board on \nevery program.\n  Indeed, what this agreement does is it raises the caps on defense in \nthis first year $25 billion. It allows an OCO increase of $23 billion--\nand that is considerably less than what had been proposed earlier. \nIndeed, as you get into fiscal year 2017, it raises the budgetary caps \non defense by $15 billion, also a $23 billion OCO, or overseas \ncontingency fund, for the war effort over in Central Asia.\n  This is a good program, but the other thing this agreement corrects--\nin the Republican budget, they had only raised money for defense \nspending, and all the other needs of government that need to be \nappropriated--nondefense discretionary spending--were kept artificially \nlow. If you are talking about grants from NIH, that was all being \nlimited. If you are talking about money for NASA as we get into the \nprogram of going to Mars, all of that had been cut. If you are talking \nabout agricultural programs, all of that had been cut. No matter what \nprogram--education, the environment, you go on down the list--all of \nthat had been cut.\n  This budget agreement that we will vote on hopefully in the next 2 or \n3 days does, in fact, raise those budgetary caps for nondefense \nspending as well as for defense spending. So where the caps were raised \nin this first year of fiscal year 2016 by $25 billion for defense \nspending, so too $25 billion for nondefense discretionary spending. \nLikewise, in the next fiscal year, 2017, where the caps had been raised \n$15 billion for defense spending, likewise, nondefense discretionary \nand all those other needs of government, the same amount--$15 billion.\n  I will have more to say about this later, but while I have the \nopportunity, I wish to commend to the Senate that I think it is \ncertainly in the interests off of our country to move forward and \napprove this new budgetary agreement.\n  By the way, I might add as I close that an agreement has been \nhammered out between the Republican and the Democratic leadership in \nboth Houses, along with the White House.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in today's digital age, many Americans live \ntheir lives online. We communicate via email, use photo sharing and \nsocial networking Web sites, store documents in the cloud, and access \nour private financial and medical information through the Internet. The \namount of sensitive electronic data that we create and store on the \nInternet is staggering and will only continue to grow. We know that \ncyber security is an important component of protecting our critical \ninfrastructure. A cyber attack targeting the electric grid in the \nNortheast, for example, could have dire effects during a cold Vermont \nwinter. I know that Vermonters care about cyber security, and Congress \nmust act responsibly to strengthen our ability to defend against cyber \nattacks and breaches. But I also know that Vermonters care deeply about \ntheir privacy and civil liberties, and I believe just as strongly that \nwhatever Congress does in the name of cyber security must not \ninadvertently undermine the privacy and security of Vermonters and all \nAmericans.\n  For years, Congress has seemed singularly focused on the private \nsector's desire for voluntary information sharing legislation. While \nimproving the flow of cyber threat information between the government \nand private sector is a laudable goal that I support, it is not a \npanacea for our cyber security problems. Information sharing alone \nwould not have prevented the major breaches of the past year, such as \nthe breach at the Office of Personnel Management, OPM, or the breaches \nat Sony, Home Depot, or Anthem.\n  Narrowly tailored legislation to facilitate the sharing of technical, \ncyber threat data could be beneficial, but the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee's bill lacks certain basic safeguards and threatens to \nsignificantly harm Americans' privacy. That is why I have heard from a \nnumber of Vermonters who oppose the bill and that is why consumer \nadvocacy organizations, privacy and civil liberties groups, and major \ntechnology companies like Apple, Dropbox, and Twitter all vocally \noppose the bill. The technology companies know firsthand the importance \nof ensuring our cyber security, and they oppose this bill because they \nbelieve it does little to improve our cyber security and would \nultimately undermine their users' privacy.\n  For months, I have worked with Senator Feinstein to improve this \nbill. She has been receptive to my concerns, and I appreciate that many \nof the revisions that I suggested are now incorporated into the \nmanagers' amendment. The managers' amendment now makes clear that \ncompanies can only share information for cyber security purposes, which \nis an improvement from the original legislation. It also prohibits the \ngovernment from using information shared by private companies to \ninvestigate routine crimes that have nothing to do with cyber security. \nAnd it removes a completely unnecessary and destructive new exemption \nto the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, which had the potential to \ngreatly restrict government transparency. These are significant \nimprovements, and I am thankful to Senator Feinstein for working with \nme to incorporate them into the bill.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate Intelligence Committee's bill still has \nmajor flaws. This bill overrides all existing legal restrictions to \nallow an unprecedented amount of data--including Americans' personal \ninformation--to flow to the government without adequate controls and \nrestrictions. It needlessly requires all information shared with the \ngovernment to be immediately disseminated to a host of Federal \nagencies, including to the NSA. It fails to adequately require \ncompanies to remove irrelevant personal information before sharing with \nthe government. The bill contains broad authorizations that allow \ncompanies to monitor traffic on their networks with liability \nprotection and employ ``defensive measures'' that may\n\n[[Page S7519]]\n\ncause collateral harm to innocent Internet users. The bill also \ncontinues to include another unnecessary FOIA exemption that will \nweaken the existing FOIA framework.\n  Proponents of the bill have attempted to assuage many of these \nconcerns by arguing that sharing under this bill is voluntary, and if \ncompanies do not want to share information with the government or use \nthe authorities in the bill, they do not have to. This bill may be \nvoluntary for companies, but it is not voluntary for consumers. \nAmerican consumers have no say on whether their information is shared \nwith the government and ends up in an NSA or IRS database. They may \nhave no recourse if a company needlessly monitors their Internet \nactivity or inappropriately shares their personal information with the \ngovernment.\n  Rather than limiting the dissemination of information in order to \nprotect the private and proprietary information of Americans and \nAmerican businesses, this bill goes in the wrong direction by giving \ncompanies more liability protection and more leeway on how to share our \ninformation. The most effective action Congress can take to improve our \ncyber security is to pass legislation that requires companies to take \ngreater care of how they use and protect our data, not less. And we \nshould pass my Consumer Privacy Protection Act to require companies to \nprotect our personal information and help prevent breaches in the first \nplace. The cyber security legislation before us today does nothing to \naddress this very real concern, so I cannot support it. I fear that \nthis bill will significantly undermine our privacy, and I urge Senators \nto vote against passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2581, as Modified\n\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, today I speak in support of the Cotton \namendment to the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act. My amendment is \nstraightforward. It simply would provide liability protection to any \nbusiness or other private organization that shares cyber threat \nindicators to the FBI or the Secret Service.\n  In its current form, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act would \nrequire entities to submit these cyber threat indicators through a \nportal created and run by the Department of Homeland Security in order \nto receive liability protection. But there are also two exceptions that \nwould allow entities to receive liability protection outside the DHS \nportal: first, if a submission was related to a previously shared cyber \nthreat indicator, and second, if the submitting entity is sharing \ninformation with its Federal regulatory authority. But not every \nprivate entity has a Federal regulatory authority, thank goodness, so \nwhere a cable company can share with the FCC or an energy company can \ngo to the Department of Energy or FERC, other businesses are forced to \ngo to the DHS portal. Good examples are retailers such as JCPenney, \nWalmart, Target, and Home Depot.\n  When the trade associations for two victims of the biggest cyber \nattacks in recent memory--Target and Home Depot--are pleading for this \nlanguage, we should take notice and incorporate it. Anything else would \nbe unfair, inequitable, and unwise.\n  We ought to give these companies an alternative to the DHS portal. \nOne simple reason is that nobody knows what the portal will look like, \nhow it will function, or how much it will cost companies to interact \nwith it. The Federal Government, after all, doesn't have the best track \nrecord for designing and deploying IT systems. Healthcare.gov was not \nexactly a resounding success. One could easily imagine a company trying \nto share a cyber threat indicator and getting an error message from the \nportal, just as millions of Americans received when they tried to sign \nup for ObamaCare.\n  In this case, regulated businesses can just go to their regulator. \nPrivate and small businesses will be out of luck, though. This is the \nprimary reason my amendment has such strong private support. \nOrganizations such as the National Retail Federation, the chamber of \ncommerce, the National Cable & Telecommunications Association, and many \nothers support this commonsense amendment.\n  The second main reason that entities should be able to share directly \nwith the FBI and the Secret Service is that the bill is about promoting \ncollaboration between the government and the private sector, as the \nNational Security Council says that we should in this tweet: ``More \nthan any other national security topic, effective cybersecurity \nrequires the US gov't & private sector to work together.'' I agree.\n  As Director Comey recently told the Senate Intelligence Committee, \nthe FBI has redoubled its efforts to reach out to private businesses in \nthis area. This has paid dividends. And there is no entity in the \nFederal Government that the private sector trusts more on cyber \nsecurity than the FBI. That is why Sony Pictures called the FBI when it \nwas hacked by North Koreans last year.\n  I also have to imagine that is the main reason the White House \nendorsed my amendment over the weekend when they sent out this very \nhelpful tweet: ``If you are a victim of a major cyber incident, a call \nto @FBI, @SecretService, or @DHSgov is a call to all.'' My goodness, \nSusan Rice and I stand together in agreement that if you are a victim \nof a cyber incident, you should be able to call the FBI, the Secret \nService, or the DHS. I thank the National Security Advisor and the \nWhite House for their support for the concept behind my amendment.\n  I would also like to take a few moments to dispel a few myths about \nthis amendment. The first myth is that the Cybersecurity Information \nSharing Act creates a single portal at DHS for liability-protected \ninformation sharing with the Federal Government and that the Cotton \namendment would create an unprecedented second channel.\n  This is false. The bill authorizes multiple liability-protected \nsharing channels with the Federal Government, not just one, through a \nbroad exception to the DHS portal that permits certain regulated \nbusinesses to engage in liability-protected sharing of cyber threat \ninformation directly with any Federal regulators without requiring that \nit first pass through DHS. The Cotton amendment simply provides the \nsame flexibility for businesses that already have established threat-\nsharing relationships with the FBI or the Secret Service to maintain \ntheir existing channels for sharing and not incur significant costs and \ndelays to establish new ones with DHS. My amendment is consistent with \nthis multichannel sharing approach.\n  The second myth is that my amendment would harm privacy as it would \nallow the sharing of cyber threat indicators with the FBI and the \nSecret Service and that the sharing with these agencies wouldn't happen \nunder the bill in its current form.\n  This is also false. Under the current version of the bill, if an \nentity shares information through the DHS portal, the FBI and Secret \nService will receive it. My amendment doesn't change that or the \nprivacy protections in the bill. Both with and without my amendment, \nthe FBI and Secret Service will get cyber threat indicators.\n  The third myth is that the scrub DHS would have to conduct for \npersonally identifiable information is not as rigorous under my \namendment.\n  Again, this is not true. The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act \nrequires all Federal entities receiving threat indicators to protect \nprivacy by removing personal information that may still be contained in \nthem before sharing with other entities. My amendment does not \neliminate or weaken any of the bill's privacy requirements, as the FBI \nand Secret Service are required to protect privacy in the same way all \nother Federal entities receiving threat indicators.\n  Finally, I simply want to note that the House-passed version of the \nbill contains a nearly identical provision, and that bill passed with \noverwhelming bipartisan support on a 307-to-116 vote.\n  To sum up, the Cotton amendment has overwhelming support in the \nprivate sector, including companies that have been victims of cyber \ncrimes. It would lead to greater information sharing between the \nprivate sector and the Federal Government. It preserves the privacy \nprotections in the bill. When it was included in the House bill, both\n\n[[Page S7520]]\n\nRepublicans and Democrats voted yes. I therefore ask my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, what is the order of business?\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2552, as Further Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question occurs \non amendment No. 2552, as further modified, offered by the Senator from \nDelaware, Mr. Coons.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to speak and urge a ``no'' vote \non amendment No. 2552, known as the Coons amendment.\n  This amendment essentially adds another layer of review to the bill's \ncurrent requirements. We worked this out in an earlier amendment with \nSenator Carper. This amendment goes further, and it could prevent parts \nof the government from quickly learning about cyber threats at machine \nspeed because it would require an additional privacy review for any \ninformation going through the DHS portal.\n  The Carper amendment that I spoke about was adopted as part of the \nmanagers' package, which made clear that the government should take \nautomated steps to ensure that the real-time information sharing system \ncan both protect privacy and allow for sharing at the speed necessary \nto stop cyber threats. Because the Coons amendment will slow down \nsharing via the DHS portal, I ask my colleagues to join me in voting \nno.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport my amendment to make sure that this bill strikes the right \nbalance between privacy and security.\n  I respect the very hard work of Senators Burr and Feinstein and the \nconstructive amendment that my senior Senator Tom Carper added to the \nmanagers' amendment. I do believe this bill has made significant \nmovement in the right direction. But I remain concerned, and my \namendment's purpose is to require that DHS review all cyber threat \nindicators it receives and to remove personally identifying information \nby the most efficient means practicable. It would not necessarily--\naccording to the amendment in the managers' package--be required that \nDHS scrub, unless multiple agency heads unanimously agree on the \nscrubbing process. My amendment's purpose is to simply ensure that \nthese privacy scrubs--done at machine speed, done in a responsible \nway--protect citizen privacy and our security. I don't think we should \nbe forced to choose between those two.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to amendment \nNo. 2552, as further modified.\n  Mr. BURR. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture \nmotion on S. 754 be withdrawn; that prior to the vote on adoption of \nthe Burr-Feinstein substitute amendment, the managers' amendment at the \ndesk be agreed to; and that following adoption of the substitute, the \nbill be read a third time and the Senate vote on passage of the bill, \nas under the previous order. I further ask that notwithstanding \nadoption, the Flake amendment No. 2582 be modified with the technical \nchange at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2582), as further modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 408. EFFECTIVE PERIOD.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b), this \n     Act and the amendments made by this Act shall be in effect \n     during the 10-year period beginning on the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Exception.--With respect to any action authorized by \n     this Act or information obtained pursuant to an action \n     authorized by this Act, which occurred before the date on \n     which the provisions referred to in subsection (a) cease to \n     have effect, the provisions of this Act shall continue in \n     effect.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2581, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question occurs \non amendment No. 2581, as modified, offered by the Senator from \nArkansas, Mr. Cotton.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. COTTON. Madam President, I support this important bill, but I \nwant to strengthen it.\n  Under the bill, a business receives liability protection by reporting \nthreats to DHS or its regulatory agency, but many businesses, \nespecially retailers like Target or Home Depot, don't have a regulator; \nthus, they must report to DHS. They have no choice. They must report to \nDHS even if they have longstanding ties to the FBI, as did Sony \nPictures.\n  I contend that we should allow these businesses to choose between the \nDHS, FBI, and Secret Service. Fortunately, the White House appears to \nagree with my position. The National Security Council tweeted over the \nweekend: ``If you are a victim of a major cyber incident, a call to \n@FBI, @SecretService, or @DHSgov is a call to all.''\n  This amendment wouldn't undermine the single-point-of-reporting \nconcept behind this bill because there is already an exception for the \nregulators, nor would it impair privacy rights because those rules \napply to the FBI.\n  Finally, I would note that the House-passed version of this bill \nincludes a nearly identical provision, and that got 307 votes.\n  Let's join together in a bipartisan fashion, adopt this amendment, \nand strengthen the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, we are almost at the end. This is the last \namendment.\n  Unfortunately, I rise to ask my colleagues to vote against the \namendment of not only my colleague but a member of the Intelligence \nCommittee. This is a deal-killer. I will be very honest. This kills the \ndeal. One of the thresholds that we had to reach was the balance to \nhave one portal that the information goes through. This creates a new\n\n[[Page S7521]]\n\nportal. The White House is not in favor of it. Downtown is not in favor \nof it because they understand what it does.\n  We are this close right now to a voluntary information sharing bill. \nI can assure you that this is the first step. We have a ways to go. But \nif you want to stop it dead in its tracks, support this amendment. If, \nin fact, you want to get this across the goal line, then I would ask \nyou to defeat the Cotton amendment and let us move to passage of this \nbill. Let us go to conference with the House.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nas modified.\n  Mr. BURR. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I ask my colleagues for just the next 2 \nminutes to allow Senator Feinstein and me to thank our colleagues for \ntheir help over the last several days as we have worked through the \ncyber bill.\n  I thank my vice chairman, who has been beside me all the way, and I \nthank Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member Carper for the input they \nprovided.\n  I want to say to committee staff who has worked night and day to get \nus to this point and to members of the committee who worked diligently \nfor months to get this legislation enacted that I could not have done \nit without you.\n  Now the work begins as we go to conference.\n  I turn to the vice chairman.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank you very much.\n  Madam President, I just want to say a personal word to Chairman Burr, \nand maybe it is to everyone in this body. One of the things I have \nlearned from two prior cyber bills is that if you really want to get a \nbill done, it has to be bipartisan, particularly a bill that is \ntechnical, difficult, and hard to put together, and a bill where often \nthere are two sides. I thank you for recognizing this. We stood \nshoulder to shoulder and the right things happened, and now we can go \nto conference.\n  I also want to say that we did everything in this bill we possibly \ncould to satisfy what were legitimate privacy concerns. The managers' \npackage had 14 such amendments, and before that our staffs sat down \nwith a number of proposals from Senators and went over literally dozens \nof additional amendments. So we took what we could.\n  When the chairman talks about the balance, what he means is that this \nis the first time the chamber of commerce has supported a bipartisan \nbill. This is the first time we had virtually all the big employers--\nbanks and retailers and other companies--supporting a bipartisan bill \nbecause today everybody understands what the problem of cybersecurity \nis much greater. So we stood shoulder to shoulder, and you all \nresponded, and I am very grateful.\n  There is still a lot of work to be done, but, Mr. Chairman, you and \nyour staff have been terrific. I would like to single a couple of them \nout, if I might, in particular, Chris Joyner, Michael Geffroy, Jack \nLivingston, Janet Fisher, John Matchison, and Walter Weiss.\n  I also want to thank Tom Carper, who has been working to get this \nbill passed as much as anyone. He wrote one of the key changes in the \nmanagers' package to improve privacy as information moves through the \nDHS portal. He was supported by his chairman, Senator Johnson. He has \nbeen a close partner throughout the process, and I thank him.\n  I also thank Gabbie Batkin, Matt Grote, and the other members of \nSenator Carper's staff.\n  We had incredible support from our committee. It is a committee of \n15--8 Republicans and 7 Democrats. I thank Senator Collins, who was \nparticularly concerned about the critical infrastructure of this \ncountry, as well as Senators Mikulski, Whitehouse, King, Warner, \nHeinrich, Blunt, Nelson, and Coats. I know they will help us push this \nbill forward as we go to conference with the House.\n  I greatly appreciate the supporters of this bill outside the Senate, \nto include the U.S. chamber of commerce and the associations that have \nendorsed this bill, tech companies like IBM and Oracle, Secretary Jeh \nJohnson at the Department of Homeland Security, and NSA Directors Keith \nAlexander and Mike Rogers, and Lisa Monaco and Michael Daniel at the \nWhite House.\n  On my staff, I would like to thank David Grannis, our staff director \non the minority side. David has been there for these previous cyber \nbills, and it has proven to be a very difficult issue. David, you are a \n10.\n  I also thank Josh Alexander. Josh has been our lead drafter and \nnegotiator and knows these cyber issues better than anyone. He has been \ntireless on reaching agreement after agreement on this bill, and is, as \nmuch as anybody, responsible for today's vote.\n  I would also like to thank my former cyber staffer Andy Grotto, as \nwell as Mike Buchwald, Brett Freedman, Nate Adler, and Nick Basciano. \nThank you all so very much.\n  Finally, I very much appreciate the work done by Ayesha Khanna in the \nDemocratic leader's office and Jeffrey Ratner at the White House.\n  We have the administration behind the bill, we have the Department of \nHomeland Security behind the bill, and we have the editorial pages of \nthe Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal, as well as the chamber \nof commerce, and most of the businesses of America.\n  So, Mr. Chairman, you did a great job, and thank you from the bottom \nof my heart.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I just want to add my words of \ncongratulation to Chairman Burr and Ranking Member Feinstein. This is a\n\n[[Page S7522]]\n\nvery complicated issue, as we all know. It has been around multiple \nCongresses, and it took their leadership and coordination and \ncooperation first to produce a 14-to-1 vote in the committee and then \nthis extraordinary success we have had out here on the floor. I know \nall of us are extremely proud of the great work you have done.\n  Congratulations. We deeply appreciate the contribution you have made \nto our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall it pass?\n  Mr. TILLIS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Madam President, I think we have clearance on a \nnoncontroversial resolution that is going to pass yet this evening, and \nI rise for about 5 minutes to speak on this issue.\n  Last week I submitted a resolution to commemorate the goals and \nideals of National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, which takes place \neach October. I thank Senators Leahy, Ayotte, and Klobuchar for joining \nme as original cosponsors of this measure.\n  I have met with many domestic violence victims over the years. We \nhave come a long way since the enactment in 1984, with my support, of \nthe landmark Family Violence Prevention and Services Act.\n  In the decades since then, Congress has committed billions of dollars \nto implement that statute, as well as the Violence Against Women Act, \nand we have seen a decline in the rate of serious partner violence over \nthe last two decades, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n  But researchers and advocates who work with domestic violence \nsurvivors remind us that there is still much work to be done to stop \nthis terrible crime and support survivors in their efforts to heal. It \nis estimated that as many as 9 million Americans are physically abused \nby a partner every year.\n  According to a 2011 survey by the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, about 22 percent of women and about 14 percent of men have \nexperienced severe physical abuse by a partner in their lifetime.\n  Experts tell us that domestic violence affects women, men, and \nchildren of every age and socioeconomic class, but we also know that \nwomen still experience more domestic violence than do men, and women \nare significantly more likely to be injured in an assault by a partner \nor a spouse.\n  According to the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics, \nwomen between the ages of 18 and 31 experience the highest rates of \ndomestic violence. Most have been victimized by the same offender on at \nleast one prior occasion. And, of course, it is heartbreaking to \nrealize that millions of American children have been exposed to \ndomestic violence, either by experiencing some form of abuse or \nwitnessing a family member's abuse.\n  The good news is that each and every day, in communities across the \nNation, there are victim advocates, service providers, crisis hotline \nstaff and volunteers, as well as first responders who are working \ntirelessly to extend compassionate service to the survivors of domestic \nviolence. I wish to take this opportunity to single out some of these \nfolks and extend a special thank-you on behalf of the Senate.\n  First, I highlight the hard work of trained volunteers and staff who \noperate crisis hotlines across the country. They are a varied and \ntalented group of individuals who, often at low or no pay, make \nconfidential support, information, and referrals available to victims, \nas well as their friends and families, each and every day. We \nappreciate their efforts to help countless men, women, and children \nescape abusive situations.\n  Next, I recognize the contributions of the talented staff at the 56 \nState and territorial domestic violence coalitions around the country \nand the globe. These individuals also help respond to the needs of \nbattered men, women, and children, typically by offering their \nexpertise and technical support to local domestic violence programs in \neach and every State and territory. In my home State, for example, the \nIowa State Coalition Against Domestic Violence has, since way back in \n1985, connected local service providers to vitally important training \nand other resources that exist to support Iowa survivors.\n\n  We cannot commemorate Domestic Violence Awareness Month without also \nmentioning the police officers who are on the front lines in the effort \nto protect crime victims and to prevent abuse in the first place. \nDomestic violence calls can present lethal risks for officers, and we \nmourn those who have lost their lives while responding to such domestic \nviolence incidents. We know, too, that in recent decades the law \nenforcement approach to these instances has changed to reflect the \nlatest research, and we applaud those police agencies that continue to \nupdate and improve their domestic violence policies.\n  I also recognize those who operate the Nation's domestic violence \nshelters that meet the emergency housing needs of thousands of adults \nand children each day or millions of Americans each year. Last but not \nleast, I want to highlight the hard work of the staff at charities and \nagencies across the Nation that are devoted to helping domestic \nviolence survivors achieve financial independence, obtain legal \nassistance, and most importantly overcome the detrimental emotional and \nphysical effects of abuse.\n  As I close, I urge my colleagues to support the adoption of this \nimportant resolution. With its adoption, we demonstrate the Senate \nsupports the goals and ideals of National Domestic Violence Awareness \nMonth.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nup to 20 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/senate-section/article/S7534-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7534-S7536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, there has been some activity on the \nSenate floor today regarding the President's Clean Power Plan, with \nfossil fuel State representatives coming to decry that plan. I would \nsimply note that on October 22, in the Wall Street Journal, many of the \nleaders of America's national security took out an advertisement to \nsay: ``Republicans & Democrats Agree: U.S. Security Demands Global \nClimate Action.''\n\n[[Page S7535]]\n\n  We have had generals and admirals, former National Security Advisers \nand Directors of National Intelligence, Secretaries of the Treasury, \nSecretaries of Defense, Directors of the Central Intelligence Agency, \nChairman of the National Intelligence Council, Governors, Senators, \nUnder Secretaries of State, many Republicans all saying this is \nimportant; that it is time for America to lead. And what do we get? We \nget complaints about America leading.\n  If my friends have a better idea than the Clean Power Plan, I would \nbe glad to listen. I am sure we would all be glad to listen. What is \nit? What is the other plan? Because if you have nothing, then you \nreally don't have a seat at the table and you certainly don't have \noccasion to criticize what the President is trying to do. Show us \nsomething--anything. What have you got? Where is the Republican bill \nthat even talks about climate change--let alone does anything serious \nabout it.\n  It is truly time for this body to wake up and not just wake up to \nclimate change but also to the decades-long purposeful corporate \nsmokescreens of misleading statements from the fossil fuel industry and \nits allies on the dangers of carbon pollution. So I am here for the \n116th time seeking an open, honest, and factual debate in Congress \nabout global climate change.\n  The energy industry's top dog, ExxonMobil--No. 2 for both revenue and \nprofits among the Fortune 500 of companies--has been getting some bad \npress lately. Two independent investigative reports from InsideClimate \nNews and the Los Angeles Times revealed that Exxon's own scientists \nunderstood as far back as the late 1970s the effects of carbon \npollution on the climate and warned company executives of the potential \noutcomes for the planet and humankind, but Exxon's own internal report \nalso recognized heading off global warming ``would require major \nreductions in fossil fuel combustion.''\n  So what did this fossil fuel company do? Rather than behave \nresponsibly, rather than face up to that truth, rather than lead an \neffort to stave off catastrophic emerging changes to the climate and \nthe oceans, what Exxon chose to do was to fund and participate in a \nmassive misinformation campaign to protect their business model and \ntheir bottom line.\n  This started right at the top. Exxon's former chairman and CEO Lee \nRaymond repeatedly and publicly questioned the science behind climate \nchange, notwithstanding what his own scientists had said. \n``Currently,'' Raymond claimed in a 1996 speech before the Economic \nClub of Detroit--20 years after this work by his own scientists--``the \nscientific evidence is inclusive as to whether human activities are \nhaving a significant effect on the global climate.''\n  There was already an emerging international consensus that unchecked \ncarbon emissions were warming the planet. There was already Exxon's own \ninternal research that showed carbon emissions were warming the planet, \nand it has gone forward to now with the latest report from the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stating that ``warming of the \nclimate system is unequivocal.'' Unequivocal.\n  The current ExxonMobil CEO, Rex Tillerson, still emphasizes \nuncertainty and goes out of his way to overestimate the costs of taking \naction. In 2013, he asked: ``What good is it to save the planet if \nhumanity suffers?'' All right, someone needs to explain to me how if we \nfail to save the planet, humanity does not suffer. I guess it is \nExxon's position that we only suffer if we try to save the planet.\n  At this year's annual shareholders meeting, Mr. Tillerson argued that \nthe world needs to wait--that is always their argument, the world needs \nto wait--for the science to improve--unequivocal is evidently not \nenough--and to look for solutions to the effects of climate change as \nthey become more clear--more clear.\n  Our oceans are clearly warming and acidifying, and this has been \nclearly measured. Atmospheric carbon is clearly higher than ever in our \nspecies' history on this planet, and this has been clearly measured. In \nRhode Island, we have measured nearly 10 inches of sea level rise since \nthe 1930s, right on our shores. What is not clear?\n  While Exxon was peddling climate denial here in Washington, the L.A. \nTimes reports, they were using climate models to plan operations in the \nwarming Arctic. Between 1986 and 1992, Exxon's senior ice researcher, \nKen Croasdale, and others studied the effects global warming would have \non Arctic oil operations and reported back to Exxon brass. They knew \nmelting ice would lower exploration and development costs. They also \nknew higher seas and thawing permafrost would threaten the company's \nships, drilling platforms, processing plants, and pipelines.\n  So Exxon was challenging the climate models publicly while it was \nusing them privately to guide its own investment decisions. Exxon \nunderstood the dangers, but instead of sounding the alarm or trying to \nhelp, they chose to sow doubt.\n  Then there are the Exxon front groups. A study out just last month in \nthe peer-reviewed journal Climatic Change says that ExxonMobil paid \nover $16 million between 1988 and 2005 to a network of phony-baloney \nthink tanks and psuedoscience groups that spread misleading claims \nabout climate science. The company's network includes organizations \nthat name themselves after John Locke, James Madison, Benjamin \nFranklin, and even George C. Marshall. It also includes the American \nLegislative Exchange Council, or ALEC, which pedals anti-climate \nlegislation in State legislatures. ALEC denies the human contribution \nto climate change by calling it a ``historical phenomenon,'' asserting \n``the debate will continue on the significance of natural and \nanthropogenic contributions.'' The climate denial coming out of ALEC is \nso egregious even Shell Oil left the group this summer.\n  Don't forget the paid-for scientists. The Exxon network includes \nWillie Soon, whose work consistently downplayed the role of carbon \npollution in climate change. Well, investigative reporting revealed Dr. \nSoon received more than $1.2 million from oil and coal interests, \nincluding ExxonMobil, over the last decade.\n  So the cat is out of the bag now, and all the bad press has got Exxon \na little jumpy. Exxon's VP of Public Affairs, Ken Cohen, took to \nExxon's blog to proclaim that his company has a legitimate history when \nit comes to climate. ``Our scientists have been involved in climate \nresearch and related policy analysis for more than 30 years, yielding \nmore than 50 papers in peer-reviewed publications,'' he said. He goes \non to say that Exxon has been involved with the U.N. IPCC, the National \nAcademy of Science's National Climate Assessment, and that Exxon funds \nlegitimate scientists at major universities as they research energy and \nclimate.\n  Right. The problem is that is only half the story. That is the half \nof the story that shows Exxon knew better. What is the rest of the \nstory? Decades of funding to a network of front groups that led a PR \ncampaign designed to undercut climate science and prevent legitimate \naction on climate change. For decades, Exxon invested in legitimate \nclimate research, you say? That is the proof of actual knowledge. That \nmakes the route they chose of denial and delay all the more culpable, \nand that denial and delay, as Paul Harvey would say, is the rest of the \nstory.\n  What are Tillerson and ExxonMobil waiting for? Why this campaign of \ndeceit, denial, and delay? Sadly, it is our American system of big \nbusiness and paid-for politics--just follow the money.\n  Exxon foists the costs of its carbon pollution on the rest of us--on \nour children, on our grandchildren--and all the while they make \nstaggering amounts of money. And Congress, funded by their lobbyists, \nsleeps placidly at the switch.\n  Exxon even fights to protect their status quo with their own \nshareholders. The Institute for Policy Studies reports that \nshareholders of ExxonMobil have introduced 62 climate-related \nresolutions over the past 25 years, and all of them have been opposed \nby management. Rex Tillerson, who made $21.4 million in stock-based pay \nin 2014, has openly mocked a shareholder who asked about investing in \nrenewables. This is rich. Tillerson responded that renewable energy \n``only survives on the backs of enormous government mandates that are \nnot sustainable. We on purpose choose not to lose money.''\n  Well, ExxonMobil spends huge amounts of money on the complex PR \nmachine to churn out doubt about the real science in order to protect \nthe\n\n[[Page S7536]]\n\nmarket subsidy that ignores the costs of Exxon's carbon pollution and \nmakes clean energy face an uphill battle. So it is really kind of nervy \nto say that clean energy survives on the backs of enormous government \nsubsidies when oil gets the biggest subsidies ever.\n  Things could have been different. Exxon could have heeded the \nwarnings of its own scientists and helped us make a transition to clean \nenergy. It is happening now without them. The International Energy \nAgency found that the cost of generating electricity from renewable \nsources dropped from $500 a megawatt hour in 2010 to $200 in 2015. \nImagine if we had rolled up our sleeves and gotten to work way back \nwhen Exxon first learned of the dangers of carbon pollution. Imagine \nthe leadership that company could have shown. Imagine how much of the \ncoming climate and ocean changes we could have avoided. But they \ndidn't, and the time of reckoning may now be upon the likes of Exxon \nand others in the fossil fuel industry. That PR machine may end up \ncosting the company a lot. Look at what happened to big tobacco.\n  Two weeks ago, Congressmen Ted Lieu and Mark DeSaulnier sent a letter \nto Attorney General Loretta Lynch regarding these newly reported \nallegations that ExxonMobil intentionally hid the truth about the role \nof fossil fuels in influencing climate change. ``The apparent tactics \nemployed by Exxon are reminiscent of the actions employed by big \ntobacco companies to deceive the American people about the known risks \nof tobacco.''\n  Last week, my friend, the junior Senator from Vermont, joined in the \ncall for the Attorney General to bring a civil RICO investigation into \nbig fossil fuel. ``These reports, if true,'' reads Senator Sanders' \nletter to Attorney General Lynch, ``raise serious allegations of a \nmisinformation campaign that may have caused public harm similar to the \ntobacco industry's actions--conduct that led to federal racketeering \nconvictions''--actually, a judgment. It was civil. But it is otherwise \naccurate.\n  Also last week, Sharon Eubanks, the former U.S. Department of Justice \nattorney who actually brought the civil action and won the civil RICO \ncase against the tobacco industry, said that, considering recent \nrevelations regarding ExxonMobil, the Department of Justice should \nconsider launching an investigation into big fossil fuel companies--\nthat it ``is plausible and should be considered.'' That was her quote.\n  Let me show why it is plausible and should be considered. Let me read \nfrom U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler's description of the culpable \nconduct in her decision in the government's racketeering case against \nBig Tobacco:\n\n       Each and every one of these Defendants repeatedly, \n     consistently, vigorously--and falsely--denied the existence \n     of any adverse health effects from smoking. Moreover, they \n     mounted a coordinated, well-financed, sophisticated public \n     relations campaign to attack and distort the scientific \n     evidence demonstrating the relationship between smoking and \n     disease, claiming that the link between the two was still an \n     ``open question.''\n       Defendants knew there was a consensus in the scientific \n     community that smoking caused lung cancer and other diseases. \n     Despite that fact, they publicly insisted that there was a \n     scientific controversy and disputed scientific findings \n     linking smoking and disease knowing their assertions were \n     false.\n\n  Now, let's read that exact same language back but apply it to \nclimate.\n\n       Each and every one of these Defendants repeatedly, \n     consistently, vigorously--and falsely--denied the existence \n     of any adverse [climate] effects from [carbon pollution]. \n     Moreover, they mounted a coordinated, well-financed, \n     sophisticated public relations campaign to attack and distort \n     the scientific evidence demonstrating the relationship \n     between [carbon pollution] and [climate], claiming that the \n     link between the two was still an ``open question.''\n       Defendants knew there was a consensus in the scientific \n     community that [carbon pollution] caused [climate change] and \n     other [harms]. Despite that fact, they publicly insisted that \n     there was a scientific controversy and disputed scientific \n     findings linking [carbon pollution] and [climate] knowing \n     their assertions were false.\n\n  Just change the words, and there is her judgment against the tobacco \nindustry, and it plainly applies to climate denial.\n  The investigative journalism from InsideClimate News and the Los \nAngeles Times is damning. The calls for greater scrutiny of ExxonMobil \nand the fossil fuel industry are mounting, and the phony-baloney denial \nnetwork is up in arms, trying to shovel this campaign under the \nprotection of the First Amendment. Sorry, guys, the First Amendment \ndoesn't protect fraud.\n  Describing Caesar at the Battle of Monda, Napoleon said: ``There is a \nmoment in combat when the slightest maneuver is decisive and gives \nsuperiority; it is the drop of water that starts the overflow.''\n  Is the tide turning? Is this the decisive moment? Despite documented \nwarnings from their own scientists dating from the 1970s, ExxonMobil \nand others pursued a campaign of deceit, denial, and delay. They may \nsoon have to face the consequences. In any event, history will not look \nkindly on their choice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, over the weekend President Obama \nannounced that all 100,000 public schools across the Nation should \nlimit testing to 2 percent of a student's time in the classroom. It is \na recommendation, not a requirement, and it comes in response to a \nnationwide backlash from teachers, students, and parents who are sick \nof overtesting.\n  I was glad to see the President's comments. He is right about \nstudents taking too many tests. But I hope the President will stop and \nthink before trying to cure overtesting by telling teachers exactly how \nmuch time to spend on testing or what the tests should be. Classroom \nteachers know better than Washington how to assess their students' \nprogress. They also know that the real reason we have too many tests is \nthat there are too many Federal mandates that put high stakes on \nstudent test results and that one more Washington decree--even if it is \nonly a recommendation for now--is not the way to solve the problem of \ntoo many Federal mandates.\n  Instead, the best way to fix overtesting is to get rid of the Federal \nmandates that are causing the problem. That is precisely what the \nSenate did when it passed by an overwhelming bipartisan majority, 81 to \n17, legislation to fix No Child Left Behind and give more flexibility \nto States and to classroom teachers to decide which tests will decide \nwhat progress students are making in the classroom.\n  No Child Left Behind, a Federal law enacted in 2001, requires \nstudents to take 17 standardized tests over the course of their \neducation, kindergarten through the 12th grade. It then uses those \ntests to decide whether schools and teachers are succeeding or failing.\n  In the Senate's work to fix No Child Left Behind, no issue stirred as \nmuch controversy as these high-stakes tests. At first, I was among \nthose who thought the best way to fix overtesting might be to get rid \nof the 17 Federal tests. But the more we studied the problem, the more \nthe issues seemed not to be the 17 Federal tests but the federally \ndesigned system of rewarding and punishing schools and teachers that \nwas attached to the tests.\n  A third grader, for example, is required to take only one test in \nmath and one in reading. Each of those tests probably takes 1 or 2 \nhours, according to testimony before our committee. But here is the \nproblem: The results of these tests count so much in the federally \nmandated accountability system that States and school districts are \ngiving students dozens of additional tests to prepare for the Federal \ntests.\n  A new survey says students in big-city schools will take, on average, \n112 mandatory standardized tests between prekindergarten and high \nschool graduation. That is eight tests a year. One Florida study showed \nthat a Fort Myers school district gave more than 160 tests to its \nstudents. Only 17 of those are federally required.\n  So after hearing this, the Senate decided to keep the federally \nrequired 17 tests. That is two annual tests in reading and math in \ngrades 3 through 8 and once in high school, as well as science tests \ngiven three times between grades 3 and 12. We also kept the practice of \nreporting results publicly so parents and teachers know how their \nchildren are performing. These results are disaggregated, so we know \nhow students are doing based upon their gender, their ethnicity or \ntheir disability.\n\n[[Page S7537]]\n\nThen, to discourage overtesting, we restored to States and classroom \nteachers the responsibility for deciding how to use these Federal test \nscores to measure achievement.\n  The Senate bill ends the high-stakes, Washington-designed, test-based \naccountability system that has caused the explosion of tests in our \nlocal schools. The Senate bill reverses the trend toward a national \nschool board.\n  I am glad to see President Obama's focus on overtesting, but let's \nnot make the same mistake twice by decreeing from Washington exactly \nhow much time to spend on tests or what the tests should be. States and \n3 million teachers in 100,000 public schools are in the best position \nto know what to do about overtesting our children.\n  Both the Senate and the House of Representatives have now passed \nsimilar bills to fix No Child Left Behind and to reduce the Federal \nmandates that are the real cause of overtesting. The best way to have \nfewer and better tests in America's classrooms is for Congress to \nfinish its work and the President to sign our legislation before the \nend of the year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to call \nattention to a group of our Nation's veterans who participated in a \nreconciliation program with the Japanese Government.\n  From October 11 to October 19, nine veterans of the U.S. Army, U.S. \nArmy Air Corps, and the U.S. Marines who fought bravely in the Pacific \ntheater of World War II and were taken prisoner by Japanese forces \ntraveled to Japan. They were guests of the Japanese Government on a \ntrip of reconciliation and remembrance.\n  Established in 2010, this was the sixth Japanese POW Friendship \nProgram delegation. This program is sponsored by the Japanese Ministry \nof Foreign Affairs for World War II POWs from the United States, with \nJapan running similar friendship programs with Australia and Britain.\n  More than 30,000 Allied troops were taken prisoner in Japan, many of \nthem Americans who faced horrific ordeals. Today, 70 years following \nthe end of World War II, this program reflects the journey of \nforgiveness and resolution between the United States and Japan, as our \nrelationship has developed into one of the most critical in the region.\n  I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the veterans who were \nmembers of this year's delegation: Joseph DeMott, a U.S. Army Air Corps \nveteran from Litiz, PA; Arthur Gruenberg, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran \nfrom Camano Island, WA; George Hirschkamp, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran \nfrom Sandpoint, ID; George Rodgers, a U.S. Army veteran from Lynchburg, \nVA; Jack Warner, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran from Elk City, OK; and \nClifford Warren, a U.S. Army veteran from Shepherd, TX.\n  I would also like to recognize three members of the delegation who \nare my constituents: Leland Chandler, a U.S. Army veteran from \nGalesburg, IL; William Chittenden, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran from \nWheaton, IL; and Carl Dyer, a U.S. Army veteran from Oglesby, IL.\n  I am so grateful to all of these participants for their years of \nservice to our Nation.\n  The delegation was accompanied by Jan Thompson, another Illinois \nconstituent and a documentary filmmaker and daughter of a World War II \nveteran who was himself a POW in Japan. Thompson also heads the \nnonprofit veterans organization American Defenders of Bataan & \nCorregidor Memorial Society.\n  The Japanese POW Friendship Program and the American veterans who \nparticipate in it represent the transformation and strength of the \nU.S.-Japan relationship. I hope this program continues to bring \ntogether our two nations in remembrance and reconciliation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/senate-section/article/S7537-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUDGETARY REVISIONS\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, section 4380 of S. Con. Res. 11, the \nconcurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2016, allows the \nchairman of the Senate Budget Committee to revise the allocations, \naggregates, and levels in the budget resolution for legislation that \nincreases sharing of cyber security threat information while protecting \nindividual privacy and civil liberties interests. The authority to \nadjust is contingent on the legislation not increasing the deficit over \neither the period of the total of fiscal years 2016-2020 or the period \nof the total of fiscal years 2016-2025.\n  I find that S. 754, as amended, fulfills the conditions of deficit \nneutrality found in section 4380 of S. Con. Res. 11. Accordingly, I am \nrevising the allocation to the Select Committee on Intelligence and the \nbudgetary aggregates to account for the budget effects of the \namendment.

Mr. President, I wish to submit to the Senate the budget \nscorekeeping report for October 2015. The report compares current law \nlevels of spending and revenues with the amounts provided in the \nconference report to accompany S. Con. Res. 11, the budget resolution \nfor fiscal year 2016. This information is necessary to determine \nwhether budget points of order lie against pending legislation. It has \nbeen prepared by the Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee \nand the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, pursuant to section 308(b) of \nthe Congressional Budget Act.\n  This is the third report I have made since adoption of the fiscal \nyear 2016 budget resolution on May 5, 2015. My last filing can be found \nin the Congressional Record on September 10, 2015. The information \ncontained in this report is current through October 26, 2015.\n  Table 1 gives the amount by which each Senate authorizing committee \nis below or exceeds its allocation under the budget resolution. This \ninformation is used for enforcing committee allocations pursuant to \nsection 302 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, CBA. For fiscal \nyear 2015, which ended on September 30, 2015, Senate authorizing \ncommittees have increased direct spending outlays by $7.8 billion more \nthan the agreed upon spending levels. Over the fiscal year 2016-2025 \nperiod, which is the entire period covered by S. Con. Res. 11, Senate \nauthorizing committees have spent $2.2 billion less than the budget \nresolution calls for.\n  Table 2 gives the amount by which the Senate Committee on \nAppropriations is below or exceeds the statutory spending limits. This \ninformation is used to determine points of order related to the \nspending caps found in section 312 and section 314 of the CBA. While no \nfull-year appropriations bills have been enacted for fiscal year 2016, \nsubcommittees are charged with permanent and advanced appropriations \nthat first become available in that year.\n  Table 3 gives the amount by which the Senate Committee on \nAppropriations is below or exceeds its allocation for overseas \ncontingency operations/global war on terrorism, OCO/GWOT, spending. \nThis separate allocation for OCO/GWOT was established in section 3102 \nof S. Con. Res. 11 and is enforced using section 302 of the CBA. No \nbills providing funds with the OCO/GWOT designation on a full-year \nbasis have been enacted thus far for fiscal year 2016.\n  The budget resolution established two new points of order limiting \nthe use of changes in mandatory programs in appropriations bills, \nCHIMPS. Tables 4 and 5 show compliance with fiscal year 2016 limits for \noverall CHIMPS and the Crime Victims Fund CHIMP, respectively. This \ninformation is used for determining points of order under section 3103 \nand section 3104, respectively. No full-year bills have been enacted \nthus far for fiscal year 2016 that include CHIMPS.\n  In addition to the tables provided by the Senate Budget Committee \nRepublican staff, I am submitting additional\n\n[[Page S7538]]\n\ntables from CBO that I will use for enforcement of budget levels agreed \nto by the Congress.\n  CBO provided a report for both fiscal year 2015 and fiscal year 2016. \nThis information is used to enforce aggregate spending levels in budget \nresolutions under section 311 of the CBA. CBO's estimates show that \ncurrent law levels of spending for fiscal year 2015 exceed the amounts \nin the deemed budget resolution enacted in the BBA by $8.0 billion in \nbudget authority and $1.0 billion in outlays. Revenues are $79.8 \nbillion below the revenue floor for fiscal year 2015 set by the deemed \nbudget resolution. As well, Social Security outlays are at the levels \nassumed for fiscal year 2015, while Social Security revenues are $170 \nmillion above levels in the deemed budget. This will be CBO's final \nreport to the Senate Budget Committee for fiscal year 2015, as the \nfiscal year is now closed.\n  For fiscal year 2016, CBO annualizes the effects of the Continuing \nAppropriations Act, P.L. 114-53, which provides funding through \nDecember 11, 2015. For the enforcement of budgetary aggregates, the \nSenate Budget Committee excludes this temporary funding. As such, the \ncommittee views current law levels as being $885.9 billion and $526.4 \nbillion below budget resolution levels for budget authority and \noutlays, respectively. Revenues are $144 million above the level \nassumed in the budget resolution. Finally, Social Security outlays are \nat the levels assumed in the budget resolution for fiscal year 2016, \nwhile Social Security revenues are $18 million above assumed levels for \nthe budget year.\n  CBO's report also provides information needed to enforce the Senate's \npay-as-you-go rule. The Senate's pay-as-you-go scorecard currently \nshows deficit reduction of $1.4 billion over the fiscal year 2015-2020 \nperiod and $6.1 billion over the fiscal year 2015-2025 period. Over the \ninitial 6-year period, Congress has enacted legislation that would \nincrease revenues by $4.1 billion and increase outlays by $2.7 billion. \nOver the 11-year period, Congress has enacted legislation that would \nreduce revenues by $1.3 billion and decrease outlays by $7.4 billion. \nThe Senate's pay-as-you-go rule is enforced by section 201 of S. Con. \nRes. 21, the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution.\n  All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n TABLE 1.--SENATE AUTHORIZING COMMITTEES--ENACTED DIRECT SPENDING ABOVE\n                   (+) OR

Mr. President, last month the Senate Indian Affairs \nCommittee held an oversight hearing on the Environmental Protection \nAgency's Gold King Mine disaster. I am very grateful that Chairman John \nBarrasso and Vice Chairman Jon Tester quickly made this matter a \npriority for their committee following the August break. The hearing \nfocused on the harmful impacts that spill is having on Indian Country, \nnamely the Navajo Nation, the Southern Ute Tribe, and the Ute Mountain \nUte Tribe.\n  On the Navajo Nation, an estimated 1,500 farms have been damaged by \nthe EPA and its contractors when they released a deluge of tailings-\npond wastewater from the abandoned Gold King Mine. On August 5, 2015, \nan acidic plume of mercury, arsenic, and other metals worked its way \ndown the Animas River in Colorado and into the San Juan River near \nFarmington, NM. Nobody yet knows for certain the total damage to crops, \nsoil, livestock, wildlife, and water supplies that are critical sources \nof food for the Navajo people and also serve as economic and cultural \ncenters. Those farmers who were able to shut down their irrigation \nsystems watched in horror as their crops wilted.\n  The EPA now says water quality in the San Juan River has returned to \n``pre-event levels,'' but the Gold King Mine is still releasing water \nroughly at 600 gallons per minute. The concentrations of toxic metals \nmay not as be as high today as it was during the initial 3 million \ngallon flush, but the Navajo are still waiting for EPA to demonstrate \nit can prevent another large release. The nation is rightfully \ndemanding assurances that heavy rainfall won't disturb toxic substances \nthat may have settled in the sediment of the Animas River, the San Juan \nRiver, or even Lake Powell.\n  In August, I--along with Arizona Governor Doug Ducey--met with Navajo \nNation president Russell Begaye and Navajo council speaker Lorenzo \nBates in Window Rock, AZ, to discuss this matter. I can assure my \ncolleagues that the Navajo are suffering deeply and dearly because of \nthis spill. I have also received calls and letters from a number of \nconcerned constituents, mayors, county supervisors, and businesses in \nnorthern Arizona who also have a stake in the health and safety of Lake \nPowell. They are just as alarmed as the Navajo people that the plume \ncould endanger their livelihoods and their enjoyment of natural \nresources in their communities. The Arizona Department of Environmental \nQuality and the Arizona Geological Survey have been expending scarce \nresources to conduct water samples independent of EPA. And that has \nbeen helpful. But the Federal Government has to step up and take action \nthat would allow all affected stakeholders, but especially tribal \ncommunities, find confidence in what the Federal Government is doing to \nfix the mess that it created.\n  At last month's hearing, we received testimony from EPA Administrator \nGina McCarthy and others dealing with the spill, including the Navajo \nNation president, Russell Begaye. We also received testimony from Doug \nHoltz-Eakin, a noted economist and former Director of the Congressional \nBudget Office. Mr. Holtz-Eakin estimated that the spill will cost the \nNavajo's agriculture sector roughly $41,000 a day in lost economic \nactivity.\n  While I am grateful that Administrator McCarthy agreed to appear \nbefore the committee, I am concerned that, under her watch, not a \nsingle Agency employee or contractor had been fired for the disaster. \nIn her testimony, Administrator McCarthy portrayed the EPA's response \nto the tribes as timely, but her portrayal was directly contradicted by \nthe testimony of the Navajo president, who noted that it took EPA 2 \ndays to notify the tribe about the plume's threat to the tribe. It was \nalso revealed that Administrator McCarthy did not directly contact \nPresident Begaye for about 5 days after the spill. The committee also \nreceived testimony that EPA had not quickly and routinely shared water \nmonitory data with the tribes. All of this shatters any notion that EPA \nhas honored its government-to-government responsibility to the nation.\n  The Gold King Mine spill was a series of failures by EPA that \ncompounded, and the Navajo are paying the price. I will continue to \npush for increased congressional oversight into this matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/senate-section/article/S7541-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HEAD START AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I speak on \nbehalf of the Delaware delegation to honor Head Start's 50 years of \nservice to our Nation's most vulnerable children and families in \nDelaware and nationwide. On May 18, 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson \nlaunched Project Head Start as an 8-week summer demonstration project \nto teach low-income students needed skills before they started \nkindergarten. Over the past 50 years, Head Start has served 32 million \nchildren and families across the country with comprehensive services.\n  The Head Start Program has given children and families the tools to \nsucceed by ensuring a high quality education and access to health care \nand social services. The Head Start Program represents a critical \ninvestment in the education of our nation's youngest children. In the \nState of Delaware, 2,714 children and pregnant women benefitted from \nHead Start, Early Head Start, and the Early Childhood Assistance \nProgram in 2014. Head Start is instrumental in uplifting families in \nDelaware by providing resources to families who, like many of us, want \nto see their children reach their full potential.\n  The teachers, home visitors, and family service workers that make up \nthe Head Start Program are the backbone of this mission. Without them \non the front lines each and every day, these early education goals \nwould not be met. I commend the teachers and staff who are deeply \ncommitted to seeing all children succeed. On behalf of Senator Chris \nCoons and Congressman John Carney, I recognize Head Start Awareness \nMonth and the 50th Anniversary of Head Start. It is our sincere hope \nthat future generations of children and families can continue to \ngreatly benefit from Head Start's programs and we can put children on \nthe right path from the very beginning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/senate-section/article/S7541-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7541-S7542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                OBSERVING INTERNATIONAL DAY OF THE GIRL\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, October 11 marked the second annual \nInternational Day of the Girl. This day\n\n[[Page S7542]]\n\nbrings together people and advocacy groups to raise awareness about the \nchallenges facing girls around the world. Tragically, today's regional \ncrises are having a disproportionately destructive impact on girls. \n2015 marks the year with the highest number of displaced persons since \nWorld War II. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for \nRefugees, women and girls comprise half of any refugee or internally \ndisplaced population. Crises such as the ongoing conflict in Syria, \nover 1.5 million displaced in South Sudan, and the expanding migrant \ncrisis in Europe, among others, risk leaving an entire generation of \ngirls shaped by a lack of opportunity, gender-based violence, forced \nmarriage, and disrupted education.\n  Access to education is often a top priority for refugee families upon \nresettling in a foreign country. We know that, if empowered with the \nappropriate tools, girls can be facilitators of change who can \ntransform their own lives, as well as the lives of their families, \ncommunities, and societies and serve as a bulwark against the \nconditions that contribute to extremism that so many terrorist groups \nhave exploited, often at the expense of women and girls. The lack of \naccess to education for refugee girls stifles empowerment and stands in \nthe way of achieving a durable solution to conflict.\n  As the United States and the international community work to cope \nwith the current refugee crisis, it is critical that we focus not only \non security but on the basic needs of refugees, such as access to \neducation and increasing the role of women and girls in humanitarian \nresponse and civil society programs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/senate-section/article/S7542-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO THOMAS ROCKROADS, JR.\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I wish to honor Thomas Rockroads, Jr., a \nveteran of the Vietnam war. On behalf of all Montanans and all \nAmericans, I would like to thank Mr. Rockroads for his service to our \nState and to our Nation. It is my privilege to share Thomas's story for \nthe official Senate Record.\n  Thomas Rockroads, Jr., was born on December 21, 1948, in Crow Agency, \nMT. His father worked in sawmills in both Kirby and Lame Deer and was a \nranch hand and coal miner in Lame Deer. His mother worked for many \nyears at the Northern Hotel before coming home to the Northern Cheyenne \nReservation. He spent his childhood in Busby and attended Busby High \nSchool until joining the Army his junior year.\n  In September of 1968, he volunteered for the Army Airborne Infantry, \nand by September of 1969, he found himself jumping out of helicopters \nand into the highlands of Vietnam. Thomas was a member of the 173rd \nAirborne Brigade, which was stationed in the hot, humid Tiger Mountains \nof Vietnam's Central Highlands. Their responsibilities included \nrescuing and evacuating ground forces, as well as setting up perimeters \nfor operations. They were right in the thick of things, and, as Thomas \nonce put it, ``If there was a hot spot where reinforcements were needed \n. . . we were there.'' On more than one occasion, this proved to be an \nimportant but harrowing position to be in. One night, when the brigade \nwas charged with setting up a perimeter on a hillside, Thomas and his \ncomrades felt particularly concerned. They knew the area was likely \nheavily booby-trapped, so they proceeded with extra caution. Their \nmission was to intercept the North Vietnamese forces headed in their \ndirection, and after establishing a perimeter, they were allowed a few \nhours of rest before being put on high alert. A few hours later, while \nhe was trying to get some sleep, Thomas suddenly heard a blast, and he \nwas thrown nearly a dozen feet from his makeshift tent. Thomas quickly \nrealized that someone had set off a booby trap, but before he could \nprocess much else, a medic began calling his name and he rushed over to \nhelp. Thomas worked with the medic to care for his fellow soldier, but \nshortly thereafter the man died in Thomas's arms.\n  A few days later, Thomas and his brigade found themselves under siege \nagain--this time, without cover, they came face to face with enemy \nsoldiers. The North Vietnamese troops, equipped with an anti-aircraft \ngun and hiding inside an irrigation trench, began rapid firing on \nThomas and his platoon. Knowing they needed air support, Thomas headed \nright toward the anti-aircraft gun--as long as it was operable, \nAmerican helicopters couldn't access the area. However, his M16 was \njammed, so under heavy fire, he had to dislodge the trapped bullets and \nreplace them with a new magazine. He and a fellow solider finally \nlocated the enemy's weapon at the far end of a hedgerow and headed back \ninto the firestorm with one aim--to disarm it. Before they could reach \ntheir target, an enemy solider intercepted them, lobbing a grenade \ndirectly at Thomas and his comrade. They both ran for cover, and \nthankfully the grenade failed to detonate, but mere seconds after that, \nanother soldier charged them, firing wildly at Thomas and his platoon. \nThe soldier was not more than 10 feet away from Thomas when he finally \nwent down.\n  Thomas returned to Busby, MT, a full 365 days after his deployment. \nHe remarkably didn't sustain a single scratch. But like many of his \nfellow veterans, despite his lack of visible wounds, Thomas has \nstruggled with the unseen wounds of war. Thirty-five years after coming \nback from Vietnam, he was formally diagnosed with post-traumatic stress \ndisorder.\n  Despite this often debilitating struggle, Thomas has spent the last \n30 years working for Western Energy's Rosebud Mine at Colstrip and \nraising two daughters and a son with his wife, Charlotte, of 38 years. \nHe also has grandchildren. He credits his family with helping him heal. \n``It's all the support of my family that's got me where I'm at today,'' \nThomas said. ``My wife is always supporting me. My daughters, my son \nand my grandchildren--I'm very, very fortunate.''\n  However, Thomas is still haunted by his memories daily, and he \ndoesn't want other soldiers to have to suffer the way he has had to. He \nbelieves, like I do, that our commitment to our veterans is a cost of \nwar, and we must make it a priority to help, protect, and serve those \nwho served. Too many of our Vietnam veterans never got the homecoming \nor the recognition they deserved. So today I am honored to have the \nopportunity to thank Thomas for his bravery both in battle and beyond. \nHe is a Montanan born and bred, and his life has been a testament to \nthe kind of commitment, courage, and compassion that our State can be \nproud of.\n  It was my honor to recognize Thomas Rockroads, Jr. by presenting him \nwith the Bronze Star Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam \nService Medal, Combat Infantryman Badge 1st Award, Republic of Vietnam \nCampaign Ribbon with 1960 Device, Sharpshooter Badge with auto rifle \nbar with rifle bar, Marksman Badge with machine gun bar, and the \nParachutist Badge Basic.\n  Our State and our Nation thank you, Thomas, for your service and for \na soldier's sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/senate-section/article/S7542-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7542-S7543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RECOGNIZING MENTOR: THE NATIONAL MENTORING PARTNERSHIP\n\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize MENTOR: \nThe National Mentoring Partnership, the leadership of its founders, \nGeoffrey T. Boisi and Raymond G. Chambers, and the expansion of the \nmentoring field in the past quarter century.\n  This year, MENTOR celebrates its 25th anniversary. Its founders, \nGeoffrey T. Boisi and Raymond G. Chambers, were leading businessmen and \nphilanthropists who understood the value of mentoring in their own \nlives. They believed passionately that the intervention of a caring \nadult is a critical element in the life of a young person, and they \nbelieved that every young person needs and deserves a powerful \nrelationship that supports their growth and gives them the opportunity \nfor success.\n  In 1990, Boisi and Chambers recognized the powerful impact that \nmentoring could have on our Nation's at-risk youth, and they started a \nmovement to increase opportunity for all young people by establishing \nMENTOR. The success of Boisi's and Chambers' efforts has been \nremarkable. That first year, approximately 300,000 youth at risk of \nfalling off track were paired with a caring adult through a structured \nmentoring program. Today, 4.5 million at-risk young people will find\n\n[[Page S7543]]\n\nthe support that they need in a mentoring relationship while growing \nup.\n  We know that research has found that young people with a mentor are \n55 percent more likely to attend college and more than twice as likely \nto say that they held a leadership position in a club or sports team \nthan young people without mentors. We also know that people who are \nmentored in their youth are 78 percent more likely to volunteer in \ntheir communities than those who are not mentored.\n  Unfortunately, despite the tremendous growth of the mentoring \nmovement in America over the past 25 years, 1 in 3 young people, \nincluding 9 million at-risk youth, will still reach adulthood without \nhaving a mentor of any kind. This mentoring gap isolates these young \npeople from the meaningful connections to adults that would help them \nto grow and succeed. Furthermore, young people are not the only ones \nwho gain from a mentoring relationship. While mentoring empowers our \nchildren and sets them on the path to success, it also deeply enriches \nthe lives of the adults who are partnered with them. As a mentor \nmyself, I can attest to this profound benefit.\n  MENTOR has been a leader in the development of best practices to \nassist mentoring organizations across the country in improving their \nprogram quality. MENTOR and its network of affiliate Mentoring \nPartnerships has set the bar for quality in practice and has \nstrengthened the mentoring field's capacity to deliver on the promise \nof mentoring.\n  It is clear that, in the last quarter century, MENTOR, under the \nleadership of its volunteer board and founders, has done tremendous \nwork championing the advancement of mentoring practice and fostering \nthe growth of the mentoring movement. Therefore, I ask that my \ncolleagues join me in recognizing the accomplishments of this \nremarkable organization in expanding the quality and availability of \nmentoring for all young people in the United States, in honoring the \nservice and leadership of MENTOR cofounders Geoffrey T. Boisi and \nRaymond G. Chambers and their dedication to America's youth, and in \nencouraging Americans to discover just how rewarding mentoring can be \nthrough volunteering with their local mentoring organization.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/senate-section/article/S7543-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n           TRIBUTE TO REVEREND DOCTOR M. WILLIAM HOWARD, JR.\n\n Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize \nRev. Dr. M. William Howard, Jr., pastor of Newark's Bethany Baptist \nChurch. Dr. Howard has spent many decades leading the charge for \nchange, fueled by his personal mission to utilize his faith to \ntransform the human condition.\n  From his Georgia roots to his work at Bethany Baptist, Dr. Howard has \nshown an extraordinary commitment to serving others. His work outside \nof the church has spanned the realms of human rights, international \naffairs, domestic policy, and education. In his role over the last 15 \nyears as pastor of Bethany Baptist Church, he has worked tirelessly to \nexpand outreach to the community as a whole.\n  Since his first position as a youth leader conducting some of the \nearliest voter outreach efforts in southwest Georgia, Dr. Howard has \nbeen a beacon of light across the globe, bridging the worlds of faith \nand political activism. He has consistently taken on leadership roles, \nserving as moderator of the Programme to Combat Racism of the World \nCouncil of Churches, president of the National Council of Churches, and \npresident of the American Committee on Africa. Through these posts, Dr. \nHoward has provided a powerful example of our Nation's commitment to \nhuman rights and equality. In ministering to U.S. personnel held \nhostage in Iran in 1979 and working for the release of U.S. Navy pilot \nRobert O. Goodman, Dr. Howard was a quiet but powerful force for faith \nand peace.\n  Dr. Howard's record of service and leadership domestically is equally \nimpressive. Serving as president of New York Theological Seminary, he \ndemonstrated the importance of interdisciplinary approaches to \ncommunity development by implementing joint programs in social work and \nurban education. He has been a board member for such organizations as \nthe National Urban League, the Children's Defense Fund, and the Rutgers \nUniversity Board of Governors. Under his leadership, the New Jersey \nDeath Penalty Study Commission was instrumental in New Jersey becoming \nthe first State to abolish the death penalty since 1976.\n  Finally, Dr. Howard's impact on the city of Newark has been \nremarkable. As pastor of Bethany, Dr. Howard quickly established \nBethany Cares, Inc., and through this outreach corporation, the church \nhas actively transcended its congregation walls to serve the community \nat large. Such transformative work has played an integral part in \nstrengthening the development of New Jersey's largest city.\n  After 15 years of devoted service as pastor of Bethany Baptist \nChurch, Dr. Howard will be retiring. It is an honor to formally \nrecognize Dr. Howard for his unwavering commitment to creating a better \nworld.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/senate-section/article/S7543-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           RECOGNIZING VFW POST 1674 ON ITS 75TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I wish to honor Veterans of \nForeign Wars Post 1674 in Siloam Springs, AR, on its 75th anniversary.\n  Chartered November 10, 1940, the post was named in honor of Levi \nDouthit, a WWI veteran.\n  As a member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I understand the \nimportance of acknowledging the bravery and valor of the men and women \nwho fought in defense of our country, as well as those who continue to \nserve. Men like Levi Douthit and members of VFW Post 1674 set their \npersonal lives aside to fight for our country. This post recognizes the \nservice, sacrifice, and courage of fellow veterans and continues to \noffer aid and assistance to those who served our Nation in uniform.\n  As participants in the Buddy Poppy Program, members support the \nveterans relief fund. They serve veterans in and around Siloam Springs \nwho need help with daily basic needs and transportation to VA health \ncenters for medical treatments.\n  Members continue their dedication to the community, offering \nscholarships to students, teaching flag etiquette, and, as partners \nwith Kind at Heart Ministries of Siloam Springs, helping build \nwheelchair ramps for veterans.\n  The importance of Post 1674 to the community was apparent when more \nthan a decade ago a lack of membership and financial troubles nearly \nforced its closure. Businessmen helped raise support in the community \nand kept its doors open.\n  I congratulate VFW Post 1674 on its 75th anniversary. I wish \nCommander Frank Lee and the 163 members who served in U.S. engagements \nsince WWII the best of luck and many more years of camaraderie, \nservice, and investment in the community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/senate-section/article/S7543-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7543-S7544]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     50-YEAR CLASS REUNION OF THE 1965 CLASS OF WESTERN HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, this week in my hometown of \nBaltimore, MD, the Western High School class of 1965 will gather to \ncelebrate their 50th class reunion. In honor of this special occasion, \nI wish to take a moment to pay tribute to the experiences of the WHS \nclass of 1965 and commemorate the lasting legacy of Western High \nSchool, which continues to produce leaders for the Baltimore community.\n  To this day, Western High School remains a source of pride for the \ncity of Baltimore. Founded as Western Female High School in 1844, it \nremains the oldest operating public all-girls high school in the Nation \nnearly 171 years after its doors opened on North Paca Street. Prior to \nthe opening of Western Female High School and its now defunct companion \nEastern Female High School, Baltimore City females were without an \nopportunity to advance their education beyond the basic grammar school \nlevel. Female students from across the city were drawn to the academic \nrigor of Western High School, creating a true magnet school, as we know \ntoday. As the city of Baltimore grew, so did Western High School. In \n1896, Western High School moved to a larger location on Lafayette and \nMcCulloh Streets, which allowed for\n\n[[Page S7544]]\n\nthe expansion of courses to include clerical courses. Today Western \nHigh School resides on a joint campus opened in 1967 with the all-male \nBaltimore Polytechnic Institute on Falls Road.\n  The WHS class of 1965 graduated from Western in a transitionary \nperiod for Western. Two years away from the opening of the current \ncampus, Western High School students attended classes in the heart of \ndowntown Baltimore. With an overpopulated school building that forced \nadministrators to move to a split shift schedule to accommodate all of \nWestern's students, alumnae often participated in work or volunteer \nopportunities located within walking distance of the school. This \nproximity to downtown also allowed Western students to participate in \nthe burgeoning civil rights movement in Baltimore City, including the \npicketing of businesses which refused to serve African Americans. While \nWestern High School students can fondly remember their efforts to fight \nfor social justice in the civil rights movement, the class of 1965 was \nalso struck by the tragic news of President John F. Kennedy's \nassassination. Even as WHS mourned this news, former Western High \nSchool alumna Sarah T. Hughes, then judge of the U.S. District Court \nfor the Northern District of Texas and just the third woman to ever \nserve as a Federal jurist, administered the oath of office to then-Vice \nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson aboard Air Force One.\n  The storied history of Western High School and school motto, ``Lucem \naccepimus, lucem demus''--``We have received light, let us give \nlight''--has continued to inspire generations of students and countless \nalumnae of WHS. Among its alumnae include Henrietta Szold, the founder \nof Hadassah; Trazana Beverley, a 1977 Tony Award Winner; former \nMaryland State superintendent of schools Dr. Nancy S. Grasmick; current \nBaltimore City mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake; and current Western High \nSchool principal Michelle White. As the WHS class of 1965 comes \ntogether this week to celebrate their class reunion and years of \nfriendship, I encourage each alumnae to remember the words they were \ntaught at Western High School many years ago and continue to strengthen \ntheir own communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/senate-section/article/S7544-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7544]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JAMIE TURNER\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that, on \nbehalf of the Delaware congressional delegation, I wish to honor the \nexemplary service of Jamie Turner, director of the Delaware Emergency \nManagement Agency, upon his retirement. Jamie has served as director \nfor 13 years and during that time has provided first responders and \nDelaware citizens with emergency preparedness training and education to \nkeep Delawareans safe when hazards such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and \nfires hit Delaware. His efforts will be a guide and inspiration for the \nhard-working employees at DEMA and the many first responders in \nDelaware for years to come.\n  Jamie has a lifetime of experience when it comes to responding to \nemergency situations. In 1970, he began his education in fire \nprotection technology at Delaware Technical Community College. He \nstudied the causes and proper responses to various hazards and \npreventive measures that can be taken to avoid them entirely. Jamie \ntook the knowledge he gained from his education and in 1976 began \nworking with the Delaware State Fire School as the emergency service \ntraining administrator. It was his responsibility to supervise \ninstructors, research technical information, and work with fire, \nrescue, and emergency medical services to develop necessary guidelines \nand effective procedures.\n  Then, in 2000, he took on the role of executive secretary of the \nDelaware Volunteer Firemen's Association, where he was tasked with \nfollowing legislation at every level of government that affected DVFA's \nmembership. In this role, he researched different laws and ordinances \nto ensure that the DVFA was following the proper guidelines. Thanks to \nJamie, Delaware's firefighters stayed informed on the regulations that \nwere put in place to keep themselves and those in emergency situations \nsafe.\n  Jamie has been a dedicated public servant for years. Before his \nappointment to director of DEMA, he was serving and protecting Delaware \nthrough his consistent endeavors to remain on the cutting edge of best \npractices in emergency protocol and then use that experience to educate \nothers in the field. He is active in the Smyrna Little League and \ncontinues to volunteer with the Delaware Fire Service.\n  On behalf of Senator Chris Coons and Congressman John Carney, I \nwholeheartedly thank Jamie Turner for his service to the State of \nDelaware. His model leadership and dedication has improved the quality \nof our State's emergency response systems and has kept countless \nresidents safe. We offer our sincere congratulations on a job well done \nand wish him and his wife Debbie, their daughters Kim and Katie, \nhusbands Mike and Sean respectively, and their grandchildren Madelyn, \nHarper, Keegan, and Kolton many happy years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/senate-section/article/S7544-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7544-S7545]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO VAUGHN THOMAS HAWKES\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I wish to honor Vaughn Thomas Hawkes \non his 80th birthday. Vaughn is a native Idahoan whose family roots in \nthe State go back generations. He is one of nine children born to a \nfarm family outside of Preston, where he learned hard work and \ningenuity are the keys to a good life. The work ethic he learned early \non has served him well through his 80 years, but he had a spirit of \nadventure that was unusual for an Idaho farm boy. After he finished \ncollege at Utah State University and married his sweetheart of close to \n56 years, Frances Arlene Anderson, they embarked on a journey that took \nthem to the tiny island territory of American Samoa, where he first \ntaught high school chemistry, math, and physics, and then served as \nprincipal at Mapusaga High School. But perhaps some may think his \ngreatest achievement during that time was that he was instrumental in \nintroducing American football to the Samoan people--something many \ncollege and NFL teams have appreciated for many years now. An educator \nby training and inclination, Vaughn spent many years in administrative \npositions at the Blackfoot School District before finishing his career \nin the Provo School District where he retired.\n  His devotion to his faith has been manifest in many ways, including \nmissionary service throughout the world--first as a young missionary in \nwestern Canada; then in American Samoa; then in Milan, Italy; and most \nrecently in Santa Monica, CA. His teaching nature has been evident far \nbeyond his professional career, as he has been given the opportunity to \neducate through that missionary service. Upon his retirement from \neducation several years ago, he had served in teaching positions at the \nLDS Missionary Training Center and the BYU-Idaho Pathways Program--ever \nsearching to help those who are seeking improvement in their \neducational pursuits.\n  His friends and neighbors know him as a tinkerer, a man who can fix \nanything. He maintains a world-class collection of tools and parts you \nnever knew you were missing. He is the proud father of eight children--\nSusan, Richard, Diane, Pamela, Cynthia, Daniel, John, and Scott. His \neldest daughter, Susan, has worked for me for many years, and I have \nhad the opportunity to get to know Vaughn on a personal level. While he \nmay count them as his greatest achievements, each one of them is \ngrateful for his influence and support in their lives. He taught them \nhow to work, how to fight for what is right and fair, to value \neducation and learning, to take the adventurous path, and to be \nfaithful to the Lord. He has built a life of service and devotion to \nhis family, friends, and faith and serves as a tremendous example of \nkindness and strength to all who know him.\n  As a young farm boy, Vaughn had an opportunity to receive the \nCongressional Record every day through the mail. He was fascinated by \nall that transpired in Congress and read the documents studiously. It \nwas only the beginning of a lifetime of curiosity about the world \naround him. So it seemed a fitting tribute to honor his 80th birthday \nto provide him with his own mention in that illustrious Record. We wish \nhim a very happy 80th birthday.\n\n[[Page S7545]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/senate-section/article/S7545-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7545]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO WAR CHIEF JOSEPH MEDICINE CROW\n\n Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I would like to wish happy birthday \nto the last Crow war chief, Joseph Medicine Crow, who is celebrating \nhis 102nd birthday today. He has served proudly as the Crow Tribe's \nhistorian and storyteller, is a decorated World War II veteran, and was \nthe first in his tribe to attain a master's degree.\n  Medicine Crow has lived a life filled with numerous accomplishments. \nHe is a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The White House \nidentified him as both ``a warrior and living legend'' when he received \nthe Medal of Freedom in 2009. In 2006, his personal memoir, ``Counting \nCoup,'' was published by National Geographic. He is considered one of \nthe most celebrated Native American soldiers due to his selfless \nservice in World War II.\n  With his great-grandmother, grandmother, mother, and uncle all living \npast 100 years of age, Medicine Crow credits his long life to his \nstrong family roots. Medicine Crow's secret advice to living such a \nlong and full life? He advises going to sleep early, sleeping 8 hours, \neating breakfast, keeping busy at work, and eating healthy and \ngenerously. He also touched on the positive influences of his wife, who \nurged him to maintain good habits. His positive, endearing spirit and \nsense of humor truly keeps him young.\n  Medicine Crow's spirit, humility, kind disposition, and many \nincredible life achievements are a model for all Montanans. Happy \nBirthday, Chief Medicine Crow. I look forward to celebrating many \nmore.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/senate-section/article/S7545-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7545]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO RUSTY STAFNE\n\n Mr. DAINES.

Stafne ended his term yesterday and will not be \nrunning for reelection as chairman. I am proud to honor and to \ncongratulate him on his service and successes.\n  As chairman, Stafne has worked diligently for the Assiniboine and \nSioux people on the Fort Peck Reservation and has held firm in his \npriorities. He has worked to honor veterans, specifically those who \nserved in World War II, and has worked tirelessly to protect wildlife \nin Montana and on the Fort Peck Reservation.\n  We thank Chairman Stafne for his involvement in the Senate Indian \nAffairs Committee. He has been a tireless advocate for rural water \nprojects and other challenges facing the tribes. He has traveled to \nWashington, DC, to testify in front of Congress and has broadened the \neyes of many--giving new and better insight into the life of tribal men \nand women, so that we can work together to better serve and protect our \ntribal nations.\n  I am thankful for Chairman Stafne's work on behalf of the tribe. His \nloyalty, priorities, and hard work set an amazing example to the rest \nof Montana and our great Nation as a whole.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/senate-section/article/S7545-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7545]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:27 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3033.

A bill to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to carry \nout a program to establish peer specialists in patient aligned care \nteams at medical centers of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, in 2013, the VA estimated that about \n1.5 million veterans required mental health services, which VA provides \nin a variety of settings. In addition to the traditional VA medical \ncenters, veterans may access mental health services and support through \nVet Centers--which often appeal to veterans because of their welcoming, \nhome-like environment; Community Based Outpatient Clinics, which play \nan important role in telehealth delivery by connecting rural veterans \nto psychiatry services from the medical center home-base, a Veterans \nCrisis Line, VA staff on college and university campuses, and other \noutreach efforts. Another important means of delivering mental health \nservices has been the inclusion of mental health professionals within \nprimary care delivery through VA's Patient Aligned Care Teams, which \nimproves the screening process and allows providers to recognize and \ntreat mental health issues occurring among those veterans who present \nin their primary care locations.\n  In addition to providing ongoing care to veterans with mental health \nneeds, VA plays a role in suicide risk assessment and prevention among \nveterans. According to VA, about one-quarter of the 18 to 22 veterans \nwho die by suicide each day were receiving care through VA. Suicide \nrates are even higher among those veterans who do not use VA for the \nhealth care services. Given the stigma and reluctance of some veterans \nto seek mental health treatment, veterans using VA for primary care may \nbe missing a key entry point to the peer support model of care. \nExpanding this effective model into the primary care setting could \nprovide another opportunity for veterans to access mental health \nservices through VA. That is why, today, I am introducing--with my \ncosponsors Senators Baldwin and Markey--the Veteran Partners' Efforts \nto Enhance Reintegration, Veteran PEER Act, a bill that would expand \nthe peer support model of care for mental health services within the VA \nsystem to help ensure that veterans receive the effective and timely \ncare they deserve.\n  VA has begun a program to co-locate mental health care providers \nwithin primary care settings in an effort to promote effective \ntreatment of common mental health conditions in the primary care \nenvironment. This is a positive step; however, the peer support model \nof care for mental health services has not been similarly integrated. \nResearch on the use of the peer support model of care for mental health \nservices within the VA has shown that Peer Specialists helped patients \nbecome more active in treatment, which can promote recovery. Peer \nsupport was recognized by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices as an evidence-based practice in 2007; and over 20 states have \nMedicaid reimbursement for peer support services. In response to the \nPresident's August 2014 Executive Orders to improve mental health \nservices for veterans, VA committed to integrating and expanding the \npeer support model of care beyond traditional mental health settings \ninto primary care clinics in order to better connect with veterans \nwherever they seek care. However, progress toward placing Peer \nSpecialists in primary care teams has been slow.\n  The Veteran PEER bill would require VA to expand its use of Peer \nSpecialists--VA employees who promote veterans' recovery by sharing \ntheir own recovery stories, providing encouragement, and teaching \nskills needed for successful recovery. These professionals may also \nprovide case management assistance, help with accessing the right \nmental health care, and teach coping and self-advocacy skills. In \ngeneral, peer support programs aim to develop veterans' self-management \nskills and restore participation in work and other social roles. \nRecognizing this effective model of care, this bill would require VA to \nestablish Peer Specialists in Patient Aligned Care Teams within VA \nmedical centers to promote the use and integration of mental health \nservices into the primary care setting. Over a two year period, the \nprogram would be carried out in 25 locations.\n\n[[Page S7548]]\n\n  The bill directs VA to take into consideration the needs of female \nveterans when establishing peer support programs, ensure that female \nPeer Specialists are made available to veterans through the program, \nand consider rural and underserved areas when selecting program \nlocations. VA would be required to regularly report to Congress on the \nprogress of the program including on its benefits to veterans and their \nfamily members and data on the gender of clients served by the program. \nGiven that VA is one of the largest employers of Peer Specialists, VA's \nregular reporting on the program would not only allow Congress to \nconduct appropriate oversite of the activities, but could also provide \nimportant insights for the wider peer support community.\n  Given the pressing need for mental health services, it is imperative \nthat we equip VA with the resources and organizational structure it \nneeds to care for veterans who access these services and to find ways \nto reach more veterans with effective mental health services when they \nneed them. Expanding the peer support model into the primary care \nsetting could provide another opportunity for veterans to access mental \nhealth services through VA. As a nation we have asked more of these \nindividuals than most of us can comprehend. We must now honor the \npromise we made as a nation--to take care of those who have taken care \nof us.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nletters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2210\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Richard Blumenthal,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Blumenthal: On behalf of the Depression and \n     Bipolar Support Alliance (DBSA), it is with great pleasure \n     that I endorse the Veteran Partners' Efforts to Enhance Re-\n     integration (PEER) Act. This bill addresses a critically \n     important gap within the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs \n     (VA) that inhibits access to behavioral health services. We \n     look forward to working with you to improve veterans' access \n     to care.\n       Since 2013, the VA has effectively used peer support \n     specialists to enhance behavioral health care delivered to \n     veterans in behavioral health settings. Yet, a majority of \n     veterans in need of behavioral health care will enter the VA \n     system through a primary care center. To help create the \n     necessary connection from primary care to behavioral health \n     services, the PEER Act will utilize behavioral health peer \n     support specialists to assist veterans in various primary \n     care settings.\n       Specifically, the bill will require the VA to establish a \n     pilot program to assess the feasibility and advisability of \n     establishing peer support specialists in Patient Aligned Care \n     Teams within VA medical centers to promote the use and \n     integration of mental health services into the primary care \n     setting. DBSA strongly supports the requirement that VA \n     medical centers give special consideration to the needs of \n     female veterans when designing the pilot programs and ensure \n     that female peer support specialists are available in each of \n     the pilot locations. We also welcome the collection and \n     reporting of data that will provided to Congress every six \n     months from the pilot. The VA utilizes the largest number of \n     peer support specialists in the nation. As such, this data \n     will help improve the role of the peer support specialists \n     within the VA and throughout America's entire health care \n     system.\n       As the leading peer-led organization supporting individuals \n     with mood disorders and their families, DBSA understands the \n     importance of peer support for individuals with a behavioral \n     health condition. We feel strongly that expanded use of peer \n     specialists within the VA will increase veteran engagement in \n     their care, and lead to better outcomes and sustained \n     wellness. We applaud you for leading this new effort and \n     stand ready to support the VA as it implements this pilot \n     program.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Allen Doederlein,\n\n                                                        President,\n     Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              National Alliance on\n\n\n                                               Mental Illness,\n\n                                  Arlington, VA, October 26, 2015.\n     Hon. Richard Blumenthal,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Blumenthal: On behalf of the National Alliance \n     on Mental Illness (NAMI), I am writing to offer our strong \n     support for your proposed legislation, the Veteran Partners' \n     Efforts to Enhance Re-Integration (PEER) Act. As the nation's \n     largest organization representing people living with serious \n     mental illness and their families, NAMI is pleased to support \n     this important legislation.\n       As you know, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \n     currently uses Peer Specialists to assist veterans living \n     with mental illness. These Peer Specialists do a tremendous \n     job in helping veterans' access mental health services and \n     navigate the complicated VA health care system. Every day \n     they promote recovery through development of self-management \n     skills and assistance in moving toward employment and \n     community integration.\n       Your PEER bill would direct the VA to establish a pilot \n     program to assess the feasibility of ``going to scale'' in \n     the VA with a peer support program built on Patient Aligned \n     Care Teams within VA medical centers across the nation. This \n     would be a major step forward in promoting integration of \n     mental health services into primary care settings. Your bill \n     would also direct the VA to specifically take into \n     consideration the needs of female veterans when designing \n     pilot programs and to ensure that female peer support \n     specialists are available in each of the pilot locations.\n       NAMI strongly supports this effort to expand access to peer \n     specialists in the VA. Thank you for bringing this important \n     legislation forward. NAMI looks forward to working with you \n     to ensure its swift passage.\n           Sincerely,\n     Mary Giliberti.\n                                  ____\n\n                                     Military Officers Association\n\n\n                                                    of America\n\n                                 Alexandria, VA, October 26, 2015.\n     Hon. Richard Blumenthal,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Veterans Affairs, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Blumenthal: On behalf of the more than 390,000 \n     members of the Military Officers Association of America\n\n[[Page S7549]]\n\n     (MOAA), I'm writing to thank you for sponsoring the ``Veteran \n     Partners Efforts to Enhance Reintegration (PEER) Act,'' a \n     bill that would establish a two-year pilot program that \n     requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to establish peer \n     specialists in patient aligned care teams at 25 medical \n     center locations.\n       MOAA has long supported peer support programs as a means to \n     enhance delivery of health care services. By extending VA's \n     existing mental health peer support model into the primary \n     care setting helps to further reduce barriers in accessing \n     mental health services while also supporting the Department's \n     current efforts at integrating mental-physical health care \n     concurrently to increase system capacity.\n       All veterans deserve access to mental health care when they \n     need it and wherever they may live. As such, we are \n     particularly grateful for special consideration in this \n     legislation for female veterans and those living in rural or \n     underserved areas.\n       I greatly appreciate your leadership and look forward to \n     the passage of this timely legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Norbert Ryan, Jr.,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           American Public Health Association,\n\n                                                 October 23, 2015.\n     Hon. Richard Blumenthal,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ranking Member Blumenthal: On behalf of the American \n     Public Health Association, a diverse community of public \n     health professionals who champion the health of all people \n     and communities, I write in support of the Veteran Partners' \n     Efforts to Enhance Reintegration Act, which would require the \n     inclusion of peer support specialists in Patient Aligned Care \n     Teams within medical centers at the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs.\n       Rates of mental illness are disproportionately high among \n     U.S. veterans, particularly posttraumatic stress disorder, \n     substance abuse disorders, depression, anxiety and military \n     sexual trauma. Nearly 50 percent of combat veterans from Iraq \n     report that they have suffered from PTSD, and close to 40 \n     percent of these same veterans report problem alcohol use. In \n     2010, about 22 veterans died each day as a result of suicide. \n     Military culture promotes inner strength, self-reliance and \n     the ability to shake off injury, which may contribute to \n     stigma surrounding mental health issues. Stigma may create a \n     reluctance to seek help and a fear of negative social \n     consequences, and is the most often cited reason for why \n     people to do not seek counseling or other mental health \n     services.\n       Through a peer support model of care, Peer Specialists--\n     veterans who have recovered or are recovering from a mental \n     health condition--provide veterans with assistance in \n     accessing mental health services, navigating the health care \n     system and skills needed for a successful recovery. Expanding \n     the peer support model to the primary care setting may offer \n     a key entry point for those reluctant to access mental health \n     services. The bill would also direct the VA to take into \n     consideration the needs of female veterans and locations that \n     are underserved.\n       Thank you for your commitment to the health and wellbeing \n     of U.S. veterans and to improving access to mental health \n     services within the VA.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Georges C. Benjamin, MD,\n     Executive Director.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/27/senate-section/article/S7549-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2749.
