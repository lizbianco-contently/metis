Mr. President, in his State of the Union Address, \nPresident Obama promised to deliver a budget filled with ``ideas that \nare practical, not partisan.'' I know many Americans were glad to hear \nhim say that. The American people elected a right-of-center Congress \nfocused on jobs and reform, so it makes sense that a President would \nwant to send commonsense ideas that could pass the Congress that the \npeople actually elected last November.\n  He could have proposed a budget that was balanced. He could have \nchallenged us with serious, innovative reforms aimed at getting \nspending under control or effective ideas to create jobs and \nopportunity. There are so many positive things he could have done \ninstead of phoning in another tired tax-and-spend manifesto. We \nbasically see the same thing every year. It focuses on growing the \nbureaucracy instead of opportunity. It does not balance ever. Because \nit isn't designed to pass Congress, of course it doesn't pass Congress.\n  The budget is just one symptom of a wider disconnect. Rhetorically, \nat least, we hear the White House echo Republican calls for policies \naimed at helping the middle class, but then we see the White House push \nmore of the same stale, top-down policies favored by political bosses \nover on the left. As Americans who have lost health plans or who are \nseeing health costs skyrocket could tell you, the left's priorities \noften hurt the very people they purport to help.\n  This is the wrong approach. We need fresh ideas. Republicans want the \nPresident to join us in fighting for the middle class, so we think he \nshould take opportunities such as the budget\n\n[[Page S678]]\n\nto actually rally Members of both parties behind serious ideas that can \nactually pass. We think the country could really benefit from his \npositive leadership.\n  His next test will come soon as the new Congress works to develop the \nkind of budget the American people deserve. We are going to focus on \ngrowing the economy from the ground up, with more future-oriented \nreform, more jobs, more opportunity. We are going to pursue ideas that \nmake government leaner, more efficient, and more effective. We are \ngoing to honor the hard-working men and women who count on us to spend \ntheir dollars wisely, not offload Washington's problems onto them with \nhigher taxes. That is what the American people expect. It is the kind \nof practical agenda you pursue if you are serious about helping the \nmiddle class. It is what I hope the President will now encourage \nMembers of both parties to work toward.\n  The truth is, there is a lot we can achieve with constructive, \nbipartisan cooperation. The bill we will vote on tomorrow is a great \nexample of that. Members in both parties agree it is time to pursue \npositive reform for veterans who are hurting. The Clay Hunt Suicide \nPrevention for American Veterans Act aims to reduce the tragedy that \nbefalls too many of our heroes and the heartbreak that befalls too many \nof their families. We lose thousands of veterans every year to suicide. \nNow is the time for practical, bipartisan action to do something about \nit.\n  The legislation we will vote on tomorrow will provide more of the \nsuicide prevention and mental health support our veterans deserve. It \nwill help veterans transition from Active-Duty service. It will take \nsteps to improve the effectiveness of programs to help heroes in need.\n  This bill has already passed the House unanimously. I hope we can \nachieve a similar result in the Senate and send this bipartisan \nlegislation to the White House for signature.\n  Before I finish, I would like to thank both the senior Senator from \nGeorgia, Mr. Isakson, and the senior Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, \nfor their tireless work on this bill. These Senators care deeply about \nthe men and women who give everything--literally everything--to protect \nus. Veterans are lucky to have such strong champions on their side.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/02/senate-section/article/S678-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as Senators, our work is measured by what we \nare able to accomplish for the middle class, what we are able to \naccomplish for the American people. I have watched very closely and \nbeen in touch, as we all know, having read all the stories, of what has \ngone on here in the last month. I am sorry to say that we spent 1 month \non a bill calling for the importation of oil from a foreign country and \nthen exporting that oil outside of America. I am glad we were able to \nwork it out so that we had a number of amendments. That was really \ngood. We felt very comfortable with that. I wish we could have done \nsome more, but I am satisfied with what we were able to do. Of course \nnow we await the action of the President, as we should be doing.\n  The work of this Senate is based upon--should be based upon--what we \nare able to do for the middle class. We are a constructive minority, \nand we proved that the last month. To show how constructive we are, \ntake for example TRIA, terrorism insurance. It is so important up and \ndown the Las Vegas Strip, Times Square, everyplace in America. That is \nimportant to the business community. Yet that was held up in the last \nCongress by my Republican colleagues. To show our good faith, we were \nable to pass that in a matter of hours. That is the way it should be.\n  We are going to vote tomorrow on the Clay Hunt bill. That is an \nimportant piece of legislation. I have worked hard on suicide \nprevention. We need to keep working on it. Each year in America 32,000 \nAmericans kill themselves. That does not take into consideration the \ncar accidents that are not reported properly, hunting accidents. We \nhave about 24 veterans who kill themselves every day in America. We \nbelieve that is important for America, and because of that, we are \ngoing to pass that in a matter of hours tomorrow. That is the way it \nshould be.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/02/senate-section/article/S678-4", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there is an issue that is now before this \nbody. It is an important issue. All we need to look at is what is going \non around the world--terrorism attack in Australia; terrorism attack in \nCanada; in France, scores of people killed. We saw what happened in \nBelgium. Terrorism is for real. Senator McCaskill said it about the \nbest way I have seen it described. The Republicans are more afraid of \nthe DREAMers than they are of ISIS. By the way, ISIS said they are \ncoming our way. Why should we be dealing with issues that have nothing \nto do with homeland security?\n  We should pass a homeland security bill with no strings attached to \nit. That is where we are going to wind up. If the Republican majority \nin the House and the Senate wants to have a CR for Homeland Security--a \ncontinuing resolution--that would cut about $1 billion out of the \nbudget for Homeland Security.\n  Homeland Security was developed after 9/11. It was a bipartisan piece \nof legislation that consolidated 22 different government agencies. We \nneed to get that done and sent to the President in a clean fashion. If \nmy Republican colleagues have some problem with something the President \nhas done on immigration, for example, hit it head-on. Do not hide \nbehind Homeland Security. We need a safe homeland. I hope my Republican \ncolleagues will join us to get that done as quickly as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/02/senate-section/article/S678-5", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, first I wish to welcome back my colleague \nand friend, the minority leader of the Senate, Senator Harry Reid. I \nwas told he was coming back. I found a way to avoid a blizzard in \nChicago to be here with him because I wanted to be here for this \nmoment.\n  It is a great moment for those of us on the Democratic side of the \naisle to have him back. I know it means a lot to him. We have been on \nthe phone. I know he has gone through a lot in terms of his injury and \nalso his impatience at home when for a period of time he could not read \na book, which he loves to do, watch television, or do much of anything. \nI know he was anxious to get back in the saddle and back here, and we \nare so glad he has returned.\n  His message at the outset shows he may be scarred and beaten up, but \nthere is no diminution of the fighting spirit that Harry Reid has \nbrought to the Senate floor on so many occasions with his opening \nremarks, reminding us we are going to embark this week on a question \nabout the funding of the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/02/senate-section/article/S678-7", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S678-S680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, of all things, the Department of Homeland\n\n[[Page S679]]\n\nSecurity, created to protect America from terrorism, is a Department \nthat is underfunded by Republican design. The Republicans refuse to \ngive the regular budget appropriation to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to protest President Obama's Executive order on immigration. \nThe House of Representatives went so far as to add five riders--\nconditions--to the budget for the Department of Homeland Security and \nsend them here. They have said they will not fund this Department \nunless we join them in what has become an extremely negative and, I \nbelieve, hate-filled attack on people across America.\n  Saturday we had a rally in Chicago, and at that rally was Secretary \nJeh Johnson of the Department of Homeland Security. Joining us were \nCongressman Luis Gutierrez of Chicago, the mayor of Chicago, and \nliterally hundreds of people, many of them DREAMers--young people who \nare now, because of President Obama's Executive order, allowed to go to \nschool and work in America.\n  Remember, these were children--toddlers, infants--brought to America \nby their families, who are undocumented through no fault of their own. \nThey have lived in America, they have been educated in America, they \nhave pledged allegiance to our flag in their classrooms, and they have \nno future because we have not changed the immigration law to give them \na chance. But President Obama has given them a chance. DACA is a \nprogram where, when these young people sign up for it, they can be \nprotected to live in America without fear of deportation--to work here, \nto go to school here, and to start to realize their dreams. They even \nwant to volunteer for our military. Many of them do. They are trying \ntheir best to be part of America's future, and the President gave them \nthat chance.\n  The House of Representatives--the Republican majority--said: We will \nnot fund the Department of Homeland Security to protect America against \nterrorism unless the Senate will vote to literally deport the DREAMers.\n  At a time, as Senator Reid said, when we are threatened with ISIS, \nwhen we are sickened by the images on television of innocent people--\nincluding Americans--being beheaded, at that same time the Republicans \non Capitol Hill are telling us: We are not going to properly fund the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to protect America unless we can \nprotest what President Obama has done for 600,000 young people \nprotected by DACA.\n  Senator Reid quoted Senator McCaskill, who spoke up at one of our \nmeetings the other day, who said: Apparently the Republicans fear the \nDREAMers more than they fear the terrorists, more than they fear ISIS.\n  That is wrong. I do not know who cooked up this political strategy. \nThey were not thinking clearly. If they were thinking clearly, we would \nfund that Department with a clean appropriation--one that is now \nsitting on the calendar of the Senate that was offered by Senators \nJeanne Shaheen and Barbara Mikulski. It is sitting here. By unanimous \nconsent, with the approval of the majority leader, we could pass it \ntoday, fund this agency.\n  I asked Secretary Johnson: Well, what difference does it make if you \nget a temporary funding bill or a regular budget bill?\n  He said: I can't properly run this Department. I am wasting time and \nmoney. I am not investing in things that make us safer because of the \nway Congress--in this case, the House Republicans--insists that they \nwill not properly fund this agency.\n  It funded every other agency of government except for the Department \nof Homeland Security. What are they thinking? Why would they want to \nmake an object lesson out of this critical Department?\n  I said to Secretary Johnson: So what types of things can't you do?\n  He gave one example. He said: We give grants for research to find \nways to make America safer when we are attacked. We can't give those \ngrants now because we are under a continuing resolution.\n  Research to make America safe has stopped. Is that a wise thing for \nthe new Republican majority in the House and Senate to do? Clearly, \nthat is their plan. But we are going to give them an alternative and \nvery quickly. Tomorrow we are going to consider a procedural motion \nabout whether we go to this House bill, which has the five riders on \nimmigration. I believe the Democrats will say: No, we want a clean \nbill, and we want to move to that bill quickly.\n  And we need to do it not just because we need to keep America safe--\nisn't that our first obligation?--but secondly because I do not believe \nour caucus--and I hope not a majority of the other caucus--has the same \nhate-filled feelings toward DREAMers that we have seen in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Mr. President, 600,000 of them have stepped forward. I have come to \nthe floor day after day to tell their stories. They are the most \namazing stories of young people who, with no help from the government, \nfinished college and pursued professional degrees, without a penny of \nassistance from our government, whose only dream is to be part of the \nfuture of America. They are our future. They will help our economy. \nThey will reduce our deficit. They will once again reestablish and \nreaffirm the American dream that people can risk everything to come to \nthis country to make sure their children have a better life. These \nDREAMers deserve that chance. America deserves the chance to be \nproperly secure in this age of terrorism. This Republican strategy is \nnot going to achieve that.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. My friend is modest, my friend the senior Senator from \nIllinois. But tell those within the sound of our voices how long you \nhave worked on the DREAM Act--you.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Nevada, our minority leader. \nFourteen years ago I introduced the DREAM Act, and I got into a spat \nwith a Republican Senator, Mr. Hatch, who said: That is my idea.\n  I said: Fine. Then it will be the Hatch-Durbin DREAM Act.\n  And we introduced it 14 years ago, and it has not been enacted into \nlaw. Senator Hatch now has some misgivings over this issue, but I have \nstuck with it for 14 years. And the majority leader joined me in \nsending a letter to President Obama asking that he create this \nExecutive order of protection.\n  I would like to say a word about Executive orders. Republicans come \nto the floor and suggest that when a President of the United States \nissues an Executive order, it is an unconstitutional exercise of power. \nYou hear it over and over again.\n  If you step out of this Chamber and take just a few steps toward the \nstaircase, you will see this magnificent, historic painting of Abraham \nLincoln signing the Emancipation Proclamation. It is historic because, \nwith the signature of President Lincoln, 3 million American slaves were \nfreed--an Executive order. And it was an order which had the force of \nlaw. It was signed by President Lincoln--an Executive order.\n  It was not the only one. You think back in history to the historic \nExecutive orders, and you have to think of Harry Truman. After World \nWar II Harry Truman stepped up and said: We are going to integrate the \nArmed Forces of the United States of America, and I will not wait for \nCongress. Give me the pen and paper to sign the Executive order to \nachieve it.\n  So if President Lincoln can liberate 3 million American slaves, if \nPresident Truman can sign an Executive order integrating the Armed \nForces, how can the Republicans come to the floor, one after the other, \nand say the use of an Executive order by the President is \nunconstitutional and want to hold President Obama accountable for their \nmisguided thinking? It does not make sense.\n  I might just say--and I thought perhaps the Senator from Nevada was \ngoing to say it as well--if none of the Republicans like what President \nObama has done on immigration, can I remind them they are now in \nmajority control of the House and the Senate? If they think it is \nbetter to have a law enacted--despite the fact that for 2 years the \nHouse of Representatives refused to even call the bipartisan \ncomprehensive immigration reform--if they think it is proper and right \nfor a law to be enacted on immigration, the\n\n[[Page S680]]\n\nAmerican people have given them the majorities in both Houses to do it.\n  So instead of cursing the darkness and failing to fund the Department \nof Homeland Security, why don't they roll up their sleeves and go to \nwork as Members of the House and Senate and pass immigration reform? I \nthink that is worthy of this great body and the one across the rotunda. \nBut to underfund the Department of Homeland Security that protects us \nfrom terrorism? What are they thinking?\n  I thank the Senator from Nevada for returning. It feels great to have \nyou back in your capacity here as our leader on the Democratic side and \nas my friend.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner).

Mr. President, I want to give you a stark fact and \nfigure. Every year 8,000 American veterans take their own lives and \ncommit suicide. That is more people, more veterans than were killed in \nall the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  We have a major epidemic in America's Armed Forces because of soft \ntissue issues of PTSD and TBI. This Congress, both Committees on \nVeterans' Affairs--in the House and Senate--have acted, and tomorrow \nthis Senate will vote on the Clay Hunt suicide prevention bill. I want \nto talk about it for a few minutes because it is critically important.\n  When these men and women go overseas and volunteer to serve America \nand lay their lives on the line for us, many come back with terrible \ninjuries, prosthesis, an inability to walk, some in wheelchairs. But \nthe stealth disease, the one that hurts the most, the one that \npermeates the most, is PTSD and TBI. We have been doing as much as we \ncould but not enough within veterans health care.\n  Secretary McDonald has committed himself to improving the services of \nmental health to our veterans. I have committed myself. Senator \nBlumenthal has committed himself. Senator Boozman from Arkansas, \nSenator McCain from Arizona, who will speak later--all are committed to \nsee to it that we have a better program for our veterans.\n  What the Clay Hunt suicide prevention bill does is create incentives \nfor more psychiatric professionals to come into the VA health care \nsystem because psychiatry is the best physician expertise you need to \ndeal with PTSD and TBI. But it also has external audits of the VA to \nmake sure they are doing what needs to take place in terms of veterans \nhealth care and in terms of mental health for our veterans.\n  The tragedies are daily, the tragedies are compounding, and we must \nfind an end to it. A lot of people think these tragedies are with \nveterans of the gulf war, our Operation Iraqi Freedom, or our battle in \nAfghanistan. But, quite frankly, a lot of them are our Vietnam \nveterans. We looked the other way and did not recognize PTSD and TBI \nfor a long time, but now we have recognized it front and center, and it \nis the major injury from the battles in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other \nconflicts in the history of the United States of America. We owe it to \nour veterans to have the best mental health available to them.\n  In my hometown of Atlanta, on August 21, 2013, I called a field \nhearing at Georgia State University and brought in all the VA experts \non suicide prevention because, quite frankly, we had had three suicides \nin the Atlanta VA within a very short period of time that got high-\nprofile headlines in our newspaper.\n  As it turned out, we found that we really did not have the followup, \nthe follow-through, and the continuum of care that mental health needs \nand deserves, and we had some veterans who had fallen through the \ncracks--not just in Atlanta but around the United States of America. In \nfact, as recently as last week there was a tragic death in Atlanta. We \ndo not know yet the root cause of it, but we know the individual may \nhave had mental health problems and was a veteran of the war in \nAfghanistan and took their life and the life of their children. We do \nnot know whether PTSD or TBI was the contributing cause or whether we \nhad done anything wrong in terms of veterans health care. But we know \nthis: Four more lives were taken from the stealth disease called tragic \nbrain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder.\n  So I am very pleased as the chairman of the Veterans Affairs' \nCommittee to tell you that the House unanimously passed this bill 3 \nweeks ago on the floor of the House, the Senate Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee unanimously passed it 2 weeks ago in committee, and the bill \nwe will vote on tomorrow can go directly from the floor of the Senate \nto the desk of the President of the United States and be signed.\n  Very quickly, I want to make two points for anybody who is listening \nthat remembers last year. This bill failed last year. It failed for two \nreasons:\n  One, Members questioned whether we could afford it because it had a \nprice tag of $24 million. We have fixed the price problem by taking \ninternally generated funds of the VA to pay the $24 million. That is \ndone.\n  Secondly, some said: Well, this is a duplicative service. We already \nhave mental health services and suicide prevention at the VA.\n  We have some, and we do not have enough. It is not duplicative. It is \nabsolutely necessary and essential that we do what we are doing.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to come to the floor of the Senate on \nbehalf of all of our veterans and tell them: Washington is watching. We \nare listening. We feel your pain. We understand the problems you have. \nAnd we are going to do everything we can to see to it that the Clay \nHunt suicide prevention bill becomes the law of the land, that the VA \nis held accountable for its policies and procedure in mental health, \nand that we put an end and stem the tide of the tragic number of \nveteran suicides that take place every single day.\n  I would like to now yield to my ranking member on the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, the Senator from Connecticut, who has done an \noverwhelmingly great job to see this through from beginning to end, Mr. \nBlumenthal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I begin by thanking the chairman of \nthe Veterans' Affairs Committee, Senator Isakson, and really giving him \nimmeasurable credit for his courage and his fortitude in addressing \nthis bill that he could have allowed to languish on the agenda of the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee. In fact, he made it the very first agenda \nitem--the very first issue--that we would confront on the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee at our very first meeting, and it passed unanimously \nthrough the Veterans' Affairs Committee because of his leadership--and \nI really mean his leadership in making it happen.\n  So on behalf of the veterans of America, he deserves due credit, and \nso do my colleagues on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, Senator Boozman \nand Senator Sanders, who championed this bill, along with Senator Burr.\n  During the last session I was pleased to argue for it on the floor in \nthe closing days of the session, and unfortunately it failed to pass.\n  There is no reason to look back and try to blame others for that \nfailure. What is important is to look forward and to give credit to \nboth sides of the aisle--most especially to my colleague, Senator \nMcCain, who, of course, dwarfs us in his service to our Nation in the \nArmed Forces. He literally is a giant in his service and sacrifice for \nour Nation while serving in the Navy. I have felt very privileged and \nproud to work with him and to introduce this measure, the Clay Hunt \nSuicide Prevention for American Veterans Act or the Clay Hunt SAV Act, \nas it is called, that basically provides for suicide prevention\n\n[[Page S681]]\n\nservices and, even more importantly, pioneers and champions mental \nhealth care for our VA.\n  I thank all of our colleagues who have worked on this bill over the \npast year or so because this measure gives us a tremendous opportunity \nto set a direction for the VA and for the Senate. If I may be so bold \nand perhaps presumptuous, I say this measure is truly bipartisan. It \nprovides a template for bipartisan action to help our veterans, our \nmilitary men and women who serve now, and to set a real lodestar for \naction by this body.\n  Very fittingly, we are on the floor when the Democratic leader, \nSenator Reid has returned. I am tremendously heartened by his presence \nhere and by the President's budget today, which provides a proposed \nincrease in health care spending and, most especially, mental health \ncare spending, to $7.4 billion from last year's expenditure of $6.7 \nbillion. It is significant, again, in the context of a bipartisan \napproach to this issue.\n  This legislation is named for Clay Hunt, a marine, a patriot, a \nveteran who served bravely in Iraq. His mom, Susan Selke, is a real \nhero. She came before the Veterans' Affairs Committee during the last \nsession.\n  Her testimony was not only as a patriot and an advocate of veterans \nbut as a family member. There have been too many family members forced \nto grieve the loss of their loved ones who have succumbed to suicide, \nas did Clay Hunt in March of 2011, after struggling valiantly and \ncourageously with post-traumatic stress and the inadequate care of his \nlocal VA hospital.\n  Far too many of Clay Hunt's fellow veterans, 22 per day, have \nsuccumbed to suicide, including a friend of mine, Justin Eldridge of \nsoutheastern Connecticut.\n  Justin braved mortar fire and sniper attacks in Afghanistan to return \nto southeastern Connecticut and to his family, his children, and his \nwife Joanna. Suffering from post-traumatic brain injury and post-\ntraumatic stress, tragically, like so many others, Justin slipped \nthrough the cracks of his local VA facility and eventually succumbed in \nhis fight against those inner demons and invisible wounds when he took \nhis own life. As brave as Justin Eldridge was on the battlefield, he \ncould not win that war at home.\n  How Justin and Clay fell into that black hole of depression and \ndespair I certainly will never understand, but we grieve for them and \nwe hope that their example of courage will inspire us to face this \nissue.\n  All too often, the response to suicide--whether it is among veterans \nor others--is denial. It is to turn away, to look in the other \ndirection because sometimes it is too painful or there is stigma or \nshame in mental health needs.\n  We can conquer that stigma and shame. To its credit the military is \ndoing more every day. The VA has raised awareness and is increasing its \ncommitment.\n  This bill is a tremendous opportunity for the VA to be a pioneer and \nchampion in mental health care, just as it has been in other areas of \nhealth care, such as amputee rehabilitation, prosthetics, and traumatic \nbrain injury.\n  This bill is a downpayment. It is the beginning--not the end--of our \ncommitment and our solutions to problems. It is a worthwhile measure to \ntake limited, targeted steps--less than we must eventually do--to keep \nfaith with our veterans and their mental health needs.\n  I hope the committee and this Congress will continue in this great, \nbipartisan spirit.\n  I look forward to a continuing partnership with my friend Senator \nIsakson, who is such a leader in this area, as we work on these issues \nand seek to make progress as quickly as possible. As we do so--remember \nall of our efforts from all of the years of conflict and war in this \ncountry--Senator Isakson is absolutely right that post-traumatic stress \nand mental health needs are hardly limited to the veterans of Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  I have worked hard to help veterans of the Vietnam and Korea eras. In \nfact, I successfully championed the needs of our veterans of earlier \neras when they have been burdened by less-than-honorable discharge \nresulting from post-traumatic stress, from an era when post-traumatic \nstress was nonexistent as a diagnosis.\n  Post-traumatic stress was unknown for our Vietnam and Korea veterans. \nIt was not unknown as a condition. It was not nonexistent. It was \nsimply unknown has a diagnosis. It was not called post-traumatic \nstress. It may have been called shell shock or battle fatigue. But the \nhorror, the nightmares, the cold sweats, the headaches, and the \ncrippling mental issues have plagued many of our veterans over many \neras and many wars.\n  Today we take a step to recognize this Nation's obligation to Justin \nEldridge, to Clay Hunt, to all of our veterans and to Joanna Eldridge, \nSusan Selke, and to the countless family members who have struggled and \nborne that burden side by side when their heroes have awakened at night \nwith the nightmares and the battles they continue to fight against \npost-traumatic stress, the invisible wounds, and the inner demons that \nhave come back with them from their service.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, on March 21, 2010, Deborah Johnson of \nSherwood, AR, answered a call no parent should ever receive. Her son, \n23-year-old Army Private Jeremy Andrew Johnson, was dead from a drug \noverdose.\n  Private Johnson was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder \nafter his deployment to Afghanistan. Deborah said she thought he was \ngetting the proper care he needed during the transition out of the \nmilitary, but when she received a goodbye text from him, she knew he \nneeded more help.\n  The family made his commanders aware of his suicidal thoughts and \nPrivate Johnson was put on suicide watch. Three days later Deborah \nanswered that horrible call.\n  Deborah shared her family's story with me in hopes that other \nfamilies can be spared the anguish of losing a loved one to mental \nillness.\n  Deborah understands Congress has an opportunity to deliver help to \nveterans living with mental illness and prevent suicides by passing the \nClay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act. This \nlegislation would improve mental health care and suicide prevention \nresources for veterans by increasing access to mental health programs, \nproviding incentives to recruit and retain psychiatrists to treat \nveterans and enhancing resources for members of the military \ntransitioning to civilian life.\n  The VA estimates 22 veterans commit suicide every day. This trend is \ntragic and it is unacceptable. We need to provide the VA with the \npersonnel, services, and proper tools to help veterans facing mental \nillness struggles. These invisible injuries are why we struggle to \nidentify at-risk individuals.\n  As a member of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, my \ncolleagues and I are working to fully understand the scope of mental \nillness in our veteran community. In the meantime, we are paving the \nway for improvements.\n  Two weeks ago the Veterans' Affairs Committee met for its first order \nof business in the 114th Congress--approving the Clay Hunt SAV Act. I \nam proud to say the committee approved this bill with a bipartisan vote \nof 15 to 0. Our veterans deserve this care.\n  The VA needs to evaluate its mental health programs using metrics \ncommon to mental health practitioners to determine the success of its \nprograms. This legislation will do that. It will help the VA more \nefficiently use the taxpayer funding it receives to support the \nprograms most effective for our veterans.\n  The House approved this bill in January and I am confident the Senate \nwill follow its lead. Deborah Johnson says she wishes Congress would \nhave taken up legislation to improve mental health services years ago. \nAs the President of the Arkansas chapter of Gold Star Mothers, Deborah \nhears similarities from other families who have suffered a loss because \nof suicide. She admits that a one-size-fits-all approach\n\n[[Page S682]]\n\nwill not adequately address mental health struggles, but she is hopeful \nthe Clay Hunt SAV Act will help prevent other families from suffering \nthe pain hers lives with.\n  We owe it to Deborah and others like her who have lost loved ones to \nthis battle, as well as servicemembers and veterans coping with mental \nhealth issues, to make this one of the first bills the 114th Congress \nsends to President Obama to sign.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I come to the floor in strong support of \nthe Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act.\n  Our men and women in uniform serve our country with honor and \ncourage. They put themselves in harm's way day in and day out to \nprotect us. I have a special appreciation for how much servicemembers \nand their families contribute to our country, and how important it is \nthat we honor their service. All three of my brothers served in the \nmilitary, and my oldest brother was career military. He flew 288 combat \nmissions in Vietnam.\n  When you grow up in a family with someone in the military, you know \nhow lucky you are to see them come home safely. But that doesn't mean \nthe sacred trust with our servicemembers ends the moment they step off \na plane. We owe our servicemembers the very best, and that means \nensuring they always have access to high-quality services and care, \nincluding mental health care.\n  The Clay Hunt SAV Act, introduced in the Senate by Senators John \nMcCain and Richard Blumenthal, would strengthen critical mental health \ncare services and suicide prevention resources for our country's \nveterans. We have heard the deeply troubling statistics. The VA has \nreported that 22 veterans die each day from suicide. Data collected in \nthe BackHome project shows that while 10 percent of Americans served in \nthe military, veterans make up 20 percent of all suicides in the United \nStates. These statistics tell us something is deeply wrong and that we \nneed to make significant changes.\n  The SAV act calls for an evaluation of the mental health services and \nsuicide prevention efforts of the Department of Veterans Affairs and \nDepartment of Defense, and launches a pilot program to provide \neducation loan repayment for psychiatrists who work at the VA. It also \nhelps build stronger partnerships between the VA and nonprofit \norganizations working with veterans in our communities.\n  The SAV act is named for Clay Hunt, a marine veteran from Texas who \nserved in Iraq and Afghanistan and was a strong advocate for improved \nservices for his fellow veterans. He struggled with post-traumatic \nstress, and when he was unable to access the care he needed from the \nVA, he took his own life.\n  As Clay's mother Susan Selke said in her testimony at the Senate \nVeterans' Affairs Committee hearing last summer:\n\n       Not one more veteran should have to go through what Clay \n     went through with the VA after returning home from the war. \n     Not one more parent should have to testify before a \n     congressional committee to compel the VA to fulfill its \n     responsibilities to those who served and sacrificed.\n\n  She went on to say:\n\n       The reforms, evaluations, and programs directed by this \n     legislation will be critical to helping the VA better serve \n     and treat veterans suffering from mental injuries from war. \n     Had the VA been doing these things all along, it very well \n     may have saved Clay's life.\n\n  I am proud Massachusetts has taken steps at the State level to help \nimprove suicide prevention resources for veterans, such as establishing \nthe Statewide Advocacy for Veterans' Empowerment Program, or SAVE.\n  The SAVE team is comprised of veterans who work directly in the \ncommunity to connect veterans and their families to services provided \nby the Commonwealth and by nonprofits. I have also visited several \noutstanding community organizations in Massachusetts, such as Veterans \nInc. in Worcester, Soldier On in Pittsfield, and the New England Center \nfor Homeless Veterans in Boston, that work tirelessly to help \nservicemembers access the full range of services they need and deserve, \nfrom housing and education to health care.\n  In August, I met with veterans in Framingham, MA, at a mobile vet \ncenter. One of the veterans I heard from was Army MAJ Justin Fitch, who \nwas working at the Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering \nCenter. Justin, who is battling terminal cancer and has had his own \nstruggles with depression, is retiring from the Army just this week, \nbut he is still a powerful and relentless voice fighting to improve \ncare and prevent suicide among veterans fighting depression and \npsychological stress after returning home from war.\n  Justin told me:\n\n       Too many veterans are suffering in silence. Twenty-two a \n     day is a lot. One is too many.\n\n  Justin is right. Our armed service men and women are tough, smart, \nand courageous. They make huge sacrifices to keep our families safe, \nand we owe them all a true debt of gratitude for their service. But \ngratitude isn't enough. We must do more to protect our men and women in \nuniform who devote their lives to the service of our country.\n  It is clear that Congress has more work to do to bolster our Nation's \ncommitment to supporting veterans and providing the mental health care \nservices they deserve. The Clay Hunt SAV Act is an important part of \nthis effort. I hope my colleagues will join me in voting to pass this \nlegislation in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/02/senate-section/article/S682-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S682-S686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here now for the 88th time to \nurge this body to wake up to the looming threat of climate change.\n  In the last few weeks, my Republican colleagues have talked about \nclimate change here on the floor more than at any other time since I \nbegan giving these weekly speeches. We had heard next to nothing from \nRepublicans about climate change since the 2010 Citizens United \ndecision. That decision let loose the fossil fuel industry to cast an \never darker shadow of intimidation across this town. So this minor \noutbreak of dialogue, although minor, has been significant.\n  All but one of my Republican colleagues is now on the record saying \nthey agree that climate change is real, and 15 voted that it is caused \nat least in some part by humans. That is some progress. Yet some still \npersist in their denial. Our scientists now tell us that warming of the \nclimate system is ``unequivocal.'' Yet we equivocate. Scientists are a \ncareful bunch. When they say something is unequivocal, we ought to take \nnote.\n  The senior Senator from Oklahoma, our chairman of the Environmental \nand Public Works Committee, however, maintains that human-caused \nclimate change is a hoax. He thinks it is arrogant to say that humans \ncould cause the climate to change. What is really arrogant is thinking \nwe can ignore the laws of nature, the laws of physics, the laws of \nchemistry, the laws of biology. Whose laws do we think those are? Those \nlaws were given to us by our Creator. They came with this world. They \nare immutable.\n  These laws of nature dictate that carbon dioxide is the byproduct of \nour burning of fossil fuels. These laws of nature, fresh from the hands \nof our Creator, explain why carbon traps heat in our atmosphere--\nsomething we have known since Abraham Lincoln was riding around this \ntown in his top hat.\n  Here in the Senate, we have no human power to amend or repeal those \nlaws--and here in the Senate, we shouldn't cherry-pick from the \nscientific record. That is not fair play. Here on the floor, the EPW \nchairman paraphrased a 2013 paper from the journal Nature, saying:\n\n\n[[Page S683]]\n\n\n       . . . there is considerable uncertainty as to whether \n     [increases in extreme climate variability] is occurring.\n\n  The author of the paper, Dr. Chris Huntingford of the UK's National \nEnvironmental Research Council, took exception to his paper being \nmischaracterized. He said this:\n\n       Our Nature paper strictly analyzes only year-to-year \n     variability (fluctuations) in temperature. . . . We do not at \n     any point offer evidence against a general on-going \n     background and upwards warming trend. Detection and \n     attribution statistical studies show that the observed \n     average increasing temperatures are almost certainly a \n     consequence of the burning of fossil fuels.\n\n  In that same floor speech, my colleague from Oklahoma suggested we \ncould relax about climate change because the Munich Reinsurance Company \nsaid weather-related disaster losses have declined as a proportion of \nGDP worldwide. He neglected to mention testimony before our EPW \nCommittee last July by Munich Re's head of risk accumulation in the \nUnited States, Carl Hedde, to wit:\n\n       Due to our history of insuring natural catastrophe, Munich \n     Re was one of the first companies in the industry to \n     recognize the impact that weather-related events and a \n     changing climate could have on its business model and \n     customers. As a nation, we need to take steps to reduce the \n     societal impact of weather events as we see greater \n     variability and volatility in our climate.\n\n  The senior Senator from Oklahoma has even resurrected the ghost of \nClimategate, that faux scandal whipped up a few years ago by the \npolluters and their allies to suggest climate scientists were colluding \nto exaggerate global warming data. Turned out it was the cooked-up, \nphony scandal that was exaggerated and not the data. So-called \nClimateGate should actually be accurately called ClimateGate-Gate. Yet \nyears later this zombie falsehood still staggers about the floor of the \nSenate attempting to cast doubt on human-caused climate change. The \npolluters have relentlessly made it their business to misconstrue the \nfindings of scientific works and to cling to discredited accusations.\n\n  We would do well to listen to the overwhelming majority of \npracticing, publishing climate scientists who agree our carbon \npollution is altering the climate. Scientists who conduct experiments, \nwho examine data, who arrive at conclusions, who submit their work \nthrough peer review, and who make their data accessible for due \ndiligence by other researchers. It is the best science out there.\n  But I am afraid those scientists don't have the ear of the senior \nSenator from Oklahoma. He showed us whom he listens to. He brought a \nchart to the floor showing several dozen ``recognized'' scientists--as \nhe called them--who don't buy the climate consensus. That chart was \nproduced by an outfit called the Heartland Institute. You may remember \nthem for associating climate scientists with the Unabomber--a classy \ngroup.\n  Their scientists, so-called, included bloggers, columnists, staff of \nconservative think tanks, a member of the European Parliament, and many \nscientists who have been funded by the fossil fuel industry.\n  I will side with the scientists affiliated with the American \nAssociation for the Advancement of Science over a bunch of carefully \nselected bloggers. I will trust NASA and NOAA over scientists who shill \nfor the fossil fuel industry. The Heartland Institute is not alone. It \nis part of a sophisticated network of climate denial propped up by the \ncarbon-polluting fossil fuel industry. It is a front group fueled by \nthe special interests and their dubious experts.\n  Interestingly, if we go to Oklahoma State University, we will find \none of the experts on this. Dr. Riley Dunlap at Oklahoma State could \ntell his Senator all about it. Professor Dunlap is one of the \npreeminent researchers into the deliberate and coordinated effort by \ncorporate interests to spread denial propaganda and distort public \nopinion on climate change--what he calls the ``organized climate-denial \nmachine.'' Dunlap and a colleague found that nearly 90 percent of \nclimate denial books coming out of publishing houses between 1982 and \n2010--guess what--had ties to conservative fossil fuel-funded think \ntanks such as the Heartland Institute. The whole thing is a rigged game \nand a phony, and there is a very good professor at Oklahoma State \nUniversity who keeps track of it.\n  I also have a fact sheet from the Oklahoma Climatological Survey, its \nstatement on climate change and its implications for Oklahoma. Here is \nwhat it says in plain language: The Earth's climate has warmed during \nthe last 100 years. The Earth's climate will continue to warm for the \nforeseeable future, and much of the global temperature increases over \nthe last 50 years can be attributed to human activities, particularly \nincreasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. That is actually a \nnoncontroversial statement among regular scientists.\n  This is no radical with some political agenda. This is a fact sheet \nfrom a State scientific agency. It happens to be Oklahoma's. Here is \nwhat the agency expects this means for Oklahoma: earlier maturation of \nwinter wheat and orchard crops, leaving them more vulnerable to late \nfreeze events; drought frequency increases, especially during the \nsummer; drier and warmer conditions increasing the risk of wildfires; \nrain-free periods lengthening with individual rainfall events becoming \nmore intense, with more runoff and flash flooding occurring.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this statement printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Oklahoma Climatological Survey]\n\n     Statement on Climate Change and Its Implications for Oklahoma\n\n       ``Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now \n     evident from observations of increases in global average air \n     and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, \n     and rising global average sea level.''\n       --the Fourth Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on \n     Climate Change (IPCC).\n       That statement reflects the essence of a vast amount of \n     observational data and climate research: the earth's climate \n     has warmed on average during the last 100 years and will \n     continue to warm through the 21st century. Further, ample \n     evidence from observational data and climate modeling studies \n     indicates that this global-scale warming is not attributable \n     to natural variability. The Oklahoma Climatological Survey \n     (OCS) has been mandated by the Oklahoma legislature to \n     provide climate information and expertise which could be of \n     value to the public, as well as to state policy- and \n     decision-makers. In accordance with that directive, OCS has \n     conducted a review of the current assessments of climate \n     change research and concludes the following to be true:\n       Across the globe, a warming climate will be beneficial to \n     some and detrimental to others. Anticipating how this \n     climatic shift will impact Oklahoma is of vital importance to \n     state decision-makers. One of the greatest impacts will be \n     the exposure of Oklahoma's growing population and economy to \n     water stress. Oklahoma's future requires access to fresh \n     water. Thus, due diligence in protecting our water resources \n     and adapting to future climate variability is paramount if we \n     are to maintain and improve the quality of life and the \n     economy of Oklahoma.\n\n\n                  The Science of Global Climate Change\n\n       The earth's climate is always changing. Evidence such as \n     tree ring and ice core studies indicates large and sometimes \n     abrupt climate changes have occurred in the earth's distant \n     past, lasting centuries to millennia. These climate swings \n     are attributed to natural variations, such as changes in the \n     output of the sun or shifts in the earth's orbit. Oklahoma \n     has exhibited distinct climate periods attributable to \n     natural variability in the last 100 years, from the decadal-\n     scale droughts of the 1920s, 1930s and 1950s to an extended \n     period of abundant precipitation during the 1980s and 1990s. \n     Mounting evidence continues to indicate, however, that human \n     activities have begun to impact the earth's climate through \n     the release of greenhouse gases. Ice core studies show carbon \n     dioxide and methane are at their greatest levels within the \n     last 650,000 years. Due to the extended periods required for \n     these gases to be removed from the atmosphere, further \n     emissions during the 21st century will cause additional \n     warming for more than a millennium. In fact, even if \n     greenhouse gas concentrations were held steady since the year \n     2000, the earth is committed to decades of warming from heat \n     already absorbed by the oceans.\n\n\n               Global Climate Change Impacts for Oklahoma\n\n       The continued warming of the climate averaged across the \n     globe will create a cascade of climatic shifts which could \n     impact Oklahoma's climate. These shifts will not mean an end \n     of year-to-year natural variability--hot years and cold years \n     will continue, as will wet years and dry years. The projected \n     changes will be seen at time scales averaged over a decade or \n     more. Little is known of the effects climate change will have \n     on severe weather. The ingredients required for severe \n     weather involve complex\n\n[[Page S684]]\n\n     combinations that do not exhibit clear changes in a warming \n     climate. Further, global climate models are unable to \n     accurately simulate small scale weather events like \n     thunderstorms or tornadoes.\n\n\n                            Recommendations\n\n       OCS recommends that Oklahoma aggressively pursue four \n     initiatives to address the risks of both climate variability \n     and climate change. First, the state should undertake a \n     comprehensive assessment of Oklahoma's social and economic \n     vulnerability to climate variability as well as climate \n     change. Learning to adapt to nature's extremes now will yield \n     benefits in reduced disaster losses, regardless of the future \n     trajectory of climate change. Climate change may also bring \n     economic opportunities that would be identified in such an \n     assessment. Second, OCS recommends immediate funding of the \n     Oklahoma Water Resources Board's Comprehensive Water Plan \n     study to identify existing as well as projected needs for \n     water. Third, OCS encourages efficiency programs to reduce \n     our growing demand for energy. Fourth, OCS recommends \n     investment in renewable energy technology and production. \n     Oklahoma has already demonstrated the successes of wind \n     energy; similar efforts should be undertaken to advance \n     development of solar and sustainable bio-energy as well as \n     fostering further research and development of wind energy.\n       Even if climate does not evolve as expected, these steps \n     will yield long-term benefits to Oklahoma's society and \n     economy through reduced losses to existing climate and \n     weather threats and cost-savings through reduced energy use. \n     If climate does evolve as expected, Oklahoma will be better \n     positioned to adapt to those changes without rapid social \n     upheaval. Furthermore, building resilience to climate and \n     weather events will help position Oklahoma at a relative \n     advantage to neighboring states, especially in attracting \n     businesses that are dependent upon a continuous water supply.\n       This statement is the first in a series issued by OCS which \n     delineates the impacts, both beneficial and detrimental, of a \n     warming climate system on the economy of Oklahoma and the \n     quality of life for Oklahomans. Further statements will \n     illuminate possible impacts to specific industries, such as \n     water management and agriculture.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. The National Climate Assessment estimates that by the \nend of the century the temperatures in the Southern Great Plains will \nincrease up to 9 degrees. Mark Shafer is a researcher at the Oklahoma \nClimatological Survey who contributed to the National Climate \nAssessment. He told the Oklahoman newspaper that in a few decades \nOklahoma could see 100-plus temperatures every summer. By century's \nend, daily temperatures could top 100 degrees for the entire summer. As \nthe climate warms, droughts will probably get worse, both more severe \nand more frequent.\n  Nine Oklahoma professors from Oral Roberts University, Southern \nNazarene University, and the University of Tulsa were among 200 \nevangelical scientists and academics to sign a 2013 letter to Congress \nimploring us to address climate change.\n  All of God's Creation . . . is groaning under the weight of our \nuncontrolled use of fossil fuels. . . . The threat to future \ngenerations and global prosperity means we can no longer afford \ncomplacency and endless debate. We as a society risk being counted \namong ``those who destroy the earth.''\n  Those who know the Bible will know that reference to ``those who \ndestroy the earth'' comes from Revelations. I will quote from \nRevelations: ``And Thy wrath is come, and the time . . . that thou . . \n. shouldst destroy them which destroy the earth.''\n  The letter warns that the way we live harms our neighbors, \nthreatening to create more empty wells, devastated cropland, loss of \nvillages, environmental refugees, and disease.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that letter from the 200 evangelical \nscientists printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    July 10, 2013.\n       Dear Speaker Boehner, Senate Majority Leader Reid, and \n     Members of the United States Congress: As evangelical \n     scientists and academics, we understand climate change is \n     real and action is urgently needed. All of God's Creation--\n     humans and our environment--is groaning under the weight of \n     our uncontrolled use of fossil fuels, bringing on a warming \n     planet, melting ice, and rising seas. The negative \n     consequences and burdens of a changing climate will fall \n     disproportionately on those whom Jesus called ``the least of \n     these'': the poor, vulnerable, and oppressed. Our nation has \n     entrusted you with political power; we plead with you to lead \n     on this issue and enact policies this year that will protect \n     our climate and help us all to be better stewards of \n     Creation.\n       Average global temperatures are at their highest level \n     within the measurement record, and we are beginning to see \n     indications of increasingly disturbed weather. For example, \n     2012 was the hottest year ever recorded for the contiguous \n     United States, and it will go down as one of the most \n     destructive and disruptive years in U.S. history: wildfires, \n     drought, superstorms, and public health outbreaks. This past \n     year is only one example of the patterns of change we expect \n     to see as the climate warms globally. We're already spending \n     billions in emergency aid for the victims of hurricanes and \n     weather disasters, and these expenses will only increase as \n     the ``once in a lifetime'' storms become the new normal.\n       The Bible tells us that ``love does no harm to its \n     neighbor'' (Romans 13:10), yet the way we live now harms our \n     neighbors, both locally and globally. For the world's poorest \n     people, climate change means dried-up wells in Africa, floods \n     in Asia that wash away crops and homes, wildfires in the U.S. \n     and Russia, loss of villages and food species in the Arctic, \n     environmental refugees, and disease. Our changing climate \n     threatens the health, security, and well-being of millions of \n     people who are made in God's image. The threat to future \n     generations and global prosperity means we can no longer \n     afford complacency and endless debate. We as a society risk \n     being counted among ``those who destroy the earth'' \n     (Revelation 11:18).\n       We call on you to pass meaningful legislation during this \n     Congress to reduce carbon emissions and protect our \n     environment, thereby strengthening the long-term outlook for \n     our economy and our children. As Christian scientists and \n     educators, we offer our knowledge, experience, and prayerful \n     witness to assist you and all of our nation's leaders who are \n     willing to address this urgent challenge.\n           Sincerely,\n       Dr. Tom Ackerman, University of Washington, Seattle, \n     Washington; Dr. Carolyn Anderson, Calvin College, Grand \n     Rapids, Michigan; Dr. Stanley Anderson, University of \n     California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, California; Dr. \n     Brian Aukema, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, \n     Minnesota; Prof. Michael Bailey Anderson, University, \n     Anderson, Indiana; Dr. Jonathan Bakker, University of \n     Washington, Seattle, Washington; Dr. Marvin Bauer, University \n     of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota; Dr. Philip Bays, Saint \n     Mary's College, Notre Dame, Indiana; Dr. Caroline Bentley, \n     Southern Nazarene University, Bethany, Oklahoma; Dr. Abram \n     Bicksler, International Sustainable Development Studies \n     Institute, Chiang Mai, Thailand; Prof. Russell Bjork, Gordon \n     College, Wenham, Massachusetts; Dr. Curtis Blankespoor, \n     Calvin College, Grand Rapids, Michigan; Dr. Harvey \n     Blankespoor, Hope College, Holland, Michigan; Dr. Mark Bloom, \n     Dallas Baptist University, Dallas, Texas; Dr. Robert Boomsma, \n     Trinity Christian College, Palos Heights, Illinois.\n       Dr. Dorothy Boone, Gordon College, Wenham, Massachusetts; \n     Prof. Michael Bosscher, Trinity Christian College, Palos \n     Heights, Illinois; Dr. Sheri Boyce, Messiah College, \n     Grantham, Pennsylvania; Prof. Lynn Braband, Cornell \n     University, Ithaca, New York; Dr. James Bradley, Calvin \n     College, Grand Rapids, Michigan; Dr. Robert Bringolf, \n     University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia; Dr. Joshua Brokaw, \n     Abilene Christian University, Abilene, Texas; Dr. Jeff Brown, \n     Hope College, Holland, Michigan; Dr. Douglas Bulthuis, \n     Washington State University, Pullman, Washington; Dr. Russell \n     Camp, Gordon College, Wenham, Massachusetts; Dr. David \n     Campbell, Gardner-Webb University, Boiling Springs, North \n     Carolina; Dr. Clayton Carlson, Trinity Christian College, \n     Palos Heights, Illinois; Dr. Chris Carmichael, Bob Jones \n     University, Greenville, South Carolina; Dr. Walter Cho, Point \n     Loma Nazarene University, San Diego, California; Dr. Hyun \n     Joong Cho, University of California, San Francisco San \n     Francisco, California.\n       Dr. James Clark, Wheaton College, Wheaton, Illinois; Dr. \n     Stephen Cole, MidAmerica Nazarene University, Olathe, Kansas; \n     Dr. Bruce Congdon, Seattle Pacific University, Seattle, \n     Washington; Dr. John Cossel, Jr., Northwest Nazarene \n     University, Nampa, Idaho; Dr. Lisa Crow, Southern Nazarene \n     University, Bethany, Oklahoma; Dr. Thomas F.

Finally, Mr. President, at the University of Oklahoma \nBerrien Moore III is dean of the College of Atmosphere and Geographic \nSciences. He is also Director of the National Weather Center. Dean \nMoore of the University of Oklahoma was a lead author on an \nintergovernmental panel on climate change report, which the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma is so fond of disparaging. Dr. Moore's work helped the \nIPCC earn the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007. He has won research accolades \nfrom NOAA and from NASA. In 2009 Dr. Moore testified before the House \nCommittee on Science, Space, and Technology. Here is what he had to say \nabout climate change:\n\n       On the increasing strength of Earth science, we now can \n     state that global warming is ``unequivocal,''--\n\n  There is that word again--\n\n     but this simply sets the challenge. We need now--\n\n  This is 5 years ago, by the way--\n\n     to develop the capability to monitor and thereby manage \n     greenhouse gas emissions through this century and beyond. . . \n     . The challenge is growing and will not go away.\n\n  The effects of climate change are all too real in Oklahoma, in Rhode \nIsland,\n\n[[Page S686]]\n\nand across the Nation. If you don't believe me, go to Oklahoma State \nand the University of Oklahoma and talk to the scientists I just \nmentioned. The outlook for us if we fail to act is increasingly dark.\n  But look again at Oklahoma. The Sooner State is the fourth largest \nproducer of wind power in the country. Wind turbines there make \nprogress toward energy independence and they give Oklahoma farmers \nsteady income as a hedge against droughts and extreme weather. So \npeople farm and they get paid for having a wind turbine located on your \nfarm. It is a win-win.

Mr. President, 1 year and 1 week ago, on a cold, snowy \nmorning in Cleveland, OH, not much different from what I woke up to \nthis morning in Cleveland, OH, I attended the Dr. Martin Luther King \nMemorial Breakfast in that city, which is also my hometown. A minister \nat that breakfast said something that we all know but probably have not \nthought about and rarely put in such succinct, meaningful words. He \nsaid: Your life expectancy is connected to your ZIP Code. Think about \nthat. Whether you grew up on the east side of Cleveland or Gary, IN, or \nwhether you grew up in Appalachia, OH, or southern Indiana, or whether \nyou grew up in a city, suburb, small town, affluent, less affluent, low \nincome, rural, or urban, your ZIP Code often determines whether you \nhave access to quality health care, to a good, solid education, and the \nsocial support that is necessary to succeed. It is up to this body to \nhelp ensure--not to do it and not to do it alone--that every ZIP Code \nis one that provides opportunity, not inequality.\n  Ten years ago, the ZIP Code where my wife and I live in the city of \nCleveland had the highest foreclosure rate of any ZIP Code in America. \nThink about what that means for a 12 year-old-child of a family where \nthe father gets laid off from work and the mother has her hours cut \nback. Even though they were doing everything right, they can't pay \ntheir mortgage. They sit down with their 12-year-old daughter and say: \nHoney, we are going to have to move, but we don't know where we are \ngoing yet. We don't know what school district you are going to be in, \nand we don't know if you will be close enough to be able to stay with \nyour friends.\n  Those kinds of decisions happen far too often. Those kinds of \nscenarios happen far too often. But we know that in many ways we have \nmade progress. Fifty years ago the poverty rate was 26 percent, and \ntoday it is around 15 percent thanks in large part to what people in \nthis institution have done with social insurance programs, such as the \nAffordable Care Act, Medicaid, and today's Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, so-called CHIP.\n  There was no greater champion in the Senate for children's health \ncare than my predecessor, the Senator from West Virginia who actually \nsat at this desk on the Senate floor, retired Senator Jay Rockefeller. \nHe helped to write CHIP in 1997. I was a member of the House Health \nSubcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee at that time. I \nbelieve the Presiding Officer sat on that committee when he was in the \nHouse many years ago. We worked on writing CHIP in 1997 when it was a \njoint State-Federal health insurance program for low- to moderate-\nincome children and pregnant women.\n  Keep in mind that in most cases the children who are in today's \nChildren's Health Insurance Program have at least one working parent in \ntheir family. CHIP provides health insurance to low-income families who \nfall into a coverage gap: They make too much to qualify for Medicaid, \nbut they don't make enough to qualify for private insurance. Many \nemployers don't offer the insurance. They don't make enough money and \nare not able to afford to buy the insurance due to the high copays and \nthe high premiums they would typically face. Today's CHIP, the current \nCHIP program, bridges that gap.\n  I am honored to continue the fight to protect this program and ensure \nthat Congress acts to extend funding for the current program before it \nexpires at the end of September.\n  You may have noticed that I said today's CHIP, the current program. \nWhen CHIP started in 1997, it was a good program. It was started in the \nSenate by Senator Rockefeller, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Hatch. It \nwas very bipartisan, and it passed overwhelmingly. Those of us who \nworked on it in the House--Congressman Billirakis and I, as leaders on \nthe Health Subcommittee, and others--made sure that it was bipartisan \nand that it worked very well. But understand that over the 20 years of \nCHIP, each time it has been reauthorized, we made it better. We \nextended the benefits because we have seen where the coverage gaps are. \nWe made it more efficient, we made it work better, we have kept the \nbipartisan nature to it, and that is why I referred to it as today's \nCHIP, as the current program.\n  Providing health insurance to low-income children is not just the \nright thing to do, it is the smart thing to do. It is the right thing \nto do because these are families where the parents are working hard and \ntaking responsibility but simply can't afford health insurance for \ntheir child. Today I was in Cleveland with a couple of people--Shonte \nSaunders and her daughter Amari. Ms. Saunders is a young woman with two \nchildren. Amari is 9 years old. Ms. Saunders told me she is working, \nraising her children, and she is in school studying to become a nurse \nat Cuyahoga County Community College. She is doing the right thing, but \nshe said: If CHIP expires, I don't want to be in the position where I \nhave to choose between taking my daughter to a doctor for an ear \ninfection versus having to provide enough food to put food on the \ntable, or a more serious illness or injury than that.\n  Why should she be subjected to that?\n  Listen to these numbers. Thanks to CHIP, the number of uninsured \nchildren has fallen by half. It went from 14 percent almost 20 years \nago when Senator Hatch, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Rockefeller wrote \nthis program in the Senate and Congressman Billirakis and I and others \nin the House wrote it to a record low of 7 percent. Because of today's \nCHIP, 10 million children--130,000 children in my State of Ohio alone--\nhave access to health care they may not have received otherwise.\n  Over the past week I met with parents across Ohio. I met with \nJennifer Huit in Cincinnati and listened to her story. In Dayton, I \nlistened to a family talk about what CHIP means to them.\n  Think about this: It provides a sigh of relief for parents like \nShonte and Jennifer, and not only for financial reasons. CHIP means \nbetter access for preventive and comprehensive care. Too often, if you \nare right on the edge and making $12 or $13 or less an hour and don't \nhave Medicaid, think about the choices you know you have to make. You \ncan't take your child to the doctor if they are only kind of sick. If \nyou had insurance, you would take her in. But she is kind of sick, and \nit may get worse, but you will only take her in if it gets worse \nbecause you really can't afford those out-of-pocket expenses. Think of \nthe tension and the difficult life that people generally have anyway at \nthat income level. Think of how much more difficult that is. CHIP--\nwhich in Ohio is administered\n\n[[Page S687]]\n\nthrough Medicaid--means that a child in Cleveland or Cincinnati or \nGallipolis or Troy or Pickaway, OH, can see a family doctor when they \nneed it, thereby preventing a costly ambulance ride and emergency room \nvisit.\n  CHIP means a bunch of things. It means vaccines, shots, dental \ncoverage, and better treatment if kids get sick. Think about this: It \nis not just the health care. It means they do better in school. It \nmeans they miss fewer days in school so they don't fall behind their \nclassmates who perhaps have better health insurance. It means they \nperform better in school because they feel better. We know the stories \nof how a hungry or sick child can't focus on what they need to do in \nthe classroom. CHIP means that children from Bowling Green will get the \nhealth care they need to become healthy, active adults.\n  We know that the current CHIP--today's 2015 version of CHIP--works \nnot just because of the number of insured children under the program \nbut because of the flexibility it provides States and the quality of \ncare children receive.\n  Ohio's conservative Republican Governor supports CHIP. It is called \nHealthy Start in Ohio because the Governor and legislature have been \ngiven flexibility under CHIP to make it work for that State.\n  The flexibility that CHIP provides States is the result of 20 years \nof watching, observing, quantifying, and analyzing CHIP. We have had 18 \nyears of experience in seeing what works best, and we have worked \ntogether to make improvements. As a result, under the current CHIP \nprogram, more children are covered and the coverage they get is better.\n  If we don't act, understand that CHIP--the authorization, the \nlanguage, the law governing CHIP is in effect until 2019, but the \nfunding for CHIP runs out in September of this year. You have to have \nboth. You have to have the law governing CHIP--how it works, who is \neligible, how the States have flexibility--but obviously you also need \nthe money to implement it.\n  If Congress doesn't act now, first of all, Ohio, my State, would lose \n$146 million in Federal funds in 2016 alone, and the Presiding \nOfficer's State of Indiana would lose tens of millions of dollars in \nCHIP funding.\n  We know another thing: Whether it is Governor Pence in Indiana or \nGovernor Kasich in my State, they need the flexibility of knowing what \nCongress is actually going to do. We should not wait until July or \nAugust; we should reallocate money for CHIP today. If we don't act, \nparents like Shonte and Jennifer may not be able to get the quality, \naffordable care for their children as States would start to roll back \nCHIP programs.\n  That is why I will soon introduce legislation to protect the program \nand extend its funding so it runs out at the same time as the \nauthorization--the roadmap, if you will, of how CHIP will work. If we \nlet the program run out of funding, the number of uninsured children \nwill increase, the quality of health care will decrease, and States \nwill see a significant increase in cost-sharing services.\n\n  Providing health insurance to low-income children isn't just the \nright thing to do, it is the smart thing to do. If the program works, \nit works for children, it works for parents, it works for communities, \nand it works for our great country.\n  I call on my colleagues to work with me to extend funding for the \ncurrent CHIP program before it is too late.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/02/senate-section/article/S687-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S687-S690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING\n\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise today because I wish to speak about \nthe importance of this DHS funding bill that is going to be before the \nbody in the coming days. In particular, I wish to emphasize what I \nthink is the important imperative that we pass what we are calling a \nclean bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security for the \nremainder of fiscal year 2015 through the end of September. That clean \nbill would be a bill that would fund homeland security without \nattaching additional items to it concerning immigration.\n  The support of this legislation was an initiative we were together \non. We negotiated in December as part of a budget process by leaders of \nboth parties in both Chambers, and the funding for DHS would have been \nan increase to help protect our borders and help protect our security \nby about $1.2 billion above the enacted level for fiscal year 2014. But \nat the end of the year the decision was made by the House to not fund \nthat piece and leave it separately and that is why we are now talking \nabout whether we will fund the Nation's homeland security efforts and \nunder what circumstances.\n  All 45 Members on the Democratic side, save only Senator Reid, have \nwritten a letter saying let's make sure we fund DHS at the level we \nhave already agreed to between the Houses. Then, let's not play \npolitics over immigration issues; let's take up immigration separately. \nBut the House bill that has been sent to us includes measures to begin \nto block or unwind actions taken by the President on immigration, and \nthose complicate what all should agree is a national imperative, which \nis the need to fund homeland security. If we don't pass such a bill, \nthat funding will expire on February 28.\n  I don't need to explain too much why homeland security funding is \nimportant, but let me make a few points. This Department was created \nafter the attacks of 9/11, and its stated mission--while it employs an \nawful lot of people and does many complicated things, the mission is \nquite simple--let's keep our country safe, secure, and resilient \nagainst terrorism and other hazards. We see every day the kinds of \nterrorism hazards we are dealing with. The horrible shooting in Paris a \nfew weeks ago and the shooting in Quebec a few months ago remind us of \nthe dangers of terrorism, and now that we are in a war against ISIL--a \njihadist terrorist enemy that has promised to carry out attacks on the \nUnited States--we should be very concerned about the mission the DHS \nperforms and the need to provide funding.\n  The men and women who work for the DHS are quite a wide swath of our \nFederal employees. They are the TSA personnel who protect our \ntransportation system, the Border Patrol agents who serve on our \nNation's front lines, Customs officials who oversee the entrance of \nnearly 1 million visitors per day who come to the United States, and we \nneed Customs agents to help process those visitors. Our DHS folks \ninclude disaster specialists--people who respond to hurricanes and \nother emergencies. Our Coast Guard, our Secret Service, and many of our \ncyber security professionals all work for the DHS and they work hard \nevery day to carry out that mission of keeping our Nation safe.\n  Funding DHS is not just critical to the Nation's security, it is also \ncritical to the economy because DHS is the third largest agency in the \nFederal Government by the number of employees. The impact of any \nshutdown or cessation of funding would reverberate through the country, \nfrom our Southwest border to our Nation's ports to every international \nairport that brings in either foreign commerce or foreign visitors who \nwant to come and be tourists in our country.\n  Many DHS employees, as the Presiding Officer knows, call Virginia \nhome, and a shutdown would impact their lives and would make it \ndifficult for them to plan not only for their immediate needs but for \nan unknown period of time.\n  So as we are facing threats--and I think we all would agree--while we \nsometimes have differences of opinion about how to deal with threats, I \nthink everybody in this body would acknowledge that the threats we are \ndealing with as a nation are not shrinking, they are growing. The \nchallenges we are facing are not getting fewer in number, they are \ngetting greater in number. To respond to threats, the DHS not only \nneeds a good funding bill at an appropriate level, which we have \nalready agreed to, but they need financial certainty and the \nflexibility to direct its resources as they can.\n  Let me give one interesting recent example of how DHS employees have\n\n[[Page S688]]\n\nbeen very important in Virginia, and how those serving in Virginia have \nperformed a critical role for the Nation.\n  We saw a crisis spring up in 2014 that many of us hadn't paid too \nmuch attention to before, and that is the spread of the Ebola virus in \nAfrica. That epidemic that began in 2014 is the largest in history for \nthis kind of virus and it had a significant impact on many West African \ncountries. There were more than 22,000 cases as of January 30, 2015.\n  One of the great things is whenever there is a challenge such as \nthis, the nations of the world turn to the United States and they ask \nfor our help. Many parts of our government responded. We deployed \nmilitary and health professionals to Africa to try to battle the \ndisease there, but we have also deployed our DHS personnel right here \nat home to keep us safe. As part of this strategy to stop the spread of \nEbola, DHS announced in October that five U.S. airports would begin an \nadvanced screening process for Ebola, and one of those airports is in \nVirginia, and that is Dulles airport. Shortly after, DHS announced that \nall travelers from Ebola-affected countries would have to enter the \nUnited States from one of these five airports.\n  So using existing resources--using existing resources because we \ndidn't have an Ebola line item in the 2014 budget; this is an emergency \nthat came up--but with existing resources, the DHS employees at Dulles \nwere charged with supervising the entire Ebola screening process, \nincluding administering questionnaires, taking travelers' temperatures, \nand referring potentially infected people to the Centers for Disease \nControl, while also doing all of their regular duties. These officers \nin Virginia have gone above and beyond their mission for the sake of \nkeeping every American safe.\n  Since this advanced screening began in October, CBP officers at \nDulles have interviewed more than 2,000 visitors to the United States \nfrom African countries and they have referred more than 140 people to \nthe CDC. As a result of their work and the work of their colleagues and \ntheir ability to react to this emerging threat, the United States has \nonly seen two diagnosed cases of Ebola since advanced screening began \nat our airports, and both patients recovered.\n  This should be viewed as a huge success. Remember how worried we all \nwere--how worried I was--when this was happening in September and \nOctober. Our DHS employees have gone the extra mile to keep us safe.\n  This is the kind of mission that we call upon our DHS employees to \ncarry out for our security. It has nothing to do with congressional \ndebates about immigration policy, but it has everything to do with \ndoing the stated mission of keeping us safe. To limit DHS's access to \nresources by shutting down the agency or passing another continuing \nresolution that would keep them running on auto pilot--sort of driving \nby looking in the rearview mirror rather than looking through the \nwindshield of the challenges to come--would damage the ability of DHS \nto deal with growing threats.\n  I understand the message from the House. We have agreed on the right \nfunding level for DHS. They are saying, however, that we will only fund \nDHS, we will only fund the guys who are protecting us from ISIL, or \nprotecting us from Ebola, or protecting our ports from nuclear material \nbeing shipped--we will only fund it if we can get an agreement to \nchange policies enacted by the President with immigration. They are \nthreatening to stop funding DHS actions unless we reverse the \nPresident's actions on immigration--actions that, in my view, are \nalready helping the economy by bringing families out of the shadows to \nbecome productive, taxpaying members of our communities.\n  While I strongly support the President's immigration actions--and \nmost of them I voted for as part of the Senate's comprehensive \nimmigration reform bill that we passed in June of 2013--I can \nunderstand there might be Members of the House who may not like those \nactions. They may want to do something different. And the great thing \nis they have an ability to do something different. The House, with a \nsignificant Republican majority, can pass their own immigration reform \nbill. They can retract the President's actions. They can express what \nthey want to do about immigration reform. They can pass that bill just \nas they passed the DHS funding bill, and send it over to the Senate, \nand we can have a debate about immigration reform. But we can have that \ndebate without holding hostage the funding of the third largest agency \nin government, without holding hostage the work that agency does every \nday to keep us safe.\n  I think the good news in all of this is in both the House and Senate \nthere are people who think the immigration system is broken, the \nimmigration system needs to be fixed, and we ought to have a dialogue \nto do it. Certainly, when the Senate passed an immigration reform bill \nin June of 2013--nearly 2 years ago--and we sent it to the House, we \nknew the House was not going to adopt what the Senate passed without \nchanging anything. We were trying to start a dialogue where the House \ncould pass their own bill and then we could sit down in conference and \nwork out a solution to an immigration system that we all think is \nbroken. That is what we should be doing as responsible legislators--\nfixing an immigration system, and even those of us who have different \nviews, getting those views on the table and finding a compromise. It is \nthe wrong thing to do to try to hold up funding for the third largest \nagency in government--this agency that is keeping us safe in so many \nways all over this country every day--to try to reverse actions the \nPresident took that are well within his legal authority.\n  So I am going to continue to support the President's Executive \nactions. I am going to continue to encourage the House and others, if \nthey have different ideas about immigration reform, to pass a bill, put \ntheir ideas on the table and we will talk about them. But it is wrong \nto try to hold up protecting our Nation's security as a punishment to \nthe President for using Executive action that was within his legal \npower to make. Since we have the complete ability to have a discussion \nabout immigration, let's do it.\n  I will conclude and say this, although I wish I didn't have to--and \nparticularly looking at these young pages who are sitting in front of \nme--it is a dangerous world out there. For the sake of these youngsters \nand my own kids, I wish it was getting less dangerous. I have a son in \nthe military. I wish it was getting less dangerous, but it is not. It \nis getting more dangerous. The kinds of threats we have to face abroad \nand at home are tough, challenging, difficult threats. We have \nprofessionals on the front line every day, many of whom are risking \ntheir lives for us, to try to stop these threats. Let's not starve \ntheir work. Let's not hamper their work. Let's not make them face the \nthreat of a shutdown or losing their salary or losing their livelihood \nwhile we wait for Congress to have a meaningful debate about \nimmigration.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to offer those thoughts and to urge \nfunding for a clean DHS bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, tomorrow afternoon the Senate will vote to \nbegin consideration of the bill called H.R. 240. This is a bill that \nauthorizes funding for the Department of Homeland Security, or DHS. It \nwould fund DHS through September of this year. This, of course, is a \nprocedural vote we have scheduled for tomorrow, not a substantive one. \nThe only question on the table, the sole question in connection with \nthis particular vote, will be whether the Senate is ready to begin \nvoting and debating on H.R. 240.\n  I am ready--I am eager, in fact--to begin this debate. It does need \nto begin. That is what this vote is about. Not just because we have \nonly 25 days before the current budget authority for DHS expires but \nalso because this debate will finally allow the American people to see \nwhere their elected representatives, right here in the U.S. Senate, \nstand on President Obama's recent Executive action on immigration.\n  The legislature is the only lawmaking branch within our Federal \nGovernment because it is the only deliberative branch in our \ngovernment. Before Congress enacts a piece of legislation--before it \nmakes a new piece of law--we first debate the merits of that \nlegislation--weighing the various pros and cons of each proposal in a \ncandid and transparent discussion, and allowing the various sides of \nthe issue to make their case.\n\n[[Page S689]]\n\n  Open, robust debate is not merely incidental to the lawmaking process \nthat goes on here, it is the essence of that lawmaking process. It is \nat the very heart, the very center, the very core of this process that \nwe hold near and dear and was established by our 227-year-old founding \ndocument. It is the only way for Members of Congress to fully explore \nthe cost and consequences of a particular policy under consideration. \nIt is the only way for the American people to know exactly where their \nelected officials stand on an issue; and, just as importantly, why they \nstand where they stand.\n  When the President of the United States announced in November of last \nyear he was singlehandedly going to rewrite our immigration laws, in \neffect, he short-circuited this process of debate and of deliberation \nthat is at the very heart of our constitutional lawmaking process.\n  His announcement showed us what it looks like when one person ignores \nthe limits of his office and claims the power to change the law all on \nhis own, just as an expression of his own unilateral will.\n  Policies are written behind closed doors, in consultation with \nlawyers and special-interest groups, rather than the American people. \nThe law is pronounced from behind a podium as a fait accompli rather \nthan discussed and debated in an open, transparent, fair contest of \nideas and open to inspection by 300 million Americans who will be \naffected by these decisions.\n  This is not how our Republic works. It is not what the American \npeople expect from their elected officials in Washington, DC. Indeed, \npoll after poll shows most people disapprove of the President's \nExecutive action on immigration--that same action taken just this last \nNovember. Even those who agree with the President on policy grounds, \neven those who think the President's amnesty action would be the kind \nof policy they would prefer, even those people disagree with the \nPresident on the process because the American people understand that \nthe process does matter. Especially among those people who have taken \nan oath to uphold, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United \nStates--that same document that prescribes the formula by which our \nlaws are made.\n  According to one poll, when asked if the President should ``sidestep \nCongress and act on his own using Executive orders,'' only 22 percent \nof the public said he should--22 percent. It is hardly a rousing \nmandate from the American people. In other words, the American people \nknow what our President seems to have forgotten: that in a \nconstitutional republic the ends don't justify the means.\n  The American people oppose lawmaking by fiat not out of some abstract \nloyalty to the abstract concept of separation of powers. No, that is \nnot why. Rather, they understand quite intuitively that when a \nPresident sidesteps Congress and avoids open, robust debate on a \nparticular policy, it is probably because the public isn't likely to \naccept and isn't likely to like the substance of that policy. \nOtherwise, he wouldn't need to take this kind of action. Otherwise, he \ncould do it through the people's duly elected representatives who have \nbeen put in office specifically for the purpose of making law through \nthis open, deliberative, transparent process.\n  This is certainly what we have seen in the aftermath of the \nPresident's Executive order on immigration. The more the people \ndiscover about the content and about the consequences of his policy, \nthe less they like it. For instance, the President claimed that his \nExecutive order would honor the golden rule of American exceptionalism: \nIf you work hard and play by the rules, you can get ahead.\n  We now know his plan subverts this very basic fundamental bargain by \npaving a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants who have broken \nthe rules and violated the law, and by granting them work permits and \nbenefits such as Social Security and Medicare.\n  Likewise, we were told the President's Executive order would make our \nimmigration system more fair and more functional, more accessible for \neveryone. But we now know his plan will only exacerbate the problems in \nour labor market for American workers by giving more power and more \nmoney to the dysfunctional U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, \nor USCIS. This is the agency within the Department of Homeland Security \nthat was recently reported to have given over 900,000 work permits to \nillegal immigrants since 2009. We know that unless we do something to \nstop it, unless we do something to reach back and take back our \nconstitutional privilege, our institutional privilege as the lawmaking \nbranch of the Federal Government, the President's Executive order will \ngo into effect at a time when all net job growth in our economy since \n2007 has gone to immigrants.\n  These are the kinds of facts and figures that ought to inform the \nlegislative process and ought to not be treated as some sort of \nafterthought. These are not, coincidentally, exactly the kinds of \nobservations, the kinds of facts and figures, the kinds of details that \ncould have been and should have been and, undoubtedly, inevitably would \nhave been explored had this policy been implemented through the \nconstitutionally prescribed formula.\n  Last November the President may have chosen to ignore these facts and \nto circumvent debate altogether, but that doesn't mean we have to \nrespond in kind. That certainly doesn't mean we have to capitulate and \nsay, okay, the way he wants to do it is fine. It is not constitutional. \nIt is not legal. It is not what the American people want, but we just \nhave to accept it. No. On the contrary, I believe we have not just a \nright but we have a duty, we have an affirmative obligation to make \nevery effort to ensure lawmaking by edict does not become the new \nnormal in this country. Not now, not ever, not in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Beginning debate on this bill will give us the opportunity to do just \nthat, to make sure this never becomes the new normal. Some have said we \nshouldn't be debating the President's Executive action on immigration \nright now. They say it has nothing to do with funding the operations of \nthe Department of Homeland Security. To this I have a very simple \nreply: If not now, when? If we are not going to do it right now, when \nare we going to do it? When will there be a better time? When will \nthere be any adequate time for us to respond to this constitutional \noverreach, this grave injustice? If we don't debate the legality of the \nPresident's Executive orders when we are in the very process of \nauthorizing money to the Department that is tasked with carrying out \nthose very orders, then when exactly will we have that debate?\n  The truth is now is the perfect time because it is the only time. It \nis the only time when we can do this. It is the only time for us to \nhave a meaningful debate on the President's Executive action on \nimmigration.\n  At any other point our debate is more or less hypothetical. Now is \nthe time, when we are exercising our constitutional power of the purse, \nthat our debate has consequences, real consequences. They are \nconsequences the American people can see and feel, consequences that \nwill inure to the betterment or the detriment of the American people. \nNow is the time when this needs to be debated.\n  The power of the purse is the power to allocate money to fund \ngovernment operations as well as the power to withhold money from \nimproper or illegitimate government operations. It is what enables \nCongress--and only Congress, uniquely Congress--to reform dysfunctional \ngovernment.\n  We like to talk about the power of the purse as a tool that Congress \ncan use, use as a check and a balance against the excesses of an \noverbearing President. That is absolutely true. There is no doubt about \nit. But first and foremost, it is a tool for Members of Congress \nthemselves to represent the interests of our constituents and to fix \nthe very things that are broken within our government.\n  Our Constitution grants the legislative branch--this branch, \nCongress--the power of the purse not simply to achieve some abstract \nequilibrium or balance of power, but to compel the national government \nto truly represent the American people and to be faithful stewards of \ntaxpayer funds.\n  At the end of November of last year, President Obama made his choice. \nIt was an unfortunate choice; it was a wrong choice. It was a choice \nnot backed up by law, not backed up by the U.S. Constitution, and \nflatly inconsistent with the same. President\n\n[[Page S690]]\n\nObama made his choice in November. Now it is time for us to make ours.\n  The President chose to sidestep Congress, and in the process to avoid \ndebate and to rewrite our immigration laws on his own. Now we must \ndecide: Are we going to be a deliberative body or are we going to be a \nrubberstamp for the President's agenda, whoever the President is \nhappens to be in power, whether it is now or years from now? Are we \ngoing to be that kind of legislative body that just rubberstamps what \nthe President does, or are we going to exercise our prerogative as an \nindependent coordinate branch of this government to make sure our laws \nare faithfully and carefully executed in a manner consistent not only \nwith the wishes of the people but also with the formula prescribed by \nthe Constitution? Are we going to acquiesce to an Executive who \ndisregards the boundaries of his office, or are we going to stand up \nfor the rule of law and for the will of the American people?\n  I choose the latter. I urge my colleagues to choose the latter. I \nhope my colleagues will join me in voting to at least begin debate on \nH.R. 240. This is a debate the American people have been waiting for \nCongress to have for far too long. If not now, when? The time is now. \nWe need to get on this bill. We need to debate it. We need to allow our \nconstituents to be heard.\n\n  The American people have a will, and that will is expressed though \nregular elections. Those elections choose those people who occupy seats \nin this Chamber and in the House of Representatives. We must represent \nthem. We must do so in a manner fully consistent with the oath that \nevery one of us has taken as required by article VI of the \nConstitution. We can begin to do that by voting to proceed to H.R. 240 \ntomorrow.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/02/senate-section/article/S690-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CLAY HUNT SAV ACT\n\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, last night tens of millions of Americans \nwatched the Super Bowl, a game that has become a national tradition, \nsomething of an American holiday--and for good reason. Competition, \ngrit, and hard work can bring out the best in all of us. But not all \nAmericans were watching.\n  Last night, just like every other night of the year, there were young \nAmerican men and women, humbly and without complaint, shouldering the \nburden of protecting their follow citizens from harm. Some were doing \nthis overseas, in places both familiar and unfamiliar to us. Others \nwere here in America doing the hard training that is necessary to hone \ntheir warrior skills to protect us.\n  I had the privilege of being with thousands of these fine young \nAmericans last night at the Army's National Training Center, the NTC, \nat Fort Irwin, CA. Just as in the Super Bowl, they were on the field \nengaged in fierce competition, force-on-force operations, as part of \nsome of the best, most challenging military training anywhere in the \nworld.\n  But unlike the Super Bowl, there were no winners or losers last \nnight--just winners. Among the participants at NTC are 3,000 soldiers \nfrom a battle-hardened Army Stryker brigade based in Fairbanks, AK, \nalong with hundreds of paratroopers from other military bases across \nAlaska. I felt immense pride in watching them train last night.\n  These young men and women, volunteers all, selflessly stand ready to \nfight and give their lives for our great country. With all due respect \nto my distinguished colleagues from New England who are deservedly \ncelebrating today, it is very important to keep in mind that America's \ntrue patriots were on the field last night in places such as Fort \nIrwin, Baghdad, and Kabul.\n  We have an important opportunity to honor their service tomorrow as \nwe prepare to vote on a bipartisan bill to make sure the patriots in \nour military have the resources and care that can help them fight the \ndespair of suicide. Tomorrow we vote on the Clay Hunt Suicide \nPrevention for American Veterans Act, which I was proud to cosponsor \nand help pass out of the Veteran's Affairs Committee.\n  This bill is named for a true American hero, a decorated Marine who \nfought in Afghanistan and Iraq and who struggled with despair and \nultimately took his own life. This bill will start to bring greater \nawareness and services to the devastation that too many of our finest \nfall sway to. I encourage all of my distinguished colleagues to vote \nfor this bill tomorrow so we can get it on the President's desk for his \nsignature as soon as possible.\n  A vote tomorrow will be a vote for Clay Hunt, for his courageous \nfamily, and for all the families and their loved ones who have lost \nsomeone to the national tragedy of suicide.\n  This will be a vote for my State, Alaska, which proudly boasts the \nhighest number of veterans per capita in the United States but, sadly, \nhas the highest rates of suicide in our country. This is also a \npersonal vote for me. It is a story I do not share often or lightly. As \nan officer in the Marine Corps, both on Active Duty and in the Reserve, \nI have personally witnessed the struggles, at times tragic, that some \nof our service men and women undergo.\n  The suicide of a young Alaskan marine under my command still haunts \nme. You always wonder: Could I have done more? With the proper \nawareness and resources this marine might be alive today. That is why \nwe need legislation such as the Clay Hunt bill. When I cast my vote \ntomorrow, it will be a vote for all of our veterans but particularly \nfor the families who have suffered the unspeakable pain of suicide.\n  This is a good bill. It is a good start. As my distinguished \ncolleague from Connecticut calls it, this bill is a downpayment on our \ndebt to our veterans. It will not solve all the problems they face, \nincluding rates of suicide among veterans that are far too high in this \ncountry. But it is an important beginning. I ask my colleagues to vote \nfor this bill tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/02/senate-section/article/S690-2", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       CELEBRATING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF CONGREGATION NER TAMID\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of the 40th \nanniversary of Congregation Ner Tamid in Henderson, NV. With its strong \ncommitment to serving others, Congregation Ner Tamid is an integral and \ndeeply valued part of the Las Vegas community.\n  As the largest Reform synagogue in the State of Nevada, with a \nmembership of more than 600 families, Congregation Ner Tamid is an \nimportant center for the Jewish community. For decades, the \ncongregation has provided opportunities for religious education to \nmembers of all ages and helped sustain important Jewish traditions that \nhave been practiced for centuries. At the same time, Congregation Ner \nTamid has worked to develop strong, interfaith relationships with other \ncommunities in southern Nevada. Congregation Ner Tamid hosted the \nInterfaith Council of Southern Nevada's annual Thanksgiving observance \nthis past November, bringing together people with diverse spiritual \nviews in a unified commitment to mutual understanding and cooperation.\n  In particular, I appreciate the value Congregation Ner Tamid places \non serving others and working to improve the Las Vegas community. \nCongregation Ner Tamid is committed to helping the homeless, engaging \nin important political discussions, and providing support to \nindividuals and families through a variety of programs and events.\n  I extend my congratulations to Congregation Ner Tamid on this \nimportant anniversary, and I thank Rabbi Sanford Akselrad, Cantor \nJessica Hutchings, president Jacky Rosen, and the past presidents of \nCongregation Ner Tamid for their leadership and dedication.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/02/senate-section/article/S690-3", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S690-S691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    LAND AND WATER CONSERVATION FUND\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with Senator Wyden.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S691]]\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of entering into a \ncolloquy with the senior senator from Oregon and ranking member of the \nFinance Committee in regards to the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n  As the senior senator from Oregon knows, the Land and Water \nConservation Fund was created in a bipartisan manner to help safeguard \nnational parks, rivers, lakes and critical habitats for wildlife in all \nfifty States. Over the years, the Land and Water Conservation Fund has \nhelped protect some of our Nation's most treasured places. Two such \nplaces are located in Delaware. They are the Bombay Hook National \nWildlife Refuge and the Prime Hook National Wildlife Refuge. Now that \nDelaware has a new national park--the First State National Historical \nPark--the State has even more opportunities to take advantage of the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund.\n  As you know, every year, some of the royalties from drilling for oil \nand gas on public lands are paid into the Land and Water Conservation \nFund. Despite over $900 million coming into the fund every year, only \nabout one-third of that amount actually goes toward conservation. The \nfunding is diverted elsewhere, despite the huge unmet need across our \ncountry to safeguard national parks, national forests, national \nwildlife refuges, rivers, lakes, and critical wildlife habitat.\n  Two weeks ago, I sought to bring an amendment up for a vote on S. 1, \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline Act, in an effort to address some of the Land \nand Water Conservation Fund funding issues. Critical habitats are \nimpacted every year by the building of pipelines like the Keystone \npipeline. Therefore, increasing funding for the Land and Water \nConservation Fund to help counter these impacts seemed like a relevant \nissue to debate and vote on. Unfortunately, my amendment was tabled, \nalong with other Democratic amendments, and we were not able to have \nthat debate and vote. Although I am disappointed we were not able to \naddress this issue on this piece of legislation, I am determined to \ncontinue to work on this issue.\n  Let me say to my colleague, our ranking member, I know you have been \na long-time champion for the Land and Water Conservation Fund. I would \nwelcome the opportunity to work with you and your staff on legislation \nthat not only reauthorizes the program, but also better ensures that \nthe revenues credited to the Land and Water Conservation Fund each year \nare no longer diverted, but are used instead to meet more of our \nNation's critical conservation needs. Would the Senator be willing to \nwork with my staff and me?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I want to thank the senior Senator from Delaware for \nraising this important issue. I would be happy to work with him on this \nissue because, as my friend and colleague from Delaware knows, the Land \nand Water Conservation Fund is not only good for the environment but \ngood for local economies. Economists have determined that communities \nthat are near or part of protected natural resources have better and \nmore sustainable economic outlooks than communities that are not.\n  In addition to the Land and Water Conservation Fund, I have been \nworking on longer term solutions to the need to reauthorize the Secure \nRural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act, as well as the need \nto consistently fund Payments in Lieu of Taxes. These programs share a \nsimilar, though not identical, vision as the Land and Water \nConservation Fund in that they seek to support the rural communities \nthat house some of our most important conservation-based treasures. I \nknow the Senator seeks to support these sorts of American communities \nand so, while we are working on ensuring the stable continuation of the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund, we can also work together on these \nfunds.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/02/senate-section/article/S691-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S691-S694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN RELATIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. CORKER.

Issues of procedure which may arise from time \n     to time shall be resolved by decision of the chairman, in \n     consultation with the ranking member. The chairman, in \n     consultation with the ranking member, may also propose \n     special procedures to govern the consideration of particular \n     matters by the committee.\n       (f) Closed Sessions.--Each meeting and hearing of the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations, or any subcommittee thereof \n     shall be open to the public, except that a meeting or hearing \n     or series of meetings or hearings by the committee or a \n     subcommittee on the same subject for a period of no more than \n     14 calendar days may be closed to the public on a motion made \n     and seconded to go into closed session to discuss only \n     whether the matters enumerated in paragraphs (1) through (6) \n     would require the meeting or hearing to be closed followed \n     immediately by a record vote in open session by a majority of \n     the members of the committee or subcommittee when it is \n     determined that the matters to be discussed or the testimony \n     to be taken at such meeting or hearing or series of meetings \n     or hearings--\n        (1) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in \n     the interests of national defense or the confidential conduct \n     of the foreign relations of the United States;\n        (2) will relate solely to matters of committee staff \n     personnel or internal staff management or procedure;\n        (3) will tend to charge an individual with crime or \n     misconduct; to disgrace or injure the professional standing \n     of an individual, or otherwise to expose an individual to \n     public contempt or obloquy, or will represent a clearly \n     unwarranted invasion of the privacy of an individual;\n        (4) will disclose the identity of any informer or law \n     enforcement agent or will disclose any information relating \n     to the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense \n     that is required to be kept secret in the interests of \n     effective law enforcement;\n        (5) will disclose information relating to the trade \n     secrets or financial or commercial information pertaining \n     specifically to a given person if--\n        (A) an Act of Congress requires the information to be kept \n     confidential by government officers and employees; or\n        (B) the information has been obtained by the government on \n     a confidential basis, other than through an application by \n     such person for a specific government financial or other \n     benefit, and is required to be kept secret in order to \n     prevent undue injury to the competitive position of such \n     person, or\n        (6) may divulge matters required to be kept confidential \n     under other provisions of law or government regulations.\n       A closed meeting or hearing may be opened by a majority \n     vote of the committee.\n       (g) Staff Attendance.--A member of the committee may have \n     one member of his or her personal staff, for whom that member \n     assumes personal responsibility, accompany and be seated \n     nearby at committee meetings and hearings. The chairman or \n     ranking member may authorize the attendance and seating of \n     such a staff member at committee meetings and hearings where \n     the member of the committee is not present.\n       Each member of the committee may designate members of his \n     or her personal staff for whom that member assumes personal \n     responsibility, who holds, at a minimum, a top secret \n     security clearance, for the purpose of their eligibility to \n     attend closed sessions of the committee, subject to the same \n     conditions set forth for committee staff under Rules 12, 13, \n     and 14.\n       In addition, the majority leader and the minority leader of \n     the Senate, if they are not otherwise members of the \n     committee, may designate one member of their staff for whom \n     that leader assumes personal responsibility and who holds, at \n     a minimum, a top secret security clearance, to attend closed \n     sessions of the committee, subject to the same conditions set \n     forth for committee staff under Rules 12, 13, and 14.\n       Staff of other Senators who are not members of the \n     committee may not attend closed sessions of the committee.\n       Attendance of committee staff at meetings and hearings \n     shall be limited to those designated by the staff director or \n     the minority staff director.\n       The committee, by majority vote, or the chairman, with the \n     concurrence of the ranking member, may limit staff attendance \n     at specified meetings or hearings.\n\n\n                            RULE 4--QUORUMS\n\n       (a) Testimony.--For the purpose of taking sworn or unsworn \n     testimony at any duly scheduled meeting a quorum of the \n     committee and each subcommittee thereof shall consist of one \n     member of such committee or subcommittee.\n       (b) Business.--A quorum for the transaction of committee or \n     subcommittee business, other than for reporting a measure or \n     recommendation to the Senate or the taking of testimony, \n     shall consist of one-third of the members of the committee or \n     subcommittee, including at least one member from each party.\n       (c) Reporting.--A majority of the membership of the \n     committee, including at least one member from each party, \n     shall constitute a quorum for reporting any measure or \n     recommendation to the Senate. No measure or recommendation \n     shall be ordered reported from the committee unless a \n     majority of the committee members is physically present, \n     including at least one member from each party, and a majority \n     of those present concurs.\n\n\n                            RULE 5--PROXIES\n\n       Proxies must be in writing with the signature of the absent \n     member. Subject to the requirements of Rule 4 for the \n     physical presence of a quorum to report a matter, proxy \n     voting shall be allowed on all measures and matters before \n     the committee. However, proxies shall not be voted on a \n     measure or matter except when the absent member has been \n     informed of the matter on which he is being recorded and has \n     affirmatively requested that he or she be so recorded.\n\n\n                           RULE 6--WITNESSES\n\n       (a) General.--The Committee on Foreign Relations will \n     consider requests to testify on any matter or measure pending \n     before the committee.\n       (b) Presentation.--If the chairman so determines, the oral \n     presentation of witnesses shall be limited to 10 minutes. \n     However, written statements of reasonable length may be \n     submitted by witnesses and other interested persons who are \n     unable to testify in person.\n       (c) Filing of Statements.--A witness appearing before the \n     committee, or any subcommittee thereof, shall submit an \n     electronic copy of the written statement of his proposed \n     testimony at least 24 hours prior to his appearance, unless \n     this requirement is waived by the chairman and the ranking \n     member following their determination that there is good cause \n     for failure to file such a statement.\n       (d) Expenses.--Only the chairman may authorize expenditures \n     of funds for the expenses of witnesses appearing before the \n     committee or its subcommittees.\n       (e) Requests.--Any witness called for a hearing may submit \n     a written request to the chairman no later than 24 hours in \n     advance for his testimony to be in closed or open session, or \n     for any other unusual procedure. The chairman shall determine \n     whether to grant any such request and shall notify the \n     committee members of the request and of his decision.\n\n\n                           RULE 7--SUBPOENAS\n\n       (a) Authorization.--The chairman or any other member of the \n     committee, when authorized by a majority vote of the \n     committee at a meeting or by proxies, shall have authority to \n     subpoena the attendance of witnesses or the production of \n     memoranda, documents, records, or any other materials. At the \n     request of any member of the committee, the committee shall \n     authorize the issuance of a subpoena only at a meeting of the \n     committee. When the committee authorizes a\n\n[[Page S693]]\n\n     subpoena, it may be issued upon the signature of the chairman \n     or any other member designated by the committee.\n       (b) Return.--A subpoena, or a request to an agency, for \n     documents may be issued whose return shall occur at a time \n     and place other than that of a scheduled committee meeting. A \n     return on such a subpoena or request which is incomplete or \n     accompanied by an objection constitutes good cause for a \n     hearing on shortened notice. Upon such a return, the chairman \n     or any other member designated by him may convene a hearing \n     by giving 4 hours notice by telephone or electronic mail to \n     all other members. One member shall constitute a quorum for \n     such a hearing. The sole purpose of such a hearing shall be \n     to elucidate further information about the return and to rule \n     on the objection.\n       (c) Depositions.--At the direction of the committee, staff \n     is authorized to take depositions from witnesses.\n\n\n                            RULE 8--REPORTS\n\n       (a) Filing.--When the committee has ordered a measure or \n     recommendation reported, the report thereon shall be filed in \n     the Senate at the earliest practicable time.\n       (b) Supplemental, Minority and Additional Views.--A member \n     of the committee who gives notice of his intentions to file \n     supplemental, minority, or additional views at the time of \n     final committee approval of a measure or matter, shall be \n     entitled to not less than 3 calendar days in which to file \n     such views, in writing (including by electronic mail), with \n     the chief clerk of the committee, with the 3 days to begin at \n     11:00 p.m. on the same day that the committee has ordered a \n     measure or matter reported. Such views shall then be included \n     in the committee report and printed in the same volume, as a \n     part thereof, and their inclusion shall be noted on the cover \n     of the report. In the absence of timely notice, the committee \n     report may be filed and printed immediately without such \n     views.\n       (c) Roll Call Votes.--The results of all roll call votes \n     taken in any meeting of the committee on any measure, or \n     amendment thereto, shall be announced in the committee \n     report. The announcement shall include a tabulation of the \n     votes cast in favor and votes cast in opposition to each such \n     measure and amendment by each member of the committee.\n\n\n                            RULE 9--TREATIES\n\n       (a) General.--The committee is the only committee of the \n     Senate with jurisdiction to review and report to the Senate \n     on treaties submitted by the President for Senate advice and \n     consent to ratification. Because the House of Representatives \n     has no role in the approval of treaties, the committee is \n     therefore the only congressional committee with \n     responsibility for treaties.\n       (b) Committee Proceedings.--Once submitted by the President \n     for advice and consent, each treaty is referred to the \n     committee and remains on its calendar from Congress to \n     Congress until the committee takes action to report it to the \n     Senate or recommend its return to the President, or until the \n     committee is discharged of the treaty by the Senate.\n       (c) Floor Proceedings.--In accordance with Senate Rule \n     XXX.2, treaties which have been reported to the Senate but \n     not acted on before the end of a Congress ``shall be resumed \n     at the commencement of the next Congress as if no proceedings \n     had previously been had thereon.''\n       (d) Hearings.--Insofar as possible, the committee should \n     conduct a public hearing on each treaty as soon as possible \n     after its submission by the President. Except in \n     extraordinary circumstances, treaties reported to the Senate \n     shall be accompanied by a written report.\n\n\n                          RULE 10--NOMINATIONS\n\n       (a) Waiting Requirement.--Unless otherwise directed by the \n     chairman and the ranking member, the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations shall not consider any nomination until 5 business \n     days after it has been formally submitted to the Senate.\n       (b) Public Consideration.--Nominees for any post who are \n     invited to appear before the committee shall be heard in \n     public session, unless a majority of the committee decrees \n     otherwise, consistent with Rule 3(f).\n       (c) Required Data.--No nomination shall be reported to the \n     Senate unless (1) the nominee has been accorded a security \n     clearance on the basis of a thorough investigation by \n     executive branch agencies; (2) the nominee has filed a \n     financial disclosure report and a related ethics undertaking \n     with the committee; (3) the committee has been assured that \n     the nominee does not have any interests which could conflict \n     with the interests of the government in the exercise of the \n     nominee's proposed responsibilities; (4) for persons \n     nominated to be chief of mission, ambassador-at-large, or \n     minister, the committee has received a complete list of any \n     contributions made by the nominee or members of his immediate \n     family to any Federal election campaign during the year of \n     his or her nomination and for the 4 preceding years; (5) for \n     persons nominated to be chiefs of mission, the report \n     required by Section 304(a)(4) of the Foreign Service Act of \n     1980 on the demonstrated competence of that nominee to \n     perform the duties of the position to which he or she has \n     been nominated; and (6) the nominee has provided the \n     committee with a signed and notarized copy of the committee \n     questionnaire for executive branch nominees.\n\n\n                            RULE 11--TRAVEL\n\n       (a) Foreign Travel.--No member of the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations or its staff shall travel abroad on committee \n     business unless specifically authorized by the chairman, who \n     is required by law to approve vouchers and report \n     expenditures of foreign currencies, and the ranking member. \n     Requests for authorization of such travel shall state the \n     purpose and, when completed, a full substantive and financial \n     report shall be filed with the committee within 30 days. This \n     report shall be furnished to all members of the committee and \n     shall not be otherwise disseminated without authorization of \n     the chairman and the ranking member. Except in extraordinary \n     circumstances, staff travel shall not be approved unless the \n     reporting requirements have been fulfilled for all prior \n     trips. Except for travel that is strictly personal, travel \n     funded by non-U.S. Government sources is subject to the same \n     approval and substantive reporting requirements as U.S. \n     Government-funded travel. In addition, members and staff are \n     reminded to consult the Senate Code of Conduct, and, as \n     appropriate, the Senate Select Committee on Ethics, in the \n     case of travel sponsored by non-U.S. Government sources.\n       Any proposed travel by committee staff for a subcommittee \n     purpose must be approved by the subcommittee chairman and \n     ranking member prior to submission of the request to the \n     chairman and ranking member of the full committee.\n       (b) Domestic Travel.--All official travel in the United \n     States by the committee staff shall be approved in advance by \n     the staff director, or in the case of minority staff, by the \n     minority staff director.\n       (c) Personal Staff Travel.--As a general rule, no more than \n     one member of the personal staff of a member of the committee \n     may travel with that member with the approval of the chairman \n     and the ranking member of the committee. During such travel, \n     the personal staff member shall be considered to be an \n     employee of the committee.\n       (d) PRM Travel.--For the purposes of this rule regarding \n     staff foreign travel, the officially-designated personal \n     representative of the member pursuant to rule 14(b), shall be \n     deemed to have the same rights, duties, and responsibilities \n     as members of the staff of the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations.\n\n\n      RULE 12--TRANSCRIPTS AND MATERIALS PROVIDED TO THE COMMITTEE\n\n       (a) General.--The Committee on Foreign Relations shall keep \n     verbatim transcripts of all committee and subcommittee \n     meetings and hearings and such transcripts shall remain in \n     the custody of the committee, unless a majority of the \n     committee decides otherwise. Transcripts of public hearings \n     by the committee shall be published unless the chairman, with \n     the concurrence of the ranking member, determines otherwise.\n       The committee, through the chief clerk, shall also maintain \n     at least one copy of all materials provided to the committee \n     by the Executive Branch; such copy shall remain in the \n     custody of the committee and be subject to the committee's \n     rules and procedures, including those rules and procedures \n     applicable to the handling of classified materials.\n       Such transcripts and materials shall be made available to \n     all members of the committee, committee staff, and designated \n     personal representatives of members of the committee, except \n     as otherwise provided in these rules.\n       (b) Classified or Restricted Transcripts or Materials.--\n        (1) The chief clerk of the committee shall have \n     responsibility for the maintenance and security of classified \n     or restricted transcripts or materials, and shall ensure that \n     such transcripts or materials are handled in a manner \n     consistent with the requirements of the United States Senate \n     Security Manual.\n        (2) A record shall be maintained of each use of classified \n     or restricted transcripts or materials as required by the \n     Senate Security Manual.\n        (3) Classified transcripts or materials may not leave the \n     committee offices, or SVC-217 of the Capitol Visitors Center, \n     except for the purpose of declassification or archiving, \n     consistent with these rules.\n        (4) Extreme care shall be exercised to avoid taking notes \n     or quotes from classified transcripts or materials. Their \n     contents may not be divulged to any unauthorized person.\n        (5) Subject to any additional restrictions imposed by the \n     chairman with the concurrence of the ranking member, only the \n     following persons are authorized to have access to classified \n     or restricted transcripts or materials:\n        (A) Members and staff of the committee in the committee \n     offices or in SVC-217 of the Capitol Visitors Center;\n        (B) Designated personal representatives of members of the \n     committee, and of the majority and minority leaders, with \n     appropriate security clearances, in the committee offices or \n     in SVC-217 of the Capitol Visitors Center;\n        (C) Senators not members of the committee, by permission \n     of the chairman, in the committee offices or in SVC-217 of \n     the Capitol Visitors Center; and\n        (D) Officials of the executive departments involved in the \n     meeting, hearing, or matter, with authorization of the \n     chairman, in the committee offices or SVC-217 of the Capitol \n     Visitors Center.\n        (6) Any restrictions imposed by the committee upon access \n     to a meeting or hearing of the committee shall also apply to \n     the transcript of such meeting, except by special\n\n[[Page S694]]\n\n     permission of the chairman and ranking member.\n        (7) In addition to restrictions resulting from the \n     inclusion of any classified information in the transcript of \n     a committee meeting or hearing, members and staff shall not \n     discuss with anyone the proceedings of the committee in \n     closed session or reveal information conveyed or discussed in \n     such a session unless that person would have been permitted \n     to attend the session itself or is a member or staff of a \n     relevant committee or executive branch agency and possess an \n     appropriate security clearance, or unless such communication \n     is specifically authorized by the chairman, the ranking \n     member, or in the case of staff, by the staff director or \n     minority staff director. A record shall be kept of all such \n     authorizations.\n       (c) Declassification.--\n        (1) All noncurrent records of the committee are governed \n     by Rule XI of the Standing Rules of the Senate and by S. Res. \n     474 (96th Congress). Any classified transcripts or materials \n     transferred to the National Archives and Records \n     Administration under Rule XI may not be made available for \n     public use unless they have been subject to declassification \n     review in accordance with applicable laws or Executive \n     orders.\n        (2) Any transcript or classified committee report, or any \n     portion thereof, may be declassified, in accordance with \n     applicable laws or Executive orders, sooner than the time \n     period provided for under S. Res. 474 if:\n        (A) the chairman originates such action, with the \n     concurrence of the ranking member;\n        (B) the other current members of the committee who \n     participated in such meeting or report have been notified of \n     the proposed declassification, and have not objected thereto, \n     except that the committee by majority vote may overrule any \n     objections thereby raised to early declassification; and\n       (C) the executive departments that participated in the \n     meeting or originated the classified information have been \n     consulted regarding the declassification.\n\n\n                    RULE 13--CLASSIFIED INFORMATION\n\n       (a) General.--The handling of classified information in the \n     Senate is governed by S. Res. 243 (100th Congress), which \n     established the Office of Senate Security. All handling of \n     classified information by the committee shall be consistent \n     with the procedures set forth in the United States Senate \n     Security Manual issued by the Office of Senate Security.\n       (b) Security Manager.--The chief clerk is the security \n     manager for the committee. The chief clerk shall be \n     responsible for implementing the provisions of the Senate \n     Security Manual and for serving as the committee liaison to \n     the Office of Senate Security. The staff director, in \n     consultation with the minority staff director, may appoint an \n     alternate security manager as circumstances warrant.\n       (c) Transportation of Classified Material.--Classified \n     material may only be transported between Senate offices by \n     appropriately cleared staff members who have been \n     specifically authorized to do so by the security manager.\n       (d) Access to Classified Material.--In general, Senators \n     and staff undertake to confine their access to classified \n     information on the basis of a ``need to know'' such \n     information related to their committee responsibilities.\n       (e) Staff Clearances.--The chairman, or, in the case of \n     minority staff, the ranking member, shall designate the \n     members of the committee staff whose assignments require \n     access to classified and compartmented information and shall \n     seek to obtain the requisite security clearances pursuant to \n     Office of Senate Security procedures.\n       (f) PRM Clearances.--For the purposes of this rule \n     regarding security clearances and access to compartmented \n     information, the officially-designated personal \n     representative of the member (PRM) pursuant to rule 14(b), \n     shall be deemed to have the same rights, duties, and \n     responsibilities as members of the staff of the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations.\n       (g) Regulations.--The staff director is authorized to make \n     such administrative regulations as may be necessary to carry \n     out the provisions of this rule.\n\n\n                             RULE 14--STAFF\n\n       (a) Responsibilities.--\n        (1) The staff works for the committee as a whole, under \n     the general supervision of the chairman of the committee, and \n     the immediate direction of the staff director, except that \n     such part of the staff as is designated minority staff shall \n     be under the general supervision of the ranking member and \n     under the immediate direction of the minority staff director.\n        (2) Any member of the committee should feel free to call \n     upon the staff at any time for assistance in connection with \n     committee business. Members of the Senate not members of the \n     committee who call upon the staff for assistance from time to \n     time should be given assistance subject to the overriding \n     responsibility of the staff to the committee.\n        (3) The staff's primary responsibility is with respect to \n     bills, resolutions, treaties, and nominations and other \n     matters within the jurisdiction of the committee. In addition \n     to carrying out assignments from the committee and its \n     individual members, the staff has a responsibility to \n     originate suggestions for committee or subcommittee \n     consideration. The staff also has a responsibility to make \n     suggestions to individual members regarding matters of \n     special interest to such members.\n        (4) It is part of the staff's duty to keep itself as well \n     informed as possible in regard to developments affecting \n     foreign relations and national security and in regard to the \n     administration of foreign programs of the United States. \n     Significant trends or developments which might otherwise \n     escape notice should be called to the attention of the \n     committee, or of individual Senators with particular \n     interests.\n        (5) The staff shall pay due regard to the constitutional \n     separation of powers between the Senate and the executive \n     branch. It therefore has a responsibility to help the \n     committee bring to bear an independent, objective judgment of \n     proposals by the executive branch and when appropriate to \n     originate sound proposals of its own.

Mr. President, I am humbled to recognize Mr. Odell \nLumont Price, and especially during Black History Month. As a \nconstituent, I can say he has encouraged all who are familiar with his \nstory. Mr. Price exemplifies the words of the late Dr. Martin Luther \nKing, Jr.--he has truly lived a life in which he has been ``judged by \nthe content of his character rather than the color of his skin.''\n  He grew up in Liberty Hill, a small part of North Charleston, and was \namong the first to graduate from all-white North Charleston High in \n1967. Upon graduation, he volunteered to join the U.S. Marines at the \nage of 17 because he lacked the finances to attend college. He also \nserved to show his\n\n[[Page S695]]\n\nlove and respect for his country and family.\n  He saw much during his time in battle, and quickly became a squad \nleader of the 3rd Marine Division. After leaving the military, he used \nthe GI Bill to further his education. Mr. Price believes that the \nopportunity to further his education played a huge part in his success \nworking at the Charleston Naval Shipyard.\n  Mr. Price is an example of everything that has allowed me to stand \nbefore you today. His values of faith, family and freedom have granted \nme the chance to stand on his shoulders and continue helping our \nbeloved country march forward.\n  Please join me in a heartfelt ``Thanks'' to not only a fellow South \nCarolinian but someone who deserves the title of ``Hero'' for his \nservice to our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/02/senate-section/article/S695-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING PRIVATE NATHAN WHITE, JR.\n\n Mr. SCOTT.

His mother gave her final \nblessing upon his graduation from Bonds-Wilson High School, and Nathan \nwent to training at Parris Island before being deployed to Vietnam.\n  Private White gave his life while saving a fellow Marine at the age \nof 19 years old. His influence continues today in the lives of his \nfamily members who have extended his love of serving our county. His \noldest nephew Alfred Green serves in Germany and his niece Lt.

Our unemployment rate is now lower than \nit was before the financial crisis. More of our kids are graduating \nthan ever before. More of our people are insured than ever before. We \nare as free from the grip of foreign oil as we've been in almost 30 \nyears. Thanks to the hard work, resilience, and determination of the \nAmerican people over the last six years, the shadow of crisis has \npassed.\n  With a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, and \nbooming energy production, we have risen from recession freer to write \nour own future than any other Nation on Earth. It's now up to us to \nchoose what kind of country we want to be over the next 15 years, and \nfor decades to come. Will we accept an economy where prosperity belongs \nto a few and opportunity remains out of reach for too many? Or will we \ncommit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and \nchances for everyone who makes the effort?\n  Over the last six years, we've seen that middle-class economic works. \nWe've reaffirmed one of our most fundamental values as Americans: that \nthis country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, does their \nfair share, and plays by the same set of rules.\n  The ideas I offer in this Budget are designed to bring middle-class \neconomic into the 21st Century. These proposals are practical, not \npartisan. They'll help working families feel more secure with paychecks \nthat go further, help American workers upgrade their skills, so they \ncan compete for higher-paying jobs, and help create the conditions for \nour businesses to keep generating good new jobs for our workers to \nfill. The Budget will do these things while fulfilling our most basic \nresponsibility to keep Americans safe. We will make these investments \nand end the harmful spending cuts known as sequestration, by cutting \ninefficient spending, and closing tax loopholes. We will also put our \nNation on a more sustainable fiscal path by achieving $1.8 trillion in \ndeficit reduction, primarily from reforms in health programs, our tax \ncode, and immigration.\n  First, middle-class economics means helping working families afford \nthe cornerstones of economic security: child care, college, health \ncare, a home, and retirement. We will help working families tackle the \nhigh costs of child care and make ends meet by tripling the maximum \nchild care credit for middle-class families with young children, \nincreasing it to up to $3,000 per child, expanding child care \nassistance to all eligible low-income families with children under four \nby the end of 10 years, and making preschool available to all four-\nyear-olds.\n  The Budget also provides middle-class families more flexibility at \nwork by encouraging States to develop paid family leave programs. \nToday, we're the only advanced country on Earth that doesn't guarantee \npaid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers. Forty-three \nmillion workers have no paid sick leave, which forces too many parents \nto make the gut-wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at \nhome. It's time to change that. For many families in today's economy, \nhaving both parents in the workforce isn't a luxury, it's an economic \nnecessity.\n\n  Second, middle-class economics means making sure more Americans have \nthe chance to learn the skills and education they need to keep earning \nhigher wages down the road. The Budget calls for new investments and \ninnovation that will expand preschool and invest in high-quality early \neducation for America's youngest learners, provide more help to \ndisadvantaged students and the schools that serve them, better prepare \nand support teachers, and transform our high schools so they help all \nstudents graduate prepared for college and career.\n  In a 21st Century economy that rewards knowledge more than ever, our \nefforts must reach higher than high school. By the end of this decade, \ntwo-thirds of job openings will require some higher education, and no \nAmerican should be priced out of the education they need. Over the \ncourse of my Administration, we have increased Pell Grants, and the \nBudget continues to ensure that they will keep pace with inflation over \ntime. The Budget also includes a bold new plan to bring down the cost \nof community college tuition for responsible students, to zero. Forty \npercent of college students attend community college; some to learn a \nparticular skill, others as a path to a four-year degree. It is time \nfor two years of college to become as free and universal in America as \nhigh school is today.\n  Even as we help give our students the chance to succeed, we also must \nwork together to give our workers the chance to retool. Last year, the \nCongress came together and passed important improvements to the \nNation's job training system with the bipartisan Workforce Innovation \nand Opportunity Act. To build on this progress, the proposals in this \nBudget support more in-person career counseling for unemployed workers \nand double the number of workers receiving training through the \nworkforce development system. My plan would also expand the successful \n``learn-as-you-earn'' approaches that our European counterparts use \nsuccessfully by investing in the expansion of registered \napprenticeships that allow workers to learn new skills while they are \nearning a paycheck. The Budget would also ensure that training leads to \nhigh-quality jobs by investing in projects that feature strong employer \npartnerships, include work-based learning, and develop new employer-\nvalidated credentials.\n  As we welcome home a new generation of returning heroes, the Budget \nmakes sure they have the chance to live the American Dream they helped \ndefend. It invests in the five pillars I have outlined to support our \nNation's\n\n[[Page S696]]\n\nveterans: providing the resources and funding they deserve; ensuring \nhigh-quality and timely health care; getting veterans their earned \nbenefits quickly and efficiently; ending veteran homelessness; and \nhelping veterans and their families get good jobs, education, and \naccess to affordable housing.\n  Third, middle-class economics means creating the kind of environment \nthat helps businesses start here, stay here, and hire here. We want to \nbuild on the growth we have seen in the manufacturing sector, where \nmore than 750,000 new jobs have been created over the last 58 months. \nTo create jobs, continue growth in the industry, and strengthen \nAmerica's leadership in advanced manufacturing technology, the Budget \nfunds a national network of 45 manufacturing institutes, building on \nthe nine already funded through 2015, As part of the manufacturing \ninitiative, the Budget also launches a Scale-Up Fund, funded through a \npublic-private partnership to help ensure that if a technology is \ninvented in the United States, it can be made in the United States. The \nBudget proposes an investment fund to help startup companies produce \nthe goods they have developed. Taken together, these investments will \nhelp ensure that America keeps making things the rest of the world \nwants to buy and will also help create manufacturing jobs for the \nfuture.\n  Our Nation thrives when we are leading the world with cutting-edge \ntechnology in manufacturing, infrastructure, clean energy, and other \ngrowing fields. That is why the Budget includes investments in cutting-\nedge advanced manufacturing research--to make sure we are leading the \nway in creating technology that supports our manufacturing sector; \nbiomedical research--like our BRAIN initiative, which studies the brain \nto offer new insight into diseases like Alzheimer's, and Precision \nMedicine, which can improve health outcomes and better treat diseases; \nor, agricultural research--looking at climate resilience and \nsustainability. These investments have the potential to create high-\nwage jobs, improve lives, and open the door to new industries, \nresulting in sustainable economic growth.\n  As our economy continues to grow, our Nation's businesses and workers \nalso need a stronger infrastructure that works in the new economy--\nmodern ports, stronger bridges, better roads, faster trains, and better \nbroadband. The Budget proposes to build a 21st Century infrastructure \nthat creates jobs for thousands of construction workers and engineers, \nconnects hardworking Americans to their jobs, and makes it easier for \nbusinesses to transport goods. The Budget would do more to repair and \nmodernize our existing roads and bridges, while expanding transit \nsystems to link communities and support workers.\n  These proposals will put more money in middle-class pockets, raise \nwages, and bring more high-paying jobs to America. To pay for them, the \nBudget will cut inefficient spending and close tax loopholes to make \nsure that everyone pays their fair share. The Budget closes loopholes \nthat punish businesses investing domestically and reward companies that \nkeep profits abroad, and uses some of the savings created to rebuild \nour aging infrastructure. The Budget closes loopholes that perpetuate \ninequality by allowing the top one percent of Americans to avoid paying \nany taxes on their accumulated wealth and uses that money to help more \nyoung people go to college. The Budget simplifies the system so that a \nsmall business owner can file based on her actual bank statement, \ninstead of the number of accountants she can afford. It is time for tax \nreform that at its core is about helping working families afford child \ncare and college, and plan for retirement, and above all, get a leg up \nin the new economy.\n  Of course, we cannot separate our work here at home from challenges \nbeyond our shores. By winding down the wars overseas and lowering war \nspending, we've strengthened our economy and shrunk our deficits. But \nwe still face threats to our security that we must address.\n  The Budget supports our efforts to degrade and ultimately destroy \nISIL. We are leading over 60 partners in a global effort that will take \ntime and steady resolve. As I made clear in my State of the Union \naddress, I am calling on the Congress to show the world that we are \nunited in this mission by passing a bill to authorize the use of force \nagainst ISIL.\n  The Budget supports our efforts to counter Russian pressure and \naggressive actions in concert with our European allies, by funding \nsupport for Ukraine's democracy and efforts to reassure our NATO \nallies.\n  We also must look beyond the issues that have consumed us in the past \nto shape the coming century. This Budget provides the resources we need \nto defend the Nation against cyber-attacks. No foreign nation, no \nhacker, should be able to shut down our networks, steal our trade \nsecrets, or invade the privacy of American families. In addition to \nincreasing funding to protect our Nation against cyber-attacks, I \ncontinue to urge the Congress to finally pass the legislation we need \nto meet this evolving threat.\n  The Budget invests in our efforts to confront the threat posed by \ninfectious diseases like Ebola--here at home, and internationally. It \nprovides resources to support the Global Health Security Agenda, \nincreases funding to eradicate polio and other global health \nchallenges, and creates a new Impact Fund for targeted global HIV/AIDS \nefforts. In addition, the Budget increases funding for domestic \npreparedness efforts to more effectively and efficiently respond to \npotential, future outbreaks here at home and dedicates funding for \nStates to develop HIV Plans to help them reach the goals of the \nNational HIV/AIDS Strategy.\n  The Budget also capitalizes on historic opportunities in Asia and the \nPacific--where we are modernizing alliances, opening new markets, and \nmaking sure that other nations play by the rules--in how they trade, \nresolve disputes, and do their part to confront the biggest challenges \nwe face.\n  No challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than \nclimate change. Fourteen of our planet's 15 warmest years on record \nhave all fallen in the first 15 years of this century. The world's best \nscientists are telling us that our activities are changing the climate, \nand if we do not act forcefully, we'll continue to see rising oceans, \nlonger, hotter heat waves, dangerous droughts and floods, and massive \ndisruptions that can trigger greater migration, conflict, and hunger \naround the globe. The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate \nrisks to our national security. And as discussed in the Budget, the \nsignificant costs to inaction on climate change hit the Federal \nGovernment's bottom-line directly, as worsening climate impacts create \nGovernment liabilities. That's why this Budget takes action on climate \nby supporting the Climate Action Plan that I released in 2013 with \ninvestments to accelerate carbon pollution reductions, to build on-the-\nground partnerships with local communities and help them put in place \nstrategies for greater resilience to climate change impacts, and to \nsupport America's leadership abroad on this important moral and fiscal \nissue.\n  Beyond these critical investments, the Budget also supports my \nManagement Agenda, which seeks to create a Government for the future \nthat is more efficient, effective, and supportive of economic growth. \nThe Budget includes initiatives to improve the service we provide to \nthe American public; to leverage the Federal Government's buying power \nto bring more value and efficiency to how we use taxpayer dollars; to \nopen Government data and research to the private sector to drive \ninnovation and economic growth; to promote smarter information \ntechnology; and, to attract and retain the best talent in the Federal \nworkforce. The Budget includes proposals to consolidate and reorganize \nGovernment agencies to make them leaner and more efficient, and it \nincreases the use of evidence and evaluation to ensure that taxpayer \ndollars are spent wisely on programs that work.\n  The Congress can also help grow the economy, reduce deficits, and \nstrengthen Social Security by passing comprehensive immigration reform. \nLast year, I took a series of executive actions to crack down on \nillegal immigration at the border; prioritize deporting felons, not \nfamilies; and allow certain undocumented immigrants who register and \npass criminal and national security background checks to start paying \ntheir fair share of taxes and stay in the United States without fear of \ndeportation. I also took action to\n\n[[Page S697]]\n\nstreamline the legal immigration system for talented STEM students, \nentrepreneurs, and business. These actions will raise average wages for \nall American workers and reduce the deficit. But this is only a first \nstep toward real reform, and as I have said before, the Congress should \nact on the more comprehensive reform that only changes in the law can \nprovide. Independent economists say immigration reform will grow our \neconomy and shrink our deficits by almost $1 trillion over 20 years. It \nis time to fix our broken system and help grow our economy by passing \ncomprehensive immigration reform.\n  The Budget also builds on the progress we have made ensuring that \nevery American has the peace of mind that comes with quality, \naffordable health insurance. The Affordable Care Act has helped to \nprovide millions more Americans get covered. It has forced insurance \ncompanies to play by the rules by prohibiting discrimination for pre-\nexisting conditions and eliminating lifetime insurance caps. It has \nalso helped to put our Nation on a more sustainable fiscal path by \nslowing the growth of health care costs. The Budget includes additional \nreforms and cost saving proposals to continue encouraging high-quality \nand efficient health care.\n  This Budget shows what we can do if we invest in America's future and \ncommit ourselves to an economy that rewards hard work, generates rising \nincomes, and allows everyone to share in the prosperity of a growing \nAmerica. It lays out a strategy to strengthen our middle class, and \nhelp America's hard-working families get ahead in a time of relentless \neconomic and technological change.\n  Fifteen years into this new century, and six years after the darkest \ndays of the financial crisis, we have picked ourselves up, dusted \nourselves off, and begun again the work of remaking America. We've laid \na new foundation. A brighter future is ours to write. This Budget will \nhelp us begin this new chapter together.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, February 2, 2015.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/02/senate-section/article/S697-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bills were read the first time:\n\n       S. 338.

the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. Grassley (for himself, Mr. Casey, Mr. Burr, Mr. Warner, \n        Mr. Roberts, and Mr. Cardin):\n  S. 335. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to improve \n529 plans; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am glad to be joined by Senator Casey \nof Pennsylvania in introducing bipartisan legislation to improve upon \nthe already immensely successful college 529 savings programs. Those \nare savings plans to go to college. The 529 plans have helped millions \nearn a college degree without piling up a mountain of debt. These plans \nhave long had strong bipartisan support, and I am glad the introduction \nof this bill today continues that tradition.\n  Given the bipartisan nature of 529 plans, it came as a shock to me, \nand I am sure to most of my colleagues, when the President put forth a \nproposal that would undermine years of hard work toward making savings \nfor college as accessible as it is today. College savings vehicles, we \nnow know by the Tax Code section--that is where section 529 comes \nfrom--were first started by States in the late 1980s. However, it was \nonly after a bipartisan effort led by then-Senator Bob Graham of \nFlorida and Senator McConnell,\n\n[[Page S699]]\n\nnow our majority leader, in 1996 that these savings plans were finally \nenshrined in section 529 of the Tax Code.\n  By recognizing college savings plans in the Tax Code, States and \nparticipants could now be certain about the favorable tax treatment \nthey would receive and thus the plans flourished. During this time, \nindividuals' parents and grandparents were able to contribute to \nsavings plans with certainty that the college savings for themselves \nand their loved ones would accumulate tax free. However, while 529 \nplans could accumulate interest tax free, tax was still owed once money \nwas distributed to pay for college.\n  So in 2001, as chairman of the Finance Committee, I worked with \nSenator Baucus of Montana and others to advance a proposal to further \nenhance college savings by excluding distributions from 529 plans from \nincome tax so long as the money was used to pay for college education \ncosts. We were then successful in making this provision permanent in \nthe tax law as part of the Pension Protection Act of 2006.\n  This change helped 529 plans take off to even new heights. From 2001 \nto 2002 assets in these plans doubled from $13 billion to $26 billion \nand totalled nearly $245 billion by July last year. The total number of \naccounts also nearly doubled. The number of accounts increased from 2.4 \nmillion in 2001 to 4.4 million in 2002 and increased to nearly 12 \nmillion by July of last year.\n  The misguided proposal put forth in the President's State of the \nUnion Address has a potential to reverse these gains by once again \nsubjecting distributions to tax. The policy rationale given by the \nPresident was that too much of the benefit for 529 plans went to more \naffluent households and individuals. I believe a big reason the \nPresident's proposal was met with bipartisan disapproval is that we all \nknow firsthand through communications with our constituents back home \nthat the typical family with a 529 account is one with only modest \nmeans. We hear about how they have scrimped and pinched pennies so they \ncould put money away for their child's college. They have a dream of \nsending their child to college and graduating without a crushing amount \nof debt holding them back as they start their new career post-college.\n  Data from the College Savings Plans Network backs up this anecdotal \nevidence that we receive at the grassroots from our constituents. On a \nnational basis the average account balance is under $21,000 and for \nIowans the average balance is slightly lower than $17,878. This is \nobviously hard evidence that a typical family contributing to a 529 \naccount is far from being part of the wealthy elite the President wants \nus to believe they are.\n\n  A private study commissioned by the College Savings Foundation \nfurther demonstrates that these accounts are largely held by middle-\nclass families. According to this study, about 10 percent of 529 \naccounts are owned by households with income below $50,000, over 70 \npercent are owned by households with income below $150,000, and almost \n95 percent of 529 accounts are in households with incomes below \n$250,000.\n  The bill I introduced today with Democratic Senator Casey will help \nbuild on the success that has so far been achieved by increasing the \nattractiveness of 529 plans.\n  This bill has three primary provisions:\n  The first provision recognizes the reality that in today's world a \ncomputer is just as much a necessary educational tool--and the expense \nassociated with it--as a required class textbook. As such, this bill \nallows 529 funds to purchase a computer on the same tax payroll basis \nas other required materials.\n  The second provision eliminates an outdated and unnecessary \naggregation rule that increases paperwork and costs for plan \nadministrators.\n  The final provision provides tax and penalty relief in instances \nwhere a student may have to withdraw from school for illness or other \nreasons. Under current law, any refunds from the college are subject to \nimmediate taxation and a 10-percent tax penalty. This provision \neliminates this tax and penalty if the refund is redeposited in a 529 \naccount. This permits a family to set the refund aside to pay for the \nstudent's education should that student be able to return to college or \nto use it for another family member.\n  The reforms in 529 plans included in Senator Casey's and my bill are \nvery modest but will help keep administrative costs low and provide a \nlittle extra incentive for parents to put money away for their child's \neducation. The bill further demonstrates a renewed bipartisan \ncommitment to 529 plans that will hopefully help erase concerns some \nmay have in contributing to 529s given the President's misguided \nproposal.\n  I hope Congress will act on this legislation and speak with a loud \nbipartisan voice on its commitment to college savings.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 337.

Mr. President, I am proud to once again join with Senator \nCornyn to introduce the FOIA Improvement Act, a bipartisan bill that \nwill make our Federal government more accountable to all Americans by \nstrengthening the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA.\n  Senator Cornyn and I introduced an almost identical bill last year, \nand despite it passing the Senate unanimously, the House failed to act. \nThis was deeply disappointing, and was a missed opportunity for \nCongress. But Senator Cornyn and I have worked together for more than a \ndecade to make our government more open, through Democratic and \nRepublican administrations and Republican and Democratic-led \nCongresses. We have a strong partnership, and we will not quit. We are \ndetermined to make progress on creating a more open and transparent \ngovernment for all Americans.\n  The FOIA Improvement Act of 2015 codifies what President Obama laid \nout in his historic 2009 memorandum by requiring Federal agencies to \nadopt a ``Presumption of Openness'' when considering the release of \ngovernment information under FOIA. Under this bill, when considering \nFOIA requests Federal agencies must find a reasonable foreseeable harm \nin order to invoke a discretionary exemption and withhold information \nfrom the public. The government should always err on the side of \ndisclosure. Our legislation also provides additional independence to \nthe Office of Government Information Services, OGIS, an office created \nby the Leahy-Cornyn OPEN Government Act in 2007 that helps mediate \ndisputes between the Federal Government and FOIA requesters. Finally, \nour legislation will limit the use of Exemption 5 by placing a 25 year \nlimitation on information covered by the exemption.\n  I have fought for years to make our government more open and \ntransparent. Senator Cornyn has been an important partner in these \nefforts, and our collaboration has resulted in the enactment of several \nimprovements to FOIA including the OPEN Government Act, the first major \nreform to FOIA in more than a decade; the OPEN FOIA Act, which \nincreased the transparency of legislative exemptions to FOIA; and the \nFaster FOIA Act, which responded to the concerns of FOIA requestors and \naddressed agency delays in processing requests.\n  After four decades in the Senate, I appreciate that legislating \nrequires compromise. The FOIA Improvement Act of 2015 reflects the \ninput of both sides of the aisle, the open government community, the \nadministration, and many other stakeholders. It is the product of \nnearly a year of careful negotiations on behalf of Senator Cornyn and \nme. It is supported by more than 70 public interest groups that \nadvocate for government transparency and it had the unanimous support \nof the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate last year. Above all, it \nmarks an historic step forward in our continued effort to open the \ngovernment by codifying what President Obama set out to achieve in 2009 \nwhen he said ``In the face of doubt, openness prevails.''

Mr. President, tomorrow we will vote on whether to \nproceed to the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill, \nwhich fully funds the Department of Homeland Security and includes the \nlaw enforcement priorities that were agreed to on a bipartisan basis in \nthe House. It is indeed a clean bill. The House of Representatives has \nvoted to fund fully homeland security, as the President has requested.\n  Now, it is not a perfect bill. Republicans and Democrats and \nindividuals on both sides have different priorities on some matters, \nbut they did come to an agreement to fund all of the programs of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and on how much they were funded--\nactivities and actions that are authorized, however, by the laws of the \nUnited States.\n  So this bill will not deny a penny of funding. In fact, it says: Mr. \nPresident, spend the money on enforcing and following the law. Spend \nthe money on enforcing the Immigration and Nationality Act as passed by \nCongress--that is the law of the United States of America. Spend the \nmoney to let our law enforcement officers carry out their duties as \nprescribed by the laws.\n  Yet our Democratic colleagues say they are going to block this bill--\nthat they will all stick together and not even let it come to the floor \nof the Senate. Why? Why would they do that? Because, they say, they \nwant to give the President the funds, apparently, to spend on his \nunconstitutional and unlawful Executive amnesty. They will not allow \nthe bill to even be voted on, and without a vote in the Senate, the \nfunding for Homeland Security does not go forward. They are not going \nto allow it to be voted on because they want to protect the President \nin his assertion of an unconstitutional and illegal power to order \nduly-constituted enforcement officers of the U.S. Department of \nHomeland Security to carry out unlawful activity.\n  The President is not entitled to spend taxpayer dollars to implement \na system of immigration that Congress--representing the American \npeople's wishes, let me add--rejected just last year. Surely our \nDemocratic colleagues will not block the Senate from proceeding to this \nbill to fund the Department of Homeland Security. If they are unhappy \nwith the language of the bill of the House of Representatives, if they \nthink the President wrongfully or rightfully, using legitimate powers, \ncould direct them to provide Social Security numbers, Medicare \nparticipation, earned income tax credit money from the Federal \nGovernment and the right to work in the United States when the law says \nthey are not entitled to be employed in the United States, then they \ncan offer an amendment to the bill and bring it up on the floor of the \nSenate to strike that language if they think it is so bad.\n  Of course, if you think about it, that would be a stunning event; \nwould it not be--the Senate taking language from a bill or striking \nlanguage from a bill that restores the separation of powers as properly \nunderstood by the Framers and preventing the President from violating \nlaw and the constitution. They are going to vote against that? Maybe \nthat is why they choose not to have this bill go forward. Maybe they do \nnot want to confront the issue.\n  I am going to quote Senator Reid in a moment because he said we ought \nto confront the issue square-on. All right, let's do so. I suspect \nSenator Reid, though, and his team are not so interested in having \nvotes and being held accountable for their votes.\n  Our colleagues would have the right to offer amendments. Senator \nMcConnell is allowing amendments. He is going out of his way to allow \namendments and changing the terrible state the Senate had found itself \nin under the leadership of Senator Reid. Consistent with the rules of \nthe Senate, those amendments can be brought up, and a motion to strike \nthis language is certainly appropriate.\n  It is an untenable position--untenable constitutionally, untenable \nbecause it is contrary to the will of the Members of the House and \nSenate who oppose the President's action--Republicans and Democrats. \nPerhaps most importantly, it is untenable politically because the \nAmerican people strongly reject it. So why would any Senator--Democrat \nor Republican--when the very integrity of the Congress is under assault \nby an overreaching executive branch, not want to assert congressional \nauthority at this point?\n  We are coequal branches of government, and the President does not \nhave the authority to enforce a law that was never passed--indeed, a \nlaw that was explicitly rejected by the Congress of the United States--\nand grant amnesty to people who are unlawfully here, provide them work \nauthorizations, a photo ID allowing them to apply for any job in \nAmerica, with Social Security numbers and the right to participate in \nSocial Security and Medicare. That is what the President's actions are \ngoing to do.\n  This is not prosecutorial discretion--nowhere close to prosecutorial \ndiscretion. It is an Executive fiat. It is an imperial act. As the \nPresident himself said repeatedly: I am not a king; I am not an \nemperor. When dealing with this very issue, he told people over a \nperiod of years--20 times--that he did not have the power to do this. \nBut then he changed his mind. Under pressure from certain political \ninterest groups and because he couldn't get Congress to vote for the \nbill he wanted, he just decided to do it on his own.\n  This is an unthinkable overreach. It is a matter of great national \nimportance. The American people were engaged in this. They were \nfollowing this issue. The President couldn't get the constitutional \nprocess to give him the power he wanted, so he just did it anyway.\n  Why can't it be stopped? I get asked that. What is the matter with \nyou people in Congress?\n  Well, we had seven Members on the Democratic side of the aisle, still \nin this Senate today, who said the President overreached. They said he \nshouldn't have done this, and it should have been done by the \nlegislature, by the Congress, not by the President. Yet are all seven \nof them going to vote with Senator Reid and become part of\n\n[[Page S704]]\n\nthe palace guard that protects the President in his unlawful act so the \nPresident can't be challenged?\n  That is what it amounts to. There is no doubt about it. That is \nprecisely what it amounts to--a palace guard circling around the White \nHouse to protect the President, even though Members of this Senate have \nsaid he overreached and what he did was wrong. They are, apparently, \ngoing to continue to vote for it. Out of what--party loyalty? Out of \nloyalty to Senator Reid, the minority leader in the Senate?\n  Well, they say--and the media even is saying sometimes--Democrats and \nothers are sometimes saying that the bill contains controversial new \nimmigration riders, and therefore, it ought to be blocked. It contains \nunconstitutional or controversial new immigration riders, and that is \nbad. That is why it ought to be blocked.\n  What new policy is in the bill? What new expenditure is in the bill \nthat is not consistent with the laws of the United States? Not one. The \nbill passed by the House carries out the essential functions in the \nnormal orderly way of Homeland Security. It doesn't add any pork, and \nit doesn't add any special expenditures for some controversial project. \nIt doesn't do any of that.\n  So if the President says that he will deploy his Border Patrol \nofficers--no longer at the Mexican border where we have large flows of \nillegal labor--to Montana or Maine, where we have very few people, in \neffect, he is saying we are no longer going to enforce the border there \nor even attempt to, and he is going to reassign them. He is saying: I \nam the President. They work for me. I can do such things.\n  Well, would it be a controversial rider for the Senate, or for the \nHouse of Representatives, to say no, we prohibit funds to do that? We \nare going to fund the officers' duty at the border with our Mexican \nneighbors where they need to be.\n  The point is who is creating the controversy--not the House of \nRepresentatives. It is the President of the United States. He has \noverreached, without any doubt, and the situation is very grave.\n  What if the next President of the United States decides to do \nsomething else? Senator Cruz, at the hearing for the Attorney General \nnominee, Ms. Lynch, asked her: What if Mr. Cornyn--whom he was sitting \nby, at the time, the Senator from Texas--were President and he didn't \nlike certain labor laws that applied to people in Texas and he told his \nbureaucrats--who in effect work for the President of the United \nStates--don't enforce labor laws in Texas?\n  So Senator Cruz asked the nominee, Loretta Lynch, who wants to be \nAttorney General of the United States of America, whether under \nPresident Obama's Executive amnesty theory, the next President could do \nthat and bar the enforcement of labor laws in the State of Texas. She \nsaid she would have to review it. She wasn't sure. Of course that is \nblatantly unconstitutional. It shouldn't have taken her 5 seconds to \nsay of course a President can't do that. Have we gotten such a confused \nunderstanding of law in America that we are at that point that \nuniversal laws of labor are subject to the whim of a President of the \nUnited States, and even the Attorney General will not say it is wrong \nand even the Congress will not say no to the President on this?\n  Well, the House did say no. They passed a perfectly responsible \nfunding bill for Homeland Security. They said: We are not going to \nallow you to spend money to advocate a policy which we have rejected--\nwhich they can do just that way: We don't like this action. We are not \ngoing to fund this action. The Executive of this country--the \nPresident--cannot act on it if he is prevented from spending money on \nit. It goes to the very core of the legislative process. It is what the \nAmerican Revolution was about. It is what happened in England. They \nwrested this power from the King, and we adopted it in terms of the \nPresident and put the power in Congress. They had the power in \nParliament. It is a big deal.\n  I don't think we are at a point where we need to back down on this. \nIt is not an overreach. Those great leaders, some at Homeland Security, \nso confident in their wisdom and policy ideas, having forgotten what \nthe rule of law is, suggest that Congress should just roll over and \nforget it and go on and let it happen and not be controversial by \nstanding up to it.\n  Now, look. I like Senator Reid. We battle a lot. He is pugnacious, as \nthis Politico article said, but I can live with that. I am glad he is \nback and I hope he is doing better and I hope he recovers fully, and I \nam confident he will. A Politico article by Mr. Burgess Everett earlier \ntoday quoted Senator Reid as saying:\n\n       Why should we be dealing with issues that have nothing to \n     do with homeland security?\n\n  Nothing to do with homeland security, Senator Reid said.\n\n       If my Republican colleagues have some problems with \n     something the President has done on immigration, for example, \n     hit it head on. Don't hide it in homeland security.\n\n  Well, the problem is Homeland Security. The President has directed \nthe officials of Homeland Security to take money that has been \nauthorized and appropriated for them to enforce the immigration laws of \nthis country and to use those funds to carry out a scheme Congress has \nrejected.\n  Under the laws of the United States it is illegal to hire somebody \nunlawfully in the country. There is no doubt about that. People \nunlawfully in the country are not entitled to participate in Social \nSecurity or Medicare. How could it be otherwise?\n  So he told the Homeland Security officials to create a new office, a \nnew building across the river in Crystal City. He directed them to hire \n1,000 new employees to process applications under his Executive \namnesty, a policy Congress rejected. It is breathtaking. It is going to \ncost tens of millions of dollars just for that one office. That just \nbegins to suggest how much money will have to be spent to execute his \nvision for immigration that the American people rejected.\n  So how do we deal with it directly? How do we hit it on the head \nopenly and directly? The Congress has the power of the purse. No money \ncan be spent by this President that Congress hasn't authorized.\n  So the House discussed this. They went into some detail about it, \nworked at it for some time, and the House decided they would not fund \nthis action that contradicted laws they passed and execute a policy \nthey didn't agree with. I think that is confronting it head on--no \ndoubt about that--and it absolutely deals with homeland security. My \ngoodness. So this is the kind of logic and weak arguments that are \nbeing put forth here.\n  We will talk about a lot of things as we go forward with this debate \nthat evidences the bankruptcy of the policies carried out by this \nadministration.\n  One of the things that came out today as part of the President's \nbudget was his assumption that if his immigration policies are passed, \nwe would save lots of money for the U.S. Treasury. Why would it save \nmoney? It would save money because we would collect more Social \nSecurity benefits, and this would create more revenue for the \ngovernment and put us in a sound position to help balance the budget.\n  We are not going to balance the budget. We are not going to come \nclose to it, but he said a substantial amount of money would come from \nit.\n  Colleagues, we have to understand what a misrepresentation of \ncolossal enormity is at stake in that statement. Everybody knows Social \nSecurity and Medicare are on unsustainable financial courses. Anybody \nwho knows anything about Medicare and Social Security knows the \nfundamental problem is people are not putting in enough money to take \ncare of those who retire, and so the flow is not enough. Over time it \nis going to get worse. We are just now beginning to go into deficit for \nSocial Security. The disability portion is in critical shape. It is in \nvery bad shape, but what this calculation is based on is the next 10 \nyears.\n  So it says we will have more income in the next 10 years, and that \nmay be so. But every person who goes on Social Security today--and even \nmore so in the future--are, under law, projected to take out more than \nthey put in plus interest. So obviously add 5 million new people to the \nSocial Security rolls and no change in the amount of money that they \npay in, they make the long-term strength of Social Security even more \nweak. It makes the hole even deeper that we have to dig our way out of. \nThere is no other way to analyze it.\n\n[[Page S705]]\n\nIt is just unbelievable to me that they would make such a statement.\n  Those of us in the Congress need to be thinking about the long-term \nfinancial course of America. We need to be trying to put not just \nshort-term benefits here so Congress can spend more money, but also we \nneed to be thinking about how to place this country on a sound long-\nterm path. Adding more people to Social Security--particularly lower \nincome people as most of these are, who will draw out even more than \nthe higher income people draw out as a percentage on the basis of what \nthey paid in--is not a way to save Social Security.\n  In a December 1, 2014 article in Investor's Business Daily entitled, \n``Obama's Amnesty will create a Fiscal Nightmare for Entitlements,'' \nMerrill Matthews, resident scholar at the Institute for Policy \nInnovation, and Mark E. Litow, retired actuary and past chairman of the \nSocial Insurance Public Finance Section of the Society of Actuaries, \nwrote this:\n\n       Obama's amnesty action greatly exacerbates the problem, \n     because retirees get back far more than they pay in.\n\n  That is as plain and as simple as daylight following dark. They go on \nto write:\n\n       But millions of Obama's newly legalized are working-age \n     adults with children, so many could be in their 40s or older.\n       Thus, they could pay FICA taxes for the next, say, 15 or 20 \n     years--less than the average American worker--and be eligible \n     for the full array of Social Security and Medicare benefits.\n\n  This is going to be devastating to Social Security and Medicare. It \nis going to hammer those programs. It is going to make it harder for us \nto save them, which we have an obligation to do. There is no obligation \nto give Social Security and Medicare to persons who enter the United \nStates unlawfully. People aren't entitled to come into the country \nunlawfully and demand the benefits of the country. The first thing we \nshould do to confront unlawful immigration is not to subsidize it with \ntaxpayer money.\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       Using a basic simulation model, we believe the government \n     will receive about $500 billion in payroll tax revenue \n     (including Part B and drug premiums) and expect it to pay out \n     some $2 trillion in benefits over several decades.\n\n  So they pay in $500 billion, but we are going to pay out $2 \ntrillion--four times as much. How does this make America more \nfinancially stable?\n  On December 4 of last year, in an article in the Atlantic magazine \nentitled ``The Cost of Amnesty,'' senior editor David Frum wrote this:\n\n       In the 2011 tax year, the average EITC payment to a family \n     with children was $2,905, according to the Center for Budget \n     and Policy Priorities. The Additional Child Tax Credit works \n     in much the same way, paying an average of $1,800 to \n     qualifying households.\n\n  Earned-income tax credit--that sounds like some sort of deduction you \nmight have, but it is not. So many of the persons who will be given \nthis legal status will be eligible for the earned-income tax credit \nbecause they have a family--presumably--that is what the President \ntells us; these are for families--and their income is at a rate that \nentitles them to draw earned-income tax credit.\n  But go to the budget of the United States of America and how the \nCongressional Budget Office calculates this--they don't calculate \nearned-income tax credit as some sort of tax deduction. They calculate \nit as an expenditure of the United States of America, and it absolutely \nis.\n  The way it works is your income is so low you have a family of such \nthat you don't owe any income tax, and they send you a credit and they \ncall it an earned-income tax credit, and a tax credit is a cash payment \nto you. It looks something like a tax matter, but it is really a direct \ncheck from the United States of America to lower-income families. So \nthis is going to be qualifying for large numbers of people that will be \ngiven a legal status.\n\n  Citing the Center for Immigration Studies, Mr. Frum in the Atlantic \narticle explains:\n\n       About 14.5 percent of the native-born population of the \n     United States earns little enough to qualify for the EITC. \n     Almost twice as great a portion of the total immigrant \n     population, 29.7 percent, qualifies. But the specific \n     immigrant groups most likely to benefit from the President's \n     actions earned even less.\n\n  So you have, on a percentage basis, twice as many in the immigrant \npopulation eligible for EITC as the average native-born American would \nbe to qualify to receive that check from the United States.\n  Mr. Frum goes on to say, ``The EITC will cost a shade over $70 \nbillion in fiscal year 2015.''\n  That is a lot of money--$70 billion. A Federal highway bill is $40 \nbillion, moving up to $50 billion. This is $70 billion.\n\n       The refundable portion of the child tax credit will cost \n     about $33 billion. That's $100 billion in total. Together, \n     they cost 10 times as much as traditional cash welfare. Soon \n     they will cost much, much more.\n\n  He goes on to note:\n\n       Quaintly enough, U.S. immigration law still forbids the \n     president to grant residency to aliens likely to become ``a \n     public charge.'' The list of exceptions, however, overwhelms \n     the rule. Here are the benefits that are ``not intended for \n     income maintenance'' and therefore exempt, according to the \n     Citizenship and Immigration Services. . . .\n\n  And they list a whole lot of taxes.\n  Well, I just want to wrap up by saying the House of Representatives \ncan do time and order, pass the bill that fully funds the United \nStates, and it does not contain riders and it does not contain pork \nspending. Well, maybe it contains it, but it is not being complained \nabout at this time, and it is before the Senate. To fund the Department \nof Homeland Security the Senate has to pass the same bill with the same \nexpenditures to do so. So all we have to do is fund the Department of \nHomeland Security but not approve the President's desire to transmit \nfunds in Homeland Security to an illegal, unlawful policy of amnesty \nthat Congress opposes and the American people oppose. Who do we \nrepresent?\n  Since 2009, we learned today, the Obama administration issued 5.5 \nmillion extra work permits--double the normal expected flow by over \nalmost a million a year. We understood it to be 700,000. Now we \nunderstand there are so many more that have not been calculated in the \nnumbers. His Executive amnesty will issue 5 million more.\n  Since 2009 family incomes are down $4,000. There is no doubt about \nit, colleagues, that this incredibly large flow of immigrants into \nAmerica exceeds the ability of the American economy to absorb them. It \nis pulling down wages. It is moving people out of the workplace. It is \nmaking it very difficult for lawful immigrants to get jobs in America \nbecause there will always be a new group coming in willing to work for \nless. It is eroding the middle class and middle-class values.\n  So we are going to talk about this as we go forward. I believe this \ncountry will continue to be a nation that allows immigration. We don't \ndislike or hate or demean people that want to come to America and work \nhere. But we need to send a clear message: If you are not coming \nlawfully, don't come. And if you come unlawfully, you are not going to \nbe given amnesty. You are not going to be given Social Security, \nMedicare, earned income tax credits, and the right to go to any \nhospital in America and demand health care. We are just not going to do \nthat.\n  If we do that with clarity, colleagues, what will happen? The people \nwho are coming here unlawfully will stop coming. The numbers will fall \ndramatically, and we will be in a position, then, to reestablish a \nlawful system of immigration that the American people have pleaded with \nus to establish--one that we can be proud of, that is just and fair \nwhere people apply and wait their turn and are accepted or not accepted \nbased on the merits. If we do that, we will have served the American \npeople with what they have asked us to do.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/02/senate-section/article/S705-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
