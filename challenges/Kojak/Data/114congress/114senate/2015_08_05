Mr. President, as the administration's agreement with \nIran comes under greater scrutiny, there is growing bipartisan concern. \nIt is widespread, and it is well founded. The leading House Democrat on \nthe Foreign Affairs Committee recently said the deal ``troubled'' him \nbecause ``it doesn't prevent Iran from having a nuclear weapon, it just \npostpones it.''\n  Yesterday another House Democrat said the deal lacks ``sufficient \nsafeguards'' and ``could lead to a dangerous regional weapons race.'' \nShe warned that the agreement would leave the international community \nwith limited options to prevent Iran's nuclear breakout.\n  These are strong words, and they are from congressional Democrats who \nare otherwise supportive of the President. It is clear that this deal \nis making Members of both parties uneasy--and with good reason.\n  America's role in the world, its commitment to global allies, and the \nkind of future we will leave our children are all tied up in this \nissue. That is why I have called for a debate worthy of the importance \nof the agreement when the Senate takes it up in September.\n  I hope the President will echo this tone of seriousness in his \nremarks later today. I hope he will avoid tired, obviously untrue \ntalking points about this being some choice between a bad deal and war. \nOf course it isn't. He knows it isn't. He himself has said that no deal \nis better than a bad deal.\n  There is also no need to insult the man who negotiated this agreement \nand the man who stood by his side when he announced it by falsely \nconflating debates from more than a decade ago with the unique and \nconsequential realities of today.\n  Now is a time to aim higher. Now is a time to dig deeper. What I am \nasking is for President Obama to join us in rising to the moment.\n  Senators and the American people are being asked to weigh the \nconsequences of what it would mean to allow Iran to become a nuclear-\nthreshold state with the power to dominate its neighbors, spread its \ninfluence, and threaten our allies. This is a serious decision to make \nwith serious consequences for our country. America deserves a debate \nworthy of it.\n  I imagine the many Democrats with serious reservations about this \ndeal feel the very same way. Nearly every Member of both parties voted \nto have this debate when they passed the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review \nAct this spring. Given the widespread bipartisan concern about this \ndeal, it is clear that a serious and proper debate, followed by a vote \non the agreement, is now just exactly what our country needs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/05/senate-section/article/S6327-6", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6327-S6328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CYBER SECURITY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, a cyber attack can feel like a very \npersonal attack on your privacy. A criminal with your medical records, \nyour credit cards, and your Social Security number; a stranger with \nemails from your boss, texts to your friends, and pictures of your \nkids--it is personally violating, financially crippling, and it\n\n[[Page S6328]]\n\ncan be just plain creepy. But with effective cyber security \nlegislation, we can help protect America's privacy.\n  It seems the White House agrees too. We were glad to see such a \nstrong statement of support yesterday for the strong bipartisan and \ntransparent cyber security bill before the Senate. The President's \nspokesman said ``the Senate should take up this bill as soon as \npossible and pass it.'' That is what the President's spokesman said \njust yesterday about the bill that is currently on the floor. It is \neasy to see why. This bipartisan legislation would help the public and \nprivate sectors protect America's most private and personal information \nby defeating cyber attacks.\n  It contains important measures to protect ``individual privacy and \ncivil liberties,'' as the top Democrat on the issue put it. It has been \nscrutinized and supported overwhelmingly--14 to 1--by both parties in \nthe Intelligence Committee.\n  Our colleagues said they would be happy to consider the bill in a \ntimely fashion--a couple of days ``at the most'' is what the Democratic \nleader told us--if allowed to offer some amendments. That seemed \nreasonable enough to me. That is why I offered a fair proposal \nyesterday that would have ensured at least 10 relevant amendments to be \npending and debated for each party. That is actually more than what \nDemocrats have been asking for. So I think everyone was a little taken \naback when they chose to block the proposal anyway.\n  I am still determined to see if we can find a way forward on this \nbipartisan bill. Republicans support it, Democrats support it, and \nPresident Obama supports it. I am asking colleagues to join me to open \ndebate on it today. With a little cooperation, we can pass a strong \nbipartisan cyber security bill this week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/05/senate-section/article/S6328-1", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO RUSS THOMASSON\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Now, Mr. President, on one final matter, I know my \nfriend from Texas will have some words to say about the man who has \nbeen helping him run the whip operation so effectively the last few \nyears, and I know Senator Cornyn won't mind if I share a few thoughts \nfirst.\n  Russ Thomasson is preparing to bid farewell to the Senate after many \nyears in the trenches. He is one of the most approachable and good-\nhumored staffers around here. He is also incredibly effective.\n  This former intelligence officer always has his ear to the ground. \nWhen he takes the pulse of the Senate, it is with uncommon precision.\n  Russ loves a good nail-biter too. And in a more open, more \nfreewheeling, and, by definition, more unpredictable Senate, you are \ninevitably going to have a few of those as well. What is important is \nthat with Russ's help, we almost always seem to push through. Russ has \nall of the qualities you would look for in a highly successful member \nof our leadership team--always willing to take on the difficult but \nnecessary tasks, unafraid to offer his candid advice, working each vote \nuntil the gavel falls, and defined by loyalty and integrity. This is \nsomeone whose judgment I value greatly.\n  I am glad Russ's son Austin got to see him in action. He has had a \nfront-row seat as a page here in the Senate. We hope Austin will be \nseeing more of his dad soon, the same with his sister Sasha and Russ's \nwife Cindy.\n  Thank you, Russ, for your service to the Senate. You have been an \ninvaluable member of our team, and you will be truly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/05/senate-section/article/S6328-2", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Iran accord is the result of many years \nof hard work by lots of people. Congressional committees are conducting \nhearings to listen to the administration's case and others. For \nexample, this evening at 5 p.m., we will have an all-Senators \nclassified briefing. At that meeting, we will hear from Dr. Moniz, the \nSecretary of Energy, a man imminently qualified as a scientist--an MIT \nphysics professor who is world famous for his scientific prowess--and \nWendy Sherman, one of America's truly great diplomats during the last \n20 years.\n  We have yet to see the language of the legislative response to the \naccord that has been negotiated. I know that Senator Corker and Senator \nCardin are working on that, but it is not out yet. It is incumbent on \nCongress to review this agreement with the thoughtful, level-headed \nprocess that an agreement of this magnitude deserves.\n  Let's hopefully remember that we all agree, and now the world agrees, \nthat a nuclear-armed Iran is unacceptable and a threat to our national \nsecurity, the safety of Israel, and the stability of the Middle \nEast. Like many Senators, I am continuing to consider this matter. I am \nlooking forward to the briefing tonight. It is altogether appropriate \nfor Senators to consider this deliberately and with the understanding \nthat this is very important. I admire those Senators on both sides who \nhave come to a conclusion on how they feel about this. A number of us \nhave not and are looking for more information to better understand this \nvery important time in the history of the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/05/senate-section/article/S6328-4", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6328-S6329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FUNDING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on another matter, unless Congress acts, \nthere will be a government shutdown on October 1. That is a short time \naway--less than 2 months. Every day that passes we are another day \ncloser to the crisis of an unfunded Federal government.\n  For months we have been warning Republican leaders that there is a \nneed to find a solution to these budget problems. We have offered to \nmeet with them. We have urged them to negotiate. The answer is always \nno answer.\n  The Republican leader knows he must negotiate. Here is what he said \nyesterday: ``Different parties control the Congress from control the \nWhite House, and at some point, we'll negotiate the way forward.'' I am \nsure that didn't come out exactly the way he wanted, but I think I get \nthe picture. He believes we have two Houses of Congress that are \ndifferent from the White House. I am quite certain that is what he \nmeant to say.\n  Regardless, the question remains: Why does the Republican leader \ncontinue to decline our invitation to sit down and craft a bipartisan \nsolution and do it now? Why does he continue to tell us no? This should \nnot come as a surprise, however, because Republicans are in the habit \nof governing by manufactured crisis. We have seen that over the past 7 \nmonths.\n  Their obvious distaste--some say hatred--of government generally is \nso deep that many take pleasure in closing it. We hear that from the \nstatements that have been made over the last few days. That could \nexplain why they keep fighting to not move forward on negotiations and \nfinding excuses to simply close the government. Lately it has been \nwomen's health. They are going to close the government because they \ndon't like the way women are getting their health care.\n  In the 1990s Republicans shut the government to force cuts in \nMedicare. In 2013 they shut the government to force repeal of the \nAffordable Care Act. It is clear that both of those times were total \nfailures.\n  Earlier this year Republicans came within hours of shutting down the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. That is the agency which is tasked \nwith keeping our homeland safe. They came within hours of closing down \nthe whole Department.\n  There is always a new reason--some grievance from the partisans at \nFOX News, some complaint from whiners on talk radio, some attack from \nradicals in the tea party. It makes one wonder: What will be next? Will \nthe Republicans again use shutdown extortion to try to repeal ObamaCare \nor to attack immigrants or to cut Social Security or to privatize \nMedicare?\n  As I just said, there is a new one. They are targeting the health of \nwomen in America. Could it be any more obvious that the Republican \nParty doesn't care about the health of women? That is obvious from the \nstatements that have been made. The legislation before this body says \nmoney that goes to this organization which they dislike--other agencies \nwill take\n\n[[Page S6329]]\n\ncare of it. Well, we have learned that in Texas alone, hundreds of \nthousands of people simply wouldn't be able to have the care they need. \nYesterday Jeb Bush went so far as to say this, a direct quote: ``I'm \nnot sure we need half a billion dollars for women's health issues.''\n  Unfortunately, the attack on women's health is only one example of \nthe many legislative riders Republicans are pursuing. This isn't just \ntalk; they have actually done it in the various bills that have come \nout of the House in the appropriations process and over here by the \nRepublicans. These partisan riders have nothing to do with funding the \ngovernment and everything to do with ideology and special interests.\n  For example, there is a legislative rider to block implementation of \nthe Affordable Care Act, which would deny health coverage to millions \nof Americans--that, after almost threescore different attempts to \nrepeal ObamaCare. Each of them turned out the same: They were defeated \noverwhelmingly.\n  There is a legislative rider on behalf of Wall Street to protect \ninstitutions that are too big to fail, making taxpayers more vulnerable \nto future bailouts.\n  There is a legislative rider to undermine the President's work to \naddress the dangers of climate change. And the dangers of climate \nchange exist. Spread across all the news today is the fact that the \nForest Service is going to be spending 75 percent of its money fighting \nfires in the future. There will be no money left for anything other \nthan fighting fires.\n  There is a fire going on in California now. It is 15 or 20 percent \ncontained. There are 7,000 or 8,000 firefighters trying to stop that \nfire from spreading even more. That is only one of the many fires \nburning as we speak.\n  There is a legislative rider in their legislation attacking \nimmigrants by undermining President Obama's recent Executive actions.\n  There is a legislative rider to block the Federal Communications \nCommission from implementing its recent net neutrality order. Let's not \nforget that this is what the Republican leader wanted; in fact, this is \nwhat he promised. It was just last month that he told the Lexington \nHerald Leader that he and Republicans would ``line the interior \nappropriations bill with every rider you can think of.'' In this \ninstance, he certainly is a man of his word.\n  Democrats disagree with these Republican attacks, and we are going to \nresist them. We believe in standing up not for billionaires and tea \nparty ideologues but for everyday, working families. Take \nsequestration, for example. While Republicans want relief only for the \nPentagon, we insist on equal, dollar-for-dollar treatment for the needs \nof America's middle class--for jobs, for education, for health care. We \ninsist on strengthening Social Security and Medicare, not cutting and \nprivatizing them. And we insist on supporting women's health, not \ngutting it.\n  We know that Republicans disagree with us about these middle-class \npriorities, but I hope these disagreements--serious though they are--\nwon't get in the way of keeping the government operating. Whatever our \ndifferences, we should act responsibly. We should at least be able to \nagree to not shut down the government. Republicans should not once \nagain take legislative hostages to get some rightwing prize that is \nwithin their grasp.\n  Mr. President, would the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/05/senate-section/article/S6329-1", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the \ntime until the cloture vote will be equally divided between the bill \nmanagers or their designees.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that although \nthe Senate had been scheduled to vote at 10:30 on a cloture motion, \nthat time might be changed. However, I wish to make some further \nremarks in addition to what I said yesterday on the Cybersecurity \nInformation Sharing Act.\n  I think it is fair to say that I have been very disappointed over the \npast couple of days that we have not moved to this bill more quickly \nand that we haven't reached an agreement to take up and begin \nconsidering amendments. There has been a lot of talk about committee \njurisdictions and germaneness of amendments and process issues that the \nAmerican people just don't care about and which, frankly, don't make \nanyone safer. So I wish to take a few minutes to point out what we are \nreally talking about.\n  Here are a few facts and figures. As I said in my remarks yesterday, \ncyber attacks and cyber threats are getting more and more common and \nmore and more devastating. This isn't going to stop. It is going to get \nworse, and it affects everyone. That is why last night the White House \nhad a simple message, and I hope my colleagues will hear it. A White \nHouse spokesman said yesterday: ``Cybersecurity is an important \nnational security issue and the Senate should take up this bill as soon \nas possible and pass it.''\n  Here is why this is so important.\n  Last year the cyber security company McAfee and the Center for \nStrategic and International Studies, which we call CSIS, estimated that \nthe annual cost of cyber crime is more than $400 billion--that is the \nannual cost--and could cost the United States as many as 200,000 jobs. \nThat is not my analysis; that is the analysis of security experts. Also \nlast year the cyber security company Symantec reported that over 348 \nmillion identities were exposed through data breaches--348 million \npeople had their data exposed.\n  Poll information out this week from the Financial Services Roundtable \nshows that 46 percent of Americans were directly affected by cyber \ncrime over the past year--that is almost one-half of the American \npopulation--and 66 percent are more concerned about cyber intrusions \nthan they were last year. Why are people so concerned? Well, here is a \nlist of 10 of the most noteworthy cyber breaches and attacks from the \npast year and a half.\n  Of course, we all know OPM. June of this year, Office of Personnel \nManagement. There was an announcement that roughly 22 million \ngovernment employees and security clearance applicants had massive \namounts of personal information stolen from OPM databases.\n  Primera Blue Cross. In March of this year, Primera Blue Cross, a \nhealth insurer based in Washington State, said that up to 11 million \ncustomers could have been affected by a cyber breach last year.\n  Anthem. In February 2015, Anthem, one of the Nation's largest health \ninsurers, said that hackers breached a database that contained as many \nas 80 million records of current and former customers.\n  Sony Pictures Entertainment. In November of last year, North Korean \nhackers broke into Sony Pictures Entertainment and not only stole vast \namounts of sensitive and personal data but destroyed the company's \nwhole internal network.\n  Defense Industrial Base. A 2014 Senate Armed Services Committee \ninvestigation found over 20 instances in the previous year of Chinese \nactors penetrating the networks of defense contractors to the \nmilitary's Transportation Command.\n  JPMorgan Chase. In September of last year, it was reported that \nhackers broke in to their accounts and took the account information of \n76 million households and 7 million small businesses.\n  Home Depot. In September of last year, Home Depot discovered that \nhackers had breached their networks and may have accessed up to 56 \nmillion credit cards.\n  EBay. In May of last year, it was reported that up to 233 million \npersonal records of eBay users were breached.\n  There are people here who are concerned with personal information.\n\n[[Page S6330]]\n\nLook at the breach of personal information that has taken place because \nwe haven't been able to stop it.\n  Destructive attack on Sands Casino. In early 2014, Iran launched a \ncyber attack on the Sands Casino in Las Vegas that rendered thousands \nof their electronic systems inoperable, according to public testimony \nof the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper.\n  Target. In December 2013, Target discovered that up to 70 million \ncustomers may have had their credit card information taken by hackers.\n  That is just the last year and a half. This Senator remembers, before \nthis was disclosed in 2008, when hackers broke into Citibank and broke \ninto the Royal Bank of Scotland and robbed individuals in each one of \nmore than $10 million. That was not made public for a long time because \nthey didn't want anybody to know. That was 2008. That was 7 years ago, \nand we haven't done anything about it.\n  Those are some of the breaches from the past year and a half. There \nare cyber crimes, theft of personal information, intellectual property, \nand money every single day.\n  In 2011 and 2012, there were denial-of-service attacks against major \nWall Street banks and Nasdaq, showing that our financial institutions \nare vulnerable. In 2012, Saudi Aramco, the world's largest energy oil \nand gas company, had three-quarters of its corporate computers wiped \nout in a cyber attack. We are vulnerable and these attacks will \ncontinue.\n  This legislation, which was approved by a 14-to-1 vote in March and \nhas been significantly improved since then, will not end these attacks, \nbut it will greatly enhance the ability of companies and the U.S. \nGovernment to learn from each other about the threats they see and the \ndefenses they employ.\n  I would like to make a couple of comments about the bill on specific \npoints, if I may. We have made some 15 privacy information improvements \nin this bill, and I would like to read page 16 of the bill on ``Removal \nof Certain Personal Information.''\n\n       An entity sharing a cyber threat indicator pursuant to this \n     Act shall, prior to such sharing--\n       (A) review such cyber threat indicator to assess whether \n     such cyber threat indicator contains any information that the \n     entity knows at the time of sharing to be personal \n     information of or identifying a specific person not directly \n     related to a cybersecurity threat and remove such \n     information; or\n       (B) implement and utilize a technical capability configured \n     to remove any information contained within such indicator \n     that the entity knows at the time of sharing to be personal \n     information of or identifying a specific person not directly \n     related to a cybersecurity threat.\n\n  That is the first personal information scrub in this bill.\n  The second scrub is left to the agencies receiving the information. \nTo that end, the Attorney General is directed to issue guidelines to \nall agencies once the information goes through the DHS portal and goes \nto the Defense Department or FBI or any other agency. Page 25 of the \nbill has details on the agencies' guidelines that will be developed to \nmake a scrub:\n\n       Not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Attorney General shall, in coordination with the \n     heads of the appropriate Federal entities and in consultation \n     with officers designated under section 1062 of the National \n     Security Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 (42 U.S.C. 2000ee-\n     1), develop, submit to Congress, and make available to the \n     public interim guidelines relating to privacy and civil \n     liberties which shall govern the receipt, retention, use, and \n     dissemination of cyber threat indicators by a Federal entity \n     obtained in connection with activities authorized in this \n     Act.\n       (2) Final guidelines.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall, in \n     coordination with heads of the appropriate Federal entities \n     and in consultation with officers designated under section \n     1062 of the National Security Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 \n     (42 U.S.C. 2000ee-1) and such private entities with industry \n     expertise as the Attorney General considers relevant, \n     promulgate final guidelines relating to privacy and civil \n     liberties which shall govern the receipt, retention, use and \n     dissemination of cyber threat indicators by a Federal entity \n     obtained in connection with activities authorized in this \n     Act.\n\n  Then there is a section on periodic review.\n  Then there is a section on content:\n\n       The guidelines required by paragraphs (1) and (2) shall, \n     consistent with the need to protect information systems from \n     cybersecurity threats and mitigate cybersecurity threats--\n       (A) limit the impact on privacy and civil liberties of \n     activities by the Federal Government under this Act;\n       (B) limit the receipt, retention, use, and dissemination of \n     cyber threat indicators containing personal information of or \n     identifying specific persons, including by establishing--\n       (i) a process. . . .\n\n  And it goes on through page 27 of the bill. Everyone can pick it up \nand read it.\n  Section (E) on line 27 says it must ``protect the confidentiality of \ncyber threat indicators containing personal information of or \nidentifying specific persons to the greatest extent practicable. . . . \n''\n  Somebody can pick up this bill and read the section, pages 25, 26, \nand 27, and see the second personal information scrub that is in this \nbill. It happens, first, the company must scrub the information and \nthen, second, the government must scrub the information. I think those \nare very substantial mandates.\n  I have been very disappointed by our inability to move this bill. \nYesterday I cited the procedural history. This is the third bill we \nhave dealt with. It gets into a question of committee jurisdiction, but \nthe Intelligence Committee has been working on this issue for 5 years \nnow. We have worked with companies. We have worked with technicians. \nOur staffs are very well aware of all the issues and the technical \ndifficulties in putting together a bill.\n  The earlier bills were fragmented. This bill has a solid support from \nover 50 different companies and associations. I want to read just a few \nof them.\n  For the first time, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce supports the bill; \nthe Software Alliance supports this bill; the Information Technology \nCouncil supports this bill; yesterday I received a letter from General \nMotors supporting this bill; the American Bankers Association; the \nAmerican Financial Services Association; the American Insurance \nAssociation; Agricultural Retailers Association; Airlines for America; \nAlliance of Automobile Manufacturers; American Cable Association; \nAmerican Chemistry Council; American Fuel and Petrochemical \nManufacturers; American Gaming Association; American Gas Association; \nAmerican Insurance Association; American Petroleum Institute; American \nPublic Power Association; American Water Works Association; Association \nof American Railroads; Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies; The \nClearing House; Consumer Bankers Association; Credit Union National \nAssociation; Electronic Transactions Association; Financial Services \nForum; Independent Community Bankers of America; Investment Company \nInstitute. It goes on and on and on.\n  I would point out Oracle and the National Association of \nManufacturers support it; IBM; as I said, General Motors; and the U.S. \nTelecom Association support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this list be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Supporters of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015\n\n       U.S. Chamber of Commerce; BSA: The Software Alliance; \n     Information Technology Industry Council; American Bankers \n     Association; American Financial Services Association; \n     American Insurance Association; Agricultural Retailers \n     Association; Airlines for America; Alliance of Automobile \n     Manufacturers; American Cable Association; American Chemistry \n     Council; American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers; \n     American Gaming Association; American Gas Association; \n     American Insurance Association; American Petroleum Institute; \n     American Public Power Association; American Water Works \n     Association; ASIS International; Association of American \n     Railroads.\n       Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies; The Clearing \n     House; Consumer Bankers Association; Credit Union National \n     Association; Electronic Transactions Association; Financial \n     Services Forum; Financial Services Roundtable; Independent \n     Community Bankers of America; Investment Company Institute; \n     NACHA--The Electronic Payments Association; National \n     Association of Federal Credit Unions; National Association of \n     Mutual Insurance Companies; Property Casualty Insurers \n     Association of America; Securities Industry and Financial \n     Markets Association; BITS--Financial Services Roundtable; \n     College of Healthcare Information Management Executives; \n     CompTIA--The Computing Technology Industry Association; \n     CTIA--The Wireless Association; Edison Electric Institute; \n     Electronic Payments Coalition.\n\n[[Page S6331]]\n\n       Electronic Transactions Association; Federation of American \n     Hospitals; Food Marketing Institute; Global Automakers; \n     GridWise Alliance; HIMSS--Healthcare Information and \n     Management Systems Society; HITRUST--Health Information Trust \n     Alliance; Large Public Power Council; National Association of \n     Chemical Distributors; National Association of Manufacturers; \n     National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies; National \n     Association of Water Companies; National Business Coalition \n     on e-Commerce & Privacy; National Cable & Telecommunications \n     Association; National Rural Electric Cooperative Association; \n     NTCA--The Rural Broadband Association; Property Casualty \n     Insurers Association of America; The Real Estate Roundtable; \n     Software & Information Industry Association; Society of \n     Chemical Manufacturers & Affiliates.\n       Telecommunications Industry Association; Transmission \n     Access Policy Study Group; Utilities Telecom Council; Oracle; \n     National Association of Manufacturers Association; IBM; \n     General Motors (GM); US Telecom Association.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. So I want to say something about jurisdiction of \ncommittees. The Homeland Security Committee is certainly free to do a \nbill. The Judiciary Committee is certainly free to do a bill. We have \nthe one on the Intelligence Committee--and the Presiding Officer is a \nmember of this committee--which has been working on this for a long \ntime. We have done two bills previously. This bill, I believe, has hit \nthe mark of support across the Nation, from the companies--both \ncorporate and privately owned--that would have to use this.\n  It is all voluntary. It does not force anybody to do anything they do \nnot want to do. If one does share, and share according to the \nstrictures of this bill, you are protected with liability insurance. If \nyou reduce it to its basic elemental truth, it is the on-ramp to cyber \nsecurity protection in this country. It gives companies the ability to \ntalk to each other about a well-defined cyber threat indicator, to talk \nwith the government, and to be able to take advice from the government. \nIf they follow the bill, they don't have to worry about a lawsuit. That \nis what this bill does.\n  So this Senator must say we have made at least 15 different privacy \namendments to meet individual Senators' needs. There is a managers' \npackage, a substitute amendment, if you will, that takes out any use of \nthis information from being used for any other purpose--violent crime--\nother than cyber security because a number of Senators weighed in, and \nthey felt it could be used to be monitored as a surveillance bill.\n  This is not a surveillance bill. What it is meant to be is a \nvoluntary effort that companies can enter into with some protection if \nthey follow this law. It gives the Attorney General the obligation to \ncome up with secure guidelines to protect private information.\n  It is very hard for me, candidly, to understand why this has become \nsuch a big issue because we protect privacy information. Today out in \nthis vast land of the Internet, there is very little privacy \nprotection. You can see that by the cyber interruptions. You can see \nthat by the use of insurance data by company to company. You can see \nthat by companies that are designed to accumulate data about an \nindividual so they can sell that data to other companies, which can \ntell you who uses a credit card, how you use it, where you use it, and \nat what time you use it. To me that is a privacy violation.\n\n  We have taken every step to prevent privacy violations from happening \nunder this bill. Yet there are individuals who still raise that as a \nmajor concern. I believe it is bogus. I believe it is a detriment to us \nin taking this first step to protect our American industries. If we \ndon't pass it, the thefts are going to go on and on and on.\n  I understand that the cloture vote has been postponed until 2 \no'clock. I will vote for cloture. I believe we have, in good faith--\nSenator Burr and I, the committee as a whole, the staffs on both sides \nof the aisle--gone out of our way to listen to Senators, to present \namendments where they felt they were workable and applicable to the \nbill. We need to get on with it because the litany I read in the last \nyear and a half of almost half of the American people being affected by \ncyber crime cannot go on.\n  I make these remarks and hope at least it can clear the air somewhat, \nso when a cloture vote does come at 2 o'clock, we will have the votes \nto proceed to the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Democratic leader and myself \ncontinue to discuss the way forward on cyber. I think we have made some \nprogress, but to make that more possible for us to reach some kind of \nagreement, I now ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding the \nprovisions of rule XXII, the cloture vote with respect to the motion to \nproceed to S. 754 occur at 2 p.m. today; further, that the mandatory \nquorum call under rule XXII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nduring quorum calls be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Nuclear Agreement with Iran\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this is not the first time, nor will it be \nthe last time that I speak in this Chamber about the Iran nuclear \nagreement. I listened to some of the hearings on this subject in both \nthe House and the Senate, last week, and I want to provide a bit of my \nperspective on the challenge before us.\n  I was a law student in Washington during the 1962 Cuban Missile \nCrisis. My wife and I were living probably 2 miles from the White \nHouse, and we were paying very close attention to what might happen. \nAfterward, as more of the history came out, we realized that some of \nPresident Kennedy's top advisers and Members of Congress pushed for a \nmilitary attack on Cuba--actually, a military attack against the then-\nSoviet Union. A war between the two nuclear superpowers would have at \nthe very least risked the annihilation of both countries. Fortunately, \nPresident Kennedy had the thoughtfulness, patience, and fortitude to \nresist the pressure to go to war.\n  It is not easy to stick with the long road of tough negotiations when \nmany are clamoring for a military solution rather than negotiations. It \nis the same today as it was back in the time of the Cuban Missile \nCrisis.\n  Today we are considering an agreement at the end of such negotiations \nbetween the United States and our allies, and Russia, China, and Iran \nto curb an illicit nuclear program that threatens the Middle East and \nthe world.\n  I know from my conversations with the President and with Secretary \nKerry and Secretary Moniz how difficult this was. I also know from my \nconversations with them that they were prepared to walk away rather \nthan settle for a bad deal. But based on what I have heard so far, this \nis not a bad deal.\n  There are aspects of the agreement that I and others have legitimate \nquestions about, but we already know a lot about it.\n  We know that prior to negotiations, Iran's nuclear program was \nhurtling forward despite multinational sanctions.\n  I remember back in September of 2012, I had been named the Senate \ndelegate to the U.N., and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke. He \nwarned that Iran was within months--months--of producing a nuclear \nbomb. Well, whether or not that was accurate then, it certainly is not \naccurate if this agreement is implemented.\n  We know negotiations succeeded in freezing Iran's nuclear development \nin place, and now we have an agreement to roll back Iran's program.\n\n[[Page S6332]]\n\n  We know that this is the most rigorous monitoring and inspection \nregimen ever included in a nonproliferation agreement. Actually, I \nthink it is a lot more rigorous than many observers predicted it would \nbe.\n  We know that without this deal, the monitoring and the onsite \ninspections would go away, and so would support for the international \nsanctions we painstakingly built. Remember, it took years for us to put \ntogether a coalition of other countries to impose the sanctions. Many \nof them did so at great economic cost to their own economies, but they \nstuck with us because they thought we would negotiate in good faith and \nthat diplomacy could succeed. If we walk away now, many of these \ncountries are going to say: OK, you are in this by yourself. The United \nStates can impose sanctions, but they will be nowhere near as effective \nas they were when we joined you.\n  We know that the sanctions reprieve in this agreement is limited and \nreversible. It is structured so that many sanctions remain in place, \nsanctions in which other countries have joined us. If Iran fails to \nmeet its commitments, we and our partners can revoke the limited relief \nand we can impose additional sanctions.\n  Some criticized this agreement within minutes of the agreement being \nannounced. They are long on scorn, but they are short on alternatives.\n  Again, I remember that speech by Prime Minister Netanyahu years ago \nwhen he warned that Iran was just months away from building a nuclear \nweapon. Today, people are expressing concern about what may happen 15 \nyears from now, not a few months from now. They ignore the fact that if \nCongress rejects this agreement, Iran can immediately resume its \ndevelopment of highly enriched uranium. Iran can build a nuclear weapon \nin far less than 15 years. I would ask, is that the alternative they \nsupport?\n  Or is it another war in the Middle East, which our senior military \nleaders say could spiral out of control and at best would delay the \nresumption of Iran's nuclear weapons programs by 2 to 3 years, after \nwhich it would not be subject to international inspections?\n  Some of the most vociferous critics of this agreement reflexively \nsupported sending American troops to overthrow Saddam Hussein and \noccupy Iraq. We did this after having hearings and meetings in which \nthe Vice President of the United States implied that Iraq was involved \nin the attack on 9/11 and made it very clear that they had weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  I voted against that war because I read the intelligence files, and \nthey were very clear that there was no credible evidence that Iraq had \nweapons of mass destruction, and it was very clear that they had \nnothing to do with 9/11. That colossal mistake killed or maimed \nthousands of Americans, hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqis, and \nby now has cost more than $2 trillion and the meter is still running--\n$2 trillion. It is the first time in this Nation's history when we went \nto war on a credit card; we didn't enact a tax to pay for it. Even \nunpopular wars, like Vietnam and Korea, were paid for.\n  Is it the critics' alternative to reject this agreement and then \nsomehow convince the other parties to it--Russia, China, and the rest \nof the P5+1--to impose even stronger multilateral sanctions? Have they \nbothered to ask officials in any of those governments what the chances \nof that would be? Certainly the statements those officials have made \nmake it very clear that those chances--to use a precise expression--are \nzilch.\n  I am as outraged as anyone by Iran's support of terrorism, its \narbitrary arrests and imprisonment of Americans, its denial of due \nprocess, its use of torture and other violations of human rights, and \nits summary executions of political opponents, just as I object to \nsimilar abuses by many countries we deal with every day.\n  But as horrific as Iran's behavior is, it pales compared to the havoc \nIran could wreak if it obtains a nuclear weapon. A nuclear-armed Iran \ncould commit acts of terrorism that dwarf by thousands or even millions \nof times over those it engages in today. There is simply no comparison.\n  A workable agreement doesn't just buy more time, it can also buy more \nopportunities. In Iran, the impetus for reforming its hostile and \ndestabilizing foreign policy comes from the Iranian people. For \ndecades, the Iranian middle class has been smothered--first by a \nrevolution that crushed their aspirations and then by a regime that \nimposed the harsh consequences of its own criminal behavior on the \nIranian population.\n  Ordinary Iranians overwhelmingly do not want an empire; they want \nmore economic opportunities, freedom of expression, and to reengage \npeacefully with the world. With this agreement, the Iranian middle \nclass can continue to be a factor in future negotiations.\n  It is well understood that in the Congress, we agree or disagree, we \ndebate, and we vote. That is one of the reasons I wanted to be a Member \nof this body. Ideally, we do so in a manner that reflects the respect \neach of us owes to this institution. For a nation of over 300 million \nAmericans, there are only 100 of us who have the privilege at any given \ntime to serve in this body. We are but transitory occupants of the \nseats the voters have afforded us the opportunity to occupy. In \ncarrying out our responsibilities, we should do our best to live up to \nthe standards of those who created what we take pride in calling the \nworld's oldest democracy.\n  I mention this because, as I said earlier, I listened to portions of \nthe hearings in the various House and Senate committees on the Iran \nnuclear agreement at which the Secretaries of State and Energy \ntestified. Presumably, they were asked to testify because the members \nof those committees had questions and concerns about those agreements \nand wanted to hear the witnesses' responses. However, rather than a \nrespectful, substantive exchange, what has too frequently occurred has \nbeen an embarrassing display of political theater.\n  What we have heard is a series of speeches often containing \nassertions or accusations that are either contradicted by the actual \nwords of the agreement or without factual basis, and then they are \nfollowed by questions the witnesses were unable to answer because when \nthey tried, they were interrupted or told the time had expired.\n  Many Vermonters have talked to me about those hearings. They were \noften embarrassing to watch, and they did a disservice to the American \npeople who deserve to know that their representatives are engaged in a \nsubstantive, in-depth exchange of views on the hugely important issue \nof how to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\n  I have questions myself because, short of unilateral surrender by one \nparty, every agreement involves compromise. That is as true for \ninternational diplomacy as it is for the Senate. Neither side gets \neverything it wants. Anyone who suggests that was a possible outcome \nhere is fooling themselves or, even worse, deceiving the voters who \nsent them here.\n  The President has been unwavering in his insistence that the goal of \nthis agreement is to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. I \ncommend him for his vision and resolve. I have spoken with him at \nlength about this.\n  I will say to my colleagues what I said to the President. It is now \nup to Congress to carry out its oversight responsibility. We can strive \nto make this work, keeping in mind the vital national security \ninterests at stake for our country and for our allies, or we can \nimpulsively sabotage this chance.\n  But we should engage in this process in a manner that enhances the \nimage of the U.S. Senate and that affords those in our government who \nspent years forging this agreement the respect and appreciation they \ndeserve.\n  Mr. President, there have been many thoughtful articles and opinion \npieces written about the Iran nuclear agreement. I am sure there will \nbe many more. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record one \nof those articles, authored jointly by Eric Schwartz and Brian Atwood, \ntwo former Assistant Secretaries of State.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      [Commentary, July 30, 2015]\n\n                Cheerleaders for War Are Still so Wrong\n\n\n      congress needs to ``practice history'' and ok the agreement.\n\n                  (By Eric Schwartz and Brian Atwood)\n\n       In ``Practicing History,'' historian Barbara Tuchman \n     observed that there are ``two ways of applying past \n     experience: One is to enable us to avoid past mistakes and to \n     manage better in similar circumstances next time; the\n\n[[Page S6333]]\n\n     other is to enable us to anticipate a future course of \n     events.''\n       Tuchman would find it strange today that many of the \n     loudest opponents of the Iran nuclear agreement are the same \n     prominent individuals and organizations who unequivocally \n     supported the most significant national security blunder by \n     the U.S. in recent memory, the war of choice in Iraq.\n       As evidence has accumulated since the failure to find \n     weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, the price of that \n     foreign policy engagement has become obvious to most. The \n     cost to the U.S. includes trillions of dollars lost to future \n     generations of Americans, tens of thousands killed or \n     injured, the opening of a Sunni-Shia Pandora's box of \n     sectarian strife, the ascendance of Iran and the diminished \n     influence of the U.S. in the Middle East.\n       Remarkably, there are still unrepentant cheerleaders for \n     that war, as well as those who argue that the U.S. invasion \n     was a good idea in principle that was just executed poorly. \n     And they are among the most influential voices opposed to the \n     agreement with Iran.\n       Why does it matter that the pundits who were so convinced \n     about invading Iraq more than a decade ago now pursue with \n     passionate certainty the defeat of the diplomatic effort \n     involving Iran?\n       It matters because, then and now, these voices suffer from \n     a greatly exaggerated view of the ability of the U.S. to \n     unilaterally dictate geopolitical outcomes that we desire. In \n     the case of Iraq, this was perhaps best expressed by former \n     Vice President Dick Cheney who, when pressed before the war \n     on our capacity to remake Iraqi society, argued that we would \n     be ``greeted as liberators.'' Of course, the experience in \n     Iraq, the resulting ascendance of Iran and reduced U.S. \n     influence in the region have only further diminished our \n     capacity to act without the support of others and have \n     underscored the importance of smart power--diplomacy backed \n     with all of the resources at our disposal to achieve our \n     objectives.\n       The nuclear agreement, now endorsed unanimously by the \n     United Nations Security Council, is long and complex, and it \n     is presumed that Congress will study carefully the details. \n     Are the verification provisions adequate and does the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency have the resources to \n     monitor compliance? What is the process by which sanctions \n     could be reimposed if violations occur? Are all paths to a \n     nuclear bomb blocked? What are the alternatives to this \n     approach and are they acceptable to the American people?\n       Our expectation is that a serious examination of this \n     agreement should win over a bipartisan majority. The \n     agreement's substantial reductions in uranium stockpiles and \n     installed centrifuges, robust inspection regime and \n     dramatically diminished capacity for an Iranian breakout and \n     ``race to a bomb'' provide unprecedented means to ensure Iran \n     will meet its stated commitment to never build a nuclear \n     weapon.\n       But these elements will not win over those with an \n     unrealistic view of the capacity of the U.S. to play the Lone \n     Ranger in international politics. And while opponents say \n     they support diplomacy, the so-called alternatives they would \n     prefer--like pressing for a harder line on sanctions relief--\n     would put us at odds with our allies, be rejected by Iran and \n     increase the risks of another war in the Middle East that \n     would be tragic for both the U.S. and for Israel.\n       The nuclear agreement will of course pose challenges for \n     U.S. policymakers, as sanctions relief will provide benefits \n     to Iran and opportunities to make mischief in the region. But \n     through our continued presence, support of regional friends \n     and allies, and an enforceable nuclear agreement, we have the \n     strongest capacity to manage such challenges effectively.\n       Americans must hope that Congress will be preoccupied with \n     the substance of the Iran agreement and the poor alternatives \n     to it, and not be influenced by voices of the past that cling \n     to dangerous views about our prospects as a go-it-alone \n     superpower. Congress should ``practice history'' and \n     recognize that this agreement has the potential to interrupt \n     the downward spiral in the region, from conventional war and \n     terrorism to nuclear conflict.\n       Forcing the president to veto a rejection resolution would \n     reflect badly on the Congress and the United States of \n     America. Even worse, overriding a presidential veto would \n     have grave implications for the U.S., for Israel and for the \n     region for many years to come.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will speak further on this subject, but I \nsee no other Senators seeking the floor. While I do appreciate the \nopportunity to be here, I must admit that, looking at the weather and \nlive views of Vermont this morning, I will look forward to the time we \ncomplete our work because after the last vote of this week, I will be \non the first flight I can get on and look forward to being in Vermont. \nI will miss all of you, of course, but not so much I want you all to \ncome and join me.\n  With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                     Working Together in the Senate\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, as Senators get ready to head home for \nthe August recess, I think it is a good time to look back at what we \nhave been able to achieve so far this year.\n  I would say, by any measure, the record of the Senate this year has \nbeen one of great accomplishments and bipartisan achievements because \nwe have worked together to find solutions to help the country move \nahead.\n  With Republicans in charge, the Senate set a very fast pace for the \nfirst 100 days of the new Congress. We have kept up that pace now over \nthe first 6 months of the Congress, and we are going to continue to \nbuild on that momentum for the rest of the year and, I believe, achieve \neven greater success on behalf of all Americans.\n  Under Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Republicans are now \ngoverning, and we are doing it in a bipartisan way, just as we \npromised.\n  The Senate passed the first budget resolution with the House since \n2009--the first one since 2009. The Appropriations Committee passed all \n12 spending bills for the first time in 6 years. We passed the longest \nreauthorization of the highway trust fund in almost a decade. The \nSenate passed trade promotion authority for the first time since 2002. \nWe passed a permanent doc fix to prevent Medicare payment cuts--after \n17 temporary patches since 2002. And the Senate ended Washington's \ntest-based education policies by making States responsible and \naccountable.\n  A lot of people in Washington have written about gridlock, and they \nhad gotten used to the gridlock when Democrats ran the Senate. Now they \nare starting to realize the Senate really is working again. They \nrealize we can actually get things done. That is not me speaking. That \nis what the Bipartisan Policy Center recently said. This is a group of \nformer Republican and Democratic Members of Congress. They came out \nwith a report called their ``Healthy Congress Index.'' They did it for \nthe first 6 months of 2015.\n  The headline of the report was ``Continued Signs of Life in \nCongress.'' Continued signs of life--imagine that--actual signs of life \nand activity taking place in Congress this year.\n  This bipartisan group reported that the total number of days worked \nis up from previous years--15 more days worked just so far in the first \n6 months of the Senate compared to last year. That is 3 more weeks of \nwork on the Senate floor than the year before under Harry Reid.\n  The Bipartisan Policy Center also said the committees are actually \nworking again. ``Congressional committees have been extremely active, \nreporting a significantly larger number of bills than the previous two \nCongresses.'' That is because the committees are working again. In the \nfirst 6 months of this year we had 102 bills reported out of committees \nin the Senate, compared to just 69 in the first 6 months of the last \nCongress and just 42 in the Congress before that. Now, that is just \nthrough the end of June. Our committees have produced even more bills \nsince then. So committees are working--and we are working together--to \npush out bipartisan bills.\n  Right now both Houses of Congress are in a 60-day period of \nscrutinizing the Iran nuclear agreement. We are able to do that because \nthe Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act had unanimous support in the \nForeign Relations Committee--Republicans and Democrats voting \ntogether--and then it got overwhelming bipartisan support on the Senate \nfloor. That is just one more way the Senate is working again.\n  So far in this Congress we passed more than 64 different bills. The \nhighway trust fund legislation was bipartisan. It will fund highways \nand transportation all across the country, and 26 Democrats voted in \nfavor of that legislation. We passed the education reform bill with 40 \nDemocrats in favor. When we passed the trade promotion authority, 14 \nDemocrats joined Republicans to get that done. These important pieces \nof legislation are just part of our commitment to work together to \nsolve problems for the American people.\n  Even Tom Daschle--Tom Daschle, the former Democratic Senate leader--\n\n[[Page S6334]]\n\nrecently said: ``The good news is that Congress is continuing to move \nin the right direction: staying in session more often, empowering \ncommittees to work together.'' That is from a former Democratic \nmajority leader in the Senate, Tom Daschle. He is exactly right. The \nSenate is working again, we are moving in the right direction, and we \nare just getting started. I am hopeful that we can continue to work \ntogether to find solutions on more issues that matter to the American \npeople.\n  There is still a lot of work to be done, specifically related to our \neconomy. People want a healthy economy. But there is still far too much \nredtape and regulation coming out of Washington, and it continues to \nstrangle our economy.\n  New numbers came out last week about the slow pace of economic growth \nover the first half of the year. One of the headlines came out last \nFriday about the slow pace and it said: ``Worst Expansion Since World \nWar II Gets Even Worse.'' ``Worst Expansion Since World War II Gets \nEven Worse.'' The article says: ``The economy expanded at a 2.3 percent \nannual rate in the second quarter [of the year], once again falling \nshort of projections for a decisive rebound and raising concerns that \nthe six-year old expansion will never pick up steam''--will never pick \nup steam, ever. So the recovery from the last recession has been far \nweaker than recoveries from other recessions under Presidents Reagan \nand Clinton.\n  One reason is that the Obama administration has tied the hands of \nthose who hire others. It makes it much harder to get our economy going \nagain. Hard-working families are still struggling because their wages \nare not growing.\n  That is what another set of government numbers said on Friday. \nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment costs had their \nworst gains ever in the second quarter of the year.\n  What does the White House plan to do about it? What is President \nObama's plan for ``Worst Expansion Since World War II Gets Even \nWorse''? What does the President want to do about it? Well, on Monday \nPresident Obama and the administration announced its so-called--so-\ncalled--Clean Power Plan, and it is going to mandate massive new \nredtape and job-crushing regulations. It is a national energy tax.\n  More Americans will lose their jobs, and more hard-working families \nacross the country will be hit with higher electric bills. Congress can \nstop this costly and destructive regulation from taking effect, and \nthat is where we are headed.\n  The way to do it is by passing a bipartisan piece of legislation \ncalled the Affordable Reliable Electricity Now Act.\n  The American people have seen that Congress is capable of coming \ntogether to take on important issues, and this is certainly one.\n  Hardworking Americans are extremely anxious for us to continue \nworking together to solve some of these problems that continue to face \nour country. We have done it before, and we can do it again, as long as \nwe have a willing partner.\n  The Senate passed the bipartisan Keystone XL Pipeline jobs bill. Then \nPresident Obama vetoed it.\n  We passed an appropriations bill out of committee that funded the \nDepartment of Defense at the levels the President requested, and the \nDemocrats here in the Senate have blocked those funds for our troops. \nIn fact, Democrats are blocking all of the appropriations bills, \nincluding ones that passed out of the committee with bipartisan \nsupport.\n  The American people want their elected representatives in the Senate \nto deal with these issues. The American people want to see us get past \nthe gridlock once more--as we have already done so many times this \nyear. The American people want us to tear down the barriers to stronger \neconomic growth so they can get back to work, they can earn a decent \nwage, and they can take care of their families.\n  This Senate has accomplished a lot in the first half of the year. I \nbelieve we can do even more in the second half of the year. That is the \ncommitment Republicans made to the American people, and we are keeping \nthat commitment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Nuclear Agreement With Iran\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have had the honor of serving in the \nSenate now for three terms, and I'm in my fourth term. I have been on \nthe Senate floor a major part of my public life and witnessed a lot of \nthings that have occurred here. I remember quite a few of them, but the \none that sticks in my memory goes back to 2002. It was the end of \nSeptember or the beginning of October--I will get the exact date--and \nthere was a critical debate taking place on the floor of the Senate \nthat went late into the night. The final vote happened around midnight. \nThe question was whether the United States should be authorized to \ninvade Iraq.\n  I remember that debate because we were still reeling from the tragedy \nof 9/11. We were still determined to keep America safe. We worried \nabout our vulnerabilities and our strengths. The George W. Bush \nadministration, after several months of preparing for this debate, led \nmost Americans to believe that Saddam Hussein, the leader in Iraq, \npossessed weapons of mass destruction. Some of the testimony even \nsuggested those weapons could threaten our allies, our friends, and \neven the United States of America.\n  It was in that context that a decision was made to invade Iraq, but \nfirst the decision had to come through Congress. The American people \nhad their chance through their elected representatives in the Senate \nand the House to make that decision.\n  The public sentiment behind the war in Iraq was overwhelmingly \npositive as we voted. The belief was that we had to stop Saddam Hussein \nbefore there was another attack on the United States like 9/11. \nSentiments ran very high. The rhetoric was heated.\n  I remember that night. I remember there were two of my colleagues on \nthe floor after everyone had gone home. One was Kent Conrad, the \nSenator from North Dakota, and the other was Paul Wellstone, the \nSenator from Minnesota. Now, 23 of us had voted no on authorizing the \nwar in Iraq. It included the three of us who remained.\n  I was up for reelection, as was Senator Wellstone. I went to Paul \nWellstone in the well of the Senate and I said: Paul, I hope that vote \ndoesn't cost you the election in a few weeks.\n  Paul Wellstone said to me: It is all right if it does. This is who I \nam and this is what I believe, and the people of Minnesota expect \nnothing less.\n  The story unfolds. In the ensuing weeks Paul Wellstone died in a \nplane crash before the election took place, but I still remember that \nmoment, and I remember what I considered to be an act of conscience by \nmy friend and colleague from Minnesota.\n  I thought about the thousands of votes that I have cast in the House \nand the Senate, and only a handful are still right there in front of \nme. They include the votes that you cast that relate to war. You know \nif you vote to go to war even under the right circumstances, innocent \npeople will die. Americans will die. There is no more serious or grave \nresponsibility than to take those questions of foreign policy as \nseriously as or more seriously than virtually any other issue.\n  Fast forward to where we are today. We will leave this week and be \ngone for 4 or 5 weeks and return in September. The first item of \nbusiness will be the Iran agreement. I view this vote on the Iran \nagreement in the same class as the vote on the war in Iraq. It is a \nquestion, a serious foreign policy question, about whether Iran will be \nstopped from developing a nuclear weapon. We have added into this \nconversation the decision of Congress as to whether they approve the \nPresident's treaty. That doesn't often happen, but it will in this \ncase.\n  We have to look at the possibility that Congress will reject the Iran \ntreaty. Even if the President vetoes it, there is still a question as \nto whether\n\n[[Page S6335]]\n\nCongress would override that veto. We have to ask ourselves: What \nhappens if this Iran agreement comes to an end? Military action--some \nform of military action.\n  One of the Senators on the other side of the aisle assured us 4 \ndays--we will take care of the Iranian nuclear problem in 4 days. He \nwasn't here when we were told the war in Iraq would last 2 weeks. So \n4,844 American lives later, with tens of thousands injured, and \ntrillions of dollars spent, that war ended with a result that none of \nus really view as a success for American foreign policy. Now we face \nthat same question. Those who would reject the Iranian agreement have a \nresponsibility to come to this floor and explain what happens next.\n\n  Yesterday we called a meeting. I asked the Ambassadors from the five \nnations that joined us in the negotiations with Iran to come meet with \nMembers of the Senate on the Democratic side. We had the Ambassador \nfrom Russia, the Ambassador from China, the Ambassador from the United \nKingdom, and the Deputies Chief of Mission from Germany and France. \nAbout 30 Democratic Senators gathered to ask questions in a completely \noff-the-record, informal atmosphere.\n  The first question asked was, what happens if Congress rejects this \nIranian agreement? What happens the next day? What is the next step? \nThey said the notion that we will sit back down at the table with the \nIranians, in the words of one of these Ambassadors, is far-fetched.\n  We have spent 35 years bringing Iran to this table. These nations \njoined us in an effort to try to stop Iranians from developing a \nnuclear weapon. These nations are satisfied that what we have put \ntogether is an agreement that is verifiable with inspections.\n  When I think back to Ronald Reagan, I didn't agree with him on a lot \nof things, but I sure agreed with what he said when it came to these \nagreements, ``trust, but verify.'' There is verification in this \nagreement. The IAEA, which is the United Nations group that inspects \natomic facilities around the world, is tasked with inspecting and \nreporting and continuing to investigate Iran throughout the life of \nthis agreement.\n  Can we trust them? Well, just as a historic reminder, it was the IAEA \nthat said to the United States: There are no weapons of mass \ndestruction that we can find in Iraq.\n  We ignored them. We invaded. We paid a heavy price for it. It turns \nout they were right. Some of our leaders were just plain wrong. The \nagency has credibility, it has a track record, and it is authorized \nunder this agreement to move forward.\n  What struck me, as I looked at those Ambassadors sitting across the \ntable from 30 Members of the Senate yesterday, was how historic this \nmoment is. China, Russia, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and the \nUnited States were all together negotiating, trying to bring at least \nsome modicum of peace to the Middle East. Some of the statements that \nwere made were compelling.\n  A gentleman from the German side said: I won't go into the history of \nGermany--you know it well--but I will tell you we are more committed to \nthe survival of Israel than any nation in Europe.\n  Any student of history knows exactly what he was speaking of. Now we \nhave an opportunity to turn to diplomacy to avoid the military and \navoid war. And what do we find? In April of this year, 47 Senators on \nthe other side of the aisle sent a letter to the Ayatollah in Iran, the \nSupreme Leader of Iran, and said: Do not negotiate with President Obama \nand the United States. Whatever you think you have agreed to is subject \nto congressional approval, and don't expect the next President of the \nUnited States to abide by any agreement.\n  Forty-seven Senators from the other side of the aisle signed that \nletter. What would have happened if 47 Democratic Senators had sent a \nletter to Saddam Hussein before the invasion of Iraq and said the same \nthing: Don't negotiate with President Bush. Don't even think that you \ncan avoid a war.\n  I think they would have had us up on charges. At least Vice President \nCheney would have. But in April, before the agreement was even \nannounced on the other side of the aisle, 47 Senators said: Don't waste \nyour time negotiating. I think they are wrong.\n  I think we ought to go back to the words of John Kennedy. John \nKennedy said: We should never negotiate out of fear, but we should \nnever fear to negotiate.\n  Leaders in our country--Republican Presidents--have stepped up to \nthat negotiating table with a flurry of criticism that they would even \nsit down with these enemies of the United States and try to find a more \npeaceful world. Ronald Reagan sat down with Gorbachev looking for \ncontainment of nuclear weapons. It was Richard Nixon, another \nRepublican President, who sat down with the Chinese to open relations \nwith them while the Chinese were supplying and fortifying the North \nVietnamese fighting American forces. Despite that criticism, they had \nthe courage to sit down and look for a diplomatic way to find a more \npeaceful world, and that is what we face today.\n  This Iran agreement is our opportunity to test diplomacy, and I \ninvite Israel, our friends and allies in Israel, to join us in holding \nIran to the letter of the law in this agreement. Join us in reviewing \nthese inspections. Join us in calling for the availability of these \nfacilities so we know exactly what is going on with Iran from this \npoint forward. Let's join together in a force to make this a more \npeaceful world. I think this is our chance. I know this is a vote of \nconscience for me, and I am sure it is for all of my colleagues. I hope \nthere will be the courage to try diplomacy before we turn to war.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, in the days ahead, we are facing one of \nthe most consequential issues we will face as a nation--this issue of \nan agreement with Iran. Some people want to make this into a partisan \nconversation. It is not a partisan conversation. It is a national \nsecurity issue, and it is a world security issue.\n  The Senate has already held multiple hearings on Iran and on this \nparticular agreement with the Intelligence Committee I sit on, the \nArmed Services Committee, and the Foreign Relations Committee. I \npersonally met with Secretary of Treasury Jack Lew, Secretary of Energy \nErnest Moniz, and Secretary of State John Kerry. I have been through \nthe agreement and the classified portion of this agreement in every \ndetail.\n  I wish I could also go through the IAEA information about how the \ninspections will actually occur because the agreement itself gives \nbroad statements. The IAEA agreement will be the narrow, practical \nversion of how they will actually do inspections. I have been told over \nand over again by the administration and by officials that the United \nStates will not have a role in determining how the inspections will be \ndone and that they will not even see the methods of how we will do \ninspections before they actually begin.\n  They told me they have been orally briefed on the process, but they \nhave not actually seen it, which means since they haven't seen it, I \ncan't see it. It seems odd to me that the final aspect of the agreement \nthat actually gives the greatest detail of how the inspections will \noccur none of us can actually see. It is difficult to have this \n``trust, but verify'' attitude when we were not given the ability to \nverify how they are verifying it and to see how much trust is actually \nbeing given in this process.\n  The White House has told us over and over again that if you don't \nlike this deal, there are two options--it is either war or provide a \nbetter solution. I am telling everyone: Let's slow down. Let's look at \nboth of those things, and let's also back up and see where we are.\n  For years the United States and the United Nations said that Iran \nshould not enrich uranium. In fact, there are six U.N. resolutions \nsaying that Iran should not enrich uranium. Why? Because Iran is the \nsingle largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world. Iran has \npropped up the Assad regime in Syria. They are paying the soldiers to \nwalk side by side and to fight with Assad right now and hold up that \nSyrian Government. Iran is paying for and propping up the coup that is \nin Yemen right now on Saudi Arabia's southern border. They are still \nchanting in the streets ``Death to America,'' and they are actively \npursuing larger and larger\n\n[[Page S6336]]\n\nweapons. I think there is a reason to take this seriously.\n  Now, back to the statement by the White House. They have said: If you \ndon't agree with this agreement, then it is either war or you come up \nwith a better option.\n  I will briefly touch on those two issues. I think in many ways this \nagreement actually pushes us faster to a process towards war. Why would \nI say that? Because the conventional weapons ban is lifted under this \nagreement, and Iran can freely purchase weapons from around the world \nthat have been banned by a U.N. treaty, and that is now lifted under \nthis agreement.\n  To pacify the Gulf States and Israel, the administration immediately \nwent to the Gulf States and said: We understand the conventional \nweapons ban is being lifted there, so we are going to provide you \ngreater technology and weapons, and we are going to provide you greater \naccess to weapons and help to be able to get those weapons.\n  So help me understand why encouraging the Middle East to start \ndialing up with more and more weapons on both sides of this doesn't \nactually push us towards war even faster?\n  Then there is this statement about providing a better solution, as if \nthis is the only option that is sitting out there. Well, the agreement \nitself was written in such a way that the U.N. would approve this \nfirst, the European Union would approve it second, and then the U.S. \nCongress would get it third. That was intentionally done to try to add \npressure to this Congress to say: You can't turn away from this. The \nrest of the world has signed on to it, so you can't turn away from it.\n  This Congress should not process things under fear, and this Congress \nshould not process things by saying: You are the last in line so you \nbetter sign up to where the rest of the world is.\n  We have to look at this because we are directly affected by this \nissue. Remember, Iran has said over and over again that the United \nStates is the great Satan in the world. Anyone who believes that Iran \nwants to be able to come alongside us and be a peaceful member of the \nclub is not listening to what Iran is actually saying, not to mention \nthis whole theory of, if you don't sign onto this agreement, there is \nno better deal.\n  Last week Bloomberg reported that the French senior diplomat, Jacques \nAudibert--the senior diplomatic adviser to President Hollande, the \nindividual who led the French diplomatic team in discussions with Iran \nin the P5+1 group, and the one who was in the room--earlier this month \ndirectly disputed Kerry's claim that a congressional rejection of the \nIran deal would result in the worst of all words, the collapse of \nsanctions, and Iran racing to a bomb without restrictions.\n  The French senior diplomat actually said: If Congress votes this \ndown, there will be saber-rattling and chaos for a year or two, but in \nthe end nothing will change and Iran will come back to the table and \nnegotiate a better deal that will be to our advantage.\n  I will run that by again. He said he thought if Congress votes this \ndown, we will get a better deal. That means two things: He believes, \nagain, that Iran will come back to the table on this, and he also \nbelieves there is a better deal out there, and that this is not the \nbest deal we can get.\n  After going through the agreement, I have very serious concerns about \nit. I am concerned there are loopholes in this agreement that are big \nenough to drive a truck through. Specifically, this truck is the truck \nthat is big enough to drive it through.\n  I will go through some of my concerns. This agreement assumes that \nthe intelligence community can identify locations in a country the size \nof Texas--all the locations--for a possible inspection, notify the IAEA \nwhich places they should go, and that we would be able to contact Iran \nand get permission from them to visit those sites, which takes \napproximately 1 month--I will go into greater detail on that--and that \nwe will actually access those sites and find the information we want \nthere.\n  The IAEA is reporting that they can actually only track for uranium. \nSo all of the other research that goes into building a nuclear weapon, \nthey couldn't actually track that after 24 days, but if there was \nuranium there, they feel confident they could actually track that. So \nbasically, if we are in the final stages of their assembling something, \nand we catch them and we are able to get permission to get in there, we \ncould get to it. Not to mention the fact that the Iranian leaders have \nsaid over and over again since the agreement was signed that there is \nno way that the IAEA will get access to military sites in Iran. That is \na loophole big enough to drive this truck through.\n  The IAEA has to give 24 hours' notice of its intent to inspect, and \nthen Iran has 14 days to let the inspectors in. Of course, they can \nstall for 10 more days in the agreement itself. That is 25 days, \nminimum, to hide whatever they are working on. That is a lot of time to \nbe able to move computer equipment and all sorts of installed things. \nAt the end of it, the IAEA would say, we can actually determine if \nthere were ever uranium there even after 25 days, but basically nothing \nelse.\n  We have incredible people who work for us in the intelligence \ncommunity that most Americans will never see and never meet. There are \nsome amazing, patriotic Americans, but they can't see everything and \nthey can't catch every needle in the haystack that is in Iran. It would \nhelp the intelligence community, and it would help us in our \ninspections, if we had access to the previous military dimensions for \nthe nuclear weapons program that Iran has had on board. But the \nagreement itself only says we have to get all things from right now \nforward, that we don't have to have the documents previous. And if we \ndo, Iran will actually pick the documents that we will see previous in \ntheir nuclear practice.\n\n  So now we have to find a location with no previous documents, with no \nway to be able to really see what research they have done and how far \nadvanced they are. We are looking for different things, if there are \ndifferent stages of their research and development on a nuclear weapon. \nTo say in the agreement we are not going to have to get all the \nprevious research they have done in the past is an enormous loophole \nand it is a definite detriment to what we are doing in our own \ndiscovery.\n  Iran has to dramatically decrease the number of centrifuges that are \nspinning and cascading to enrich uranium. That is true, and I am glad \nfor that. They have to pull out what is a known stockpile and reduce \nit. I am glad of that, and that is a positive thing. But Iran can \ncontinue to enrich uranium with 5,000 cascading centrifuges, just in \nsmaller amounts and using their older centrifuges. Again, that sounds \nlike a win. But there is no reason, if they have peaceful purposes for \nuranium, to keep 5,000 centrifuges spinning--if they are only doing it \nfor peaceful purposes.\n  Iran can continue testing their advanced centrifuges in small \ncascades--their IR-6s, their IR-8s.\n  Iran can continue doing research and development on their most \nadvanced form of centrifuges. Worst of all, they can keep over 1,000 of \ntheir most advanced centrifuges still in a cascade in their most \nheavily fortified facility. They just have to promise they won't put \nuranium in there. But they can continue to do testing and development \nso when that time comes, they will be ready to accelerate uranium \nfaster. So, basically, they can do everything in the process, except \ninclude uranium at that point.\n  We are allowing them time to increase their research, with 1,000 \ncentrifuges in their most advanced level. Why would we agree to that? \nThat doesn't seem to be a pathway to peaceful purposes. That seems to \nbe a pathway to high-grade uranium and the development within country.\n  I have already mentioned that within just a very few years, the \nconventional weapons ban is lifted in this agreement, allowing \nadditional conventional weapons to flood into the single largest state \nsponsor of terrorism in the world--not to mention the fact that what is \nflooding in before all of those conventional weapons are billions of \ndollars that have been held in sanctions.\n  Now, again, there has been no change on tactics of terrorism. There \nhas been no change of statement from the leadership of Iran, but they \nare getting billions of dollars. Under sanctions, they used their money \nto prop up Yemen to form a coup there and to prop up Assad\n\n[[Page S6337]]\n\nin Syria. What are they going to do with an additional $60 billion, $70 \nbillion?\n  The administration has said they desperately need that money so they \ncan do infrastructure. They are getting billions of dollars. No one is \ngoing to tell me a major portion of that is not going to be used for \nterrorism.\n  As the administration has said, we have built in snapback sanctions \nso that if Iran violates something, immediately we will snap back the \nsanctions. But if we actually look at the details of how those snapback \nsanctions happen, it is months and months in the process of getting \neveryone back together and forming an agreement that we are going to do \nthat. And if we snap back sanctions, written into the agreement it says \nIran can then--if we snap back sanctions--kick out their part of the \nagreement as well and consider it a violation of the agreement and walk \naway, and now there are no restrictions on them. So, basically, we are \nthe ones that are punished if we ever snap back sanctions. If we snap \nback sanctions, Iran could say, see, I told you so, and then \nimmediately kick into the normal process they were into before. By the \nway, their advanced centrifuges are already spinning. They are still \ncontinuing. Nothing was diminished. I haven't even mentioned that their \nresearch and development can continue on all of their weapons systems. \nAll of that is unabated. The only limitation seems to be around \nenriched uranium, but everything else continues the same.\n  I was also appalled as I went through this agreement and saw the \nleader of the Quds Force, General Suleimani, who personally coordinated \nthe creation, distribution, and installation of improvised explosive \ndevices in Iraq designed to kill Americans. This leader personally was \nengaged in killing hundreds of American soldiers in the war in Iraq--\nhundreds. The sanctions on that general are lifted so he can have \nnormalized relationships worldwide, and four American hostages remain. \nCan someone tell me why for the murderer-of-Americans general, his \nsanctions are lifted, but American citizens still remain hostages in \nIran?\n  I have to tell my colleagues, I was stunned by many things that were \nin this agreement and how many loopholes were built into it, but none \nsurprised me more than the part of the agreement that we made as a \ncountry, apparently, that if Iran is attacked, the United States will \nnow come to their defense. Help me understand this. As they continue a \nnuclear weapons program, if a country steps in and attacks them and \nsays no, you can't do that, that is a violation and we are going to \nstop that, the United States is now agreeing to come defend Iran as \nthey are advancing their nuclear program? Have we lost our mind?\n  Now, the administration, when asked about this, just said it won't \nhappen. If it won't happen, why did we put it in the agreement? Why is \nit there at all? There seems to be a struggle to be able to get an \nagreement more than it is a struggle to say we have to prevent the \nworld's largest sponsor of terrorism from getting a nuclear weapon at \nany cost. This is not about slowing their nuclear program. It should be \nabout stopping their nuclear program.\n  This cannot come to our doorstep. This cannot come to the Middle \nEast. And while the Middle East further weaponizes to prepare for a \nmore aggressive Iran, we continue to step up and say we will help you \nweaponize, and I don't see how that is deterring us from war.\n  There is a better agreement out there, and we should push to get it. \nWe should take care of the loopholes that are big enough to drive a \ntruck through. We should resolve this issue. We should not pretend this \nis a partisan issue. This is not about Republican versus Democrat. This \nis about peace. This is about trying to work out the differences--and \nthe differences are strong--with all nations and Iran. Let's work that \nout together, and let's keep pushing until we get this resolved.\n  I cannot support this agreement with Iran.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \nCybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015.\n  I wish to first recognize the hard work of Chairman Burr and Vice \nChairman Feinstein and their leadership on this very important \nlegislation. As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I am \nwell aware of the need to strengthen our computer networks against our \nadversaries, whether they be nation-states, such as China, Russia, and \nIran, or terrorist groups or international criminal gangs or \nhacktivists.\n  Along with former Senator Joe Lieberman, I authored the Intelligence \nReform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. This bill implemented many \nof the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission report in the wake of Al \nQaeda's terrorist attack on our country that took the lives of nearly \n3,000 people. Many of the reforms enacted in our law were well-known \nand recommended prior--far before--the attacks on our country on 9/11, \nbut they simply were never implemented, despite the clear and present \nthreat posed by Al Qaeda.\n  Today, my concern is that we are repeating much the same mistake when \nit comes to the cyber domain. Our Nation has unparalleled strength, but \ncyber space allows much weaker adversaries to target our people, our \neconomy, and our military.\n  Just as modern passenger planes designed in the United States were \nturned against us and used as weapons back in September of 2001, so too \ncould the digital tools designed in the United States be turned against \nus to deal a devastating blow to our economy, our national security, \nand our way of life.\n  We already know many of the steps necessary to reduce the likelihood \nof a cyber 9/11, yet many of these actions have not yet been taken in \neither the government or the private sector. As one former official \ntold the 9/11 Commission last year in preparation for its 10th \nanniversary report, ``we are at September 10th levels in terms of cyber \npreparedness.'' How many experts have to tell us that it is not a \nmatter of if we are going to be the subject of a major cyber attack but \nwhen? How many more serious intrusions do we have to have in the \nprivate sector with banks, major retailers affected or in the public \nsector, where we have had the huge and serious OPM breach which affects \nsome 21 million Americans? How many more of these do we have to have \noccur before Congress finally acts?\n  Consider the fact that the economic and technological advantages that \nthe United States enjoys today required decades of research and \ndevelopment and investment of literally billions of dollars. Yet these \ncompetitive edges are eroding because hackers and other countries are \nstealing the intellectual property that gives us our competitive edge \nin the world.\n  Three years ago, when I stood on the Senate floor with Senator Joe \nLieberman to urge the passage of the Cyber Security Act of 2012, which \nwe wrote, I quoted the then-NSA chief, General Keith Alexander, who \nsaid that we are in the midst of the greatest transfer of wealth in our \nNation's history. Yet this transfer of wealth continues and \naccelerates. Information sharing remains fragmented, and the private \nsector is still hesitant about sharing and receiving information with \ngovernment. We have lost 3 years and endured endless, expensive data \nbreaches since the Senate refused to stop a filibuster on our cyber \nbill in 2012. I urge my colleagues: Let's not make the same mistake \ntoday.\n  Passing the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 would make \nit easier for public and private sector entities to share cyber threat \nvulnerability information to stop the theft of trade and national \nsecurity secrets, to stop the theft of personally identifiable \ninformation, and to help stop the theft of important information that \nall of us hold dear and consider to be private.\n  The bill would eliminate some of the legal and economic disincentives \nimpeding voluntary two-way information sharing between private industry \nand government. It is a modest but essential first step, especially for \nbusinesses, large and small, trying to protect their networks and \ninformation.\n  Just this week, I met with an individual whose trade association has \nbeen compromised, according to the FBI. Indeed, back in 2012, when we \nwere debating whether to bring the Lieberman-Collins cyber security \nbill to the Senate floor, one of the chief opponents was being hacked \nat that very time but did not know it until the FBI went to\n\n[[Page S6338]]\n\nthat business organization and informed them.\n  While this bill promotes sharing between the government and the \nprivate sector--and that is an important and essential step--it does \nlittle to harden the protection of Federal networks or to guard the \ncritical infrastructure on which we rely every day. Thus, I am \nintroducing, with several of my colleagues, two amendments to further \nstrengthen our Nation's cyber security posture. It would be a good \nfirst step if we could just pass this bill as it was reported by the \nIntelligence Committee, but I believe also strengthening the civilian \nside of the Federal Government and our critical infrastructure is \nessential for us to do the job completely and effectively.\n  I want to make clear that I recognize there is no law we could ever \nwrite that is going to prevent every cyber attack. That is not \npossible. But there are effective actions we can and should take that \nwould lessen the chances of these attacks occurring and that would \ndecrease the opportunities for these intrusions. So we must act. It is \nincumbent upon us.\n  For the millions of current, former, and retired Federal employees \nwhose personal data was stolen from the poorly secured databases at the \nOffice of Personnel Management, the threat posed by adversaries to \ninadequately protected Federal networks is all too real. As the FBI \nDirector testified before the Intelligence Committee in open session \nlast month, this breach is a ``huge deal'' and represents a treasure \ntrove of information for potential adversaries. But this cyber hack \nalso points to a broader problem--the glaring gaps in the process for \nprotecting sensitive information stored in Federal civilian agency \nnetworks.\n  To respond, 2 weeks ago I introduced bipartisan legislation with \nSenators Warner, Mikulski, Coats, Ayotte, and McCaskill that would \nstrengthen the security of the networks of Federal civilian agencies. \nMost importantly, our legislation would grant the Department of \nHomeland Security the authority to issue binding operational directives \nto Federal agencies to respond in the face of a substantial or imminent \nthreat to Federal networks to ensure that immediate action is taken.\n  Think of all those IG reports that OPM leaders completely ignored. \nThey go back to 2008. Last fall the IG issued a report which sounded a \nwarning which was so serious that he recommended that certain networks \nbe taken down until they were better protected. But OPM officials \nlargely ignored those warnings, those calls for action. That is why we \nneed to empower the Department of Homeland Security in a situation like \nthat to act, just as NSA acts to protect the dot-mil domain, the \nmilitary and intelligence agencies in the Federal Government.\n  I am pleased to report that all of the key elements of our bill were \nincorporated into legislation unanimously approved last week by the \nSenate homeland security committee. I thank the chairman, Senator Ron \nJohnson, and the ranking member, Senator Tom Carper, for making those \nimprovements in their bill and incorporating our bill. We have joined \ntogether to file an amendment to add the committee-approved bill to the \ncyber security legislation.\n  The primary problem our amendment would solve is that the Department \nof Homeland Security has the mandate to protect the dot-gov domain, but \nit only has limited authority to do so. As I said, this approach \ncontrasts sharply with how the National Security Agency defends the \ndot-mil domain, the information in the military and intelligence agency \nnetworks. The Director of the NSA has the responsibility and the \nauthority from the Secretary of Defense to monitor all DOD networks and \nto deploy countermeasures on those networks. If the Director finds that \nthere is an insecure computer system and wants to take it off the \nnetwork, he has the authority to do so.\n  Although the Secretary of Homeland Security is tasked with a similar \nresponsibility to protect Federal civilian networks, he has far less \nauthority to accomplish this task. Yet--think about it--Federal \ncivilian agencies, such as OPM, the Internal Revenue Service, the \nSocial Security Administration, and Medicare, are the repositories of \nvast quantities of very sensitive personal data of Americans that must \nbe better protected. We have that obligation. Our bill would help \nensure that occurs.\n  Our amendment would harden Federal computer networks from cyber \nthreats. I urge my colleagues to support the Johnson-Carper-Collins-\nWarner amendment.\n  I have also filed a second amendment aimed at protecting our \ncountry's most vital critical infrastructure from cyber attacks. For 99 \npercent of private sector entities, the voluntary information sharing \nframework established in this cyber legislation will be sufficient, and \nthe decision to share cyber threat information should be left up to \nthem. It should be voluntary.\n  A second tier of reporting is necessary to protect the critical \ninfrastructure that affects the safety, health, and economic well-being \nof every American. My amendment would create a second tier of reporting \nto the government that would be mandatory but only for critical \ninfrastructure where a cyber intrusion could reasonably be expected to \nresult in catastrophic regional or national threats on public health or \nsafety, economic security, or national security.\n  The Department of Homeland Security has already identified fewer than \n65 entities--that is all we are talking about--out of all the hundreds \nof thousands of businesses and private sector entities in the United \nStates, they have identified 65 entities where damage caused by a \nsubstantial but single cyber attack could cause catastrophic harm. How \nis ``catastrophic harm'' defined? It is defined as causing or having \nthe likelihood to cause $50 billion in economic damage, 2,500 \nfatalities, or a severe degradation of our national security. My \namendment would just take that definition and require reporting from \nthose entities--that would be mandatory if there were a cyber attack--\nand no one else.\n  Without information about intrusions into our most critical \ninfrastructure, our government's ability to defend our country against \nadvanced persistent threats will suffer in a domain where speed is \ncritical.\n  Let me further explain why this amendment is necessary. The fact is \nthat 85 percent of our country's critical infrastructure is owned by \nthe private sector, and we are not nearly as prepared as we should be \nfor a cyber attack that could cause deaths, destruction, and \ndevastation. A recent study by the University of Cambridge and Lloyds \nInsurance found that a major cyber attack on the U.S. electric grid \ncould result in a blackout in 15 States and Washington, DC, that could \ncause more than $1 trillion in economic impact and $71 billion in \ninsurance claims.\n  Under my amendment, the owners and operators of our country's most \ncritical infrastructure would be required to report significant cyber \nintrusions, similar to the manner in which incidents of communicable \ndiseases must be reported to public health authorities and the Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention. Think about the ironic situation we \nhave. Does it make sense that we require a single case of measles to be \nreported to the Federal Government but not an intrusion into the \nindustrial controls controlling a piece of critical infrastructure that \nif it were attacked successfully could result in the deaths of 2,500 \npeople?\n  The threats to our critical infrastructure are not hypothetical; they \nare already occurring in increasing frequency and severity. ADM Mike \nRogers, the Director of NSA, has described the cyber threat posed \nagainst critical infrastructure this way: ``We have . . . observed \nintrusions into industrial control systems. . . . What concerns us is \nthat . . . this capability could be used by nation-states, groups or \nindividuals to take down the capability of the control systems.''\n  Multiple natural gas pipeline companies were the targets of a \nsophisticated cyber intrusion campaign beginning in December of 2011, \nand our banks have been under cyber attacks repeatedly, most likely \nfrom Iran during the past 2 years.\n  By implementing this tiered reporting system for our country's \ncritical infrastructure at greatest risk of a devastating cyber attack, \nour government can develop and deploy countermeasures to protect its \nown networks as well as the information systems of\n\n[[Page S6339]]\n\nother critical infrastructure and help these critical infrastructure \nowners and operators to better safeguard their systems from further \nattacks.\n  Simply put, the current threat is too great and the existing \nvulnerability too widespread for us to depend solely on voluntary \nmeasures to protect the critical infrastructure on which our country \nand citizens depend.\n  Again, I want to emphasize, 99 percent of private sector entities \nwould just have a voluntary system. I am talking about fewer than 65 \nentities that operate critical infrastructure that the Department of \nHomeland Security has identified as at risk and has described that the \nconsequences would be either $50 billion in economic damage, 2,500 \ndeaths or a severe degradation of our national security.\n  Surely, if we have a cyber attack of that severity, we want to know \nabout it. We will need to act. Our laws have simply not kept pace with \nthe digital revolution. We must not wait any longer to make these \nreforms or be lulled into the mistaken belief that small incremental \nsteps will be enough to stay ahead of our adversaries in cyber space \nor, worse yet, that we take no action, that we allow a filibuster \nagainst even a modest bill to help us be more secure.\n  By adopting the underlying legislation, plus the two amendments my \ncolleagues and I have offered, we can begin the long overdue work of \nsecuring cyber space. In doing so, we will be securing our economic and \nnational security for the next generation.\n  I was in the Senate on that terrible day in September of 2001, on 9/\n11/2001, when our Nation was attacked. I was assigned the \nresponsibility, along with Joe Lieberman and the other members of what \nwas then the Governmental Affairs Committee, to look at whether that \nattack could have been prevented if the dots had been connected. The 9/\n11 Commission's conclusion was that most likely it could have been.\n  I don't want to be here after a massive cyber attack that has \nresulted in the deaths of thousands of our fellow Americans, severe \neconomic damage or a terrible degradation of our national security and \nask the question: Why did we not act? I am not saying any law can \nprevent every attack. Clearly, that is not the case. Our adversaries \nare infinitely creative, and they will keep probing our computer \nsystems, our cyber networks, but surely we ought to be doing everything \nwe can to make it far more difficult for any of these attacks to be \nsuccessful, surely we ought to pass the bill reported with only one \ndissenting vote by the Intelligence Committee, and surely we ought to \nstrengthen the protection of our critical infrastructure and our \nFederal civilian agencies.\n  We need to make sure we are doing everything we responsibly can do to \nlessen the possibilities of a cyber 9/11. I urge my colleagues to \nproceed to consider this important bill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, for the information of my colleagues, I \njust wanted to list the cosponsors of the amendment that I described \nhaving to do with critical infrastructure. I listed the cosponsors of \nthe amendment that deals with protecting civilian agencies but \nneglected to do so on the other. It is a bipartisan amendment. It is \ncosponsored by three other members of the Intelligence Committee: \nSenator Warner, Senator Coats, and Senator Hirono.\n  I just wanted that to be clear. I think it is significant that those \nmembers of the Intelligence Community do believe we need to go further \nin this arena.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                    Remembering David ``Dave'' Ruhl\n\n  Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, I rise to honor a fallen hero, David or \n``Dave'' Ruhl of Rapid City, SD. Dave was an engine captain on the \nMystic Ranger District of the Black Hills National Forest near Rapid \nCity. Since June 14, Dave had been serving our country on a temporary \nassignment as the assistant fire management officer on the Big Valley \nRanger District on the Modoc National Forest near Adin, CA.\n  Dave had been bravely and selflessly fighting the Frog Fire near \nAlturas, CA, along with many other firefighters who were risking their \nlives to protect the people and communities near that fire incident. \nFriends say he took this voluntary assignment to learn more about \nfirefighting and improve his skills because he was so passionate about \nhis profession.\n  Tragically, the team lost contact with Dave on Thursday evening, July \n30. Search and rescue teams worked diligently to locate Dave with the \nhope that he would be found safe. Sadly, Dave did not survive.\n  An investigation will reveal details about this very unfortunate and \ntragic loss of life, and there will be a learning which comes from \nthis. His death is a great loss to the State of South Dakota, and his \nlegacy and heroism will not be forgotten. Dave will be memorialized \nforever on the South Dakota Firefighter Memorial in Pierre, his name \netched in history for all to honor.\n  Professionally, Dave will be remembered as a passionate, \nknowledgeable, and well-trained firefighter. That is according to his \ncolleagues who admired him and respected him. His commitment to helping \nothers was evident throughout his life. Dave began his Forest Service \ncareer in 2001 as a seasonal forestry technician. Prior to that, he \nserved in the U.S. Coast Guard and as a correctional officer with the \nState of South Dakota.\n  Dave will also be remembered personally as a dad, a husband, and a \nselfless public servant who longed to help others. Dave leaves behind \nhis wife Erin and their two children Tyler and Ava of Rapid City. To \nthem, I offer my deepest sympathy.\n  While we cannot take away the hurt, please know we will never forget \nthe sacrifice Dave made, and we will not forget the sacrifice that you \nas his family have made. Not everyone is willing to put their life on \nthe line to protect us, but Dave did just exactly that. He put others \nbefore himself. Dave is a true hero.\n  We ask the Good Lord to bless the Ruhl family and their friends \nduring this difficult time and we ask all Americans to keep the Ruhl \nfamily in their thoughts and in their prayers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Nuclear Agreement with Iran\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, one thing we all agree on is that Iran \ncannot obtain a nuclear weapon. That has been the foundation of \nAmerican policy. For a long time, it has been at the root of these \nnegotiations. That has been our guidepost as a body. It certainly has \nbeen my guiding principle as I review the course of these negotiations \nand the agreement that is now before us. That is because we know what a \nnuclear-armed Iran would mean for U.S. security, for Israeli security, \nand for regional security. Not only would it make their provocations in \nthe region even more dangerous by giving them a nuclear cover of \nprotection, but it would also lead to a nuclear arms race in the \nregion.\n  That doesn't mean Iran's unacceptable conduct begins and ends with \nits pursuit of a nuclear weapons program. This is one of the largest \nstate sponsors of terrorism in the world. This is a country that has \ncalled for the obliteration of the Jewish State still to this day, \nchants for ``Death to America,'' a country that denies basic human \nrights and political liberties to its own citizens, and executes and \nimprisons thousands upon thousands of people who disagree with the \nregime.\n  But this agreement and these negotiations from the beginning have \nbeen about the nuclear issue. It has not attempted to resolve all of \nthese other very dangerous and malevolent behaviors that Iran engages \nin, in the region. We are focused on the nuclear issue because we \nfrankly believe we are more likely to deal with this other activity if \nwe remove the question of a potential nuclear weapons arsenal cover \nfrom the equation.\n\n[[Page S6340]]\n\n  So the test for this agreement is simple: Is Iran less likely to \nobtain a nuclear weapon with this deal than without it? Because I \nanswer yes to this question--because I believe they are less likely to \nget a nuclear weapon with this agreement than without it--I am going to \nsupport the agreement when it comes before the Senate for a vote this \nSeptember.\n  That doesn't mean there aren't parts of this agreement that I find \ndistasteful. I would have preferred for the duration of the agreement \nto be longer than the 10 to 15 years of many of its components. I would \nhave preferred to see fewer conditions on the inspections and on our \naccess to contested sites. I would like for Congress's ability to \nimpose new sanctions on nonnuclear activity of Iran to be clearer and \nless clouded as part of this agreement.\n  That being said, I think we achieved our objectives. Our negotiators \nachieved their objectives that they set out at the beginning. We have \nlengthened the breakout time from 2 to 3 months to now over a year. We \nhave reduced by 95 percent the amount of stored nuclear material that \nis housed within Iran's borders. We get an inspection regime which is \nabsolutely unprecedented. No other country has been subject to this \nkind of an inspection regime, not just as a declared site, not just the \nability to get to undeclared sites but a view of the entire supply \nchain that backs up their nuclear program.\n  There is an ability to snap back sanctions should they cheat, an \nability that is not conditioned on the support of countries such as \nRussia and China, and then an international consensus that undergirds \nthis entire agreement.\n  To me, this isn't a referendum on the agreement, the decision we are \ngoing to make in the Senate; it is a choice. It is a choice between one \nset of consequences that flow from supporting the agreement and then \nanother set of consequences that flow from a congressional rejection of \nthe agreement.\n  The set of consequences that occur if Congress rejects this agreement \nare pretty catastrophic. I would argue it would result in a big win for \nIranians. What would happen? First, the sanctions would fray, at best; \nat worst, they would fall apart. Iran would resume their nuclear \nprogram. Maybe they wouldn't rush to a bomb, but they would get closer. \nInspectors would be kicked out of the country so we lose eyes on what \nIran is doing.\n  For those who believe we should just come back to the table and get a \nbetter deal, you have a very high bar to argue. You have to make a case \nthat there are going to be a set of conditions that will cause Iran to \ncome back to the table and agree to something different, more \nstrenuous, and more rigorous than they did today. How does that happen \nif the sanctions are weaker and their nuclear program is stronger? It \ndoesn't. So this idea that you can get a better deal to me appears to \nbe pure fantasy.\n  Finally, I wish to spend a few minutes talking about this \njuxtaposition that the President has created that I know has caused \nsome in this Chamber to blanch--the idea that this is a choice between \nthis agreement or going to war. I understand that feels and sounds very \nunfair because no one who votes against this agreement believes they \nare voting to go to war. I want to make the case it is not as unfair as \nsome may think it is because if there is no deal, if there is no \nability to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon through a \nnegotiation, and if we accept the premise that we are not going to \nstand still, do nothing, and take a wait-and-see approach if they were \nto move closer to a bomb, then the only option is the military \noption. And I frankly think it is time we start taking seriously the \nrhetoric we are hearing from some Members of this body. Senator Cotton \nsaid this week that we could bomb Iran back to day zero if we took a \nmilitary route to divorcing Iran from a nuclear weapon.\n\n  Let us get back to reality for a second about what a military strike \nwould mean. You can set back Iran's nuclear program for a series of \nyears, but you cannot bomb Iran back to day zero unless you are also \nprepared to assassinate everyone in Iran who has worked on the nuclear \nprogram. Why? Because you can't destruct knowledge. You can't remove \nentirely from that country the set of facts that got them within 2 to 3 \nmonths of a nuclear weapon.\n  So I know Members bristle at this notion the President is suggesting \nthat it is a choice between an agreement or war, but there are Members \nof this body who are openly cheerleading for military engagement with \nIran, who are oversimplifying the effect of military action, who are \nblind to the reality of U.S. military activity in that region over the \ncourse of the last 10 to 15 years. This belief in the omnipotent \nunfailing power of the U.S. military is not based in reality.\n  We could set back a nuclear program for a series of years, but the \nconsequences to the region would be catastrophic. So I get that people \ndon't like the choice the President presents, but at some point we have \nto take Senator Cotton and his allies seriously when they continue to \nmake a case for war and oversimplify the effects of a military strike.\n  But let us be honest. This is all just a political agreement we are \ntalking about here today. So we do have to reserve the possibility that \nif all else fails and there is no other way to stop Iran from getting a \nnuclear weapon, we may have to take military action. None of us have \ntaken that wholly off the table. But a military strike, if it is \nnecessary, is made more effective if this deal is in place.\n  We will have more international legitimacy if we try diplomacy first \nand Iran rushes to the bomb in the context of this deal. We would have \nmore partners in this military action if we stuck together on this \nagreement.\n  I won't say war isn't an option, but I know it is more likely to be \nsuccessful and effective in the context of this agreement than without \nit. And I certainly would challenge anyone--Senator Cotton and others--\nwho try to simplify the effects of a military strike or suggest that it \nis the immediate alternative to this agreement.\n  In 1993, Yitzhak Rabin said, when talking about Israel's decision to \nrecognize the PLO, that ``you don't make peace with your friends, you \nmake it with very unsavory enemies.'' Diplomacy is never easy, and the \nresults of diplomacy are never pretty.\n  This isn't peace with Iran. We still reserve the right to fight them \ntooth and nail on their support for terrorism, on their denial of the \nright of Israel to exist, and their miserable human rights record. But \nthe question still remains: Is the world better off with this agreement \nor is the world better off if this agreement falls apart at the hands \nof the Congress and we are right back to square one?\n  I believe Iran is less likely to become a nuclear weapons state with \nthis agreement than without it, and I am going to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                             Whistleblowers\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor, as I often do, to \nspeak about the efforts of whistleblowers. Many of you know my belief \nin and my respect for those patriotic people--men and women who, often \nat great cost to their own careers and personal well-being, raise their \nvoices when they see things happening they know are wrong, usually \nagainst the law or the misuse of taxpayer money. So it was with great \njoy that I participated just last Thursday with about two dozen \nwhistleblowers and hundreds of their families, friends, and supporters \nin the first annual congressional celebration of National \nWhistleblowers Day.\n  In my remarks to that group, I said that agency leadership needs to \nfollow the example my colleagues and I set with the Whistleblower \nProtection Caucus. They need to send a strong signal that \nwhistleblowers are valued and that retaliation will not be tolerated. \nAfter all, the need to protect whistleblowers is not new and it is not \ngoing away.\n  In the midst of the whistleblowers appreciation day celebration, I \nreceived yet another harsh reminder that retaliation is alive and well \nin the executive branch's bureaucracies. At the very time several of my \ncolleagues and I shared our appreciation for whistleblowers, U.S. \nMarshals Service whistleblowers told me the hunt was on for folks in \nthat agency who disclosed wrongdoing to my office.\n  How ironic, as we recognized the bravery and the benefits of \nwhistleblowers in the past, a new set of\n\n[[Page S6341]]\n\ntruthtellers were facing harsh consequences that all too often come \nwith their brave action in exposing wrongdoing.\n  Agencies use many pretexts to hunt, to punish, and to intimidate \nwhistleblowers. So what is the pretext the Marshals Service is using? I \nam told the Marshals Service has launched an internal affairs \ninvestigation to find what they describe as a leak to the media and \nwhat harm a leak to the media does.\n  Well, this is a dubious claim. For one, news stories about the \nproblems at the Marshals Service are not new. Second, there are many \nstories in several different magazines and newspapers that strongly \nsuggest there are many sources of those news leaks.\n  Finally, I understand the Marshals Service internal affairs has \nallegedly seized the personal property of at least one of its so-called \ntargets. I also understand this personal property contains privileged \ncommunications with the target's attorneys and protected disclosures to \nMembers of Congress.\n  I wish to note some things for leaders at the Marshals Service and at \nany Federal agency. First, protection for whistleblowers under the \nWhistleblowers Protection Act is not just there for reporting to \nCongress or reporting to the inspector general or reporting to the \nOffice of Special Counsel. The Supreme Court has said disclosures to \nmedia may be covered if the disclosure is not specifically prohibited \nby statute or Executive order, even if such disclosure violates an \nagency rule.\n  So not only does this investigation appear to be retaliatory, but its \nsupposed justification is obviously not legitimate.\n  Second, even if there were nothing suspicious or retaliatory about \nthe so-called investigation, it cannot be true that investigators need \nprotected and privileged material to carry it out.\n  Third, the recent track record of the Marshals Service on \nwhistleblower protection is pretty dismal. The internal affairs inquiry \nfollows months of investigation by Congress, the inspector general, and \nthe Office of Special Counsel into allegations of misconduct at the \nU.S. Marshals Service. It also follows at least two inaccurate and \nmisleading responses from the Marshals Service and the Justice \nDepartment to letters from my committee. And it follows numerous \nletters reporting allegations of widespread retaliation and very deep \nfears that employees have of such reprisal.\n  Just so we are very clear, over 60 current and former U.S. Marshals \nService employees have made disclosures to my office since March. That \nis over 1.1 percent of the agency. Many of the reports include \nallegations that the Marshals Service frequently uses internal affairs \ninvestigations as mechanisms for reprisal. Reprisal for what, one might \nask--for engaging in activities that are explicitly protected by law.\n  Multiple whistleblowers from all across the Marshals Service have \nalso told me that internal affairs does whatever it can to charge \nemployees with misconduct, regardless of what the evidence actually \nsays. So I thought the Justice Department would understand why I have \nconcerns about this investigation and about the way the marshals are \napparently handling it.\n  Remarkably, the Justice Department has told me that is all none of my \nbusiness, and, of course, I strongly disagree. When you hear these \nsorts of things once or twice, there is a bit of a problem. When you \nhear them more than 60 times, coming directly to my office in less than \n5 months, you start to understand there is a pattern out there.\n  From where I sit, it seems to me the best thing for the agency to do \nis to get some outside input into this so-called investigation. The \nDepartment should be willing to work with me, other Members of \nCongress, the inspector general, and the Office of Special Counsel to \nensure that whistleblower rights are fully protected as the law \nintends. But officials won't even sit down and talk to us about it.\n  Senator Leahy and I sent a joint letter to the Attorney General last \nFriday asking for a briefing as soon as possible. The answer? They \nclaimed it would be inappropriate to discuss it with the two of us. I \nwill tell you what would be inappropriate: using internal \nadministrative inquiries to hunt down whistleblowers and stiff-arm a \ncongressional scrutiny. That is what would be inappropriate.\n\n  If the Justice Department and the Marshals Service think I am going \nto go away or give up on this, they are even less competent than I \nfear.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Sullivan pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1944 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. HEINRICH: Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Nuclear Agreement With Iran\n\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, in the first decade of this century, \nwhen the policies of President George W. Bush entangled our Nation \nfirmly in the war in Iraq, Iran's nuclear program surged ahead rapidly \nand unchecked. They added thousands and thousands of centrifuges. They \nbuilt numerous and complex nuclear facilities. They stockpiled highly \nenriched uranium. As we evaluate the proposed nuclear accord with Iran, \nit is important to compare what we have achieved with our allies \nagainst this reality.\n  I firmly believe that as we work to ensure that Iran is never able to \ndevelop nuclear weapons, facts, data, and details actually matter far \nmore than the rhetoric you hear here in Washington, DC. Perhaps it is \njust the engineer in me, but when the accord became public, I sat down \nthat morning and I started highlighting numbers. People in Washington \nare amazingly adept at arguing that up is down and that right is left. \nBut numbers and data are a little harder to bend to our rhetorical \nwill.\n  Let's start with this most important and critical data point: Without \na deal, Iran has enough nuclear material stockpiled that they could \nacquire enough highly enriched material for a bomb in 2 to 3 months. \nThat is what you hear talked about on the news as breakout time. Today \nIran's breakout time is 2 to 3 months. They have enough material that \nwere they to move forward, they could break out in just a matter of \nmonths. With this accord in place, their pathway forward is blocked. \nWhat is more, the breakout time is pushed back to over a year, giving \nus and our allies around the world enough time to make sure they don't \nmove down this very dangerous path.\n  Let's move on to another key data point. If you went back to 2003, \nIran only had 164 centrifuges. They surged forward--adding centrifuges, \nadding more advanced and complex centrifuges--to where they now have \n19,000 centrifuges today.\n  With this deal, once again, that number has rolled back. It has \nrolled back by two-thirds. But more importantly, of the 6,000 that \nremain, 1,000 of those cannot be used for enrichment, and all of them \nare the most basic and primitive IR-1 models.\n  In addition, without a deal, Iran has amassed 12,000 kilograms, which \nis over 26,000 pounds of enriched uranium. This slide shows the public \na representative example of what that would look like today. Under this \naccord, that is rolled back by 98 percent to just 300 kilograms. So \nstarting from over 26,000 pounds, or 12,000 kilograms, and reducing it \nby 98 percent, they no longer have the capacity or the stockpile to be \nable to quickly move forward to a weaponization scenario.\n  In addition, it is important to realize Iran had enriched some of its \nstockpile to 20 percent. That is a very dangerous figure because 20 \npercent is actually a lot closer to weapons grade, and that would \nenable them to move quickly to weapons grade. It actually takes far \nlonger to get to 4 percent than it does to get from 20 percent to a \nweaponized enrichment level.\n  Under this accord, what previously was an enormous stockpile--and \nwhere some of that stockpile had actually reached dangerous levels of \nenrichment--will be rolled back to a point\n\n[[Page S6342]]\n\nwhere all of the very limited 300 kilograms have to be below 4 percent, \na level of concentration and enrichment that is appropriate for \npeaceful energy purposes but not for a weapons program.\n  In addition, without this accord, Iran's uranium stockpile today is \nlarge enough to yield 10 to 12 nuclear bombs. With this accord, they \nwon't have enough stockpile--enough material--to produce even a single \nnuclear bomb.\n  Now, we all know that verification is key to success, and under this \ndeal Iran must allow 24/7 inspections and continuous video monitoring \nat its nuclear infrastructure, including Natanz, Fordow, the Arak \nreactor, and all of its uranium mining, milling, and processing \nfacilities. Furthermore, there is a mechanism in place that will allow \ninspections of any additional sites, should we suspect covert action is \nbeing taken to build a bomb outside of their existing supply chain. \nConsequently, this accord breaks each and every pathway that Iran has \ndeveloped to create a weaponized nuclear device, including any \npotential covert effort that they might pursue. We should welcome each \nof those developments as a major step toward both regional and \ninternational security.\n  I have thought about these issues for a long time. I have thought \nabout both the science and the politics of the nuclear age since I was \na young boy. I remember growing up listening to my dad because he was \nthere when this age started. He watched nuclear devices being exploded \nin the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific. He told me stories of \nwhat it was like to watch a mushroom cloud form over Enewetak Atoll.\n  When I was studying engineering at the University of Missouri, I \nworked at one of the largest research reactors in the country. I know \nwhat it is like to look down into that blue glow of a reactor pool. As \na Senator from the State of New Mexico, I have seen firsthand many of \nthe world's centrifuges which are housed in my home State of New Mexico \nand dedicated to the peaceful production of energy.\n  Serving on the Armed Services Committee, I helped set policy on \nnonproliferation and nuclear deterrence. As a member of the Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence, I have received numerous briefings on \nboth Iran's nuclear program and their capabilities. I am well \nacquainted with the steps necessary to successfully construct a nuclear \nweapon and the steps necessary to detect that kind of activity. It is \nbecause of this familiarity that I am confident in this accord.\n  The comprehensive, long-term deal achieved earlier this month \nincludes all of the necessary tools to break each potential Iranian \npathway to a nuclear bomb. Further, it incorporates enough lead time--\nthe breakout time that we talked about before, which we currently are \nin dire need of--so that should Iran change its course in the future, \nthe United States and the world can react well before a device can be \nbuilt. We hope that scenario never occurs, but should that happen--even \nwith this accord--it truly leaves all of our options on the table, \nincluding the military option.\n  Some of my colleagues in the Senate object to this historical \naccomplishment, saying that we could have done better; however, none of \nthem have offered any realistic alternatives. The only concrete \nalternative, should Congress reject this deal, has been to engage in a \nmilitary strike against Iran. While the military option will always \nremain on the table for the United States, even as we implement this \naccord, it should remain our absolute last resort.\n  As one can imagine, our military and intelligence leaders have looked \nat the potential repercussions should a direct military conflict with \nIran occur. That dangerous path would provoke retaliation, instability, \nand would likely lead to a nuclear-armed Iran in a matter of just a few \nyears rather than decades or never. Needless to say, this would be an \nirresponsible mistake.\n  As former Brigadier General and Deputy to Israel's National Security \nAdvisor Shlomo Brom has said, ``This agreement represents the best \nchance to make sure Iran never obtains a weapon and the best chance for \nCongress to support American diplomacy--without taking any options off \nthe table for this or future presidents.''\n  For too long, our country has been engaged in overseas military \nconflicts that have cost our Nation dearly in both blood and treasure. \nWe must always be ready at a moment's notice to defend our country, to \ndefend our allies, and even our interests, but we must also look to \navoid conflict whenever a diplomatic option is present and possible. At \nthis extraordinary moment, I am convinced that this accord is in the \nbest interest of our Nation and that of our allies.\n  I am still deeply distrustful of Iran's leadership. To make peace, \nyou negotiate with your enemies, not with your friends. Obviously any \ndeal with Iran will not be without risk, but the risks and the \nconsequences of rejecting this deal are far, far more dire. This deal \nsets the stage for a safer and more stable Middle East and, for that \nmatter, a more secure United States of America. We must seize this \nhistoric opportunity.\n  I yield the rest of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Boozman). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the \ncloture motion with respect to the motion to proceed to S. 754.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time \nto be determined by the majority leader, in consultation with the \nDemocratic leader, the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar \nNo. 28, S. 754; I further ask that Senator Burr then be recognized to \noffer the Burr-Feinstein substitute amendment and that it be in order \nfor the bill managers or their designees to offer up to 10 first-degree \namendments relevant to the subject matter per side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. For the information of all Senators, the first \namendments on the Republican side will be the following: Paul No. 2564, \nHeller No. 2548, Flake No. 2582, Vitter No. 2578, Vitter No. 2579, \nCotton No. 2581, Kirk No. 2603, Coats No. 2604, Gardner No. 2631, Flake \nNo. 2580.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I assume we would alternate with Republican \nand Democrat amendments; is that right?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the agreement \nbe modified to allow 11 Democratic amendments instead of 10.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. They will be as follows: Carper No. 2627, Coons No. 2552, \nFranken No. 2612, Tester No. 2632, Leahy No. 2587, Murphy No. 2589, \nWhitehouse No. 2626, Wyden No. 2621, Wyden No. 2622, Mikulski No. 2557, \nand Carper No. 2615.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.J. Res. 61\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nleader remarks on Tuesday, September 8, the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of H.J. Res. 61 and that the majority leader or his \ndesignee be recognized to offer a substitute amendment related to \ncongressional disapproval of the proposed Iran nuclear agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I want the \ndebate we are going to have in a matter of weeks to be--and I think all \nof us do--dignified and befitting the gravity of one of the most \nimportant issues of the\n\n[[Page S6343]]\n\nday. This is a step forward, and I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, with this agreement, we set up \nexpedited consideration of the cyber bill and the Iran resolution. The \nSenate will hold voice votes on Executive nominations, but there will \nbe no further rollcall votes this week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, so that all are clear with respect to where \nmatters are with the cyber security legislation, a couple of days ago \nit was my fear that this bill would be brought up--it is a badly flawed \nbill--with no opportunity for Senators on either side of the aisle to \nfix the legislation. I was afraid that it would come up with no \namendments and people would say ``Oh my goodness, there are serious \ncyber threats.'' And that is unquestionably correct. My constituents in \nOregon, for example, have been hacked by the Chinese. I was concerned \nthat people would say ``We have all of these cyber threats; we have to \nact'' and there would be no real opportunity to show how the \nlegislation in its current form creates more problems than it solves.\n  So that all concerned understand where things are, there are going to \nbe more than 20 amendments to this badly flawed bill. Those of us who \nwant to make sure there is a full airing of the issues have come to \nunderstand that there is no time limit that has yet been agreed to on \nthose amendments. So there is going to be a real debate, and, of \ncourse, that is what the Senate is all about.\n  I particularly wish to commend the millions of advocates around the \ncountry who spoke out. I understand there was something like 6 million \nfaxes that were sent to Members of this body.\n  I am going to take a few minutes--I see my colleagues are here as \nwell--to describe where I think this debate is and give a sense of what \nthe challenge is going forward.\n  I start with the basic proposition that we have a very serious set of \ncyber security threats, and I touched on seeing it at home. Second, \ninformation sharing can be valuable. There is certainly a lot of it \nnow. It can be constructive. Information sharing, however, without \nvigorous, robust privacy safeguards, will not be considered by millions \nof Americans to be a cyber security bill. Millions of Americans will \nsay that legislation is a surveillance bill.\n  So what I am going to do tonight--just for a few minutes because it \nis my understanding there are colleagues who would also like to speak--\nis describe exactly where this debate is.\n  As written, the cyber security legislation prevents law-abiding \nAmericans from suing private companies that inappropriately share their \npersonal information with the government. When I say personal \ninformation, I am talking about the contents of emails, financial \ninformation, basically any data at all that is stored electronically. \nCISA, as the bill is called, would allow private companies to share \nlarge volumes of their customers' personal information with the \ngovernment after only a cursory review. Colleagues who want to look at \nthat provision ought to take a look at page 16 of the bill.\n  We were told repeatedly that this legislation is voluntary. The fact \nis, it is voluntary for the companies, but for the citizens of \nPennsylvania, the citizens of Oregon, citizens across this country, it \nis not voluntary. The people of Pennsylvania won't be asked first \nwhether they want their information sent to the government. Oregonians \nwon't have the chance to say whether they want that information sent. \nFor them, this legislation is mandatory.\n  To explain the damage that I believe this legislation would do, I \nwant to take a minute to explain how cyber security information sharing \nworks now. Right now the Department of Homeland Security operates a \nnational cyber security watch center 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. \nThis watch center receives cyber security threat information from \naround the Federal Government and from private companies, and this \nwatch center sends out alerts and bulletins to security professionals \nto provide them with technical information about cyber security \nthreats. In fiscal year 2014, this watch center sent out nearly 12,000 \nof these alerts to more than 100,000 recipients. That happens today, \nwith lots of companies participating.\n  The system that is in place today includes rules to protect the \nprivacy of law-abiding Americans. These rules ensure that companies \nhave a strong interest in protecting the privacy of their customers. \nBut the legislation as it has been written now overrides those rules. \nThe bill in front of us prevents individual Americans from suing \ncompanies that have mishandled their private information. As a result, \ncompanies would suddenly, in my view, not have the same incentives with \nrespect to caring about sharing their customers' personal information \nwith the government. And my concern and the concern, I believe, of \nmillions of Americans is that the interests of some who are \noverzealous--overzealous in government, overzealous in the private \nsector--would overwhelm the interests of all of those customers who \nvoluntarily handed over their information.\n  I thought I would give a couple of examples of the problems the bill \nin its current form causes. Imagine that a health insurance company \nfinds out that millions of its customers' records have been stolen. If \nthat company has any evidence about who the hackers were or how they \nstole this information, of course it makes sense to share that \ninformation with the government. But that company shouldn't simply say \n``Here you go'' and hand millions of its customers' financial and \nmedical information over to a wide array of government agencies.\n  The records of the victims of a hack should not be treated the same \nway that information about the hacker is treated. If companies are \nsharing information for cyber security purposes, they ought to be \nrequired to make reasonable efforts to remove personal information that \nisn't needed for cyber security before that information is handed over \nto the government. And those government agencies ought to focus on \nusing that information to combat a cyber security threat.\n  That, I say to my colleagues, is not what the bill says. Page 16 of \nthe bill would very clearly authorize companies to share large amounts \nof personal information that is unnecessary for cyber security, after \nonly a cursory review.\n  Now I wish to speak about just one other issue specifically that I \nthink Senators are not familiar with, and that is the issue of cyber \nsignatures. Cyber signatures are essentially recognizable patterns in \nonline code. A number of informed observers have raised the concern \nthat once individual cyber signatures are shoveled over to the \ngovernment by private companies, they could be used as the basis for \nbroad surveillance affecting law-abiding Americans. I am not going to \nconfirm or deny any of the press reports that have raised concerns \nabout cyber signatures being used in this way, but I believe Senators \nshould understand that this is certainly--and it is being widely \ndiscussed in the public arena--a theoretical possibility, and that \nhelps underscore the importance of including a strong requirement for \nprivate companies to remove unrelated personal information about their \ncustomers before dumping data over to the government.\n  In wrapping up, I would be remiss if I didn't note that a secret \nJustice Department legal opinion that is clearly relevant to the cyber \nsecurity debate continues to be withheld from the public. This opinion \ninterprets common commercial service agreements, and in my judgment it \nis inconsistent with the public's understanding of the law. So once \nagain we have this question of what happens when the people of \nPennsylvania, Virginia, or Oregon think there is a law because they \nhave read it in the public arena or on their iPad at home and then \nthere is a secret interpretation.\n  I have urged the Justice Department to withdraw that secret \nDepartment of Justice opinion that relates directly to the cyber \nsecurity debate. They have declined to do so. I suspect many Senators \nhaven't had the chance to review it. As I have done before on this type \nof topic, I would urge Senators or their staffs to take the time to \nread it because I believe that understanding the executive branch's \ninterpretation of these agreements is an important part of \nunderstanding the relevant legal landscape on cyber security.\n\n[[Page S6344]]\n\n  I am going to close by speaking about the question of effectiveness. \nI think we all understand that we are facing very real cyber threats. I \nam of the view that this bill in its present form would do little, if \nanything, to stop large, sophisticated cyber attacks like the Office of \nPersonnel Management had.\n  I don't think Senators ought to just take my word for it. In April, \n65 technologists and cyber security professionals expressed their \nopposition to the bill in a letter to Chairman Burr and Vice Chairman \nFeinstein. In referring to the bill and two similar bills, they wrote:\n\n       We appreciate your interest in making our networks more \n     secure, but the legislation proposed does not materially \n     further that goal, and at the same time it puts our users' \n     privacy at risk.\n\n  As they wrap up their letter, this group of technologists and cyber \nsecurity professionals state:\n\n       These bills weaken privacy law without promoting security.\n\n  That has always been my concern. If we look back at our experiences, \nwe have tried to write these new digital ground rules. Fortunately, we \ntook a step in the right direction as it related to NSA rules. The \nchallenge has always been the same. The people of our country want to \nbe safe and secure in their homes and in their businesses and in their \ncommunities, and they want their liberty. Ben Franklin said anybody who \ngives up their liberty to have security doesn't deserve either.\n  What troubled me and why I am glad that the Senate has stepped back \nfrom precipitous action where we would have just passed this bill \nwithout any amendments--we will have a chance in the fall to look at \nways to address cyber security in a fashion that I think does respond \nto what our people want, and that is to show that security--in this \ncase, cyber security--and liberty are not mutually exclusive. It is \nsensible policies worked out in a bipartisan way that will respond to \nthe needs of this country in what is unquestionably a dangerous time.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                             Islamic State\n\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, we are about to start our traditional \nAugust recess. Congress is in an interesting place because we not only \nget a recess--a vacation--as many Americans do, but we are legally \nrequired to take one. That is right. By an act of Congress, Congress is \nrequired, absent a separate agreement, to take a month off during \nAugust. I learned that just yesterday during a great presentation from \none of our Senate Historians, Kate Scott.\n  This mandated August adjournment is part of the Legislative \nReorganization Act of 1970. The act provides that in odd-numbered \nyears, the Houses adjourn from the first Friday in August until the \nTuesday after Labor Day. There is an exception: The mandated recess \n``shall not be applicable if on July 31 of such year a state of war \nexists pursuant to a declaration of war by Congress.'' Again, the \nmandated recess is not applicable if on July 31 of such year a state of \nwar exists pursuant to a declaration of war by Congress. This provision \nmakes basic sense, doesn't it? Congress shouldn't go out for a \nmandatory 30-day vacation when the Nation is at war. It is not right \nthat American troops should risk their lives overseas far from home \nwhile Congress takes a month off. The Congress that passed this bill in \n1970 had an expectation about how serious war was and how Congress--the \ninstitution charged with declaring war--would treat such a serious \nobligation.\n  Well, we are about to go on a 1-month adjournment with the Nation at \nwar. In fact, this Saturday, August 8, marks 1 year since President \nObama initiated U.S. airstrikes against the Islamic State in northern \nIraq.\n  In the past year, more than 3,000 members of the U.S. military have \nserved in Operation Inherent Resolve--and thousands are there now--\nlaunching more than 4,500 airstrikes, carrying out Special Forces \noperations, and assisting the Iraqi military, the Kurdish Peshmerga, \nand Syrians fighting the Islamic State. Virginians connected with the \nUSS Roosevelt carrier group are stationed there right now.\n  We have made major gains in northern Iraq and, more recently, in \nnorthern Syria, but the threat posed by the Islamic State continues to \nspread in the region and beyond. The war has cost over $3.2 billion \nthrough mid-July--an average of $9.5 million a day--and seven American \nservicemembers have lost their lives serving in support of the mission.\n  Recently we have heard that the administration may be expanding the \nscope of the war to defend U.S.-trained Syrian fighters against \nattacks, including from the Assad regime. We are expanding our \ncooperation with Turkey in the region. We even hear rumors of a U.S.-\nTurkish humanitarian zone in northern Syria. Each of these steps is \npotentially significant and could lead to even more unforeseen \nexpansions of the ongoing war. We have already had testimony by \nmilitary leaders to suggest that the war will likely go on for years.\n  But as the war expands and our troops risk their lives far from home \nand as we prepare to go on our traditional 1-month recess, a tacit \nagreement to avoid debating this war persists in Washington.\n  The President maintains that he can conduct this war without \nauthorization from Congress. He waited more than 6 months after the war \nstarted to even send Congress a draft authorization of the mission.\n  Congressional behavior has been even more unusual. Although vested \nwith the sole power to declare war by article I of the Constitution, \nCongress has refused to meaningfully debate or vote on the war against \nthe Islamic State. A Congress quick to criticize any Executive action \nby the President has nevertheless encouraged him to carry out an \nunauthorized war. As far as our allies, the Islamic State, or our \ntroops know, Congress is indifferent to this war.\n  I first introduced a resolution to force Congress to do its job and \nto debate this war in September of 2014. That led in December to an \naffirmative vote by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to authorize \nthe war with specific limitations. But the matter wasn't taken up on \nthe floor because the Senate was about to change to a new majority, and \nthat party wanted to analyze the issue afresh.\n\n  Six months then went by, and Senator Jeff Flake and I introduced, \nfinally, a bipartisan war resolution in June to prod the Senate to take \nits constitutional responsibility seriously after so many months of \ninaction. We wanted to show there is a bipartisan consensus against the \nIslamic State. The result: a few discussions in the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, but otherwise silence.\n  One year of war against the Islamic State has transformed a President \nwho was elected in part because of his early opposition to the Iraq War \ninto an Executive war President. It has stretched the 2001 \nAuthorization for Use of Military Force that was passed to defeat the \nperpetrators of 9/11 far beyond its original meaning or intent. It has \nshown to all that neither the Congress nor the President feels obliged \nto follow the 1973 War Powers Resolution, which requires the President \nto cease any unilateral military action within 90 days unless Congress \nvotes to approve it. And it has demonstrated that Congress would rather \navoid its constitutional duty to declare war than have a meaningful \ndebate about whether and how the United States should militarily \nconfront the Islamic State.\n  This 1-year anniversary also coincides a few minutes ago with a \nvigorous congressional effort to challenge U.S. diplomacy regarding the \nIranian nuclear agreement. The contrast between congressional \nindifference to war and its energetic challenge to diplomacy is most \ndisturbing.\n  So, why isn't Congress doing its job?\n  Last month I asked Marine Commandant Joseph Dunford, nominated to be \nthe next Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, whether congressional \naction to finally authorize the war against the Islamic State would be \nwell received by American troops. His answer said it all. ``I think \nwhat our young men and women need--and it's really all they need to do \nwhat we ask them to do--is a sense that what they're doing has purpose, \nhas meaning, and has the support of the American people.''\n  A debate in Congress by the people's elected representatives and a \nvote to authorize the most solemn act of war is how we tell our troops \nthat what they\n\n[[Page S6345]]\n\nare doing--what they are risking their lives for--``has purpose, has \nmeaning, and has the support of the American people.'' Otherwise, we \nare asking them to risk their lives without even bothering to discuss \nwhether the mission is something we support. Can there be anything--\nanything--more immoral than that--to order troops to risk their lives \nin support of a military mission that we are unwilling even to discuss?\n  One year in, our servicemembers are doing their jobs, but they are \nstill waiting on us to do ours. And as I conclude--oh, yeah, what about \nthat August recess? How can we go away and adjourn for a month in the \nmidst of an ongoing war?\n  Why, that is easy. The part of the statute that creates an exception \nfor the mandatory August adjournment applies only if there has been ``a \ndeclaration of war by the Congress.'' Because we haven't even bothered \nto debate or authorize this war in the year since it started, we are \nstill entitled by statute to take the month of August off.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                 Economic Security for American Workers\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, in today's economy, too many of our \nworkers across this country are underpaid, they are overworked, and \nthey are treated unfairly on the job. In short, they lack fundamental \neconomic security.\n  In Congress, we have got to act to give our workers much needed \nrelief. We need to grow our economy from the middle out, not the top \ndown. And we should make sure our country works for all Americans, not \njust the wealthiest few. There is no reason we can't get to work on \nlegislation to do just that. That is why I am here this afternoon, \njoining my colleagues in calling for us in the Senate to move on some \nimportant policies that will help restore economic security and \nstability to more of our workers.\n  Mr. President, I understand that we are waiting for one of my \nRepublican colleagues to come to the floor before I ask unanimous \nconsent, so I will pause for just a minute.\n  But I will say while we are waiting that we are very concerned about \nmany Americans today who make few dollars an hour, who don't have paid \nsick leave, who are told to go to work at hours that they cannot \ncontrol or know about, and we are introducing legislation or asking to \nintroduce legislation today to deal with all of those issues.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1150\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be \ndetermined by the majority leader, following consultation with the \nDemocratic leader and no later than Friday, October 30, the HELP \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. 1150, the \nRaise the Wage Act; that the Senate proceed to its immediate \nconsideration; that the bill be read a third time; that the Senate vote \non passage of the bill, and the motion to reconsider be considered made \nand laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, on behalf of the chairman of the HELP \nCommittee, Senator Alexander, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 497\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to \nbe determined by the majority leader, following consultation with the \nDemocratic leader, and no later than Friday, October 30, the HELP \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. 497, the \nHealthy Families Act; that the Senate proceed to its immediate \nconsideration; that the bill be read a third time; that the Senate vote \non passage of the bill, and the motion to reconsider be considered made \nand laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, on behalf of the chairman of the HELP \nCommittee, Senator Alexander, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1772\n\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to \nbe determined by the majority leader, following consultation with the \nDemocratic leader and no later than Friday, October 30, the HELP \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. 1772, the \nSchedules That Work Act; that the Senate proceed to its immediate \nconsideration; that the bill be read a third time; that the Senate vote \non passage of the bill, and the motion to reconsider be considered made \nand laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, on behalf of the chairman of the HELP \nCommittee, Senator Alexander, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, reclaiming the floor, it is disappointing \nto us that the Republican majority has objected to bringing these bills \nforward and blocking our efforts to provide some much needed economic \nstability and security for our workers in this country. Our workers \nhave been waiting a long time for relief from the trickle-down system \nthat has hurt our middle class.\n  This Senator wants to put the Senate on notice that the Democrats are \ngoing to keep working on ways to grow our economy from the middle out, \nnot the top down, and we are going to be working to make sure our \nworkers and our families have a voice at the table. We are going to \ncontinue to focus on making sure our country works for all Americans, \nnot just the wealthy and few.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the Senator from Washington knows how much \nI admire and respect her. We have had great opportunity to work \ntogether in a very productive way, but what we have just seen from our \nfriends across the aisle is not designed to actually get anything done. \nIt was a show to try to claim political advantage and to try to create \na narrative which simply isn't borne out by the facts.\n  The facts are that these costly proposals are unfunded mandates \ndesigned to make it hard for Americans to find jobs or become employers \nand create jobs for millions of people working for a step up the \neconomic ladder. What Americans need, rather than show votes, are more \njob opportunities, more flexibility at work, and the freedom to \nnegotiate a schedule that works for them.\n  Our friends across the aisle have been in charge and we have seen the \nresults: an economy that grew last year at 2.2 percent--as a matter of \nfact, in at least one quarter it actually contracted. So we know what \nthe fruit of these policies are because they have had their chances.\n  Their policies will destroy jobs, smother innovative startups in job \ncreators like Uber, and perpetuate the Obama part-time economy, which \nhas left a shocking 6.5 million Americans in part-time work as they \nsearch in vain for full-time work--and, I might add, a 30-year low of \nthe labor participation rate--the percentage of people actually in the \nworkforce that are employed, people that would otherwise want to work. \nWe have seen what the results are.\n  The voters last November decided to try something different. They \nhave given us a chance to show what we can do while we are in the \nmajority, and I think the results are pretty good. We passed a budget \nfor the first time since 2009. We passed a 6-year highway bill just \nrecently, and we are still working with the House to try to figure out \nhow to do that on a bicameral, bipartisan basis. We passed unanimously \nthe Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act to fight the scourge of \nhuman trafficking, which targets teenage girls predominantly for sex. \nWe have passed the Defense authorization bill to make sure our men and \nwomen in uniform have the authority and what they need in order to keep \nus safe here and abroad.\n  We actually have had a very productive year so far in the 114th \nCongress under Republican leadership. What our\n\n[[Page S6346]]\n\nDemocratic colleagues want to do is take us to the past with slow \neconomic growth and policies that simply don't work.\n  That is why I am happy to stand here today and object to these show \nrequests that aren't actually designed to do anything but are designed \nfor fundraising, press releases, and other publicity stunts that simply \nare not what is going to help the American people the most.\n\n\n                       Tribute to Russ Thomasson\n\n  Mr. President, on another note, I want to talk a little bit about my \nchief of staff who is leaving. My chief of staff in the whip office is \nRuss Thomasson, who I hope is somewhere around here. He is at the back \nof the Chamber. His son Austin is down here as one of our pages.\n  The bottom line is, Russ and I learned together from the time he came \nas my military legislative assistant in 2003. From that time until now, \nwe learned how to be effective on behalf of the 27 million people I \nwork for in the State of Texas and to work with all of our colleagues \nto try to produce positive results for the American people.\n  He is leaving now for greener pastures. I mean that not exactly \nliterally, but he is going into the private sector where he will no \ndoubt be compensated for what his skills and experience are worth.\n  Back when I started in the Senate, Russ came on board as my military \nlegislative assistant. He brought with him great experience as an Air \nForce intel officer. He is an engineer; I am not. It was helpful to \nbring with him the attention to detail that engineering training \nbrings. He is also a Russian specialist, which we didn't need a lot of \nin my office in Texas, but he brought great knowledge and experience to \nthe forefront, helping me in my job on the Armed Services Committee, \ngiven that great background.\n  We had some big challenges in 2005 as all of our colleagues here at \nthe time remember. That was the Base Closure and Realignment \nCommission. Texas likes to tout the fact that 1 out of every 10 persons \nin uniform comes from Texas. Our military is very important to us. I \nwas raised in a military family. Being effective on behalf of our men \nand women in uniform who happen to call Texas home is particularly \nimportant to me, and Russ did a tremendous job there and elsewhere.\n  As a matter of fact, he did such a good job as my MLA, my military \nlegislative assistant, that when the opportunity came, he was promoted \nto legislative director. There he got to apply his knowledge and \nexpertise far beyond just national security and foreign affairs and \nhelped me navigate all of the various policy issues we confronted \nduring the time he was my legislative director from 2007 to 2012.\n  Some of these are issues that particularly hit home in Texas, things \nlike immigration, Supreme Court nominations, and the ObamaCare debate. \nNot only did Russ bring valuable policy perspectives to that role as \nlegislative director, but he was also able to help on the \ncommunications side because he understands it is not just important for \nus to do a decent job--or at least to the best of our ability--it is \nimportant to be able to communicate what you are doing in a way so the \nAmerican people, and in particular the people of Texas, can understand. \nYet he also understood the politics that go along sometimes with the \njob we have in the Senate.\n  Perhaps just as importantly, he brought with him his good judgment to \nhelp me hire an outstanding legislative staff. I believe firmly that \npart of my responsibility--and I am sure the Presiding Officer and our \nother colleagues feel the same way. I believe one of the most important \nthings we can do is hire the best and brightest staffers because if we \ndo that, and we work with them, we can benefit tremendously and our \nconstituents benefit tremendously from their advice.\n  Russ has set a high bar as my legislative director. He is a tireless \nworker who has given a lot of himself.\n  Then I would like to say just a word about his job as my chief of \nstaff--as the whip. When I became the whip, he came with me to the whip \noffice. We have found ourselves in a few nail-biting situations in \ntense moments, and Russ's calmness and personality, his calm demeanor \nand his diligence have simply helped us get the job done for the Senate \nand for the new majority.\n  Whether it is trafficking, trade, highways, funding the government, a \nbudget--the first budget that we have passed since 2009--his \nfingerprints are all over those, along with those of other members of \nmy whip staff who have done a great job. As I learned from the majority \nleader, he wants to know where the votes are before the vote is \nactually cast. My whip team, both staff and my deputy whip team, of \nwhich the Presiding Officer is one, have done a great job providing \nthat essential information and knowledge to the majority leader so we \ncan efficiently and effectively represent our constituents in the \nSenate.\n  By the way, I would say that Russ's intelligence background has \nproven to be invaluable--gathering information, talking to people, and \nunderstanding the situational awareness that is so necessary in order \nto be as effective as we can be. The results prove he has made a big \ncontribution to helping us turn the Senate around, going from \ndysfunction to function and actually producing important results for \nthe American people.\n  So here is how Russ describes the task ahead in the Senate. He likes \nto talk about the four P's. This is supposedly the key to what makes \nthe Senate work and how to be effective in the Senate. The first P is \npolicy. The second is pressure. The third is politics. The fourth is \npower. So I think by his four P's, he encapsulates one of the ways to \nbe most effective in the Senate.\n  I guess, in the end, everything comes down to people and our \nrelationships, the level of trust we are able to build working with \neach other because that is what helps us be effective and helps Russ be \nan effective chief of staff in the whip office. The truth is, as I have \ngone from No. 99 in the Senate when I came here, sitting in that back \nrow over there, down to this desk over the last 12 years, I could not \nhave done it without great staff like Russ Thomasson and all of my \nstaff, both in the whip office as well as my staff in my official \noffice. Many of them I know are here sitting in the back.\n  So on behalf of all of Team Cornyn, I want to wish Russ, his wife \nCindy, Sasha, and Austin all the very best in the next chapter of their \nlives. We used to kid that it is sort of like the Eagles song ``Hotel \nCalifornia,'' you can check out, but you can never leave, once you \nbecome part of Team Cornyn. That is as true today as it was then.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                      Nuclear Agreement With Iran\n\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I have never faced a more difficult decision \nthan the vote on the Iran nuclear weapons agreement which is currently \nscheduled for mid-September. The stakes could not be higher, the issues \nmore complex or the risks more difficult to calculate. In approaching \nthis decision, I have taken a two-pronged path. The first is to have \nlearned everything I possibly could about the agreement itself and then \ncarefully analyzed the alternatives.\n  This second step is critically important, particularly in this case. \nNo negotiated agreement is perfect. It is easy to pick apart whatever \nagreement is before you, but the question is, Compared to what? Often, \nan imperfect agreement is preferable when compared to the likely \nalternatives. Starting with a close reading of the agreement over \nseveral nights and early mornings back in July, and following hearings, \nclassified briefings and sessions, meeting with experts inside and \noutside the administration, extensive readings about the agreement and \nits implications and discussions with my colleagues, this is where I \nhave come out: First, if implemented effectively, I believe this \nagreement will prevent Iran from achieving a nuclear weapon for at \nleast 15 years and probably longer; second, at the end of that 15 \nyears, if we take the right steps, we will have the same options then \nthat we have today if Iran moves toward the building of a bomb; third, \nthe current alternatives, if this agreement is rejected, are either \nunrealistic or downright dangerous.\n  So based upon what we know now, I intend to vote in favor of the \nagreement. This is why: The deal itself, I believe, is strong and \nexplicit in terms of the burdens it places upon Iran's nuclear program \nfor the first 15 years--a\n\n[[Page S6347]]\n\n98-percent reduction in their current stockpile of enriched uranium, \nstrict numerical limits on further enrichment, the effective \ndismantling of the plutonium reactor at Arak, and dismantlement of two-\nthirds of their current fleet of enrichment centrifuges.\n  But many argue that after 15 years, Iran could become a nuclear \nthreshold state, which is certainly a possibility we need to be \nprepared to address, but Iran is a nuclear threshold state today. To be \narguing about what may or may not be the case in 15 years and ignore \nthe fact that they are a nuclear threshold state today, it seems to me, \nis the height of folly. If they decided to build a bomb today, they \ncould get there in 2 to 3 months. After the rollbacks required in this \nagreement, however, this period is extended to at least 1 year, and we \nwould know almost immediately if they were on track to a bomb.\n  I might mention that we will have a much greater insight into their \nactivities if this agreement is enacted than we do today. The \ninspection and verification provisions, as I mentioned, which will be \nmonitored and enforced by the International Atomic Energy Agency, \ncoupled with the tools and capabilities of the U.S. intelligence \ncommunity and those of our international partners which, by the way, is \nan important part of the verification regime.\n  There is a lot of discussion about the IAEA, as if those are the only \npeople who will be watching, but indeed the intelligence agencies of at \nleast half a dozen countries will also be watching. I believe the \ncombination of the IAEA and our intelligence assets provide us with a \nhigh level of confidence that any attempt by Iran to cheat on its \nenrichment program will be detected.\n  IAEA inspections at known nuclear sites indeed are anytime, anywhere, \nand include Iran's entire uranium supply chain. While it is true that \ninspections at hidden sites--sites we don't know about--could be \ndelayed for up to 24 days from when the IAEA requests access and that \nsome covert work at such a site could be harder to detect, it is in the \nnature of uranium that traces can be detected long after 24 days, no \nmatter how much they try to clean it up.\n  The half-life of uranium-235 is 700 million years. They are not going \nto be able to clean it up in 24 days. In the end, to build a bomb, \nthere has to be nuclear material. But what about after 15 years when \nmost of the restrictions on enrichment are lifted? If the Iranians try \nto break out at that point, we have the some options we have today, \nincluding the reimposition of sanctions or a military strike.\n  In other words, we are in a similar place in 15 years to where we are \nnow, but we will have achieved 15 years of a nuclear weapon-free Iran. \nIf Iran violates the terms of the agreement at that point, I believe \nreimposing the effective international sanctions involving the rest of \nthe world would be stronger and more likely than it would be today \nbecause it would be Iran breaching the agreement, not us walking away \nfrom it. I cannot argue, nor can anyone, that this deal is perfect. For \nexample, I would prefer that the 15-year limits be 20 or 25 or 30 years \nor that the U.S. arms embargo would remain in place indefinitely. I \nwould prefer to see that in the agreement.\n  In fact, I think Congress can and should have a role to play in \nseeking to ensure the strict enforcement of the agreement and to \nmitigate some of its weaknesses, as well as reassuring our regional \nallies and partners and further strengthening our ability to ensure \nIran never becomes a nuclear weapons state, but then we get to the \ncentral question. As I said, it is easy to pick apart a deal: I don't \nlike this aspect. I don't like that. I think it should be longer. I \nthink it should be shorter.\n  But the question is, Compared to what? What are the alternatives? \nWhat happens next if we reject this agreement? The usual answers I have \nheard in this body, in hearings, and in meetings over the last month or \nso are sort of vague references to reimposing or strengthening the \nsanctions, bringing Iran back to the table, and getting a better deal.\n  The problem with this is that the countries which have joined us in \nthe sanctions--and by doing so have considerably strengthened the \nimpact of those sanctions on Iran--believe this deal is acceptable. \nThey have accepted it. Our unilateral rejection would almost certainly \nlead to those sanctions eroding rather than getting stronger. I would \nnot argue they will collapse, but they will definitely erode. It is \nhard to argue that the sanctions will get stronger when the countries \nthat have helped us to enforce and make those sanctions effective \nbelieve we should endorse and enter into this agreement.\n  If that happens, we have the worst of all worlds: Iran is unfettered \nfrom the terms of the agreement, and they are subject to a weaker \nsanctions regime. It is important to remember, and this often is not \nconveyed much in the information that is shared, this is not simply an \nagreement between the United States and Iran, this is an agreement \nbetween the United States and Germany and Great Britain and France and \nChina and Russia and Iran. This is not a unilateral agreement. This is \nan agreement that has been entered into by the major world powers. They \nhave found it acceptable.\n  The other option, if we cannot somehow find our way to a better \ndeal--and I have not heard anybody credibly argue why or how that would \nhappen. The only other option, of course, is a military strike, which \nthe experts estimate would only set the Iranian nuclear program back \nbetween 2 and 3 years. Where are we then? Are we in a position where \nthere would have to be follow-on strikes to prevent the reconstitution \nof Iran's nuclear facilities every 2 or 3 years? That would be at an \nunpredictable and incalculable cost.\n  It is true that as a result of Iran's acceptance of the limitations \nof the agreement, they get relief from the nuclear sanctions and the \nrelease of approximately $50 billion of restricted foreign assets that \nthey will be able to spend, but it is important to remember they only \nget that after they comply with the limitations. If we sign on to this \nagreement, they don't get the money the next day. They have to meet the \nlimitations in the agreement and the IAEA has to verify that. Let me \nrepeat. There is no sanctions relief until Iran implements and the IAEA \nverifies that its nuclear commitments have been met. To get that relief \nis why they entered into these negotiations in the first place. And to \nget them into the negotiations is why we led the imposition of the \nnuclear weapons sanctions in the first place.\n\n  In other words, sanctions relief in exchange for acceptance of \nlimitations on their nuclear program is the essence of the deal. \nNeither the sanctions nor the negotiations were ever about Iran \nforeswearing terrorism or recognizing Israel or releasing hostages. All \nof those things are things I wish we could do. I believe those are good \npolicies, but that isn't what this negotiation was about. To try to add \nthem now or argue that the deal falls short because they aren't \nincluded is simply unrealistic.\n  The United States, along with our allies and partners, must redouble \nour efforts outside of the nuclear agreement to address these issues. \nThey are critically important issues. We need a strategy to deal with \nan expansionist Iran that is completely separate from the nuclear \nissue--I don't deny that--and to deal with Iran's malign activities in \nthe region. It is also important to reiterate that all U.S. sanctions \non Iran related to terrorism and human rights will remain in place.\n  When President Kennedy was negotiating the removal of the Soviet \nmissiles from Cuba, he did not throw in that Cuba had to depose Castro \nor that the Soviets had to foreswear their dangerous enmity to the \nWest. The phrase they used was this: ``We will bury you.''\n  He simply wanted to get those missiles out. He didn't try to settle \nall the issues in the Cold War. And, indeed, so it is with this deal. \nThe idea is to constrain. The idea has always been to constrain Iran's \nnuclear capability, not settle all the issues of the Middle East--no \nmatter how desirable that might be.\n  In my book there is only one thing worse than a rogue Iran seeking to \nmake trouble for its neighbors and us, and that is a rogue Iran seeking \nto make troubles for its neighbors and us armed with nuclear weapons. \nThat is the issue before is.\n  Finally, of equal importance as the terms themselves of the nuclear \nagreement is ensuring that it is effectively implemented. One of the \nprinciples of my life is that implementation and\n\n[[Page S6348]]\n\nexecution are as important as vision. If this agreement is approved, \nthat is day 1 of the critical implementation and execution period. \nThere is a real risk, I believe, that as time wears on, the attention \nof the international community on this issue will diminish. It will be \nvital to the United States, across successive Presidents, to maintain \nfocus on implementing and enforcing the terms of the agreement.\n  Congress also will have a crucial role to play, both in oversight of \nthe deal's implementation and in making certain that the IAEA and our \nintelligence agencies have the resources they need to monitor and \nassure compliance, and more broadly to ensure that all of our options \nto prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon--whenever they may \ndecide to take that step--remain viable if the agreement collapses.\n  I have negotiated lots of contracts over the years, and one side or \nthe other rarely wins in a negotiation. The idea is that all sides get \nsomething they want or need, and, in the end, I believe that is what \nhappened here. If this deal is implemented properly, I believe it will \naccomplish our national security objectives, while preserving or \nimproving all of our existing options to ensure that Iran never \ndevelops a nuclear weapon.\n  There is no certainty when it comes to this question. As I said at \nthe beginning, I believe this is the most difficult decision I have \never had to make. There are risks in either direction, and there are \ncredible arguments on both sides. But, in the end, I have concluded \nthat the terms of this agreement are preferable to the alternatives--\nand that is the crucial analysis; what are the alternatives--and that \nit would be in the best interests of the United States to join our \npartners in approving it.\n  I intend to remain deeply engaged in this issue in the weeks and \nmonths ahead because the process does not end the day of our vote. If \nthis agreement moves forward, it will fall to future Presidents and \nfuture Congresses to oversee it and make it work. We owe the American \npeople our best judgment, and it is my belief that this agreement, if \nimplemented effectively and in conjunction with the other measures we \nmust take to ensure its ongoing vitality, will serve our Nation, the \nregion, and the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about the deal \nnegotiated between the P5+1 and Iran to deny Iran's access to a nuclear \nweapon.\n  First, I commend the administration and others involved in the \nnegotiations for seeking a diplomatic solution. There always needs to \nbe a credible threat of military force to deny Iran a nuclear weapon, \nbut it is incumbent upon us to test every avenue for a peaceful \nsolution before resorting to such force.\n  I am mindful that--like any agreement involving multiple parties that \nare friendly, belligerent, and somewhere in between--this agreement \ncan't be used against the ideal. It has to be judged against the \nalternative. On the whole, this agreement measured against the ideal \ndoesn't look all that good. Against the alternative, it is a much \ncloser call.\n  I must say that I am not as sanguine as some of my colleagues about \nthe ability to reassemble the multilateral sanctions regime that has \nbrought Iran to the negotiating table.\n  On the nuclear side, Iran's ability to amass sufficient fissile \nmaterial to assemble a nuclear weapon would be severely curtailed for \nup to 15 years. The inspections regime to ensure compliance, at least \nas it pertains to known nuclear facilities, is fairly detailed. That is \nno small achievement. Much credit is due to the scientists and others \nwho assisted with the negotiations.\n  On the other hand, I have grave concerns regarding our ability--and \nif not our ability, our willingness--to respond to nefarious nonnuclear \nactivities that Iran may be involved with in the region.\n  We are assured by the administration that under the JCPOA, Congress \nretains all tools, including the imposition of sanctions, should Iran \ninvolve itself in terrorist activity in the region. However, the plain \ntext of the JCPOA does not seem to indicate this. In fact, it seems to \nindicate otherwise. Iran has made it clear that it believes that the \nimposition of sanctions similar to or approximating those currently in \nplace would violate the JCPOA.\n  My concern is that the administration would be reluctant to punish or \ndeter the unacceptable nonnuclear behavior by Iran in the region if it \nwould give Iran the pretext not to comply with the agreement as it \nstands. I don't believe this is an idle concern. The degree to which \nthe administration has resisted even the suggestion that Congress \nreauthorize the Iran Sanctions Act, for example, which expires next \nyear, just so that we might have sanctions to snap back, makes us \nquestion our willingness to confront Iran when it really matters down \nthe road.\n  Now, if this were a treaty, that could be dealt with with what are \ncalled RUDs--or reservations, understandings and declarations--where we \ncould clarify some of these misunderstandings. But since this was \npresented to Congress as an Executive agreement, we don't have that \noption.\n  We have had numerous hearings and briefings in the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee. I commend Senator Corker, the chairman of the \ncommittee, and the minority ranking member, Senator Cardin, for the \nmanner in which they have engaged in these hearings and briefings.\n  We have had a lot of questions raised. Some have been answered; some \nhave not. These hearings will continue. I will leave from this Chamber \nto go to another briefing that we are having. I expect to hear more in \nthe coming weeks and will seek to answer questions that I still have \nabout the agreement. The bottom line is I can only support an agreement \nthat I feel can endure--not just be signed but that can endure--and \nthat will serve our national interests and the interests of our allies.\n  Again, I commend those who have been involved in this process. I \ncommend those involved in ensuring that Congress had a say here. I will \ncontinue to evaluate this agreement based, as I said, not on the ideal \nbut the alternative. There are many questions I wish to have answered.\n  I encourage the administration to work with Congress in the coming \nweeks on legislation that would clarify some of these \nmisunderstandings. It would take the place of so-called RUDs if this \nwere a treaty.\n  I have mentioned before that this kind of legislation is going to \ncome. It will come prior to implementation day, and I think it behooves \nthe administration and the Congress to begin now to work together on \nitems that we can agree on that clarify this, assuming that this \nagreement will go into effect. It ought to be clarified now and not \ndown the road. That would make it far more likely to be an enduring \ndocument rather than one that is simply signed and forgotten later.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor once again to make an \nattempt at passing a very important, commonsense piece of legislation \nthat is bipartisan. It helps to ensure that the drinking water supplies \nin northern Ohio, Lake Erie, and throughout our State, the freshwater \nreservoirs and other lakes that are providing water--and also around \nthe\n\n[[Page S6349]]\n\ncountry--to make sure that will be something the U.S. Federal \nGovernment is helping with as much as possible through new legislation \nto get the EPA more involved.\n  I bring this legislation to the floor for the third time in the last \nseveral days to try to pass it. I do so with the hopes that we can get \nthis done tonight.\n  I thank my colleague from Ohio, Sherrod Brown, who has been \ncosponsoring and supporting this effort. I thank my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle for working with us. We have been working for \nseveral weeks to get this cleared. Most recently, we had an issue with \nregard to legislation the Democrats wanted to add to it. I think we \nhave now resolved those issues. I thank Robert Duncan of the floor \nstaff for working so closely with us on this. I thank my colleague from \nRhode Island, Senator Whitehouse, for working with us. This is \nlegislation which is both important and urgent.\n  This week marks the 1-year anniversary since the water supplies in \nToledo, OH, had to be cut off because there were toxic algal blooms in \nthe lake that were going into the water intake system. There were \n500,000 people who were told they couldn't drink the water. It was a \ncrisis. I was there. I was given bottled water along with others.\n  Unfortunately, this year we are seeing toxic algal blooms growing \nagain. We are seeing it not just near the water intake valve for the \ncity of Toledo but also near other water intake valves where 3 million \nOhioans get their drinking water, from Lake Erie. By the way, about 8 \nmillion people from other States get water from Lake Erie, including \nMichigan and other States represented here in this Chamber.\n  I am also very concerned by the fact that we have other reservoirs in \nOhio that are seeing increased levels of toxic algal blooms. This \nincludes Grand Lakes St. Marys, Buckeye Lake, and it includes the \nreservoirs in Columbus.\n  It is time to ensure that we are doing everything we possibly can at \nthe local, State, and Federal level to ensure that we can deal with \nthis issue and that it can be resolved.\n  Finally, I will say this is not just about drinking water; it is also \nabout the recreational value of these waterways, including Lake Erie, \nwhich is an incredibly important economic asset for the State of Ohio, \nour No. 1 destination for tourism. Having been on the lake a couple of \nweeks ago fishing, I will tell you that toxic algal blooms make a huge \ndifference and create a real problem for the recreational value of \nfishing but also people being able to use the beaches, people being \nconcerned about having their pets in the water, and people being \nconcerned that their kids may not be safe even being close to these \nbodies of water.\n  We passed legislation previously to help get the Federal Government \nmore involved. About a year ago, we passed legislation to get EPA but \nalso NOAA--the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration--USGS, \nand other Federal entities more involved and engaged and working \ntogether better.\n  We also passed legislation to try to help with regard to getting EPA \nto give us what the standards ought to be in terms of the drinking \nwater.\n  Now it is time to pass this legislation that requires the EPA to put \nout a report on how to mitigate the problem and how to encourage the \nlocal community and incentivize the local community to do more in terms \nof ensuring that the intake valves are in the right place, ensuring \nthat the treatment is done properly, and provide the good science and \nthe best practices that only the EPA can provide to be able to help \nwith regard to the very serious problem we face on Lake Erie and \nthroughout the State of Ohio.\n  With that, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to \nH.R. 212, which is at the desk, and that the bill be read a third time \nand the Senate vote on passage of the bill with no intervening action \nor debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 212) to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to \n     provide for the assessment and management of the risk of \n     algal toxins in drinking water, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to a third reading, and was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Ohio for the \nway we have worked together. There was a slight toll to be paid on the \nmajority side for getting the National Estuary Program passed, but it \nwas one we could live with, and I think these are both good pieces of \nlegislation. I am glad we were able to pass them together.\n  If I could just briefly read from an editorial that was recently \npublished by the Westerly Sun. Westerly is one of Rhode Island's \ncities. The area that Westerly is in is called South County, RI. There \nis a South County coastkeeper whose name is David Prescott, and he went \nout in a boat that belongs to an environmental group in Rhode Island \ncalled Save the Bay. He took some press folk down the Pawcatuck River \nwith elected leaders from both Rhode Island and Connecticut.\n  I will read from the editorial:\n\n       Prescott shared a jarful of smelly green algae from the \n     bottom of Little Narragansett Bay to illustrate how lawn \n     fertilizer, engine oil and all manner of interesting items \n     flushed down storm drains end up below the surface of what \n     appears to be a bucolic setting around Watch Hill, Napatree \n     Point and Sandy Point.\n       ``If we went further up the watershed, we would actually \n     see stuff that came right off the land, down the stormwater \n     outfalls,'' Prescott said. ``This is the stuff that we know \n     is in our developed areas. We see stuff such as oil and gas \n     and grease and sand and trash and dog waste, and guess where \n     it ends up? Eventually, it ends up here in the Pawcatuck \n     River estuary and into Little Narragansett Bay.''\n       Based on his eight-year study of the river and bay area \n     using water sampling, Prescott urged leaders from both states \n     to heed Save the Bay's ``call to action,'' which would \n     require developing stormwater management plans to better \n     filter runoff, ensuring septic systems are regularly tested, \n     encouraging homeowners to reduce or eliminate use of lawn \n     fertilizers and pesticides, and enforcing ``no-discharge'' \n     laws.\n\n  The newspaper concluded:\n\n       The Wood-Pawcatuck watershed, from Worden's Pond in South \n     Kingstown to Watch Hill, filters the water in our aquifers \n     and provides a quality of life many envy. We need to protect \n     all aspects of our watershed and treat the Pawcatuck River \n     and Little Narragansett Bay with more respect than has been \n     shown over the decades.\n\n  I thank the Westerly Sun for those thoughts. I think they are very \nhelpful. I am glad to have the chance to put them here into the record \non the Senate floor.\n  The reason I read this is because the work of doing that upland \nplanning that allows an estuary to be clean for swimming, fishing, \nboating, and all of the things that Rhode Islanders and our summer \nvisitors enjoy, is through this National Estuary Program. It shows the \ncommon link of the algae problem David Prescott referred to with the \nalgae problem Senator Portman has seen in Ohio.\n  I thank David Vitter, the Senator from Louisiana, for his \ncosponsorship of this and for his work to get this through the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee with me. I also thank Sherrod \nBrown for cosponsoring this legislation.\n  If I am not mistaken, there is the Old Woman Creek National Estuarine \nResearch Reserve in Ohio, and this will help support the work of the \nOld Woman Creek National Estuarine Reserve. This is in Huron, OH, on \nthe south-central shore of Lake Erie. It is one of Ohio's few remaining \nexamples of a natural estuary that transitions between land and water, \nwith a variety of habitats, from marshes and swamps, to upland forests, \nopen water, tributary streams, barrier beach, and near shores of Lake \nErie.\n  I am pleased both of these measures have been able to proceed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleague from \nRhode Island. I was in support of his legislation. I am glad we got \nboth bills done, and I appreciate the fact that my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle realize the urgency of dealing with this blue-green \nalgae issue, which in many cases has become a toxic algal bloom that \naffects our drinking water, affects recreation, and affects fishing, \nand it is a significant issue in my State and others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/05/senate-section/article/S6350-1", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6350-S6352]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CYBERSECURITY INFORMATION SHARING ACT OF 2015--MOTION TO PROCEED--\n                               Continued\n\n\n                            Tax Code Reform\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, if I could, I want to report on something \nthat happened this week. I see that the chair of the Finance Committee, \nSenator Hatch, is here, and he is aware of this. This week we had a \nbipartisan hearing of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations on \nan issue that is also urgent. It is one that is imminent because right \nnow many U.S. companies are leaving our shores. This means that jobs \nand investments are leaving America and going to other countries. It is \nsomething all of us should be concerned about because it is rapidly \naccelerating. It is because of one simple reason: Washington, DC, \nrefuses to reform our outdated and antiquated Tax Code. It is \nWashington's fault. Unfortunately, the brunt of it is being borne by \nworkers across our country.\n  I would like to put into the Record my statement with regard to this \nhearing. It was a hearing where we were able to hear directly from \ncompanies about the impact of the Tax Code. We were able to bring in \ncompanies that have left the United States, requiring them to determine \nwhy they left. Unfortunately, it was eye-opening to the point that it \nrequires us to deal with our broken Tax Code if we are going to retain \njobs in this country, keep investment in this country, and be able to \nattract more jobs and investment to deal with our historically weak \nrecovery in which we currently find ourselves.\n  Mr. President, I wish to address an issue that is critical to \nunleashing job creation and boosting wages in this country--and that is \nthe need to reform our broken, outdated tax code.\n  This Congress, I took on a new role as chairman of the Senate's main \ninvestigative panel, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, PSI, \nwhere I serve alongside my colleague Senator Claire McCaskill, the \nsubcommittee's ranking member. Last week, PSI held a hearing \nspecifically concerning how the U.S. tax code affects the market for \ncorporate control. It is a topic that involves the jargon of corporate \nfinance, but the impact is measured in U.S. jobs and wages. We see \nheadlines every week about the loss of American business headquarters--\nmore often than not, to a country with a more competitive corporate tax \nrate, it is not hard to find one, and territorial system of taxation.\n  Our tax code makes it hard to be an American company, and it puts \nU.S. workers at a disadvantage. At a 39 percent combined State and \nFederal rate, the United States has the highest corporate rate in the \nindustrialized world. To add insult to injury our government taxes \nAmerican businesses for the privilege of reinvesting their overseas \nprofits here at home.\n  Economists tell us that the burden of corporate taxes falls \nprincipally on workers--in the former of lower wages and fewer job \nopportunities. I am afraid this has helped create a middle-class \nsqueeze that has made it harder for working families to make ends meet. \nYet as almost all of our competitors have cut their corporate rates and \neliminated repatriation taxes, America has failed to reform its \noutdated, complex tax code.\n  As a result, American businesses are headed for the exits, at a loss \nof thousands of jobs. The unfortunate reality is that U.S. businesses \nare often much more valuable in the hands of foreign acquirers who can \nreduce their tax bills. I believe that is one reason why the value of \nforeign takeovers of U.S. companies doubled last year to $275 billion, \nand are on track to surpass $400 billion this year according to \nDealogic, far outpacing the increase in overall global mergers and \nacquisitions.\n  We should be very clear that foreign investment in the United States \nis essential to economic growth--we need more of it. But a tax code \nthat distorts\n\n[[Page S6351]]\n\nownership decisions by handicapping U.S. business is not good for our \neconomy--and that is what we have today. What is happening is that the \ncurrent tax system increasingly drives U.S. businesses into the hands \nof those best able to reduce their tax liabilities, not necessarily \nthose best equipped to create jobs and increase wages here at home. \nThat is bad for American workers and bad for our long-term \ncompetitiveness as a country.\n  To better understand the trend and inform legislative debate on tax \nreform, PSI decided to take a hard look at this issue. Over the past \ncouple months, the subcommittee reviewed more than a dozen recent major \nforeign acquisitions of U.S. companies and mergers in which U.S. firms \nrelocated overseas. This was a bipartisan project every step of the way \nwith Senator McCaskill, and I am very grateful for that.\n  Last week's hearing was the culmination of that work. And we heard \ndirectly from both U.S. companies that have felt the tax-driven \npressures to move offshore and from foreign corporations whose tax \nadvantages have turbocharged their growth by acquisition.\n  Among the U.S. business leaders we heard from was Jim Koch, the \nfounder and chairman of Boston Beer Company, maker of Sam Adams. At a \nU.S. market share between 1 percent to 2 percent each, Sam Adams and \nPennsylvania-based Yuengling are actually the first and second largest \nU.S.-based brewers left. All of the great American beer companies--\nMiller, Coors, and Anheuser-Busch--are now foreign-owned. And Mr. Koch \ntestified that if we fail to reform our tax code, his company could be \nnext.\n  He explained that he regularly gets offers from investment bankers to \nfacilitate a sale, at double-digit premiums, to a foreign acquirer who \ncan dramatically reduce his tax bill from the 39 percent rate his \ncompany now pays. Mr. Koch said he can decline those attractive offers \nbecause he owns a majority of his company's voting shares. But when he \nis gone, he believes that company will be driven by financial pressure \nto sell.\n  We also heard from the longtime CEO of the pharmaceutical company \nAllergan, David Pyott. Allergan was purchased by the Irish acquirer \nActavis last year for $70 billion after a year-long takeover pursuit by \nCanadian business, Valeant Pharmaceuticals. Mr. Pyott estimated that \nforeign acquirers pursuing Allergan had about a $9 billion valuation \nadvantage over what would have been possible for an American company, \n``simply because they could reduce Allergan's tax bill and gain access \nto its more than $2.5 billion in locked-out overseas earnings.'' Mr. \nPyott testified that Allergan would be an independent American company \ntoday if it weren't for our tax code. Instead, Allergan is now \nheadquartered in Ireland and Mr. Pyott projects that the new ownership \nwill cut about 1,500 jobs, mostly in California.\n  To better understand the tax-driven advantages enjoyed by foreign \nacquirers, PSI took a look at Quebec-based Valeant Pharmaceuticals. \nOver the past 4 years, Valeant has managed to acquire more than a dozen \nU.S. companies worth more than $30 billion. The subcommittee reviewed \nkey documents to understand how tax advantages affected Valeant's three \nlargest acquisitions to date, including the 2013 sale of New York-based \neye care firm Bausch & Lomb and the 2015 sale of the North Carolina-\nbased drug maker Salix.\n\n  We learned that, in those two transactions alone, Valeant determined \nthat it could shave more than $3 billion off the target companies' tax \nbills by integrating them into its Canada-based corporate group. Those \ntax savings meant that Valeant's investments in its American targets \nwould have higher returns and pay for themselves more quickly--two key \ndrivers of the deals. The three recent Valeant acquisitions we studied \nresulted in a loss of about 2,300 U.S. jobs, plus a loss of about $16 \nmillion per year of contract manufacturing that was moved from the U.S. \nto Canada and the UK.\n  Beyond inbound acquisitions, America is also losing corporate \nheadquarters through mergers in which U.S. businesses relocate \noverseas. The latest news is the U.S. agricultural business Monsanto's \nproposed $45 billion merger with its European counterpart Syngenta; a \nkey part of that proposed deal is a new global corporate headquarters--\nnot in the U.S., but in London.\n  To better understand this trend, the subcommittee examined the 2014 \nmerger of Burger King with the Canadian coffee-and-donut chain Tim \nHortons--an $11.4 billion tie-up that sent Burger King's corporate \nheadquarters north of the border. Our review showed that Burger King \nhad strong business reasons to team up with Tim Hortons. But the record \nshows that when deciding where to locate the new headquarters of the \ncombined company, tax considerations flatly ruled out the U.S. And it \nwasn't about the domestic tax rates--it was about international \ntaxation.\n  At the time, Burger King estimated that pulling Tim Hortons into the \nworldwide U.S. tax net, rather than relocating to Canada, would destroy \nup to $5.5 billion in value over just 5 years--$5.5 billion in an $11 \nbillion deal. Think about that. The company concluded it was necessary \nto put the headquarters in a country that would allow it to reinvest \noverseas earnings back in the U.S. and Canada without an additional tax \nhit. They ultimately chose Tim Hortons' home base of Canada because \ntheir territorial system of taxation allowed them to do just that.\n  If there is a villain in these stories, it is the U.S. tax code. And \nif there is a failure, it is Washington's. Our job is to give our \nworkers the best shot at competing in the global marketplace and yet we \nhaven't reformed the tax code in decades while other countries have.\n  That fact is that if Washington fails to reform our tax code, foreign \nacquirers will do it for us--one American company at a time. And rather \nthan more jobs and higher wages, we will continue to see a loss of \nU.S.-headquartered businesses and jobs.\n  With the deck stacked against American companies, I believe the \nsolution is clear. We need a full overhaul of our current tax code. Cut \nboth the individual and corporate rates to 25 percent, pay for the cuts \nby eliminating loopholes, and move to a competitive international \nsystem. Unfortunately, in our current political environment, that is \nsimply not possible to do immediately. However, I do believe that we \ncan take a positive first step towards reform this fall.\n  A big part of that first step is included in a bipartisan framework \nfor international tax reform that Senator Schumer and I released last \nmonth. That includes 1) a move to an international tax system that \ndoesn't provide disincentives for companies to bring their money home \nfrom overseas to invest in growing their business and hiring more \nworkers; 2) a patent box to keep highly mobile intellectual property \nand the high-paying jobs that go with developing that property in the \nU.S.; and 3) sensible base erosion protections that discourage \ncompanies from doing business in tax haven jurisdictions.\n  I believe it should also include a tax extenders package that makes a \nlot of our current tax extenders permanent. I think that we can all \nagree that temporary tax policy is bad tax policy--and whether it is \ngiving families certainty that there is going to be a mortgage \ninsurance premium deduction, small businesses certainty that there is \ngoing to be expanded section 179 expensing, or innovative companies \nassurances that there is going to be an R credit, I believe that \nmaking these policies permanent would provide a big boost to our \neconomy.\n  In fact, yesterday, the Joint Committee on Taxation found that the \nshort-term extenders package passed by the Senate Finance Committee \nlast month would create $10.4 billion in dynamic tax revenue. Imagine \nthe growth if those were made permanent?\n  If we don't start to take steps to reform our code now, I am worried \nthat we are going to turn around in a couple of years and say, ``what \nhappened? Where did our jobs go? What happened to the American tax \nbase?'' If we do get to that place, we will have no one to blame but \nourselves.\n  I thank the Chair for his indulgence this evening.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, earlier today, the Senate Finance Committee \nfinally and at long last issued its report on its bipartisan \ninvestigation of the IRS's treatment of organizations applying for tax-\nexempt status.\n  As you will recall, this investigation began 2 years and 2 months ago \nafter we became aware of allegations that the IRS had targeted certain \norganizations for extra and undue scrutiny based on the groups' names \nand political views.\n  These were serious allegations. Indeed, they struck at the very heart \nof the principle--one that everyone should agree on--that our Nation's \ntax laws should be administered fairly and without regard to politics \nor partisanship. Despite the inherently political nature of these \nallegations, the Finance Committee, which has exclusive legislative \njurisdiction and primary oversight jurisdiction over the IRS, \nimmediately opened a full bipartisan investigation into this matter.\n  The investigation officially began on May 21, 2013, under the \ndirection of former Chairman Max Baucus and myself, when I was the \nranking member. When Senator Wyden assumed the leadership of the \ncommittee last year, he agreed to continue the bipartisan work we had \nbegun, and I am very grateful to him. This bipartisan cooperation has \ncontinued unabated since I became chairman in January of this\n\n[[Page S6357]]\n\nyear. That investigation concludes today with the release of our \nreport.\n  While much has been reported about the IRS's political targeting over \nthe last 2 years, it is important to note that the Senate Finance \nCommittee has conducted the only bipartisan investigation into the \nmatter. Consequently, I believe the report we have issued today will \nserve as the definitive account of the personal political biases, \nmanagement failures, and other factors that led the IRS to unfairly \ntarget certain organizations applying for tax-exempt status.\n  Once again, the public has a right to expect that the IRS will \nadminister the Tax Code with integrity and fairness in every context. \nYet, for many conservative organizations that applied for tax-exempt \nstatus during the last 5 years, the IRS fell woefully short of that \nstandard. The committee's bipartisan report examined these events in \ngreat detail.\n  Let's take a look at what we now know after 2 years of exhaustive \ninvestigation. We know that the White House's focus on activities of \ntax-exempt organizations intensified after the Supreme Court issued its \nCitizens United decision in January 2010, culminating in many ways with \nPresident Obama's wrongheaded castigation of the Court in his State of \nthe Union Address and continuing throughout 2010 until the midterm \nelections.\n  The Finance Committee's report contains clear evidence that the IRS \nand other agencies heeded the President's call. For example, just a few \nweeks after the President's speech before Congress, the IRS made a \npivotal decision to set aside all incoming tea party applications for \nspecial processing--a decision that would subject these organizations \nto long delays, burdensome questions, and would ultimately prove fatal \nto some of their applications.\n  Around that same time, the Department of Justice was considering \nwhether it could bring criminal charges against 501(c)(4) organizations \nthat engaged in political activities. The Federal Election Commission \nhad also opened investigations into conservative organizations that \naired political ads.\n  The IRS met with both agencies, providing input on the proposals of \nDepartment of Justice and information to the Federal Election \nCommission on organizations that were under investigation. These \nactions leave little doubt that, when Congress did not pass legislation \nto reduce spending on political speech, the administration sought \nalternative ways to accomplish the same goal.\n  Regardless of whether an explicit directive was given, the President \ngave the order to target conservative groups at every opportunity--the \nState of the Union, in press conferences, and in TV interviews. He did \nnot send a smoking gun email because he did not need to. He gave the \norder for everyone to hear, and his political allies at the IRS \nfollowed those orders.\n  The report clearly shows that conservative groups were singled out \nbecause of their political beliefs, and gross mismanagement at the IRS \nallowed this practice to continue for years.\n  We know the IRS systematically selected tea party and other \nconservative organizations for heightened scrutiny, in a manner wholly \ndifferent from how the IRS processed applications submitted by left-\nleaning and nonpartisan organizations. Although the IRS knew that the \ntea party applications were too dissimilar to be grouped under a common \ntemplate, it continued to segregate them for screening and processing \nbased on the presence of certain key words or phrases in the \napplicants' names or applications, such as ``Tea Party,'' ``9/12,'' and \n``Patriots,'' as well as indicators of political views that included \nbeing concerned with government debt, government spending or taxes, \neducating the public via advocacy, lobbying ``to make America a better \nplace to live'' or being critical of how the country was being run.\n  Some tried to mitigate these facts, claiming that the IRS similarly \ntargeted left-leaning groups. Indeed, this argument is posited in the \nadditional Democratic views.\n  However, as our investigation made clear, the IRS's treatment of \nconservative organizations was without question different from that \ngiven to left-leaning and nonpartisan organizations.\n  True enough, some liberal organizations were also denied tax-exempt \nstatus during this period. However, with one exception that affected \njust two organizations, all left-leaning organizations that were, \naccording to the Democratic views, improperly treated had participated \nin activities that legitimately called their tax-exempt status into \nquestion.\n  The IRS did not target these groups based on their names or ideology. \nInstead, it evaluated their actual activities that were known to the \nIRS--activities that, in many cases, properly resulted in denial or \nrevocation of tax-exempt status.\n  That same deference and attention to detail was not offered to tea \nparty groups and other organizations. As a result, many of the tea \nparty applicant groups gave up on the process, and some of these groups \nceased to exist entirely, based, at least in part, on the failure to \nobtain tax-exempt status.\n  Once again, we know all this happened. It is spelled out in great \ndetail in the committee's report. On top of all of this, our \ninvestigation revealed an environment at the IRS where the political \nbias of individual employees such as Lois Lerner--who was, once again, \nthe Director of the Exempt Organizations unit--was allowed to influence \nagency decisionmaking.\n  The IRS's upper management gave Ms. Lerner free rein to manage \napplications for tax-exempt status. During our investigation, the \nFinance Committee found evidence that Lerner's personal political views \ndirectly resulted in disparate treatment for applicants affiliated with \nthe tea party and other conservative causes.\n  Ms. Lerner orchestrated a process that subjected applicants to \nmultiple levels of review by numerous components within the IRS, \nthereby ensuring they would suffer long delays and be required to \nanswer burdensome and unnecessary questions. Lerner showed little \nconcern for conservative applicants, even when Members of Congress \ninquired on their behalf, allowing their applications to languish in \nthe IRS bureaucracy for as long as 2 years with little or no action. \nThe IRS began to resolve these applications only after some of the \nproblems became public in 2012, but, of course, by that time the damage \nhad been done.\n  Our investigation also uncovered a pattern at the IRS of continually \nmisleading Congress about its handling of applications submitted by tea \nparty organizations. Specifically, top IRS officials, including Doug \nShulman, Steve Miller, and, of course, Lois Lerner, made numerous \nmisrepresentations to Congress in 2012 and 2013 regarding the IRS's \nmistreatment of these groups. As if that wasn't bad enough, the IRS \nimpeded congressional investigations--including our investigation--by \nfailing to properly preserve a significant portion of Ms. Lerner's \nemails and then concealing the fact that the emails had been lost from \nthe committee for months.\n\n  Long before these allegations surfaced, the IRS was already one of \nthe most feared and loathed agencies of the Federal Government. \nVirtually all Americans had some level of either apprehension or \nanimosity toward the IRS, due in large part to the power it had to \nimpact the lives of everyday, hard-working taxpayers. Then, beginning \nat least in 2010, if not sooner, the IRS made things even worse, \ndemonstrating a pattern of incompetence, mismanagement, political bias, \nand obstruction toward congressional oversight. As a result, the agency \nhas in many respects lost the public's confidence.\n  There is a lot of work that needs to be done if the agency is ever \ngoing to restore that confidence and regain the public's trust. I \nbelieve the Finance Committee's report gives the best account we have \nof how that trust was broken. It spells out in great detail the \norganizational and personnel problems that plagued the agency and \nallowed partisan agendas and political tribalism to influence important \ndecisions. I hope all of my colleagues will take the time to examine \nthis report and its findings. The report itself is over 400 pages long \nand includes roughly 5,000 pages of additional supporting documents. In \nother words, all of my colleagues have a lot of reading to do over the \nAugust recess. I hope we will take a close look at the events detailed \nin the report and come together to work\n\n[[Page S6358]]\n\non legislative solutions that will prevent this kind of misconduct from \nhappening again in the future.\n  In closing, I want to acknowledge the hard work and countless hours \nof time spent by the Finance Committee staff who worked on this report. \nAll told, they conducted over 30 exhaustive interviews and reviewed \nmore than 1.5 million pages of documents. They also drafted numerous \nversions of this report and performed countless other tasks necessary \nto bring this investigation to a close. The bipartisan committee staff \nwhose diligence and devotion to duty made this investigation and report \npossible include the following: John Angell, Kimberly Brandt, John \nCarlo, Austin Coon, Michael Evans, Daniel Goshorn, Christopher Law, Jim \nLyons, Todd Metcalf, Harrison Moore, Mark Prater and Tiffany Smith. All \nof them deserve our gratitude for the work they have put in.\n  I also thank former Chairman Baucus for his work in starting this \ninvestigation, as well as my colleague Senator Wyden, who once again \ncontinued to work with us in a bipartisan fashion to get us to this \npoint. I personally appreciate both of those gentlemen very much. I \nhave to say it wasn't easy for them to sit through some of this stuff. \nNevertheless, it has been a privilege to work with them.\n  This is the first of a number of speeches I will probably give on \nthis subject. Hopefully it gives everybody a little bit of an \nunderstanding as to why we are so upset and a little bit of \nunderstanding about the report we have issued today and have put on the \nWeb page.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished chairman \nfrom Utah. As Members will see from the views I am going to articulate, \nwe have some strong differences about how the facts ought to be \ninterpreted, but we worked very closely together to ensure that there \nwould be one bipartisan compilation of the underlying facts. The two of \nus certainly agree that there is evidence of vast bureaucratic bumbling \nat the IRS.\n  I will also say that a review of 1.5 million pages of emails and \ndocuments and interviews with more than 30 IRS officials does not point \nto a single shred of political interference. I think as colleagues look \nat particularly the majority views and the minority views--set them \naside for a moment; the fact is, the facts of the report show that no \norder--no order was ever given to target political groups.\n  I am very pleased that we now have a bipartisan report that was \nconducted here in the Congress. That is why the bipartisan findings are \nespecially important. As I have stated, the findings contain absolutely \nno evidence to support the narrative that has been advanced by other \ncommittees and some in the media that tea party groups were targeted by \nthe IRS because of their political views.\n  My own view is that groups on the progressive side and groups on the \nconservative side--both of them were handled in a fashion that was \nunacceptable. Both were handled badly. So as we kind of get into these \nissues--as I say, I think it was a very thorough and professional \neffort that was conducted to get at the facts. I want to kind of set \nthe stage with some background.\n  Under our Federal tax laws, people can establish various types of \ntax-exempt groups. There are different rules for each type. Under \nSection 501(c)(4), an organization can be established as a social \nwelfare organization. One of the rules for these social welfare \norganizations is they have to be operated exclusively for social \nwelfare purposes. That has been interpreted since 1959 to mean, among \nother things, that the organization can engage in some political \ncampaign activity, but that cannot be its primary activity. There is no \nprecise meaning of ``primary'' for this purpose, and exactly what \nconstitutes ``political campaign activity'' is similarly unclear.\n  Another type of tax-exempt organization is established under section \n527. A 527 organization can engage in an unlimited amount of political \ncampaign activity, but there is an important distinction because a 527 \norganization has to disclose the identity of its donors.\n  Finally, the type of tax-exempt entity Americans are most familiar \nwith--501(c)(3)s are not allowed to engage in any political campaign \nactivity.\n  So now, with that as some legal background, let's unpack the events \nwe looked at.\n  In February of 2010, the IRS Exempt Organizations Determinations \nOffice, located in Cincinnati, began processing the first application \nfor 501(c)(4) status from a tea party group. Before long, the office \nwas--as one IRS employee was quoted as saying, they were inundated with \napplications from tea party groups, other conservative groups, and some \nprogressive-leaning organizations. The additional Republican views \nestimate that a total of 547 applications were the focus of our \ninvestigation; 65 percent were from tea party or conservative groups; \n19 percent were from progressive organizations. To the IRS employees in \nthe tax-exempt organizations division, these applications raised \nquestions about whether the organizations were planning to engage in \nmore political campaign activity than the 501(c)(4) law allowed.\n  We also tried to assess the cause of the surge in applications, and I \nthink it would be fair to say no one really knows what was behind that. \nIt may have been related to the Supreme Court's Citizens United \ndecision in January of 2010 which knocked down some of the key limits \non political campaign spending. It may have been related to the rise in \ncitizen activism embodied in the tea party movement, the Occupy \nmovement. In any event, there was a surge in applications.\n  Now let's fast forward to May of 2013. At the conclusion of her \nremarks at an American Bar Association conference, the Director of the \nIRS tax-exempt organizations division, Lois Lerner, disclosed that IRS \nemployees had selected 501(c)(4) applications by groups with terms like \n``tea party'' and ``patriot'' in their name for further reviews. She \nstated that the IRS employees had done so simply because the \napplications had those names in the title. Lerner described this \nprocess of selecting cases for review because of a particular name as \n``wrong,'' ``insensitive,'' ``inappropriate.''\n  A few days later, the Treasury Inspector General For Tax \nAdministration, who is known as TIGTA, released a report finding that \nthe IRS ``used inappropriate criteria that identified for rebuke Tea \nParty and other organizations applying for tax-exempt status based on \ntheir names or policy positions instead of indications of potential \npolitical campaign intervention.''\n  At the time of these disclosures from the IRS and the inspector \ngeneral, there was a very serious concern that the singling out of \nconservative groups by name may have been a consequence of political \nbias or motivation on the part of IRS employees, possibly at the \ndirection of political appointees at the IRS, the Treasury Department, \nor the White House. Although the inspector general report found no \nevidence of political bias or targeting by the IRS, this was obviously \na serious matter.\n  The then-chairman of the Finance Committee, Chairman Baucus, and the \nthen-ranking member of the committee, now our chairman, Senator Hatch, \nbegan an in-depth, bipartisan investigation to assess the facts. The \ninvestigation continued after I became chairman of the committee, and \nit has gone forward under Chairman Hatch this year. So our bipartisan \ninquiry has been underway for more than 2 years. In the course of the \ninvestigation, the bipartisan committee staff has reviewed more than \n1.5 million pages of documents and interviewed 32 witnesses.\n  At the committee's request, the inspector general has undertaken \nseveral related but separate investigations. The results of the \ninvestigation are in the report the Finance Committee submitted to the \nSenate today. That consists of a bipartisan report prepared by the \ncommittee staff and represents the views of Chairman Hatch and myself; \nadditional views of Chairman Hatch's prepared by the majority staff, \nwhich I will refer to as the additional Republican views; and my own \nadditional views, prepared by the minority staff, which I will refer to \nas the additional Democratic views.\n  In total, the principal parts of the report are 318 pages long, plus \na 90-page chronology of events and another 5,000 or so pages of \nattached exhibits.\n  I certainly hope the report is going to clear away some of the smoke \nand cut through some of the rhetoric to ensure that all sides can see \nwhat really\n\n[[Page S6359]]\n\nhappened. The report also makes a series of recommendations, including \nbipartisan recommendations, about how to initiate reforms going \nforward.\n  I would like to now describe the main conclusions that I draw from \nthe report. First and foremost, the IRS's handling of this matter was \nan unmitigated bureaucratic disaster. There were some extenuating \ncircumstances.\n  The Citizens United decision had opened the floodgates to millions of \ndollars flowing into political activities, with 501(c)(4) organizations \nseeming to be one of the favored vehicles. As a result, the IRS was \nfacing a dramatic increase in the number and complexity of applications \nfor 501(c)(4) status. At the same time, the IRS was working with vague \nregulatory standards that have not been updated since 1959. So the \nstaff at the IRS exempt organizations division has one tough job. They \nwere racing against a late-model Mustang in a 1959 jalopy.\n  Even taking that into account, the IRS handled the situation badly. \nEssentially, the IRS froze. The bipartisan report shows that for more \nthan 2 years, officials in the tax-exempt organizations division in \nboth Cincinnati and Washington failed to develop a good system for \nprocessing 501(c)(4) applications that seemed to present issues about \nthe group's potential involvement in political campaign activity.\n  During that time, the IRS staff and managers tried a variety of \ndifferent approaches. They asked one of their experts on tax-exempt \norganization law to focus on two test cases--in effect, models. That \ntook more than 8 months, and nothing really came of it.\n  Then they set up task forces, and they tried what has come to be \nknown as the infamous BOLO or ``be on the lookout'' list. They tried to \nget more information from applicants by asking a long list of detailed \nquestions. This approach actually backfired because of the volume and \nthe inappropriate nature of the questions.\n  The bumbling and the bureaucratic paralysis just went on and on. By \nmy count, there were seven different efforts over more than 2 years to \nfigure out how to handle these applications, and the first six were for \nnaught. By December 2011, a total of 290 applications for 501(c)(4) \nstatus had been set aside for further review. Two of these applications \nhave been successfully resolved, not 202. It wasn't until the late \nspring of 2012--more than 26 months after the first tea party \napplication had arrived in Cincinnati--that the IRS finally started to \nget its act together, setting up a triage group that was able to work \nthrough the backlog of applications more quickly.\n  This process could and should have been handled better. Senior IRS \nleadership should have recognized or been made aware of the problem and \nshould have stepped in much earlier to develop a system that provided \nfair and expeditious processing of these applications.\n  In light of all of this, the bipartisan report concludes that \n``between 2010 and 2013, the IRS failed to fulfill its obligation to \nadminister the tax law with integrity and fairness to all.''\n  At a time of rising political activity and under increased political \nscrutiny and pressure after the Citizens United decision:\n\n       Senior IRS executives, including Lerner, failed to properly \n     manage political advocacy cases with the sensitivity and \n     promptness that the applicants deserve. Other employees in \n     the IRS failed to handle the cases with a proper level of \n     urgency, which was symptomatic of the overall culture within \n     the IRS where customer service was not prioritized.\n\n  These are all findings of the bipartisan report.\n  Further, and I wish to make this clear, most of the applications \ncaught up in this mismanagement were tea party or other conservative \ngroups, including in some cases small and relatively unsophisticated \ngroups who didn't have the resources to engage in a protracted review \nwith the IRS. And I think we ought to make no mistake about it--these \ngroups deserve much better treatment from their government.\n  If there is any good news in all of this, the Democratic view notes \nthat there have been some positive steps. Four key employees in the IRS \nwho failed to manage properly have been removed from their positions, \nthe backlog of applications has largely been eliminated, and all but 10 \nof the applications have now been resolved.\n  The bipartisan report recommends several further steps that should be \ntaken. It makes 16 recommendations, including such reforms promulgating \nobjective criteria to trigger special review, prohibiting requests for \ndonor lists, creating a position in the taxpayer advocate dedicated to \nassisting applicants for tax-exempt status, and improving the system \nfor tracking resolution of pending applications, with a target of \nresolving applications within 270 days.\n  Now let me turn to this question of political influence. Beyond the \nindisputable gross management, another important focus of our \ninvestigation was to deal with these speculative charges and issues \nwith respect to political influence. When the original inspector \ngeneral report was issued in 2013, there was a concern that it looked \nlike most of the groups that were caught up in all of this were \nconservative-leaning groups, such as those with ``tea party'' in their \nnames. In light of this, there was concern that we might be looking at \nsomething that was much worse than bureaucratic bungling. The concern \nwas that there might have been an attempt to exert inappropriate \npolitical influence over the process of reviewing applications for tax-\nexempt status by disfavoring certain applications because of their \nperceived political views.\n  In my view, that would constitute a grave and completely legitimate \nconcern not just for Republicans, not just for conservatives, but for \nevery American. Among the fundamental principles underpinning our \nsystem of government are equal treatment for all and an inviolate right \nto freedom of speech and expression. Both of these principles are \nespecially important when it comes to the IRS, which has great power \nthat must be exercised in an evenhanded fashion. Of perhaps equal \nimportance to an evenhanded exercise of its authority, it is incumbent \non the IRS to take great care to ensure against any perception that it \nis acting because of bias, political or otherwise.\n  In the committee's investigation--which, as Chairman Hatch has noted, \nwent for more than 2 years--the bipartisan staff carefully reviewed the \nevidence, and in contrast to the bipartisan analysis and \nrecommendations I have just described, in this instance, the Democratic \nand Republican views have come to different conclusions. The additional \nDemocratic views conclude that there is absolutely no evidence that \nthere was an attempt to exert political influence. The additional \nRepublican views--in contrast, in the 120 pages--are trying to make the \ncase that there somehow, someway, must have been political interference \ninvolved but without identifying any direct evidence, documentary or \notherwise, to support the case.\n  I wish to explain first by laying out the basic facts and then by \nresponding to the main points in the additional Republican view.\n  First, on the facts, according to the report, the staff found no \nevidence of involvement by the White House or by Treasury Department \npolitical officials. None. The staff found no evidence that any \npolitical appointee in the Obama administration was involved in the \nreview of applications or in the establishment of standards for their \nreview. None.\n  As a side note, during most of the relevant period, the IRS \nCommissioner was Mr. Douglas Shulman, who was appointed by President \nBush, and the principal official responsible for the management of the \nrelevant IRS activities, Lois Lerner, was a career civil servant who \nwas named to her position as Director of the tax-exempt organizations \ndivision by IRS Commissioner Mark Everson, who also was appointed by \nPresident Bush.\n  In addition to finding no emails, no memos, and no other documents \nindicating there was an attempt to exert political influence, the \nreport indicates that the staff asked every IRS employee who was \ndirectly involved in the review of the applications whether there had \nbeen any attempt to exert political influence over the handling of \napplications or whether they saw anyone else processing applications in \na politically biased way. The staff asked 25 people. Every single one \nof them said there was no political bias.\n\n  In addition, the inspector general audit that spurred the \ninvestigation\n\n[[Page S6360]]\n\nalso found no evidence of targeting or political bias. Let me repeat \nthat because there have obviously been some misconceptions. The 2013 \ninspector general audit found no evidence of political bias in \n501(c)(4) processing. This is discussed further in the committee's \nreport, including an email from the deputy inspector general at the \noffice stating: ``There was no indication that pulling these \napplications was politically motivated.'' There is an email from the \ninspector general chief counsel stating that the tea party was not \ntargeted. The inspector general himself testified before our committee \nthat no political motivation was found, and his office further stated \nthat no relevant communications were found coming from the White House \nor Treasury.\n  Further, although more conservative-leaning than progressive-leaning \ngroups were affected, several progressive organizations were subject to \nthe same kind of gross mismanagement, long delays, and inappropriate \ninformation requests that were experienced by the conservative \norganizations. The bipartisan report notes that terms such as \n``progressive'' and ``ACORN,'' as well as terms intended to capture the \nvarious Occupy Wall Street groups, were included with ``tea party'' and \n``9/12'' on the IRS BOLO list. Again, ``progressive'' appeared on the \nsame BOLO list as ``tea party'' from day one. The report also shows \nthat progressive groups were subject to mismanagement, delays, and \nintrusive questions from the IRS.\n  I also would like to respond to several other particulars to the \nadditional Republican views. Notwithstanding the plain fact that there \nis no evidence of any attempt to exert political influence over the \nprocess, the additional Republican views strive over the course of 120 \npages to make the case that somehow, someway, somewhere, there was \nsomething sinister going on. This is done through a combination of \ninnuendo, speculation, and unjustified inference.\n  The additional Republican views make much of the fact that the head \nof the tax-exempt organizations division and the principal person \nresponsible for the management issues involved, Lois Lerner, appears to \nhave been a Democrat with liberal views about some issues. Much is also \nmade of the fact that the President and some congressional Democrats \nwanted to impose tighter restrictions on campaign spending. Put these \ntwo facts together--say, Republicans--and it becomes clear in their \nview that the fix was in.\n  However, the actual evidence to support this theory is nonexistent. \nFor example, the Republican views quote an email from Ms. Lerner's \nhusband in which on election day he told her he had written in the \nnames of Socialist Labor candidates on his ballot. They quote an email \nfrom Ms. Lerner--an email she wrote--celebrating Maryland's approval of \nsame-sex marriage. And they note what they apparently consider to be \nparticularly suspicious: that in the 1.5 million pages of documents, \nthe Republican staff found no instance in which Ms. Lerner, members of \nher family, or her friends ``expressed positive sentiments about the \nRepublican Party, a specific Republican candidate, or the Tea Party.''\n  So what we have is that Ms. Lerner's husband voted for Socialists, \nshe is a Democrat, she supports same-sex marriage, and she apparently \ndoesn't have a lot of Republican supporters among her family. You just \nhave to ask yourself, what is this supposed to prove? There is no \nevidence that any of these views were brought to the actual review of \nthe application process, and that, to me, is what is paramount.\n  Granted, the Republican views also quote various other emails in \nwhich Ms. Lerner expresses support for President Obama or is critical--\nsometimes harshly so--of the Republican Party and specific Republican \nofficials. To my mind, this is pretty much irrelevant chitchat. It is \ngossip. It is coffee-shop talk, locker-room talk. As the Democratic \nviews puts it, ``There is no evidence that Lois Lerner allowed her \npolitical belief to affect how she carried out her duties as a manager \nof the Exempt Organizations office.''\n  The Republican views also highlight Ms. Lerner's views about the \nSupreme Court Citizens United decision. It is pretty obvious she didn't \nlike it. She thought it threatened to unleash a flood of unregulated \nmoney in the Federal campaign. The Republican views even suggests that \nit was somehow nefarious that Ms. Lerner was closely following the \nCitizens United decision.\n  All of this tells us nothing. She was the head of the IRS division \nresponsible for applying the law regarding the appropriate level of \npolitical campaign activity undertaken by 501(c)(4) organizations. It \nwould be odd, in my view, if she weren't closely following Citizens \nUnited. It was an important decision with major implications for \npolitical campaign spending.\n  It is not surprising to me that she didn't like the decision. Eighty \npercent of Americans felt the same way. I am one of them.\n  The Republicans also were exercised that President Obama, various \ncongressional Democrats, and the Democratic Party in general opposed \nthe Citizens United decision and supported tighter limits on campaign \nspending. No question that is true. But the Republican views make a \nremarkable leap. They say:\n\n       Overall, it is apparent that the need for an explicit \n     Presidential directive to target the Tea Party and \n     conservative organizations was rendered unnecessary by the \n     White House's frequent public statements condemning political \n     spending. Government agencies were acutely aware of the \n     President's wishes and responded accordingly.\n\n  So said the majority in their views.\n  Now, just think about that. Just kind of put your arms around that. \nThe President wanted to limit campaign spending. So the Republicans on \nthe committee would have us conclude that various relatively low-level \ncareer government officials, without any direct intervention whatsoever \nfrom the White House, from the Treasury Department or from anybody else \nin a position of political authority, just sprang into action and \nengaged in a conspiracy of some sort to harass conservative groups. I \nguess it was almost conspiracy by osmosis. I find these extraordinary \nleaps to just defy logic.\n  Federal civil servants are allowed to have a political opinion. The \nPresident of the United States and Members of Congress are allowed to \nexpress their views about the campaign finance system. Certainly some \nof Ms. Lerner's personal emails were in poor taste, and it may have \nbeen bad judgment for someone in her position to be sending emails to \nher friends on her office computer expressing political opinions, but \nthe only pertinent question here--the only pertinent question--is \nwhether the political views of Ms. Lerner or other officials influenced \nthe evenhanded administration of the law. Although the majority points \nto numerous embarrassing emails from Ms. Lerner, they cannot point to \neven a single one where she directed or encouraged employees to \nexercise political bias.\n  The majority views also make another argument. They assert that \nsignificantly more conservative-leaning groups than progressive-leaning \ngroups were affected by the dysfunction at the IRS and that this, in \nand of itself, proves there was a bias against conservatives. This is a \nmore serious argument, but when you unpack this one, it, too, falls \nshort. As I have said before, it appears from the report that most of \nthe groups affected were conservative, but progressive groups were \naffected too. The bipartisan report indicates that progressive was on \nthe BOLO list, along with ACORN and other terms such as ``Occupy'' that \nwere considered to indicate progressive or Democratic-leaning political \nengagement.\n  The report also shows the IRS conducted workshops directing employees \nto look for terms such as ``progressive'' and ``Emerge'' as well as \n``tea party.'' Again, these groups suffered from the same sort of \ndelays and intrusive questions that tea party and other conservative \ngroups suffered from.\n  Nonetheless, Republicans on the committee insist the fact that more \nconservative than progressive groups were caught up in the IRS \ndysfunction necessarily means there was bias. However, this inference \ncan be only drawn if there were equal volumes of applications coming \ninto the IRS from conservative and progressive groups. There is just no \nevidence this was the case.\n  Moreover, there is good reason to believe that in the wake of \nCitizens United, the increasing volume of applications--particularly \napplications that raised serious issues about involvement\n\n[[Page S6361]]\n\nin political campaign activity--came primarily from conservative-\nleaning groups. Independent watchdogs have determined that 80 percent \nof political campaign spending by 501(c)(4)s was supported by \nconservatives, and the IRS staff said they were inundated with tea \nparty applications. If that is the case, it would be unsurprising that \nmost of the delays and other problems included conservative groups. \nThey were mostly the ones who were applying.\n  Again, I am not trying in any way to justify the poor treatment \nreceived by conservative groups, but the report found no evidence that \nthe typical conservative application was any more likely to be \nmistreated than the typical progressive application, and without such \nevidence it is inappropriate to infer there was bias.\n  A third argument the Republican views assert, which also falls short, \nis that there was a double standard: on one hand the treatment of the \nconservative groups caught up in the 501(c)(4) dysfunction and on the \nother hand the treatment of some nonprofit groups supported by \nDemocratic Senators. The Republican views cite three cases in which \nDemocratic Senators asked that the review of applications for tax-\nexempt status be expedited and where that apparently was done. They \ncontrast the relatively quick resolution of these cases to the delays \nexperienced by tea party and other conservative applicants for \n501(c)(4) status.\n  On the face of it, the facts the three cases relied on do not support \nthe Republican inference there was a double standard. In the first \nplace, according to the information in the report, the three groups \nsupported by Democratic Senators had applied for 501(c)(3) status, \nunder which they can engage in no political activity. Further, in two \nof the three cases there is nothing in the report indicating the cases \nwere particularly difficult or controversial.\n  In the Democratic views, it is noted the third case was a request for \nthe expeditious consideration of an application for tax-exempt status \nby the One Boston Foundation in order to facilitate fundraising and \nassistance to those who were the victims of the Boston Marathon \nterrorist attacks in April of 2013. In that case, it appears from \npublic reporting there was an unusual legal issue and that in part at \nthe request of various public officials, the IRS did in fact cut \nthrough some redtape and resolve the issue so this organization could \nget up and running quickly.\n  As far as I know, there are no allegations that the One Boston \nFoundation was anything remotely like a political organization, and I \nam not aware of any partisan or other controversy surrounding it. I was \nsurprised by the Republican views that apparently thought it was \ninappropriate or unfair for public officials to encourage the IRS to \nhelp get the organization up and running or that the IRS did anything \nwrong by handling this case well. To put it more pointedly, I was \nsurprised this was considered to be in any way relevant to our \ninvestigation.\n\n  As the bipartisan report makes clear, the IRS took far too long to \nreview 501(c)(4) applications from tea party and other groups, and it \nsubjected many of the groups to unnecessary delay and inappropriate \nquestioning, but the fact that the IRS was able to handle a few very \ndifferent cases reasonably well does not show a double standard. In \neffect, the Republican views compare apples and oranges.\n  Before closing, I want to briefly address several other matters \ncovered in our report. The first is the crash of Lois Lerner's hard \ndrive in 2011 which resulted in the loss of some emails that may have \nbeen relevant to our inquiry.\n  Senator Hatch and I learned about the hard drive crash in June 2014, \njust before we were originally planning to release the committee's \nreport. The two of us immediately asked the inspector general to \ninvestigate to determine whether there was evidence of intentional \nwrongdoing and whether any of the lost emails could be recovered from \nother sources.\n  The inspector general conducted a thorough investigation, which took \nmore than 1 year. Here is what the inspector general found, as \nexplained in the report: Although we do not know why her hard drive \ncrashed, there is no evidence it was crashed intentionally. The \ninspector general was able to recover about 1,300 additional emails, \nand the inspector general found that some potentially relevant backup \ntapes had been unintentionally mishandled and then destroyed, contrary \nto the document retention policy the IRS put in place after our \ninvestigation began. These findings have led to a significant amount of \ncriticism about the current IRS Commissioner, Mr. John Koskinen.\n  Before closing, I want to make a couple of points in response to the \ncriticism of Commissioner Koskinen. First, it is important to remember \nthat the principal problems we have been talking about--in other words, \nChairman Hatch and I have been talking about these issues here for \nprobably close to an hour regarding the IRS handling of applications \nfor section 501(c)(4) status--all occurred before Mr. Koskinen came on \nboard as IRS Commissioner in December of 2013. In fact, during the \nentire period covered by the original 2013 inspector general \ninvestigation, the IRS Commissioner was Mr. Doug Shulman, as I stated, \nappointed by President Bush. Although Mr. Koskinen inherited these \nproblems, he did not create them.\n  Second, looking at how the IRS handled the hard drive crash, I do \nthink Mr. Koskinen waited too long to inform the Committee on Finance \nand that the senior IRS leadership could have done a better job keeping \ntrack of the backup tapes. That said, there is zero evidence that these \nmistakes were politically motivated, and there is no reason to believe \nthe potential loss of some of Lois Lerner's emails compromised the \ninvestigation.\n  We recovered thousands of emails covering this period from the \nrelevant people corresponding with Ms. Lerner. Even taking the \npotential loss of some emails into account, the bipartisan report \nconcludes that ``the large volume of information we have received gives \nus a high degree of confidence in the accuracy of the conclusions \nreached during our investigation.''\n  Looking forward, Commissioner Koskinen is a skilled and experienced \nleader. I am confident he is going to work closely and cooperatively \nwith Chairman Hatch, with myself, with Democrats and Republicans on the \nCommittee on Finance to continue to improve the operation of the IRS \nExempt Organizations Division.\n  We also asked the inspector general to investigate four other cases \nin which there have been allegations of political motivation by the \nIRS. One involved a White House official who referred to a specific \ncompany when criticizing the use of tax loopholes. The question was \nwhether he had received inside information from the IRS, and of course \nthat would be a serious violation of the law.\n  The other cases involved conservative groups that unfortunately had \nsome of their confidential tax information inappropriately made public. \nThese cases have generated intense congressional interest and lawsuits. \nThe underlying concern, similar to the concern about the handling of \nthe 501(c)(4) applications, was the serious and legitimate worry as to \nwhether there had been an effort to exert political influence over the \nIRS--in effect, to use the IRS as a weapon against conservatives.\n  Here, based on the information in the report, the inspector general's \ninvestigations have led to clear conclusions. The inspector general \ninvestigation of the White House official found he did not receive any \nconfidential information from the IRS. He apparently was just shooting \nfrom the hip, which may be bad judgment, but it is not a crime. In the \nthree cases where confidential taxpayer information was inappropriately \ndisclosed, it was because of unintentional mistakes by low-level IRS \nemployees, some of whom have been subject to administrative discipline.\n  These mistakes were regrettable, and the staff has made bipartisan \nrecommendations to prevent them from recurring, but the bottom line is \nthat in each of these cases there was no effort to exert political \npressure.\n  In summary, our report tells a regrettable story. Many applicants for \ntax-exempt status were treated badly. They were treated in an \nunacceptable way, and they deserved better service from their \ngovernment, but in the end this is a story about gross bureaucratic \ndysfunction. It is not about an attempt to exert political influence \nover or inject political bias into how the IRS does its job.\n\n[[Page S6362]]\n\n  Further, the main culprits are gone, the system has been improved, \nthe committee has made a series of bipartisan recommendations to \nimprove it further, and I think it is fair to say that both Democrats \nand Republicans on the Senate Committee on Finance--Chairman Hatch has \nworked very closely with me on this--are committed to making sure \nnothing like this vast bureaucratic bungling ever happens again.\n  So we here in the Senate have more to do. We are going to have to do \nsome hard thinking about one of the underlying issues, which is the \nmoney and politics, including in the context of tax-exempt \norganizations that are not supposed to be engaged primarily in \npolitical activity.\n  As part of this--and I respect the views of Chairman Hatch and others \nwho may disagree--I think the Congress has to come up with better \nstandards. We ought to set--again, in a bipartisan way--to overhaul the \n1959 regulatory jalopy. Just put our arms around that one. Here we are \nin the digital world with so many changes in our country, and we still \nhave the basic 1959 approach to regulating these issues. We ought to \nestablish rules of the road that fully respect First Amendment rights \nand also give all organizations--be they progressive, conservative or \nin between; whatever they are--better guidance about what they can and \ncannot do given their tax-exempt status.\n  My own view is, when it comes to money and politics, we really can't \nget enough transparency. I hope we will be able to work on those issues \nin the future. In fact, the last time we had a bipartisan bill here was \nin the last Congress, when Senator Murkowski, our colleague from \nAlaska, joined me on a bill that said all major spending from \neverywhere--wherever you were; progressive, conservative--essentially \nhad to be disclosed. So my own view is that we need more transparency, \nnot less.\n  Mr. President, I have some brief remarks to make on another subject, \nunless our chairman wants to make further comments. I will yield on \nthis topic and let the chairman comment. Then after the chairman is \ndone speaking, I will ask unanimous consent--and be certainly no more \nthan 10 minutes on another subject--to speak after the chairman has had \na chance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague.\n  Look, people can make up their own minds about this. Read the doggone \nreport. We cannot read it and just say: Brush it off; there is just one \nrogue employee there. There are all kinds of employees that are \nmentioned in the report. We can't just wipe it off because we were \nunable to interview the Treasury Department or the White House. We \ncan't just wipe it off, when we look at all the information there, and \njust say: Well, this was a bad apple in the IRS, and it was just an \nordinary course of events. They mistreated liberal groups or \nprogressive groups, so-called, as much as they did the conservative \ngroups.\n  There is no question they didn't. There were very few progressive \ngroups, and it was easy to understand which ones they were looking at. \nMy gosh, some of those have had criminal accusations against them. \nThere are only a few of them, compared to the wide group of people on \nthe conservative side--that they knew were conservatives and they put \non the BOLO list, the ``be on the lookout'' list.\n  Now, yes, we weren't able to get into the Treasury Department, and we \nweren't able to get into the White House and what they did or didn't do \nin these areas. I don't think we can read this report and conclude that \nthis is just a terribly dysfunctional IRS. I think we can agree that we \nall knew that before we had this report. But this is a very serious \nreport.\n  By the way, the report is signed off by both Democrats and \nRepublicans. We can't just wipe it away and say: Well, this is just a \nbunch of bad apples at the IRS.\n  Lois Lerner took the Fifth Amendment. She refused to testify in front \nof the House. Now, she had a right to do that, and I would be the first \nto stand for that right. But why would she do that?\n  The fact of the matter is that it was a dysfunctional IRS, and it was \nbeing managed by people who were bright enough to not be dysfunctional.\n  I am not going to say much more because we will answer every one of \nthe distinguished Senator's approaches here this evening. I would just \nsuggest: Read the report. It is signed off by Democrats and \nRepublicans. We can't just blow it off by saying this was just the \ndysfunction at the IRS. We all know the IRS is dysfunctional, and part \nof the reason it is is that the IRS is supposed to represent every \ncitizen in this country in a fair and balanced way. But it is governed \nby a union. They can't even fire somebody at the IRS without going \nthrough all kinds of hoops, and then they are going to have a rough \ntime firing them no matter how bad they are. We all know that. We have \nseen it year after year here. To just brush this off like it is just \none bad apple there--there are more apples there than Lois Lerner.\n  All I can say is this report is a very serious report. It can't be \njust brushed away. It is a serious report for many reasons.\n  One reason is that conservative groups, by a vast majority, were \nmistreated--and mistreated in election years, where they were trying to \nmake a difference. I am not saying I agree with them. All I can say is \nthey had a right to get their 501(c)(4) status determined and not just \ndragged out past the election.\n  That alone is something that ought to cause everybody in this country \nto be a little bit frightened that the IRS can do that. I don't want it \ndone for liberal groups that way. If the Republicans were ever totally \nin control of the White House, the Justice Department, the IRS, and the \nTreasury, I wouldn't want anybody treated like these conservative \ngroups were treated. I would probably differ with some of those \nconservative groups, myself. But they deserve to be treated with \nrespect and with dignity and under the law. And they were not. And we \ncan't just brush it off on just one person being out of line.\n  I am very concerned about it. I suggest people read the report. Read \nthe report.\n  There were some things we weren't able to look into. I wish we had \nbeen able. I think we might have been able to more definitively lay \nthis out. But to make a long story short, read the report--something \nthat my colleagues on the other side agreed to. Then read the minority \nviews, then read the majority views, and see what you think. But I will \ntell you this: You have to be alarmed.\n  The most dangerous agency in our government happens to be the IRS, \nthe Internal Revenue Service. They can break anybody overnight. People \nare afraid of the IRS, and with good cause. When we see what happened \nhere, they are going to have to be even more fearful--unless we can \nstraighten this mess up. I intend to see that it is straighten up--or \nstraightened out, may be a better way of saying it.\n  I am very concerned about this. We had people who were mistreated. I \nmight not agree with them, but they were mistreated, in comparison with \nthe liberal groups, which you would have questions about them anyway--\nsome of them.\n  Well, I am sure we will debate this even more. I don't want to take \nmore of the Senate's time tonight. But I am extremely concerned because \nI don't think there is an agency in government that causes more fear in \nthe hearts of people than the IRS. And when we see the mess they did, \nwe can't just chalk it up to just a few rogue employees there at the \nIRS. When we see the mess they did, we have to stop and think: My, \ngosh, is this the way our country is run? Is this the way the IRS is \nrun? Can we do anything about it? Or do we just have to, as citizens, \nsit back and forget about it?\n  Well, we are not going to let them forget about it. This is a very, \nvery important report. I think the majority and minority views are \nworth reading. I don't see how we can conclude at the end of it that \nthere is not a tremendous problem there.\n  Keep in mind that when the inspector general investigates and if he \ndoesn't find an absolute, they say he doesn't find anything. They are \nnot going to pick on anybody. I have a lot of respect for the inspector \ngeneral at the IRS. I remember his being criticized because apparently \nhe is a Republican. But he\n\n[[Page S6363]]\n\nis not going to accuse anybody if he doesn't have the evidence.\n  In this case, there is a whole accumulation of evidence that we \ncannot ignore and just brush away under the guise that this is just a \nrogue person. There were other people there as well who caused this \ncalamitous set of events, and we have to not just brush it away. We \nhave to look at it, and we have to find a way of straightening out the \nIRS so it is not a partisan institution--which most Americans believe \nit is, and almost every conservative believes it is.\n  Now, we are making some strides here, and I am going to continue to \npush on to see that we make strides. But I have to say, ask the \nAmerican people out there what they think. Read the report, and then we \nwill talk about it some more.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I was down here on the floor last night talking about the \nneed for actually getting some real progress to fix the mess that the \nwildfire budgeting system in our country has become.\n  I noted there have been several proposals offered, including one by \nmyself and Senator Crapo called the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, \nreferred to the Budget Committee. There have been hearings held. There \nhave been speeches given about the need to fix the broken system to \nprovide Federal agencies with the help they need to battle the \ndevastating blazes year in and year out. Senator Crapo and I have \nintroduced a bill to fix this broken system, and we need to get some \nreal results.\n  In spite of all the talk, there hasn't been any real action. Twenty-\nfour hours later and I am back, pleased to be able to stand here \ntonight to say several of our colleagues have heeded my call, and \ntomorrow I will be putting into the Congressional Record a colloquy \nwith all of our signatures--Democrats and Republicans--committed to \nresolving this issue in the fall. We have been working since last night \nto set aside a way to work together this summer, with the fires in the \nWest literally fueling the hunger to take meaningful steps this fall, \nto finally end fire borrowing, and to ensure that Federal agencies have \nthe resources they need to prevent these infernos from igniting in the \nfirst place.\n  Just today, the Forest Service released a report that makes the very \nclear point that, for the first time in its history, the Forest Service \nis routinely spending more than half of its budget battling wildfires. \nThey note that the cost of fire suppression could well increase to \nalmost $1.8 billion by 2025. This vicious cycle of underfunding \nprevention work while huge infernos burn up Federal fire suppression \naccounts is going to get worse, and what we are going to see as it does \nis the Forest Service becoming the fire service. That is not in \nAmerica's interest. It is particularly damaging to my part of the \ncountry.\n  I am pleased to be able to say that, in the last 24 hours, we have \nmade some real progress in addressing this challenge. There is a \ncommitment on both sides of the aisle now, here in the Senate, to get \nthis fixed this fall.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Wyden pertaining to the submission of S.

Mr. President, I rise to mourn the loss of an honored \nKentuckian, renowned businessman,\n\n[[Page S6364]]\n\nand public servant, and my personal friend, Ed Lane. After battling \ncancer for more than 2 years, Ed passed away on August 2. He was 73 \nyears old.\n  Ed was passionate about supporting his hometown of Lexington and the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky. He was well connected to the State's business \ncommunity through his work as a commercial real estate broker. Seeing a \nneed for a publication for and about Kentucky business, he founded and \nwas the publisher of the Lane Report, a great business news magazine \nfor Kentucky.\n  Encouraged by his friends in the community to seek public office, Ed \nalso represented the 12th District of Lexington on the Lexington-\nFayette Urban County Government Council since 2005. He was reelected \nwithout opposition in 2014. As a council member, he brought his \nbusiness experience and his wisdom to fight for and represent Lexington \nbusinesses and his district.\n  In addition to his public service as a council member, Ed supported \nhis community through many philanthropic efforts and volunteer service. \nHe served on the boards of many community, arts and civic \norganizations, including the Breeders' Cup Host Committee, the UK \nSanders-Brown Center of Aging Foundation Board, the Lexington Downtown \nDevelopment Authority Board, the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Airport \nBoard, the Kentucky Arts Council, the 2010 FEI World Equestrian Games \nAdvisory Committee, LexArts, the Lexington Ballet, the Lexington \nPhilharmonic, the Better Business Bureau of Lexington, Junior \nAchievement of the Bluegrass, the Mayor's American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act Committee, the Fayette County Equine Task Force, the \nCommerce Lexington Agribusiness Committee, and others.\n  Ed was an artist, photographer, and art collector. He loved cooking, \nreading, gardening, and talking politics. He also loved fast cars, \nearning him the nickname ``Fast Eddie'' in the 1960s. Ed is survived by \nhis daughters Susan Brett Lane and Katherine Meredith Lane.\n  I was deeply saddened to hear of Ed's passing. He was a good friend, \nand I always enjoyed reading the Lane Report, especially Ed's engaging \nOne-on-One interviews. Elaine and I send our condolences to his family.\n  The Lexington Herald-Leader recently published an article detailing \nEd's life and achievements. I ask unanimous consent that said article \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Lexington Herald-Leader, Aug. 3, 2015]\n\n Lexington Council Member, Business Magazine Founder and Publisher Ed \n                            Lane Dies at 73\n\n                    (By Greg Kocher and Karla Ward)\n\n       Lexington Urban County Councilman Edwin ``Ed'' Green Lane \n     III, founder and publisher of The Lane Report magazine, died \n     Sunday night. He was 73.\n       Lane, a longtime commercial real-estate broker, had battled \n     cancer for more than two years, according to a statement \n     Monday afternoon from The Lane Report, an online and monthly \n     print magazine of business news.\n       He made his first run for public office in 2004, when he \n     was elected to represent the 12th District on the council. He \n     took office in 2005 and had been re-elected to two-year terms \n     ever since.\n       Lane is survived by daughters Susan Brett Lane and \n     Katherine Meredith Lane, who were with him when he died, \n     according to The Lane Report.\n       ``The staff is saddened by the passing of an amazing man, \n     but it is lessened by how we marvel at the legacy Ed Lane \n     leaves,'' said Mark Green, editorial director of Lane \n     Communications Group.\n       ``His energy, his intelligence, his enthusiasm, his \n     optimism and concern for his family, community and the nation \n     will be missed but will continue to influence us. He was a \n     true leader. The man had enthusiasm for life.''\n       Mayor Jim Gray issued a statement: ``Not only was Ed highly \n     successful in his own business, he was an outstanding public \n     servant who brought his business experience and expertise to \n     City Hall to fight for Lexington's business men and women. He \n     also was a strong advocate for his district. Our city will \n     miss his leadership and experience.''\n       Sen. Mitch McConnell said he ``was saddened to hear of the \n     passing of my good friend Ed Lane. Ed was a dedicated public \n     servant and a tireless advocate for the people of Kentucky. \n     He was also a successful businessman and publisher. I always \n     enjoyed reading the Lane Report, a great publication for and \n     about Kentucky's business community, especially Ed's engaging \n     `One-on-One' interviews.''\n       Councilman Bill Farmer Jr. said Lane's knowledge about real \n     estate proved valuable whenever the council considered \n     whether to buy property.\n       ``He could make or break any land deal,'' Farmer said. ``He \n     could sit and go through the numbers at the microphone, off \n     the top of his head, about what the overhead would be, how \n     much something would cost, what the cost would be per square \n     foot. . . . He could look at any deal like that and criticize \n     it or laud it, and immediately you would go, `Yep, that's it \n     and why.' ''\n       That talent for finances made Lane a strong member of the \n     council, former Mayor Jim Newberry said.\n       ``His financial acumen was way above average,'' Newberry \n     said. ``He was really helpful when it came to budget issues \n     or the pension problems, or whether or not we ought to \n     refinance bonds.''\n       He said Lane also was ``a fun person to be around'' and \n     they became good friends.\n       ``Ed just had a personality that I would characterize as \n     delightful,'' Newberry said. He ``had a good sense of humor, \n     didn't get too worked up about things, certainly didn't take \n     himself or what he was doing too seriously. . . . He gave a \n     lot to the community and had so much more to give.''\n       Lane was born in Nashville and graduated from the \n     University of Georgia.\n       After college, he worked for a major advertising agency in \n     New York for a couple of years, according to The Lane Report \n     website. He later moved to Atlanta, where he was sales \n     manager for WRNG radio and was president of the Atlanta Young \n     Republicans.\n       He also got into the commercial real-estate business, which \n     led to a job as national director of real estate for \n     Lexington-based Jerrico in its Atlanta regional office, The \n     Lane Report said. Lane came to Lexington regularly as he \n     scouted new locations for the company, and he was involved in \n     many site acquisitions for Long John Silver's Seafood Shoppes \n     nationwide.\n       In 1981, Lane started the Lexington-based commercial real-\n     estate brokerage Lane Consultants and, later, Lane \n     Communications Group, publisher of The Lane Report.\n       Running a magazine is ``a risk that very few people have \n     been able to be successful in,'' but Lane ``did it \n     terrifically well,'' said Jim Host, founder of Host \n     Communications and former Kentucky secretary of commerce.\n       ``It ended up kind of being the official business magazine \n     of the state,'' he said.\n       Host said Lane was kind, insightful and had a non-\n     threatening demeanor during interviews ``but also really got \n     to the core of what he was trying to communicate.''\n       ``I admired the dickens out of him,'' Host said.\n       Former councilman Doug Martin said he and Lane were from \n     opposite ends of the political spectrum, but they enjoyed \n     breaking bread together in a restaurant or at Lane's home.\n       ``He was a fine chef,'' said Martin, who sat next to Lane \n     in the council chambers from 2009 to 2013. ``He was always \n     very proud of coming up with some great concoction or some \n     great recipe or some great ingredient that he'd found. He \n     would have pots of herbs and fish and seasonings, and it \n     would all just kind of stew together, and it would end up in \n     this fabulous presentation.''\n       Services will be at 7 p.m. Aug. 15 at Kerr Brothers Funeral \n     Home on Harrodsburg Road.

Jim Rutledge, the master distiller \nof Four Roses Bourbon, has announced his retirement from that position \neffective September 1, 2015.\n  Jim is in his 49th year working in the bourbon business, and has been \nthe master distiller at Four Roses since 1995. As master distiller, Jim \nis in charge of perfecting each Four Roses bottle. He oversees every \nstage of the distillation process and oversees the character, quality \nand consistency of each barrel.\n  Jim began his career in the distilled spirits industry with Seagram's \nLouisville Research & Development operation in 1966. He was transferred \nto the Four Roses distillery in Lawrenceburg, as the Kentucky area \nmanager, in 1994 and then named master distiller in 1995. In 1998, Jim \nreceived Seagram's top award, the Mel Griffin Quality Award for North \nAmerica, and in 2001, Jim was indicted into the inaugural class of the \nKentucky Bourbon Hall of Fame.\n  In 2007, Jim received the Lifetime Achievement Award from Malt \nAdvocate Magazine, and in 2008, the leading liquor industry \npublication, Whisky Magazine, named him the Ambassador of the Year for \nAmerican Whiskies as part of their annual Icons of Whisky Awards. Jim \nwas also inducted into Whisky Magazine's Hall of Fame in\n\n[[Page S6365]]\n\n2013. He was only the second American inducted into this elite group.\n  Jim was also active with the Kentucky Distillers Association board of \ndirectors for 13 years, and served as chairman of the internationally \nattended Kentucky Bourbon Festival for 7 of the 9 years he was on the \nboard. The Kentucky Bourbon Festival is a 6-day event that takes place \nin Bardstown, KY.\n  Jim graduated from the University of Louisville with a BSC in \nmarketing and a minor in chemistry. Let me add that not only did Jim \nand I both attend the University of Louisville, we are also fraternity \nbrothers.\n  In retirement, Jim hopes to stay involved with bourbon and the \ndistilled spirits industry. I suspect he will also get to spend more \ntime with his wife Beverly Anne, as well as his children Dennis, \nDeborah, Cynthia, and Doralee, and his grandchildren.\n  Jim will be missed as the face of Four Roses Bourbon but I know the \nentire distilled spirits industry in Kentucky joins me in recognizing \nhis lifetime of accomplishment and wishing him the best in retirement. \nI want to wish congratulations again to Jim Rutledge for his many \nsuccesses in the world of bourbon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/05/senate-section/article/S6365-1", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DANIELLE BLAKENEY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the respective \nanniversaries of three of the most important programs for American \nseniors: Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.\n  On August 14, 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social \nSecurity Act into law. Among other things, this bill created the Social \nSecurity Program and made a promise to all Americans: that if you work \nhard, contribute, and play by the rules, you can retire and live in \ndignity.\n  Before Social Security, more than 50 percent of older Americans in \nthis country lived in poverty. Many of these seniors worked hard their \nentire lives but became dependent on others and often had to beg for \nbasic necessities, such as food, shelter, and medical care. ``Poverty-\nridden old age'' was a pressing national concern both for seniors and \nyounger Americans, who wondered if their years of hard work would \nprovide enough for them to survive in their old age.\n  Today, less than 9 percent of seniors live in poverty. This \nsignificant decrease in poverty among seniors is a direct result of \nSocial Security and the secure retirement it provides.\n  As we approach the program's 80th anniversary, Social Security is the \nmost successful program in American history, and its trust fund \ncontains sufficient assets to fully fund all promised benefits for \nalmost 20 years. Yet, notwithstanding its success, Social Security \nremains deeply controversial among many Republicans and superwealthy \nAmericans, who are committed to weakening and ultimately destroying the \nprogram.\n  Just 10 years ago, President George W. Bush tried to privatize Social \nSecurity, which would have forced deep cuts to guaranteed benefits and \na massive increase in debt. More recently, several leading Republicans \nhave called for delaying the retirement age and cutting benefits. I \nhave strongly opposed all these proposals to break our promises to \nseniors, and I will continue to do so.\n  On July 30, 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson expanded our Nation's \ncommitment to seniors by signing into law the Social Security \nAmendments of 1965--the legislation that created Medicare. For 50 \nyears, this program has helped millions of American seniors live \nlonger, healthier lives and has also provided them with the peace-of-\nmind and economic security that comes with having comprehensive health \ncoverage.\n  I remember what it was like for seniors who became sick or injured \nbefore Medicare was enacted. In fact, Medicare was implemented during \nmy tenure on the board of trustees for the Southern Nevada Memorial \nHospital, now the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada. Prior \nto Medicare, 40 percent of seniors who came into that hospital were \nrequired to have a signature from a friend or relative who agreed to be \nresponsible for their medical bill if they could not pay. If the \npatient could not produce a signature, they were turned away. \nNationwide, nearly half of all seniors age 65 and older were uninsured, \nand if you were fortunate enough to have health insurance, you paid \nmore than 50 percent of the cost out-of-pocket. That is how bad it was \nfor seniors. Today, 98 percent of all seniors are insured and can go to \nthe hospital or see their doctor when they need care. This program has \ntruly been a lifeline for millions of seniors throughout the country.\n  And let us not forget about Medicaid, which was also created under \nthe Social Security Amendments of 1965. Medicaid provides health care \nand long-term services to 16 million low-income seniors and individuals \nwith disabilities. Medicaid pays for services that Medicare does not \ncover. It ensures that low-income seniors and individuals with \ndisabilities have access to a wide variety of services. These options \noften allow them to remain in their communities rather than relocating \nto nursing homes.\n  I have long worked to protect and strengthen Medicare and Medicaid \nfor the millions of seniors and younger Americans who depend on these \nbenefits. In 2010, I proudly cast my vote in support of the Affordable \nCare Act, which is strengthening Medicare and working to keep seniors' \nhard-earned savings in their own pockets. Since this law was enacted, \nmillions of seniors throughout the country have saved more than $15 \nbillion dollars on their prescription drug costs and the program's \nsolvency has been extended for 13 years. The Affordable Care Act has \nalso given States the option of expanding their Medicaid Programs so \nthat more low-income Americans can access the care they need.\n  Sadly, Republicans have repeatedly attacked and tried to eliminate \nMedicare and Medicaid, just as they have done with Social Security. \nThroughout the last 50 years, they have tried to privatize Medicare, \nconvert Medicaid into a block grant program, and cut benefits for both \nprograms. Now, they have set their sights on the Affordable Care Act, \nwith repeated challenges to the law before the courts, more than 50 \nvotes to repeal or undermine the law, and Republican Governors turning \nback millions of Federal dollars to expand their Medicaid Programs and \nexpand access to health care in their States. Republicans are \ndetermined to destroy effective health care programs in spite of all \nthe good they have done, but my Democratic colleagues and I will \ncontinue to work to prevent this from happening.\n\n[[Page S6366]]\n\n  As President Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act into law 80 \nyears ago, he said, ``Today, a hope of many years' standing is in large \npart fulfilled . . . We have tried to frame a law which will give some \nmeasure of protection to the average citizen and to his family against \nthe loss of a job and against poverty-ridden old age.'' Similarly, five \ndecades ago President Johnson declared, ``No longer will Americans be \ndenied the healing miracle of modern medicine. No longer will illness \ncrush and destroy the savings that they have so carefully put away over \na lifetime so that they might enjoy dignity in their later years.'' Let \nus remain mindful of these words and the promise that our country has \nmade to seniors as we commemorate the 80th anniversary of Social \nSecurity and the 50th anniversary of Medicare and Medicaid. I am \ncommitted--just as President Roosevelt and President Johnson were \ndecades ago--to giving Americans the health and economic security they \nneed, deserve, and have earned.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/05/senate-section/article/S6366-1", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CELEBRATING THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNITED LABOR AGENCY OF NEVADA\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 20th \nanniversary of the United Labor Agency of Nevada.\n  Since it was established in a joint venture with United Way of \nSouthern Nevada and Nevada State AFL-CIO in 1995, the United Labor \nAgency of Nevada, ULAN, has been assisting Nevada families who are \nexperiencing unexpected crises. Whether it be job loss or a medical \nemergency, ULAN provides individuals and families throughout our \ncommunity with assistance so they may have access to vital resources, \nsuch as housing and nutrition, during their time of need. ULAN also \noffers guidance to those battling hardship to prepare plans for long-\nterm self-sufficiency and financial stability. These imperative \nservices have made a lasting impact on Nevadans, and the benefits of \nULAN's services are felt across the Silver State.\n  ULAN began as a small dream, with only Audrey Arnold and $30,000 to \nhelp the community. Under Ms. Arnold's steadfast leadership, ULAN has \ngrown into a $2 million organization. Today, Ms. Arnold and her \ndedicated staff and volunteers are now able to provide a one-stop shop \nfor those experiencing hardship. By offering immediate housing, \nnutrition, job outreach, and financial counseling services, the \norganization works to prevent financial situations from becoming worse \nand helps individuals and families transition to living within their \nmeans on a new reduced income through federal programs and other \nresources. This two-pronged approach has had a remarkable effect on \ncountless families over the past 20 years.\n  I applaud ULAN on their decades of dedicated public service and \nextend my best wishes for much continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/05/senate-section/article/S6366-2", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                WOOD DALE AND GRAYSLAKE, ILLINOIS STORMS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, once again, Illinois communities are \nassessing damage from severe storms. A confirmed tornado along with \nheavy winds, hail, and lightning moved through the Chicago area on \nSunday leaving a path of damage in several communities.\n  The city of Wood Dale was hit Sunday afternoon during the last day of \nits Prairie Fest, an annual 4-day festival with rides, food, and music. \nDue to the storm, rides were stopped and organizers tried to evacuate. \nBut the storm approached too quickly, and its winds knocked down the \nfestival's main tent where many people had gathered to take shelter.\n  Twenty people were hurt and, tragically, Steven Nincic was killed. He \nwas at the festival with his wife and two young daughters. Our thoughts \nand prayers are with Steven Nincic's family, as they are with those who \nwere injured by the storm. I spoke this morning with Wood Dale's Mayor \nNunzio Pulice, and I know he is leading the community through this \nloss.\n  Severe weather continued throughout the day in the Chicago area. \nChicago's Lollapalooza music festival evacuated its festival grounds at \nGrant Park before its scheduled closing. Mayor Emanuel and I also spoke \nthis morning. He is working to assess the damage and help residents \nclean up and recover from the damage.\n  My office is also in touch with Mayor Rhett Taylor of the Village of \nGrayslake, Mayor Kristina Kovarik with Village of Gurnee, and Illinois \nRepresentative Sam Yingling. These communities are hurting in the \naftermath of Sunday's terrible storms that brought winds at 60 miles an \nhour and golf ball-sized hail.\n  A tornado touched down in Grayslake, ripping the roof off the high \nschool and damaging several other buildings and homes. These storms \nalso toppled power lines and trees, making several roads in the area \nimpassable. Crews are working to clean up debris and restore \nelectricity. Over 16,000 people were left without power this morning. \nThankfully, no injuries were reported as a result of the Grayslake \nstorms.\n  Along with other members of the Illinois congressional delegation, I \nstand ready to help in any way I can as the people in Dale Wood and \nGrayslake begin the clean-up and recovery from this weekend's deadly \nstorms.\n  The State of Illinois has sustained extensive damage and managed \ncleanup costs following a number of severe storms already this year. I \nstand ready to support any request for Federal disaster aid, including \nthe Governor's request today for FEMA's assistance with damage \nassessments in downstate communities still recovering from earlier \nstorms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/05/senate-section/article/S6366-3", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6366-S6367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        COMPOUNDED PHARMACEUTICALS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we all know the Department of Defense's \nrecord with bungled acquisitions that led to $500 hammers and $7,000 \ncoffee makers. The Pentagon has a tough time keeping up with \nunscrupulous contractors who have figured out how to get rich on the \ntaxpayer's dime, and unfortunately I have learned of yet another \nexample of this.\n  Several dozen pharmacies around the country specialize in compound \npharmaceuticals. These are drugs that are combinations of two or more \nprescription medications. Many of these pharmacies are on the up-and-\nup, helping people, and our servicemembers, recover from illnesses or \nwounds. But a good number of these compounding pharmacies have linked \nup with high-pressure salesmen and disreputable physicians to scam the \nDepartment of Defense out of as much as $1.2 billion in taxpayer money \nin this year alone.\n  The sales pitch went like this. A U.S. servicemember, a military \nretiree, or their spouse might get a phone call at home asking whether \na TRICARE beneficiary is suffering from pain. The telemarketer might \nask a few simple questions, get a little bit of personal information, \nand suddenly, weeks later, prescription creams would start showing up \nin the mail. In other cases, a food truck may pull up in front of a \nmilitary base. If a servicemember wanted a hot dog, he or she could \nlisten to a pitch about compounded pharmaceuticals and sign a piece of \npaper. In many cases, that servicemember had no idea they were signing \nup for an expensive prescription that might have no medical value. \nThese sneaky marketers would pass personal information on to doctors, \noften hundreds or thousands of miles away, who would then write \nprescription after prescription, never having seen the patient.\n  These ointments and creams were then custom made by a compounding \npharmacy, and the bill was sent to the Department of Defense. According \nto health officials in the Department of Defense, one of these pain \ncreams had a value of about $150 each. But the Defense Health Program \nwas billed more than $9,000 each. This scam has added up to big \ndollars. In 2004, the Department of Defense spent just $5 million on \ncompound pharmaceuticals. By 2014, as these efforts began to ramp up, \nthe total rose to $514 million. In April of 2015, just 1 month alone, \nthe bill to the Pentagon was nearly $500 million. DOD says the total \ncost of compound pharmaceuticals for this fiscal year could be as much \nas $1.2 billion.\n  What is tragic about this waste of money is that it could have been \nprevented. In 2013, the Pentagon considered policy changes it could \nmake to the approval process for compound pharmaceuticals. DOD \nofficials came under heavy pressure, both from Members of Congress and \nfrom some of these companies, not to move forward.\n\n[[Page S6367]]\n\nThis pressure continued right up through March of this year.\n  Finally, in May, the Department of Defense was able to institute a \nscreening procedure to get at this problem. And the costs charged to \nTRICARE have dropped dramatically--down to $10 million per month.\n  Let me repeat that. The Department paid $500 million for compound \ndrugs in April. The Department changed its approval process, and it now \npays $10 million a month for compound drugs. I met with Assistant \nSecretary for Health Affairs Dr. Jonathan Woodson about this. He is \nconfident that this safeguard--and others--will protect the taxpayer in \nthe future. Regrettably, in this case, the horse ran out of the barn \nand cost the American taxpayer $1.2 billion before anyone could stop \nthese scams. But no one can escape the long arm of the law forever. The \nDepartment of Justice has opened more than 100 criminal investigations, \nand $60 million has been recovered so far. The DOD has suspended 26 \nproviders for wrongdoing, and identified 71 individuals or entities who \nare believed to be associated with these scheme.\n  As vice chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, working \nwith Chairman Cochran, we have the responsibility to look after how the \nPentagon is spending its funds. I bring this episode to light because \nthere are many lessons to be learned about the need to demand a \nbureaucracy agile enough to catch profiteers and about the ways that \ncongressional oversight can hamper enforcement rather than encourage \nit. I hope my colleagues takes those lesson to heart.\n  I will also say that Thad Cochran and I will continue to root out \nthese incidents wherever they occur and work in partnership with the \ndepartment to provide for our servicemembers in ways faithful to the \ntaxpayer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/05/senate-section/article/S6367-1", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING WENDY WERTHEIMER\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to acknowledge Wendy Wertheimer, an \noutstanding Federal employee who has spent decades working to advance \nthe domestic and international HIV/AIDS research effort. Wendy is about \nto complete nearly 30 years of Federal service that began in the Senate \nand is now coming to an end at the National Institutes of Health.\n  Like many bright young people in Washington, Wendy began her career \nright here in the U.S. Senate, working for Senator Jacob Javits. Later \nshe joined the legislative staff of what was then called the Senate \nLabor and Human Resources Committee, led by Chairman Edward Kennedy and \nRanking Member Jacob Javits. Wendy's first assignment was the Venereal \nDiseases Control Act, which many on staff saw as a form of hazing for a \nnew, young staff member. But Wendy was personally connected to the \nissue. Her grandfather had been the chair of Dermatology and \nSyphilology at a hospital in Pittsburgh and had conducted early \nclinical studies of syphilis. She embraced the assignment, and the bill \npassed with bipartisan support. It was the first bill Wendy had ever \nworked on--she was off to a good start.\n  In 1979, the American Social Health Association established the first \nadvocacy group for venereal disease control and research, and Wendy was \noffered a job as its director of government affairs. After hearing the \nnews, Wendy's mother was horrified and told her she will never get \nanother date because everyone will assume that she has a venereal \ndisease. Wendy accepted the job anyway and became the first venereal \ndisease, or VD, advocate in Washington. She was a pioneer in the field \nand began working on a number of new education and research training \nprograms, including the National VD Hotline.\n  On June 5, 1981, the first cases of what we now know as AIDS were \nreported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. By the end \nof 1981, five to six new cases of the disease were being reported each \nweek and an epidemic of fear was breaking out. The American Social \nHealth Association became one of the first organizations to advocate \nbringing attention to this disease, and Wendy found herself on the \nfrontlines combatting the HIV/AIDS pandemic. In 1991, she was recruited \nby the NIH to help establish the Office of Research on Women's Health. \nAnd since 1992, Wendy has been the senior advisor, responsible for \nplanning, policy, legislation and communications at the Office of AIDS \nResearch at the NIH.\n  It is hard to imagine, but when Wendy Wertheimer began at the NIH, an \nAIDS diagnosis meant a sure and agonizing death. We have come a long \nway since the disease was first reported, and in many ways progress on \nHIV/AIDS is one of the most remarkable success stories in the history \nof biomedical research. Wendy Wertheimer shares in this success and the \nresearch accomplishments that led to lifesaving treatments and a \nhopeful future about what more can be achieved.\n  For more than two decades, Wendy has worked with Dr. Jack \nWhitescarver--the longest serving director at the Office of AIDS \nResearch at NIH--who is also retiring this year. And here is what he \nsaid:\n\n       We have made critical and even breathtaking progress in \n     AIDS research against many odds. We have been challenged to \n     confront and address stigma, homophobia, racial disparities, \n     and criticisms of the AIDS research investment. We have come \n     a long way, but the AIDS pandemic is far from over and \n     remains a threat to global populations. Any declaration that \n     the end is near is premature, inaccurate, and perilous to \n     progress against the pandemic.\n\n  He is right. Being HIV-positive is not the death sentence it once \nwas, but the battle is far from over. And although Dr. Whitescarver and \nWendy Wertheimer are retiring, the fight goes on, and the work \ncontinues. I want to thank them for all they have done and all they \nwill do to combat this terrible disease. They have set a high bar for \nthe dedicated public servants who follow them.\n  I will close with this. I strongly believe in the role of public \nservice to create change and make a difference. Wendy Wertheimer's \nyears of service reflect these values. I am honored to congratulate her \non a job well done, and I am lucky to count her as a friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/05/senate-section/article/S6367-2", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6367-S6368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING YOSHI KATSUMURA\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last Sunday, the legendary chef Yoshi \nKatsumura passed away after a battle with cancer.\n  You would never guess that a 15-minute walk from Wrigley Field, where \nhot dogs and beer reign supreme, would take you to a place bringing \ntogether the foods of Tokyo, Paris, Lyon, and Chicago. But that is what \nYoshi built at the quiet, unassuming place known simply as Yoshi's \nCafe. Honored by his peers for the past 30 years of exquisite food \npreparation, Yoshi was a master of his art.\n  Yoshi was born in Japan's Ibaraki Prefecture--a region on the main \nisland of Japan--in 1950. At the age of 20, he apprenticed under \nanother legendary chef, Hiroyuki Sakai in Tokyo. Through Sakai, Yoshi \nbegan learning the complexities of French cooking.\n  In 1973, Yoshi ventured to Chicago, where he quickly advanced in fine \nFrench culinary arts. He studied under Chicago's first celebrity chef, \nJean Banchet, at Le Francais. Yoshi would go on to refine his skills in \nParis and Lyon, and he returned to Chicago as a chef and partner at the \ncity's premier French fusion restaurant, Jimmy's Place. In 1982, Yoshi \nopened his own restaurant with his wife Nobuko, Yoshi's Place.\n  For more than three decades, Yoshi's Cafe has won the hearts and \nstomachs of Chicago and the country. Yoshi's has been featured on the \nFood Network and listed among ``America's Top Tables'' by Conde Nast's \nGourmet magazine. His fusion of cultures brought diners to North \nHalsted Street for dishes like Hamachi tartare and the Wagyu burger.\n  If you look closely for a sign next to Yoshi's Cafe, you will find \nthat Aldine Avenue east of Halsted is designated ``Yoshi Katsumura \nWay.'' His way was creating wonderful food for his community and making \nit a better place. He served on the Northalsted Business Alliance board \nand organized charitable events, including Hurricane Sandy relief and \naid for victims of the 2011 Japanese tsunami. And he always took the \ntime to talk to his customers.\n  Loretta and I love Yoshi's. I once showed up at the restaurant on a \nMonday evening, forgetting it was closed. Stranded on the corner, \ntrying to decide where to go, I heard someone call my name. It was \nYoshi, who lived\n\n[[Page S6368]]\n\nabove the restaurant, calling down to me and offering to fix a meal for \nme on his day off. That was the moment when service became friendship \nand I came to know the goodness of this man.\n  Yoshi was indeed a special kind of man. His last message was to keep \nYoshi's Cafe going. He will be missed. Loretta and I send our prayers \nand thoughts to his wife, Nobuko; his daughter, Mari; his son, Ken; his \nbrother Kazuhiro Katsumura; and grandson Hiro.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/05/senate-section/article/S6368-1", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6368-S6369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we began this year with a new Republican \nmajority in the Senate promising to govern responsibly. Unfortunately, \nthis promise has so far proven hollow. Beginning with the shameful \ntreatment of the nomination of Loretta Lynch to be Attorney General, \nthe Republican leadership has used excuse after excuse to keep the \nSenate from voting on those nominated to serve in our justice system.\n  It took 4 months for the Republican majority to schedule a vote on a \nsingle judicial nomination. So far this year, the Republican-controlled \nSenate has allowed confirmation votes on just five judicial nominees. \nThe slow trickle of confirmations is a dereliction of the Senate's \nconstitutional duty to provide advice and consent on judicial nominees. \nSince the beginning of this year, the number of Federal court vacancies \ndeemed to be ``judicial emergencies'' by the nonpartisan Administrative \nOffice of the U.S. Courts has increased by 158 percent. There are now \n31 judicial emergency vacancies that are affecting communities across \nthe country. Many are concerned that this obstruction threatens the \nfunctioning of our independent judiciary, as Juan Williams recently \npointed out. I ask unanimous consent that his column in The Hill titled \n``The GOP's judicial log jam'' be printed in the Record.\n  There is a different way to lead. Similar to the balance of power \ntoday, in the last 2 years of the George W. Bush administration the \nDemocrats were in control of the Senate. And by this time in 2007, when \nI was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, we had confirmed 26 judges. \nIn contrast, this Congress, the Republican majority has confirmed just \nfive judicial nominees appointed by President Obama. That is more than \nfive times more judges confirmed under a Democratic majority with a \nPresident of the opposite party than today's Senate Republican \nmajority.\n  The delay and obstruction is occurring even though all 14 of the \ncurrent judicial nominees pending on the Executive Calendar have \nbipartisan support and were voted out of the Judiciary Committee by \nvoice vote.\n  These nominees are highly qualified and deserve better treatment from \nSenate Republicans. Of great concern is the treatment of Judge Luis \nFelipe Restrepo, who will fill an emergency vacancy on the U.S. Court \nof Appeals for the Third Circuit in Pennsylvania. Judge Restrepo was \nunanimously confirmed 2 years ago by the Senate to serve as a district \ncourt judge. I have heard no objection to his nomination. Yet it took 7 \nmonths just to get him a hearing in the Judiciary Committee.\n  He has strong bipartisan support from the two Pennsylvania Senators, \nand was voted out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously by voice vote. \nOnce confirmed, Judge Restrepo will be the first Hispanic judge from \nPennsylvania to ever serve on this court and only the second Hispanic \njudge to serve on the Third Circuit. He has the strong endorsement of \nthe nonpartisan Hispanic National Bar Association, HNBA. At his hearing \nin June, Senator Toomey stated that ``there is no question [Judge \nRestrepo] is a very well qualified candidate to serve on the Third \nCircuit'' and underscored the fact that he recommended Judge Restrepo \nto the White House. Senator Toomey then described Judge Restrepo's life \nstory as ``an American Dream story'' recounting how Judge Restrepo, \nborn in Medellin, Colombia, came to the United States, became a U.S. \ncitizen, and rose to the very top of his profession by ``virtue of his \nhard work, his intellect, his integrity.''\n  Given his remarkable credentials, recent Senate confirmation, and \nstrong bipartisan support, you would think this Chamber would have \nconfirmed Judge Restrepo months ago. No Senate Democrat opposes a vote \non his nomination. Senate Republicans are the only thing holding up his \nnomination. I know Senator Toomey can be a fierce advocate for issues \nhe cares passionately about, and I hope he will get a firm commitment \nfrom the majority leader on a date for a vote on his confirmation. The \ncontinued delay on such a qualified judicial nominee is a poor \nreflection on this body. I ask unanimous consent that a recent column \nby Carl Tobias in the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review titled ``Confirm Judge \nRestrepo'' also be printed in the Record.\n  Another eminently qualified nominee who is also strongly supported by \nthe HNBA is Armando Bonilla. Mr. Bonilla has been nominated to serve on \nthe U.S. Court of Federal Claims, and would be the first Hispanic judge \nto hold a seat on that court. Mr. Bonilla has spent his entire career--\nnow spanning over two decades--as an attorney for the Department of \nJustice. He was hired out of law school in the Department's prestigious \nHonors Program, and has risen to become the Associate Deputy Attorney \nGeneral in the Department. Despite these outstanding credentials, the \njunior Senator from Arkansas objected to a request to vote on his \nnomination, along with any of the four other nominations to the Court \nof Federal Claims. These CFC nominees have been waiting for more than \n10 months for a vote, and were twice voted out of the Judiciary \nCommittee unanimously by voice vote.\n  Those who serve in this body understand that no one Senator can stop \na judicial nominee from being confirmed. One Senator can stop a \nunanimous consent agreement, but not a vote. The delay and obstruction \nof the 14 judicial nominees pending on the Executive Calendar, \nincluding Judge Restrepo and Mr. Bonilla, is at the hands of the \nRepublican leadership and in the hands of the other Republican \nSenators, who have allowed their leadership to delay these accomplished \njurists and prosecutors, even when it hurts their own constituents.\n  Republican leadership can still reverse course and lead responsibly. \nAlthough they have only allowed 5 judicial nominees to be confirmed \nthis year, they can make immediate progress by moving to confirm the 14 \nnominees pending on the Executive Calendar. They should schedule a vote \nfor outstanding nominees like Judge Restrepo and Mr. Bonilla. They \nshould schedule a vote for the pending judicial nominees from Missouri, \nCalifornia, New York, and Tennessee.\n  In the last 2 years of President Bush's tenure, the Democratic \nmajority moved 68 district and circuit judges through the process to \nconfirmation. In the last 2 years of President Reagan's tenure, a \nDemocratic majority confirmed 85 judges. Let us go back to treating the \nFederal judiciary like the coequal branch that it is and hold \nconfirmation votes on the nominees before us. There is no reason for \nthe double standard based on who is in the majority. We made it clear \nwe would not do that with President Reagan and President Bush. We \nshould uphold the same standard for President Obama.\n  I hope that we return to the regular order that existed for the \nnominees of past administrations and clear the Senate Executive \nCalendar of consensus nominations before the upcoming recess. The time \nto act on the 14 consensus judicial nominations pending before the full \nis Senate is now.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From the Hill, July 27, 2015]\n\n                       The GOP's Judicial Logjam\n\n                           (By Juan Williams)\n\n       As the hot Washington summer approaches August, the \n     Senate's Republican majority is already on vacation from the \n     work of confirming judges. At the current torpid pace, they \n     will put the lowest number of judges on the federal bench in \n     any year since 1969.\n       Do you think this crashed system for filling the federal \n     bench has anything to do with the GOP Senate majority's \n     distaste for the liberal in the White House--even if he was \n     chosen by the American people twice as their president and \n     given the constitutional authority to nominate judges?\n       Yes, this involves a heavy dose of simple obstruction by \n     the GOP. Keep in mind that if it were not for Republican \n     judges blocking President Obama's executive order on \n     immigration, the GOP would have already lost that fight. So \n     in a politically polarized nation, Republicans have reason to \n     keep an eye on the partisan make-up of the courts.\n\n[[Page S6369]]\n\n       That is just one of the many political backroom plots being \n     played out in the Senate over control of the nation's courts.\n       The game begins with GOP payback for the Democrats having \n     changed the filibuster rules in 2013 to allow confirmation \n     with a simple majority vote. That ``nuclear option'' broke \n     the GOP hold on judicial nominations while Democrats still \n     held the majority and cleared the way for 96 judges to take \n     their seats.\n       Now the GOP holds the Senate majority and Republicans have \n     slammed the lid on new judges from Obama. This makes judicial \n     nominations a valuable point of leverage in future \n     negotiations with the White House over budget issues, \n     regulation and more.\n       And with a presidential election next year, the GOP hopes \n     to soon have a president of its own sending over nominations, \n     beginning January 2017. Then, there is the reality that four \n     of the five current Supreme Court justices are over the age \n     of 75--including Justice Anthony Kennedy, the ``swing vote.'' \n     Republicans have little incentive to allow Obama to put more \n     Democrats throughout the nation's judiciary.\n       The extreme Republican anger at the federal courts is \n     already a big issue in the 2016 presidential race. Last week, \n     Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), chairman of the Judiciary \n     Committee's oversight panel for the federal courts, held a \n     hearing titled: ``With Prejudice: Supreme Court Activism and \n     Possible Solutions.'' He called the hearing to show the \n     depths of his upset with the recent decisions to uphold \n     ObamaCare and grant same-sex couples the right to marry.\n       Cruz, a former Supreme Court law clerk, used the hearing to \n     trash a court with a majority of five conservatives, led by a \n     conservative--Chief Justice John Roberts--and by all measures \n     a strongly conservative record in rulings on guns, campaign \n     spending, and blocking Environmental Protection Agency \n     regulation of airborne chemicals.\n       As a candidate for the GOP's 2016 presidential nomination, \n     Cruz knows the high court's standing among Republican voters \n     is low. After the ObamaCare and gay marriage decisions, only \n     18 percent of Republicans told Gallup last week that they \n     approve of the court. Cruz set the tone for his hearing by \n     saying he wanted to review ``options the American people have \n     to rein in judicial tyranny.''\n       Sen. Cruz is a fan of extreme action to deal with this \n     ``tyranny.'' He is proposing having Supreme Court justices \n     stand for retention election every eight years.\n       Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, another candidate for \n     the GOP presidential nomination, favors term limits.\n       Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) declared during the hearing \n     that the current court has a ``foreign, unhistorical approach \n     to law.''\n       Between the Senate Republicans' success at clogging the \n     judicial appointment process and the burst of harsh rhetoric, \n     there is a growing risk of a serious erosion of the public \n     trust in the nation's judicial system.\n       Obama also is playing the dangerous game.\n       He has not nominated anyone to fill 47 of the 63 open seats \n     on the federal bench. No doubt he feels it would be a waste \n     of time to keep pushing good money--in this case judicial \n     nominees--down a hole. The president does have seven judicial \n     nominees before the Senate and three would help with the \n     judicial emergencies.\n       For both liberals and conservatives, the current roadblock \n     has consequences. According to www.uscourts.gov, 28 federal \n     courts have now declared ``judicial emergencies'' because \n     they lack enough judges to hear pending cases.\n       Earlier this month, the Senate confirmed its fifth federal \n     judge for the year, Kara Stoll. The current Senate is so far \n     behind they have not reached the half-way point to match the \n     previous record low for confirmations, 12, set in President \n     Obama's first year in office.\n       The number of judges confirmed during President George W. \n     Bush's second term, higher than the current rate for Obama, \n     is still less than the number of judges confirmed in the \n     final two years of Presidents Reagan and Clinton.\n       But now that Republicans are in charge, the Bush record \n     looks generous.\n       ``It's ridiculous,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.). He \n     chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee with the Democrats in \n     the majority. ``They are trying to politicize the courts. And \n     it's irresponsible. I refused to do it with President Reagan. \n     I refused to do that with President [George W.] Bush.''\n       Can the Senate expect better results with a President \n     Hillary Clinton or President Bernie Sanders? How about \n     President Jeb Bush or President Donald Trump? Most likely it \n     will be more of the same--a continuing loss of the bipartisan \n     trust and respect that once made America's courts the gold \n     standard of justice for the world.\n\n     \n                                  ____\n            [From Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, July 30, 2015]\n\n                         Confirm Judge Restrepo\n\n                            (By Carl Tobias)\n\n       Today, as in 2007, a Pennsylvania federal district court \n     judge's unopposed nomination to the Third Circuit requires a \n     final vote in a Senate the president's party does not \n     control. On March 15, 2007, a Democrat Senate confirmed \n     President George W. Bush's nomination of Pittsburgh District \n     Judge Thomas Hardiman one week after his Judiciary Committee \n     approval.\n       This precedent is one reason Senate Majority Leader Mitch \n     McConnell, R-Ky., must schedule an immediate vote on Judge \n     Luis Felipe Restrepo's nomination, which the committee \n     approved on July 9. Restrepo would fill one of 28 vacancies \n     the courts have declared judicial emergencies.\n       President Obama nominated the experienced, uncontroversial \n     jurist in November on the strong bipartisan recommendation of \n     Pennsylvania Sens. Bob Casey (D) and Pat Toomey (R). \n     Moreover, on July 1, Third Circuit Judge Marjorie Rendell \n     assumed senior status. This means that Judge Hardiman is one \n     of six active Pennsylvania members on the court, which \n     experiences two vacancies in 14 positions.\n       Toomey's spokesperson says that the senator has spoken \n     directly with McConnell ``to emphasize the importance of \n     getting Judge Restrepo confirmed'' but did not indicate \n     Toomey urged a prompt vote. As Senate Minority Leader Harry \n     Reid, D-Nev., said on July 7, if Toomey simply asked ``to \n     confirm Judge Restrepo immediately, (I'm confident) we could \n     confirm Judge Restrepo to the Third Circuit next week.''\n       Obama has consulted with Casey and Toomey, who have \n     cooperated in helping to fill one Pennsylvania Third Circuit \n     seat and 14 district court posts since 2011. They have \n     carefully reviewed applicants and proposed excellent \n     individuals whom Obama usually nominates.\n       However, the Senate slowly processes nominees. Most \n     critical have been Republican delays of floor votes. For \n     example, between November 2013 and late March 2014, the \n     Eastern District faced seven openings. The many prolonged \n     vacancies have slowed federal court litigation, requiring \n     people and businesses to wait interminably for case \n     resolution.\n       Casey and Toomey suggested Restrepo for the Eastern \n     District, and the Senate approved him on a June 2013 voice \n     vote. Each assumed credit for proposing Restrepo's Third \n     Circuit nomination in November press releases. Toomey \n     exclaimed that Restrepo would ``make a superb addition to the \n     Third Circuit,'' but the legislator retained his ``blue \n     slip''--which permits a nominee to proceed--from Nov. 12 \n     until May 14, even though Casey submitted his in November. \n     The jurist's June 10 hearing was long overdue.\n       At his hearing, Restrepo comprehensively and candidly \n     answered questions and senators appeared satisfied. For \n     example, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who chaired the hearing, \n     observed that Restrepo has been reversed only twice.\n       McConnell has not publicly stated when he would arrange a \n     floor debate and vote. However, on June 4, he suggested he \n     might not allow ballots for more Obama circuit nominees, \n     although he did finally accord Kara Farnandez Stoll, a \n     Federal Circuit candidate who had waited 10 weeks, July floor \n     consideration.\n       The Third Circuit needs all its members to deliver justice, \n     and Restrepo has languished over eight months. The Senate \n     must confirm him before the August recess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/05/senate-section/article/S6369-1", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOMINATION OBJECTION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, this month the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee completed its work on 12 bills\n\n[[Page S6370]]\n\nto fund the government for fiscal year 2016, which begins October 1, \n2015.\n  I congratulate Chairman Cochran and his subcommittee chairs for a \nfull and open process. They worked hand in hand with me and my ranking \nDemocratic members. But their bills are based on the postsequester \nlevels of the Republican budget resolution. The bills reported by the \ncommittee are too spartan to meet the needs of the American people.\n  The difference between the Republican budget and the President's \nbudget request is $74 billion. That is a lot. But even with that \nincrease, the discretionary top line will be equal to what we spent in \n2010, 6 years ago.\n  I would like to talk about one example of the real impact of the \nRepublican sequester level budget--failing our veterans.\n  Veterans deserve promises made and promises kept. Instead, the Senate \nfiscal year 2016 Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related \nAgencies bill is at least $857 million short of what is needed for \nveteran health care. And the House is even worse, at least $1.4 billion \nbelow what is needed. At those levels, about 70,000 fewer veterans will \nreceive medical care.\n  Despite record demand for services, our veterans are still waiting to \nget appointments at hospitals and clinics. In fact, the electronic wait \nlist has grown by almost 10,000 over the past 2 months. Sequester will \nresult in waitlists growing exponentially.\n  Sequester budgeting for veterans' medical care means almost 150,000 \nveterans living with hepatitis C will be in limbo, not receiving new, \nlifesaving drugs.\n  It is not just care that is shortchanged. Sequester budgeting means \nhospitals and clinics continue to deteriorate. The VA has identified \nbetween $10 billion and $12 billion of backlogged code violations and \ndeficiencies at hospitals and clinics across the country. In fiscal \nyear 2013, the VA spent $1.3 billion repairing clinics, but for fiscal \nyear 2016 the Republican bills cut funding in half, even as the backlog \ngrows.\n  Yesterday, the Republican leader stated that he did not want a \ngovernment shutdown. Encouragingly, he added, ``At some point we'll \nnegotiate the way forward.''\n  Democrats are ready. Since May, we have been asking to negotiate to \neliminate sequester with a sequel to Murray-Ryan. The only way we will \nhave shutdown, showdown, and government by self-made crisis is if the \nRepublican majority refuses to send the President bills he can sign and \ninstead sends bills that are too spartan or contain poison pill riders \nlike prohibiting funding for Planned Parenthood or signature \ninitiatives like the Affordable Care Act and climate pollution rules.\n  Whether it is funding our troops or keeping our promises to veterans, \nwe can't do it without a new budget deal. Freezing Federal spending \ndoesn't meet the growing, complex needs of the Nation.\n  None of us were elected to make America weaker. Yet sequester makes \nus weaker and sequester hollows out America.\n  America deserves better, but we need a new budget deal to do it. \nDemocrats are ready to get serious and get to the table. We need to end \nsequester for defense with no more gimmicks and end sequester for \nprograms not funded in the defense bill that protect our country and \nmake it great.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/05/senate-section/article/S6370-1", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               DRIVE ACT\n\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President last week the Senate passed a multiyear \nsurface transportation bill, the Developing a Reliable and Innovative \nVision for the Economy Act, H.R. 22, referred to as the DRIVE Act. I \nwas pleased to vote for this bipartisan bill. For the first time in 3 \nyears, the Senate has passed a long-term surface transportation bill. \nUnfortunately, the House adjourned before taking up our bipartisan \nlegislation--forcing the Senate to pass a short-term funding patch, the \n34th since 2009.\n  I am disappointed that we were not able to get the long-term bill to \nthe President's desk. However, I believe the Senate has laid the \ngroundwork to make the most recent short-term extension the last for \nthe next few years. I look forward to working with my colleagues in \nboth houses of Congress to complete a long-term bill before the October \n29 deadline, and I expect the DRIVE Act to be the baseline for those \nefforts.\n  While the DRIVE Act's most important feature is that it provides \ncertainty to construction firms and state governments to invest in \nrebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges, it also includes several \nprovisions to improve the way we move goods and people across our \nnation. In the last few years, I have become very concerned with the \nway one particular good--Bakken oil--moves through the country. The \nfiery explosions that accompany Bakken oil train derailments have many \nin Wisconsin rightfully concerned as we have unwittingly become one of \nthe most traveled oil train routes in the country.\n  The DRIVE Act includes a rail safety bill that was added thanks to \nthe leadership of Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Thune, Ranking \nMember Nelson, and Senators Booker and Wicker. I was pleased that the \nbipartisan bill that passed out of committee included provisions to \nrequire a railroad liability study and comprehensive oil spill response \nplans. These provisions were similar to what is included in the Crude-\nby-Rail Safety Act, on which I worked closely with Senator Cantwell to \nintroduce.\n  While the liability study and oilspill response plans are steps in \nthe right direction, as the bill moved to the Senate floor, I believed \nwe needed to do more to improve rail infrastructure, transparency, and \nfirst responder preparedness. That is why I was pleased to work with \nEnvironment and Public Works Ranking Member Barbara Boxer, Commerce, \nScience, & Transportation Committee Chairman John Thune and Ranking \nMember Bill Nelson as well as Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to \ninclude two sections in the bill that passed the Senate on July 30. I \nwas able to add these sections to the substitute amendment, No. 2266, \nthat was adopted on July 29, 2015, and the provisions were included in \nthe final version of the bill that passed the Senate.\n  The first section, section 35416, would require that the Federal \nRailroad Administration keep on file the most recent bridge inspection \nreport prepared by a private railroad bridge owner and provide that \nreport to appropriate state and local officials upon request. This \nallows State and local officials who are responsible for public \ninfrastructure integrity and public safety to have access to \ninformation they need to keep the public safe. The substance of this \nsection is also contained in amendment 2538.\n  The second section, section 35431, addresses concerns raised by the \nfirst responder community who have had to fight for access to real-time \ninformation about hazmat trains entering their jurisdictions. \nFirefighters want to know in advance when hazmat trains will arrive in \norder to better prepare and keep their communities safe. The substance \nof this section is also contained in amendment 2539.\n  The section modified the bill's original language that only required \nreal-time hazmat train information to go to Department of Homeland \nSecurity Fusion Centers. The centers would then provide the information \nto local first responders only in the event of an accident, when it is \nless useful. My provision requires fusion centers to provide the real-\ntime information to State and local first responders at least 12 hours \nprior to a hazmat train arriving in their jurisdiction. The \ntransmission must also include the best estimate of the train's \narrival.\n  I believe these two sections significantly improve transparency and \nsafety in communities along oil train routes. This is also a \nsignificant achievement for state and local organizations, who are \noften powerless to take action against federally regulated railroads--\ndespite being responsible for any problems they cause. In closing, I \nagain would like to thank Senators McConnell, Thune, Nelson, Boxer, and \nInhofe for their leadership on this legislation. And I pledge to work \nwith my colleagues in the House and Senate to pass a long-term surface \ntransportation bill in the next three months.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/05/senate-section/article/S6370-2", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6370-S6371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 1965\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today marks the 50th anniversary of one \nof the most important civil rights bills we have ever come together as \na nation to pass: the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\n[[Page S6371]]\n\n  I am proud to commemorate this anniversary as the Senator for \nMaryland. Marylanders have a rich history of battling discrimination, \ngoing back to the darkest days of slavery. The brilliant Frederick \nDouglass was the voice of the voiceless in the struggle against \nslavery. The courageous Harriet Tubman delivered 300 slaves to freedom \non her Underground Railroad. And the great Thurgood Marshall went from \narguing Brown v. Board of Education to serving as a Supreme Court \nJustice. All were Marylanders.\n  Not just Marylanders but civil rights leaders and activists from all \nover this country fought hard for the right to vote. Over 600 people \nmarched from Selma to Montgomery. They were stopped and beaten but not \ndefeated. These brave men and women continued to march, continued to \nfight until they got the right to vote. They had to challenge the \nestablishment and to say ``now'' when others told them to ``wait''.\n  Their fight and their struggle culminated in the passage of the \nVoting Rights Act. This legislation guaranteed one of our most \nimportant civil rights and reflected one of our most fundamental \nvalues: that all men and women have the right to vote.\n  The struggle to truly fulfill this fundamental value--this \nfundamental right--is far from over. There are too many neighborhoods \nin this country, particularly in minority communities, that are the \ntarget of voter intimidation, barriers to access, and ever-changing \nrequirements.\n  The Supreme Court's decision in Shelby County v. Holder only made \nthis problem worse by stripping the Federal Government of its ability \nto protect voters from this kind of disenfranchisement--whether it was \nthe old-fashioned kind or the new-fashioned kind.\n  The fight for equal access to the ballot continues today, and like \nthose who came before us, we cannot take ``no'' for an answer. We must \nensure that any and all undue barriers to participation in our \ndemocracy are broken down. We must restore the protections of the \nVoting Rights Act that were struck down by the Supreme Court so that \nthe promise of the right to vote is extended to all men and women.\n  So while we look back proudly on the passage of the Voting Rights \nAct, we must recognize that the need for its protections is as great \ntoday as it was 50 years ago. The words of Justice Thurgood Marshall \nstill ring true:\n  ``I wish I could say that racism and prejudice were only distant \nmemories. We must dissent from the indifference. We must dissent from \nthe apathy. We must dissent from the fear, the hatred and the mistrust. \n. . . We must dissent because America can do better, because America \nhas no choice but to do better.''\n  Today marks an important milestone in our history. As we come \ntogether to celebrate this anniversary, we must come together to defend \nthe rights that this legislation was enacted to protect because if \ndiscrimination of any kind exists anywhere in America, we can and we \nmust do better.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/05/senate-section/article/S6371-1", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING RICHARD SCHWEIKER\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President. I rise today to remember Richard Schweiker, \nwho passed away on July 31, 2015. Congressman, Senator, and Secretary \nof the Department of Health and Human Services Dick Schweiker honorably \nserved his country in public office for more than two decades. Prior to \nhis years of government service, he served his country in the Navy \nduring World War II.\n  As a Congressman from Pennsylvania's 13th District, he was the \ncoauthor of a House Armed Services Committee proposal to end the \nmilitary draft and make service voluntary and sponsored legislation to \nallow the government to give extra money to military service personnel \nif they showed they could reduce expenses. He also supported the Civil \nRights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 along with \nlegislation that created the Medicare and Medicaid Programs.\n  As a Senator, he served on the Labor and Human Resources Committee, \neventually becoming its ranking member. This committee is now known as \nthe Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee on which I serve. \nSenator Schweiker was a strong supporter of public health initiatives, \nincluding the National Diabetes Mellitus Research and Education Act \nthat authorized the National Commission on Diabetes to put together a \nplan to fight this disease. Dick Schweiker also worked to achieve \ncompromise. In a 2000 Associated Press interview, he commented on that \napproach:\n\n       I was a World War II veteran. Our primary objective was to \n     get things done and solve problems. The partisanship and \n     heated rhetoric that have taken over the political landscape \n     wasn't always in vogue.\n\n  Dick Schweiker decided not to run for reelection in 1980 and worked \nto help elect Ronald Reagan that November. After the election, \nPresident Reagan appointed Schweiker as the Secretary of the Department \nof Health and Human Services. While in that position, he set up the \nMedicare prospective payment system in an effort to reduce costs rather \nthan leaving them open-ended. He also continued to support funding for \nmedical research and protected funding for the Head Start early \nchildhood education program. He stepped down as Secretary in 1983. At \nthat time, Senator Ted Kennedy said the following:\n\n       Dick Schweiker has been a good friend and colleague for \n     many years. As secretary of HHS, he has too often been a \n     lonely voice of compassion and humanity.\n\n  After leaving public service, Dick Schweiker spent 11 years as \npresident of the American Council of Life Insurance before retiring. \nToday, we remember and thank Dick Schweiker for his service to \nPennsylvania and the Nation. We send our thoughts and prayers to his \nfamily.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/05/senate-section/article/S6371-2", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6371-S6372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      RECOGNIZING THE 70TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE END OF WORLD WAR II\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, on August 14, 1945, World War II came to \nan end. The official ceremony aboard the battleship USS Missouri 2 \nweeks later was brief, barely 18 minutes long. The low-key nature of \nthe event stood in stark contrast to the unprecedented horror and \nviolence of the preceding years, years in which the fate of \ncivilization itself hung in the balance. I rise today to express our \nNation's gratitude to all veterans of the Army, Navy, Air Force, \nMarines, Coast Guard, and Merchant Marine for their service and \nsacrifice seven decades ago.\n  It is said that crisis builds character. For an entire generation of \nAmericans, crisis did not build character; it revealed it. With the \nperfect hindsight history books provide, the Second World War can seem \ntoday to be a series of events that followed an inevitable course from \nPearl Harbor to Normandy to Iwo Jima to the deck of the Battleship \nMissouri. Yet those who were there, those who made that history, know \nthat the outcome was far from certain. All that stood between humanity \nand the abyss of tyranny was their courage, their faith, and their \ndevotion to duty.\n  As the war began, the United States was not a rich or powerful \ncountry. We had only the 17th largest army in the world. Our industries \nwere still struggling to overcome a decade of economic depression. With \ntwo great oceans as a buffer, many Americans thought the answer to \naggression was isolationism.\n  Yet when the crisis came, Americans responded. More than 16 million \nAmerican men put on the uniforms of our Armed Forces. More than 400,000 \ndied wearing those uniforms. Thousands of American women also put on \nthe uniform, serving--and dying--in field hospitals and in such \ndangerous work as ferrying aircraft from production plant to airfield. \nThey rolled up their sleeves and turned the factories of a peacetime \neconomy into the arsenal of democracy. Throughout the country, \nAmericans of all ages worked and saved and rationed and sacrificed as \nnever before. Families planted victory gardens--20 million of them, \nproducing 40 percent of the Nation's vegetables in backyards and on \nrooftops. Two out of every three citizens put money into war bonds.\n  The people of Maine were part of this great endeavor. Some 80,000 \nMainers served in World War II, more than any previous war. More than \n2,500 laid their lives upon the altar of freedom.\n  I have had the honor of meeting many of Maine's heroes. Edward \nDahlgren of Perham--just a few miles from my hometown of Caribou--\nfought his\n\n[[Page S6372]]\n\nway through Italy, France, and Germany, and received the Medal of Honor \nfor his astonishing rescue of a trapped American platoon. Charles Shay, \na member of the Penobscot Nation, was among the first wave ashore at \nOmaha Beach and the first Native American to be awarded the Legion of \nHonor Medal, France's highest tribute. Bert Skinner of Belfast answered \nthe call for volunteers for the extremely dangerous mission of serving \nbehind enemy lines with Merrill's Marauders in Burma. Through his \nuncommon service to his community and to his fellow veterans, Galen \nCole of Bangor has kept the promise he made to himself on a battlefield \nin Germany in early 1945.\n  Maine women served with distinction. Patricia Chadwick Ericson of \nHoulton stepped forward to serve as a Women's Airforce Service Pilot, \nor WASP, flying newly built aircraft from the factories to combat \nzones. Mary Therese Nelson of Indian Island was the first Native \nAmerican woman from Maine to enlist in the Marine Corps. Each of the \nstories of the men and women from Maine are unique. Yet they are united \nby valor and devotion to duty.\n  On the homefront, Maine was on the frontlines. Eighty-two destroyers \nwere built at Bath Iron Works during the war, more than the entire \nJapanese output. The South Portland shipyard launched 274 Liberty ships \nthat carried troops and arms overseas. More than 70 submarines were \nbuilt at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, with 3 of those \nvital warships launched on the same day.\n  Maine's seafaring heritage contributed greatly to the Merchant \nMarine, and at least 60 Mainers lost their lives to enemy attack. The \nCoast Guard and the Civil Air Patrol protected our shores against Nazi \nU-boats and saboteurs.\n  These men and women did not come from a society steeped in militarism \nand the lust for conquest. Whether they came from our cities, farms or \nfishing villages of Maine, they came from places that desired peace and \nthat cherished freedom. When the crisis came, the American character \nbound the ``greatest generation'' together in a great common cause on \nbehalf of humanity.\n  I am fortunate to be a daughter of that generation. One of my \nearliest childhood memories is going with my father to the Memorial Day \nparade in our hometown. He hoisted me high above his head and from the \nbest vantage point along the route--my father's shoulders--I saw hats \ngo off and hands go over hearts as Caribou paid its respects to our \nflag and honored our veterans. Some Memorial Days, my father would wear \nhis Army jacket to the parade. As a child, I thought it was just an old \njacket. Only as an adult did I learn the price he had paid for it.\n  Donald Collins enlisted in the Reserve Corps as a college freshman in \nNovember of 1943 and was called to Active Duty in the U.S. Army before \nthe year's end. He saw action in the European theater and fought at the \nBattle of the Bulge. He earned the Combat Infantry Badge, two Purple \nHearts, and the Bronze Star. Sergeant Collins was discharged in January \nof 1946.\n  Then he did what truly distinguishes the men and women of America's \nArmed Forces. He came home, gratefully and modestly. He never talked \nmuch about his sacrifice and the hardships of war. Instead, he worked \nhard raising six children, running a business, serving as Scout leader, \nRotarian, mayor, and State senator.\n  From the strong shoulders of those like him who defended our freedom, \nall Americans learn about commitment, service, and patriotism. We learn \nthat the burden of service must be borne willingly. We learn that \nchallenges must be met and threats must be confronted. We learn that \nthe mantle of hero must be worn with humility. It is because of the \nquiet courage of those who serve our country that we take those lessons \nto heart and resolve to pass them on to the generations to come. On \nthis 70th anniversary of victory in World War II, let us recommit \nourselves to the spirit that guided our Nation through its darkest days \nand that lights our way into the future.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, this month, 70 years ago, the greatest \ncrisis of the 20th century came to an end. Lasting 6 full years and \ninvolving participants from over 30 countries, World War II was the \nmost widespread and devastating war in human history. America's \nisolation from this dreadful conflict abruptly ended when, on the \nmorning of December 7, 1941, our Nation came under sudden and \ndeliberate attack. In less than 2 hours, thousands of lives were lost \nas bombs fell across the island of Oahu and that quiet Sunday morning \nquickly turned into a terrible scene of violence and horror.\n  But the attacks on Pearl Harbor did not break the American spirit. In \nthis darkest of moments, our country discovered a renewed sense of \nstrength, courage and resiliency; qualities that define us. And, \nfollowing the attack on Pearl Harbor, American forces joined the Allied \nPowers, fighting side-by-side against Nazi oppression in Europe and \nJapanese expansion in the Pacific. Sixteen million Americans bravely \nserved in these two theaters of conflict, and it was through their \npatriotism and courage that freedom was able to triumph over tyranny.\n  I also want to recognize Maine's important role in the war effort. In \nnorthern Maine, Army airfields in Bangor, Presque Isle, and Houlton \nprovided strategic air basing and training sites which facilitated the \ndeployment of personnel and equipment overseas to the frontlines. And \nalong the coast, where the Kennebec River meets the sea, Bath Iron \nWorks established its reputation for producing the ``best-built'' \ndestroyers in the world. The shipyard delivered a total of 83 new ships \nto the U.S. Navy--hitting a 2-year peak production of 21 ships a year \nor an average of 1 destroyer every 17 days. Bath-built ships survived \nthe attack on Pearl Harbor, landed troops at Normandy, supported \nMarines at Iwo Jima, and sank Nazi U-boats in the Atlantic. Maine's \nsupport to our Armed Forces during the war years was unparalleled in \nterms of dedication, scope, and impact.\n  And, above all else, we must honor the immeasurable contributions of \nour servicemembers. As a State with one of the highest percentages of \nveterans per capita in the Nation, the war's legacy resonates strongly \nin Maine. During World War II, nearly 80,000 Maine citizens served \noverseas. Their steadfast perseverance, patriotism, and bravery in the \nface of grave danger helped secure a better future for generations to \ncome.\n  On this 70th anniversary of World War II, we remember all the \nAmerican and Allied servicemembers who bravely served on land, air, and \nsea; as well as those on the homefront providing for our warfighters. \nTheir service and sacrifices contributed to international peace and \nstability and ensured the continued promise of the freedoms we enjoy \ntoday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/05/senate-section/article/S6372-1", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6372-S6373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO ADA DEER\n\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, today I recognize and honor Ada Deer on \nthe occasion of her 80th birthday. Throughout her life, Ada has been an \neffective advocate and leader whose trailblazing work has improved the \nlives of Native Americans, women, students and others in Wisconsin and \nacross the Nation. The celebration of this milestone birthday is a \nspecial opportunity to celebrate her dedication to service and social \nengagement.\n  Ada Deer was born on the Menominee Indian Reservation in Keshena, WI. \nShe was the first Menominee to graduate from the University of \nWisconsin-Madison and the first Native American to receive a masters of \nsocial work from Columbia University.\n  She has been a champion for Indian rights throughout her remarkable \ncareer. When the Federal Government established a policy to terminate \nthe sovereign status of tribes, the Menominee was among the first to go \nthrough the process of termination, and they suffered greatly under it. \nAda organized a grassroots organization, Determination of Right and \nUnity for Menominee Shareholders, DRUMS, and fought successfully to \nrestore Federal recognition of the Menominee tribe. Ada's leadership \nled to her election as the first woman to chair the Menominee tribe in \nWisconsin.\n  She spent many years as a lecturer in the School of Social Work at \nthe University of Wisconsin-Madison, and also guided the university's \nAmerican Indian Studies Department. Ada worked as a house director, \ncommunity coordinator, school social worker, and professor.\n\n[[Page S6373]]\n\n  In 1978, she became the first Native American to run for secretary of \nState in Wisconsin, and in 1992 she was the first Native American woman \nto run for Congress in Wisconsin. In 1993, Ada became the first Native \nAmerican woman to head the Bureau of Indian Affairs. She subsequently \nserved as Chair of the National Indian Gaming Commission.\n  I am proud to call Ada a friend, and I am grateful for her lifelong \nleadership and commitment to social justice. Her vital work continues \ntoday, focused on efforts to reduce the prison recidivism rate and \ncreate a reentry program for American Indians. Her lifetime of work, \ncoupled with an enduring passion to instill in young people the drive \nto change their society through education and social engagement, shows \nwhat a determined person will continue to do--even when they have \nstated that they are ``retired.''\n  I wish Ada good health and happiness for many years to come.\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/05/senate-section/article/S6373-1", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO BRYCE LUCHTERHAND\n\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, today I honor Bryce Luchterhand on his \nretirement from Federal and public service. He has dedicated his career \nto improving the quality of life and the vitality of communities \nthroughout the State of Wisconsin. The occasion of his retirement \npresents a special opportunity to celebrate his dedication to public \nservice and social justice.\n  Bryce was born in Colby, WI, and raised on the Luchterhand family \nfarm--a fixture in the local rural community since 1902. He graduated \nfrom Colby High School and earned his bachelor's degree in secondary \neducation broadfield social studies from Northland College in Ashland, \nWI. Growing up on a Wisconsin farm, Bryce was instilled with the values \nof hard work, love of the land, Central Wisconsin optimism, and a sense \nfor social justice that would serve him well throughout his career and \nlife.\n  In 1970 he started his lifelong path in public service as teacher of \nsocial studies on the Navajo Indian Reservation at Many Farms High \nSchool in Many Farms, AZ, where he inspired and mentored the youth of \nthe Navajo reservation. Working with the impoverished youth of the \nNavajo reservation sparked within Bryce his passion for equal \nopportunity, creating bonds and lifelong friendships that became a \nfoundation for his life of service.\n  Throughout his public service career, Bryce has been guided by his \nlove of the land. In 1973, Bryce took an opportunity to return to \nColby, WI, to buy a dairy farm next to the Luchterhand family farm. And \nwith the same drive and determination that have become his trademark, \nhe and his wife, Max, milked dairy cows and raised beef cows for the \npast 42 years, even developing a new breed of cow called a Gloucester \nLineback. As a farmer, Bryce greets every season with the same grit and \nresolve he learned as a child in rural Wisconsin. However, the time of \nyear he holds most dear is the maple syrup season each spring. Bryce \nand Max spend many early mornings and late nights tending to the taps, \nboiling down the sap, and bottling one of Wisconsin's treasures--\nWisconsin maple syrup. Each bottle of Luchterhand maple syrup is a \nlabor of love, and I have been honored to be among the select \nindividuals to receive this special gift.\n  Bryce's years of public service are comprised of distinguished \nservice on various boards, committees, and associations, often in roles \nas chairman or advisor. He is most proud of his roles as instructor for \nthe Presidential Classroom in Washington, DC, executive council member \nof Wisconsin Rural Partners, member of the Board of Directors for \nWisconsin Farm Progress/Technology Days, as well as a founding and \ncurrent member of 1000 Friends of Wisconsin, an organization dedicated \nto giving citizens a voice in land use planning.\n  Bryce's career in public service has also included serving the \nPresident of the United States, the Governor of Wisconsin and two U.S. \nSenators. He served as President Clinton's Director of Rural \nDevelopment for the State of Wisconsin for 8 years, helping to make \ncritical economic and agricultural development investments in rural \nWisconsin. He served as the director of Wisconsin Governor Jim Doyle's \nnorthern office, serving residents of 40 counties for 8 years, and as \nSenator Herb Kohl's area representative for 2 years in 14 counties. As \nmy Deputy State Director of Outreach for the past 2 years, it was not \nuncommon for Bryce to travel in excess of 1,000 miles a week \nrepresenting me at meetings and events in northern Wisconsin. Of \ncourse, these trips were made easier if you knew the ``Luchterhand \nshortcuts'' that often took Bryce snaking along the back county roads \nof northern Wisconsin, inevitably getting him to his destination \nquicker. In all of these capacities, Bryce served the people of \nWisconsin with distinction and honor.\n  I am proud to call Bryce a friend and I am grateful that in choosing \nthe path of public service, he has impacted countless people's lives, \nchanged communities for the better, and strengthened rural communities \nof Wisconsin. In retirement, I wish Bryce and his wife Max all the \nbest, including good health and happiness, for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/05/senate-section/article/S6373-2", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO MARTY BEIL\n\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, today I recognize and honor Marty Beil of \nMadison, WI, for his 30 years of leadership as executive director of \nAFSCME Council 24. I have known Marty for many years, and have been \nproud to stand in solidarity with him. Marty has been a leader in the \nlabor community, and his passion for the rights of working persons will \nbe missed by all who have worked alongside him and who have benefited \nfrom his strong leadership.\n  Marty began his professional life in service to his union as a member \nof the WSEU Professional Services Bargaining team in 1973. He continued \nhis service as a member, leader and activist in Council 24 until 1985, \nwhen he was appointed executive director. Throughout that time, Marty \nhas been passionate in his advocacy for the rights of working people, \nto the honor and value of public service, and to insuring that working \npeople have a level playing field on which to compete. Marty has \ndedicated his career to protecting and serving his members in the \ncollective bargaining and political process, always with a sense of \nfairness and compassion.\n  Marty's work is exemplified by his long-term efforts in support of \nAmerican workers, the American labor movement, and those fighting for \ncivil rights for all Americans. Among many other important priorities, \nhe supported the expansion of antidiscrimination laws to protect the \nLGBT community, and defended workers from discrimination and \nretaliation for political activities. He was a staunch defender of \nlabor's right to back candidates who made a commitment to support the \ngoals and activities of union members regardless of partisan \naffiliation. His 30 years of service at the helm of Council 24 has \ninspired a new generation of workers to lead the union into the 21st \ncentury\n  I am proud to call Marty a friend, and I am grateful for his \nimportant contributions to our State and the labor community. I know \nthat his passion and dedication, in the model of his forebears such as \nRoy Kubista and John Lawton will serve as a lasting example for \ngenerations of future labor leaders. I wish him all the best in his \nfuture endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/05/senate-section/article/S6373-3", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6373-S6374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             RECOGNIZING THE NEW JERSEY-INDIA RELATIONSHIP\n\n Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I am honored to serve a State with \none of the largest Indian American diasporas in the country.\n  The Indian diaspora community in New Jersey is an active, vocal and \nengaged constituency whose contributions to the State reach across all \nsectors. When given the opportunity, the very first caucus I joined in \nthe Senate was the U.S.-India caucus. Soon after I joined the caucus, I \nhad the opportunity to meet Prime Minister Modi during his visit to the \nUnited States. His visit signaled a meaningful moment in the relations \nbetween the United States and India. It became clearer that the oldest \nand newest democracies can forge a transformational relationship to \nleverage the historic opportunities before us.\n\n[[Page S6374]]\n\n  Together, the United States and India represent over one-fifth of the \nworld's population and share long-term strategic imperatives in the \nareas of energy efficiency and environmental sustainability, social and \neconomic development, and regional and global security that are rooted \nin our shared commitment to democratic ideals. President Obama has \naptly referred to this relationship as the ``defining partnership of \nthe 21st century.'' As the United States pursues greater clean energy \nproduction and sustainable manufacturing here at home, we can and \nshould take advantage of opportunities to further collaborate on \ntechnologically advanced clean energy solutions.\n  Together, we can leverage both American and Indian assets to address \nthe challenges both our countries face in job creation, social \nmobility, and clean energy. Prime Minister Modi has also emphasized the \nimportance of sustainable growth and ensuring that diversified, \nenvironmentally conscious energy sources are made accessible to all \nIndians. I am encouraged by Prime Minister Modi's commitment to \neconomic and social policies that not only invest in infrastructure but \nthat also develop India's human capacity. With half of its population \nunder the age of 25 and a recent election that saw a 66-percent voter \nturnout, it is clear that India is set to harness the potential of its \nmost valuable resource--its young people.\n  In order to compete in a global economy, the United States and India \nmust both expand opportunities for youth education and employment. By \nengaging private sector actors in our mutual development goals, I \nbelieve together we can address these challenges and turn them into \nopportunities for cooperation.\n  As this partnership continues to grow, so will the benefits for both \nof our countries and for New Jersey. The Indian American population in \nNew Jersey has grown by 73 percent in the past decade, and many Indian \nAmericans serve our state as industry and community leaders. New Jersey \nis the No. 1 benefactor of Indian investment in job creation, with \napproximately 9,278 jobs and over $1 billion in investment in a variety \nof sectors from telecom and technology to healthcare and manufacturing.\n  As the Senate adjourns for the summer recess, I do not want to miss \nthe opportunity to highlight India Day, which will be observed next \nweek. India Day celebrates the rich history and legacy of India's \ncontributions to communities across the United States.\n  On August 10, I will have the distinct honor and privilege to welcome \nAmbassador Singh to New Jersey. I look forward to working with \nAmbassador Singh as we partner together to foster investment \nopportunities, create collaborations between our world-renowned higher \neducation institutions, and cultivate platforms to facilitate \nvolunteerism and giving. I look forward to fostering the continued \ngrowth of the strong relationship between New Jersey and India.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/05/senate-section/article/S6374-1", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING SARAH ANDERSON\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I ask \nmy colleagues to join me in honoring the extraordinary life of Sarah \nAnderson, a beloved mother, wife, daughter, sister, friend, colleague, \nand passionate advocate for improving the health and lives of people \nthroughout our country. Sarah passed away on July 28, 2015, at the age \nof 49.\n  I met Sarah when she came to work on my first campaign for the U.S. \nSenate. At the time, this impressive young Fort Collins, CO native was \njust a few years into her political career, having moved to Washington, \nDC, to work for Senator Tim Wirth right after graduating from the \nUniversity of Colorado.\n  Sarah was passionate about helping to elect women, and she wanted to \nbe part of what turned out to be an historic 1992 election. With her \nwit, intelligence, talent, dedication, sense of humor, and ever-present \ntwinkle in her piercing blue eyes, it was immediately clear to all of \nus that Sarah was special.\n  However, one young campaign staff member named Matt Kagan seemed to \nnotice all of Sarah's unique gifts even more than anyone else. While \nworking 20-hour days on our campaign, Sarah and Matt somehow managed to \nfind time to fall in love. At the time, I would sometimes joke that \nwhile I was falling in the polls, they were falling in love. But the \ntruth is, Matt and Sarah's beautiful marriage and son were among the \nmost important results of that first campaign. Sarah and Matt always \nshared a fierce commitment to making the world a better place.\n  For more than 25 years, Sarah worked tirelessly for the causes she \nbelieved in--whether it was protecting the environment at the Sierra \nClub and the League of Conservation Voters; serving the people of \nOregon and California as press secretary to Congresswoman Elizabeth \nFurse and Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez; or helping to prevent and stop \npandemics as an Assistant Dean at UCLA's School of Public Health for \nnearly a decade.\n  Sarah and Matt always managed to fill their homes--first in DC and \nthen in California--with love, laughter, good conversation, and great \nfood. But their most important addition happened 10 years ago when they \njoyfully welcomed their son, Spencer, into their lives. Whenever \nSpencer's name was mentioned, Sarah's face always lit up with such \npride and love, and there are no words to express how sorry I am for \nSpencer and Matt's loss. I also want to extend my deepest condolences \nto Sarah's entire family, especially her mother and stepfather, Sue and \nEd Sparling; her sister, Jennifer Enright; and stepbrothers, Erik and \nBret Sparling.\n  Sarah, Matt, and Spencer will always be part of our extended family \nof Boxer staff members, all of whom join me today in mourning Sarah's \nloss and celebrating her amazing legacy, which will always live on in \nthe causes she championed, the friendships she forged, and the family \nshe loved and lived for.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/05/senate-section/article/S6374-2", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6374-S6375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING VICE ADMIRAL THOMAS R. WESCHLER\n\n Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the service of a \nfellow Pennsylvanian, VADM Thomas R. Weschler, Retired, who served this \ncountry valiantly for 3\\1/2\\ decades. Vice Admiral Weschler is one of \nthe highest ranking Naval officers to come from Erie, PA, and I am \nprofoundly grateful for his service to our Nation.\n  Admiral Weschler began his service in 1940, following his graduation \nfrom the United States Naval Academy in 1939. He served on the USS \nWASP, CV-7, in World War II, seeing combat in both the Mediterranean \nand the Pacific, including the invasion of Guadalcanal, and was onboard \nwhen the WASP was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine.\n  Admiral Weschler would then go on to command the USS CLARENCE K. \nBRONSON in action during the Korean war. During the Vietnam war, he \ncommanded amphibious operations against Viet Cong forces in 1965 to \n1966, during which time he was awarded the Legion of Merit. In 1966, \nAdmiral Weschler became Commander Naval Support Activity, Danang \nRepublic of Vietnam, and was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal. \nFollowing his service in Vietnam, he was awarded a Gold Star for his \naccomplishments in pioneering and developing the Spruance Class \ndestroyer and the Virginia Class cruiser.\n  In 1970, Vice Admiral Weschler assumed command of Cruiser-Destroyer \nFlotilla TWO, and in 1971 he became Commander Cruiser-Destroyer Force, \nU.S. Atlantic Fleet. For both of these tours he was awarded a Gold \nStar. In 1973, he was selected for promotion to vice admiral and \nreported to Washington for duty as Director for Logistics, Joint Staff, \nOffice of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Vice Admiral Weschler retired on \nJune 30, 1975 as a three-star vice admiral following more than 34 years \nof service in the U.S. Navy.\n  After his retirement from the Navy, he continued his service as a \nprofessor of Naval Operations at the United States War College, \nNewport, RI, for more than a decade.\n  On August 28 and 29, 2015, Vice Admiral Weschler will be honored for \nhis service at the opening of the Hagen History Center in Erie, PA, \nwhere the Military Gallery will also be dedicated in his honor. I am \nproud to share in the celebration of Vice Admiral Weschler's\n\n[[Page S6375]]\n\ncareer, his meritorious conduct, his extraordinary leadership, and his \ndistinguished and unwavering service to this great Nation. I extend my \nsincerest gratitude to Vice Admiral Weschler, a native son of Erie, PA, \nwhom we are proud to call one of our own, and wish him and his family \nall the best in their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/05/senate-section/article/S6375-1", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HURRICANE KATRINA\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, 10 years ago, Hurricane Katrina \ncame ashore on the Mississippi gulf coast with devastating force, \ninflicting billions of dollars in property and personal damages. It was \namazing that more were not killed.\n  The tragic loss of life and horrible property destruction shocked us \nall. Our recovery has required enormous dedication and determination, \nand thousands of Mississippians rose to that challenge.\n  In the days, months, and years after the storm, Mississippians \npitched in to help neighbors and strangers alike. The dedication and \nsacrifice of the Coast Guard, the National Guard and other first \nresponders saved lives and helped enable the large-scale rebuilding \nthat would follow. The resilience and hard work of the people, as well \nas the outpouring of church and volunteer workers from across the State \nand Nation, made recovery possible.\n  Over the past decade, State, local, and Federal elected officials \nhave also aggressively promoted and assisted in the gulf coast's \nrecovery. But our recovery is not yet complete.\n  While the serious problems exposed by the Katrina recovery effort \nhave been used to improve our national response to emergencies and \nnatural disasters, work remains to be done to ensure a full recovery in \nMississippi and along the gulf coast. Unsustainable insurance practices \nand overbearing Federal regulations continue to hamper recovery and \neconomic development efforts.\n  Those challenges, however, cannot diminish the pride I have in the \npeople of Mississippi for exemplifying the strength, vision, and \nresilience necessary to ensure the cultural and economic vitality of \nour State.\n  This August, we commemorate the decade since Hurricane Katrina \nclaimed lives and left indelible marks on our State. Mr. President, 10 \nyears after Katrina, I remain confident that we will continue to work \ntogether to rebuild Mississippi and to advocate for commonsense \npolicies and intelligent investments that will ensure the continued \nvitality of the Gulf Coast.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/05/senate-section/article/S6375-2", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM P.

This group of \nyoung men and women made our State proud at their national conference, \nand brought home a combined 31 gold medals, 26 silver medals, and 3 \nbronze medals.\n  Some of the standouts in the Montana FCCLA that I would like to \nrecognize are Garrett Christiaens of Valier, MT, who was just made the \nnew national vice president of programs, and Mariah Pierce, Katlyn \nGillen, and Loren Minnick--three Park High School students who not only \ntook first place at the FCCLA State competition, but also went on to \nwin gold medals at the national level.\n  The Montana FCCLA has approximately 70 chapters across the State, and \nis part of the Family and Consumer Sciences curriculum offered in over \n100 of Montana's high schools.

I \nask my colleagues to join me in marking August 26, known as Women's \nEquality Day, a significant landmark in American history as we \nacknowledge, honor, and celebrate the vast and vital contributions that \nwomen have made to our country.\n  Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott, and other dedicated supporters \nfor women's equality convened the First Women's Rights Convention on \nJuly 1848 in Seneca Falls, NY. They advocated for the right to own \nproperty, protection from domestic violence, and other social reforms \nthat promoted equality, including voting, and never wavered in that \npursuit. Stanton wrote a Declaration of Sentiments that called for \n``all men and women'' to be recognized as created equal under the law, \nthus beginning the 72-year struggle for suffrage that ended in 1920.\n  Mr. President, 2015 is the bicentennial year for Elizabeth Cady \nStanton, who was born November 12, 1815, in Johnstown, NY. Celebrations \nof her extraordinary life are taking place throughout the year. Stanton \nmet Susan B. Anthony in 1851, and they began a 50-year partnership \nadvocating for suffrage and women's equality; however, both women did \nnot live to see the passage of the 19th Amendment. As the mother of \nseven children, Mrs. Stanton can be proud of the legacy she left to her \ndescendants, one of whom is today spearheading a committee tasked with \nplacing a new statue of these two amazing leaders in New York. They \ngave a voice to millions of women and changed history forever following \nAnthony's vow that ``failure is impossible.''\n  A unique crossroad of history resides at 77th and Central Park West \nin New York City with statues of two U.S. Presidents, Theodore \nRoosevelt astride a horse outside the American Museum of Natural \nHistory and Abraham Lincoln who stands on the steps of the New-York \nHistorical Society. Near Lincoln is a statue of abolitionist Frederick \nDouglass symbolically carrying books at a building that safeguards \nhistory. I am pleased to announce that permission was granted in May \n2015 for a suffragist statue to be installed at the West 77th Street \nentrance to Central Park. It will be the very first statue of a woman \nin this park's 160-year history.\n  New York City park commissioner Mitchell J. Silver awarded this site \nfor a statue of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, pioneering \nleaders of the women's suffrage movement. Included in the sculpture \ndesign are the names of many remarkable women instrumental in the fight \ntoward winning the vote. Its installation in September 2017 will \ncoincide with New York State's centennial of women's voting rights. The \nNew-York Historical Society announced that in the transformation of its \nfourth floor there\n\n[[Page S6376]]\n\nwould be a new Center for the Study of Women's History that will \npresent special exhibitions, as well as public and scholarly programs.\n  Over 50 million visitors each year are welcomed to New York City, \nwith over half reporting they spend time in Central Park. Placing the \nStanton and Anthony statue at this highly visible locale that resonates \nsocial justice will undoubtedly draw local residents and visitors of \nall nations to history lessons that include the story of the equal \nrights and suffrage movements in America.\n  I ask that we give tribute on August 26, 2015, the 95th anniversary \nof the passage of the 19th Amendment, to the early suffragists who were \nsteadfast in their pursuit of equality for all citizens, which is a \nsacred trust that we must continue to support today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/05/senate-section/article/S6376-1", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CONGRATULATING RAY HAGAR\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today, I wish to congratulate Ray \nHagar on his retirement after decades of bringing Northern Nevada \nextraordinary news coverage. It gives me great pleasure to recognize \nRay's hard work and unwavering dedication to the local community and \nfor showcasing journalistic integrity and excellence to the Silver \nState.\n  Ray is truly a role model to many in the local community, embodying \nthe battle-born spirit of genuine loyalty, determination, and \nresilience. He is a fifth-generation Nevadan, bringing unique insight \nto an array of topics, especially in his political coverage. Ray has \nspent time at several news outlets, including the Reno Evening Gazette \nand the Nevada State Journal, and most recently served as a member of \nthe political team with the Reno Gazette Journal and as a regular host \non Nevada's most-watched political talk show, Nevada Newsmakers. His 15 \nyears of political coverage with the Reno Gazette Journal brought \nNevadans only the most accurate journalism. He is also the co-author of \nJohnson-Jeffries: Dateline Reno, a novel about the 1910 fight between \nJack Johnson and Jim Jeffries and its effects on Nevada. His lengthy \nand extensive career touched the lives of many across the State, \nkeeping residents up-to-date and knowledgeable on key topics.\n  Ray always made sure to place himself in the middle of the action to \ngain a full understanding of what he was reporting on. Even as a young \nboy growing up, he was eager to be fully engrossed in his surroundings. \nOne story that Ray references as a good learning experience was during \nhis football career with Bishop Manogue High School. It was 1969 and \nthe Bishop Manogue High School Miners, coached by Christ Ault, were \nplaying against Carson High School, my alma mater. The Miners were \nbehind but were inside the 5-yard line with enough time to clench a \nfinal victory. At the time, Ray was playing offensive guard and was \npunched in the face by an opposing player. Ray retaliated, ultimately \nreceiving a penalty that caused the Miners to lose the game and was \nkicked off the football team. Later that night, he turned up at Coach \nAult's home, asking for a second chance and continued on in the season. \nThough I am sure this was devastating at the time, it shows Ray's sense \nof commitment and humility.\n  Throughout his career, Ray was a true journalist, gaining insight \nfrom all sides to convey a thorough picture to his audience. If \nanything important was going on, you could always count on Ray to have \nan accurate story ready to share. I will never forget some of the \nstories that Ray reported on, especially his interaction with former \nNew York Yankee manager, Billy Martin. If that doesn't illustrate a \nsincere effort to get the real story, then I don't know what does. I \nhad the pleasure of working with Ray using an open-door policy and \nappreciate the relationship we built throughout the years.\n  Ray left his footprint on Nevada journalism, a mark that will remain \nin the northern Nevada community for years to come. His legacy of \nthorough and fair coverage will never be forgotten. Surely, future \npolitical writers will have big shoes to fill after his incredible \ncareer.\n  Ray has demonstrated absolute dedication to excellent reporting, \nbringing Nevada politics outside of the walls of the legislature and \nCongress to audiences across the State. I am both humbled and honored \nby his hard work and am proud to call him a fellow Nevadan. Today, I \nask all of my colleagues to join me in congratulating an upstanding \nNevadan and friend, Ray Hagar, on his retirement. I give my deepest \nappreciation for all that he has done and offer him my best wishes for \nmany successful and fulfilling years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/05/senate-section/article/S6376-2", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RECOGNIZING DAVIDSON ACADEMY'S 10TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today, I wish to recognize the 10th \nanniversary of Davidson Academy, an institution with a noble mission to \nsupport northern Nevada's profoundly gifted students. I am proud to \nhonor this institution that has worked so hard to prepare Nevada's \nyouth for successful and positive futures.\n  Davidson Academy was established in 2005 through State legislation, \ndesignating the institution as a university school for gifted students. \nThe academy officially opened in fall of 2006 and is a free public \nschool located on the University of Nevada, Reno, UNR, campus. Students \nat both the middle school and high school levels attend the academy. \nIndividual students develop a Personalized Learning Plan, which guides \nthem through their academic and personal goals and prepares them for \ntheir futures. Students are also able to participate in UNR courses as \npart of a dual enrollment agreement. The academy works to challenge its \nstudents and gives them a great opportunity to develop their knowledge \nand skills in an advanced environment.\n  As a father of four children who attended Nevada's public schools, \nand as the husband of a life-long teacher, I understand the important \nrole that different institutions play in enriching the lives of \nNevada's students. Ensuring that America's youth are prepared to \ncompete in the 21st century is critical for the future of our country. \nProfoundly gifted students are often underserved and unfortunately, do \nnot receive the curriculum they need to excel. The State of Nevada is \nfortunate to have institutions like Davidson Academy available to \nsupport students with unique needs.\n  I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in recognizing \nDavidson Academy on its 10th anniversary. This institution is truly \ndedicated to enriching the lives of Nevada's students, and I am honored \nto congratulate them on hitting an important milestone. I wish Davidson \nAcademy well in all of its future endeavors and in creating greater \nopportunity for Nevada's youth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/05/senate-section/article/S6376-3", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6376-S6377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MIKE MCCARTHY\n\n Mr. KING. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the hard \nwork and dedication of Michael McCarthy, the principal of King Middle \nSchool in Portland, ME, who has served for 27 years and is moving on to \na much deserved retirement. Mike has left a remarkable legacy and his \nhard work and dedication will continue to help Maine students for years \nto come.\n  About one-fifth of King Middle School's students speak a native \nlanguage other than English, 28 different languages in all, and \nstudents at the school come from 17 countries. More than half of the \nstudent body qualifies for free or subsidized lunch. Such factors can \noften contribute to poor academic performance, and for many years, \nparents did not view King Middle as a viable institution for their \nchildren. That view changed when Mike McCarthy took over 27 years ago.\n  Mike possesses the qualities required of a strong leader. He is \nintelligent, but understands he may not always have the right answers, \nmaking him a good listener. He is dedicated to his students and \nfaculty, and makes decisions that benefit the entire community. As a \nformer teacher, Mike understands the classroom atmosphere and devotes \nhis time to creating a positive learning environment. Perhaps most \nimportantly, Mike is willing to take risks.\n  Under Mike's leadership, King Middle School was one of the first \nschools in Maine to embrace 1:1 digital learning. This new approach \nhelped to put technology in the hands of his students and teachers, and \nhelped to open doors and unlock new potential in and out of the \nclassroom. Mike also had the courage to implement an innovative \napproach called the Expeditionary Learning model, through which groups \nof teachers and students work together on\n\n[[Page S6377]]\n\nhands-on projects that require them to have an understanding of many \ndifferent disciplines. He also has demonstrated the courage to do what \nhe thought was right, even when decisions were controversial. His \napproach earned him the respect of the teachers and the entire school \ncommunity, and it has helped turn King Middle School into a real \nsuccess story.\n  I cannot say enough good things about Mike and his impact on King \nMiddle School, the city of Portland, and Maine education as a whole. \nWhen I recently convened a panel of Maine educators to share their \nperception on reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, \nMike brought his strong voice to the table. His has always been an \ninvaluable perspective. Through his experience and input, educators \nacross Maine are better off as they work--just like Mike--to broaden \ntheir students' horizons and prepare them for success in a rapidly \nchanging world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/05/senate-section/article/S6377-1", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CELEBRATING THE ``YEAR OF DAWES''\n\n Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, today I recognize former Illinois \nresident and Vice President of the United States, Charles Gates Dawes, \nin honor of the 150th anniversary of his birth on August 27, 1865. \nCharles Dawes holds a special place in American history, devoting much \nof his life to public service, and today his memory lives on in \nEvanston, IL, the place where Dawes and his family called home for \nnearly 60 years.\n  Serving as Vice President of the United States from 1925 to 1929 \nunder President Calvin Coolidge, Dawes distinguished himself in the \nservice of his country on a national and international scale. Dawes \nserved as brigadier general in charge of the American Expeditionary \nForce Office of Supply during World War I, where he led the Allied \nSupply Board and subsequently received medals for distinguished service \nfrom each of the Allied countries. On December 10, 1926, Dawes was \nawarded the 1925 Nobel Peace Prize for his work on the ``Dawes Plan'' \nthat restructured German reparation repayments following World War I \nand temporarily helped to restore balance to Europe, easing tensions \nbetween Germany and France.\n  In addition to his work under the Coolidge administration, Dawes \nserved four other U.S. Presidents in various offices that included \nComptroller of the Currency, First Director of the Federal Bureau of \nthe Budget, and President of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. \nDawes also served as U.S. Ambassador to Great Britain, a position he \nheld until 1931. As Ambassador, Dawes successfully helped to negotiate \ntreaties in international law and arms limitations. As the American \ndelegate to the London Naval Conference in 1930, he specifically worked \nto broker an agreement between Japan, France, Italy, Great Britain, and \nthe United States to limit the number of Navy war vessels and regulate \nsubmarine warfare. Dawes was also a dedicated humanitarian, who \npersonally established and funded extensive networks of food and \nhousing for the homeless and less fortunate.\n  Charles Dawes is also remembered for his contributions and service to \nhis local community of Evanston, IL. Dawes owned an Evanston based \nutility business, and he and his extended family were a part of the \nfabric of the community, attending local schools and participating in \ncountless Evanston organizations. In 1942, he arranged to bequeath his \nhome to Northwestern University and the broader Evanston community for \nthe conservation of its cultural history. Today the Dawes home serves \nas the headquarters of the Evanston History Center, which will be \nhonoring the life of Charles Dawes and the 150th anniversary of his \nbirth through its ``Year of Dawes'' celebration. I commend the Evanston \nHistory Center for its dedication to educating the public on the \nremarkable life of Charles Dawes and preserving the Dawes family \nhistory for future generations.\n  I ask all my colleagues to join me in celebrating the ``Year of \nDawes'' and honoring the 150th birthday anniversary of Charles Gates \nDawes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/05/senate-section/article/S6377-2", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6377-S6378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JAN THOMPSON\n\n Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, today I commemorate my constituent \nfrom Carbondale, IL, Ms. Jan Thompson, for her extraordinary work on \nbehalf of American veterans. Ms. Thompson is a professor at Southern \nIllinois University and the founder and president of the American \nDefenders of Bataan and Corregidor--ADBC--Memorial Society. On Sunday, \nJuly 19, 2015, Ms. Thompson and ADBC had the historic responsibility of \nbeing offered the first Japanese corporate apology for forced labor by \nAmerican prisoners of war--POWS--during World War II.\n  Over 900 American civilian and military POWs were slave laborers in \nfour mines owned by Mitsubishi Mining Company Ltd. during World War II. \nMs. Thompson, whose organization represents surviving POWs, their \nfamilies, descendants, and researchers working on POW history, accepted \non their behalf an apology offered by Mitsubishi Mining's successor \ncompany, Mitsubishi Materials.\n  Thompson's father, Robert E. Thompson, was a Pharmacist's Mate aboard \nthe USS Canopus--AS-9--a submarine tender moored in Manila Bay at the \noutbreak of the war on December 8, 1941. The tender was the only heavy \nship left to service the submarines during the defense of the \nPhilippines. The crew scuttled her the night before Bataan was \nsurrendered on April 9, 1942 and escaped to fight on Corregidor Island.\n  Robert Thompson attended to the wounded during the final month of the \nsiege of Corregidor. Surrendering on May 6, 1942 in the face of great \nodds, he was assigned to the Bilibid Prison Hospital in Manila and \nsurvived the three ``Hell ships'' Oryoku Maru, Enoura Maru, and Brazil \nMaru.\n  On July 19th, Mr. Hikaru Kimura, a Senior Corporate Executive of \nMitsubishi Materials Corporation and Senior General Manager of Global \nBusiness Management at the Paint Finishing System Division of Taikisha \nLtd delivered the apology at a ceremony held at the Museum of Tolerance \nin Los Angeles.\n  I applaud Mitsubishi Materials' courage and good corporate \ncitizenship. I ask unanimous consent that the statement of Jan Thompson \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n statement of jan thompson, president, american defenders of bataan & \n                      corregidor memorial society\n\n                  delivered at the museum of tolerance\n\n        simon wiesenthal center--los angeles, ca, july 19, 2015\n\n       Thank you Rabbi [Abraham] Cooper for moderating today and \n     for having the Museum of Tolerance as the venue for today's \n     meeting.\n       I thank [Ms.] Kinue Tokodome, Mr. [Hikaru] Kimura, Mr. \n     [Yukio] Okamoto and the Mitsubishi Materials Corporation for \n     inviting me to be a witness to this extraordinary occasion.\n       I have known Kinue for many years as a dear friend and an \n     advocate for our former POWs. She has worked very hard over \n     the years to bring all of us together today for this \n     important event and she should be recognized for her \n     dedication and perseverance.\n       I had three roles in the room: one role as a daughter of a \n     former POW, Robert E. Thompson; another role as a filmmaker; \n     and as President of the American Defenders of Bataan & \n     Corregidor [ADBC] Memorial Society.\n       Being a witness today is meaningful to me.\n       Seventy years ago our countries were at war and we were \n     enemies. Terrible things happen during war. Our 16th \n     President, Abraham Lincoln stated ``We cannot escape \n     history,'' and perhaps Prime Minister [Shinzo] Abe was paying \n     homage by saying at his recent address to Congress: ``We \n     cannot avert our eyes . . .''\n       For some former POWs an apology is important and they are \n     grateful.\n       For others, the apology is 70 years too late. Unfortunately \n     for those who have passed away [they] were not able to hear \n     the moving words of Mr. Kimura.\n       The mission of the ADBC Memorial Society is education and \n     to preserve the legacy of those who had been POWs of Imperial \n     Japan. Our mission is to preserve their history accurately. \n     We see this apology today as an acknowledgment that their use \n     of forced labor for Mitsubishi Mining violated their human \n     rights and their dignity. This apology is important to \n     silence those who deny these facts.\n       It is obvious that this decision to apologize did not \n     happen overnight. It took people with the same mind, the same \n     goal, and the same courage to make this happen.\n       Mitsubishi Materials Corporation should be a role model for \n     other Japanese corporations: to come forward and apologize. \n     We hope the citizens of Japan will support today's action. \n     The employees of Mitsubishi\n\n[[Page S6378]]\n\n     Materials Corporation should be proud of their company.\n       We thank Mr. Kimura for his sincere apology and we hope \n     today starts a relationship between the ADBC Memorial Society \n     and Mitsubishi Materials Corporation to further our goal of \n     reconciliation and education for generations to come.\n       We see this apology as one very important step forward and \n     we cannot let what happened today die or be forgotten.\n\n\nstatement by mitsubishi materials corporation senior executive officer \nhikaru kimura in the meeting with a former american pow and families of \n                              former pows\n\n       Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, speaking on behalf of \n     Mitsubishi Materials, thank you very much for this \n     opportunity to meet with you today at the Museum of \n     Tolerance.\n       Mitsubishi Mining Company Limited, the predecessor of \n     Mitsubishi Materials, was engaged in coal and metal mining \n     during World War II. As the war intensified, prisoners of war \n     were placed in a wide range of industries to offset labor \n     shortages. As part of this, close to 900 American POWs were \n     allocated to four mines operated by Mitsubishi Mining in \n     Japan.\n       I joined Mitsubishi Materials as a postwar baby-boomer and \n     have worked in the company for 34 years. I have read the \n     memoirs of Mr. James Murphy, who is present here at this \n     ceremony, and those of other former POWs, as well as records \n     of court trials. Through these accounts, I have learned about \n     the terrible pain that POWs experienced in the mines of \n     Mitsubishi Mining.\n       The POWs, many of whom were suffering from disease and \n     injury, were subjected to hard labor, including during \n     freezing winters, working without sufficient food, water, \n     medical treatment or sanitation. When we think of their harsh \n     lives in the mines, we cannot help feeling deep remorse.\n       I would like to express our deepest sense of ethical \n     responsibility for the tragic experiences of all U.S. POWs, \n     including Mr. James Murphy, who were forced to work under \n     harsh conditions in the mines of the former Mitsubishi \n     Mining.\n       On behalf of Mitsubishi Materials, I offer our sincerest \n     apology.\n       I also extend our deepest condolence to their fellow U.S. \n     POWs who worked alongside them but have since passed away.\n       To the bereaved families who are present at this ceremony, \n     I also offer our most remorseful apology.\n       This cannot happen again, and of course, Mitsubishi \n     Materials intends to never let this happen again.\n       We now have a clear corporate mission of working for the \n     benefit of all people, all societies and indeed the entire \n     globe. Respecting the basic human rights of all people is a \n     core principle of Mitsubishi Materials, and we will continue \n     to strongly adhere to this principle.\n       Our management team wishes for the health and happiness of \n     our employees every day, and we ask that all of them work not \n     only diligently, but also with a sense of ethics.\n       Mitsubishi Materials supplies general materials that enrich \n     people's lives, from cement to cellphone components and auto \n     parts, all of which are closely related to people's lives. We \n     also place a strong emphasis on recycling for more \n     sustainable societies, such as recovering valuable metals \n     from used electrical appliances and other scrapped materials.\n       Here in the United States, we have plants for cement and \n     ready-mixed concrete, and a sales headquarters for our \n     advanced materials and tools business, all in California, as \n     well as a polysilicon plant in Alabama. We believe that our \n     company provides fulfilling jobs for local employees and \n     contributes to host communities through its business.\n       The American Defenders of Bataan & Corregidor Museum in \n     Wellsburg, West Virginia archives extensive records and \n     memorabilia of POWs. These records and memorabilia will be \n     handed down to future generations for educational purposes.\n       I will visit the museum the day after tomorrow to view the \n     exhibits and visualize how POWs were forced to work under \n     harsh conditions. For now, however, I am pleased to announce \n     that Mitsubishi Materials has donated 50,000 U.S. dollars to \n     the museum to support its activities.\n       Finally, I sincerely thank Ms. Kinue Tokudome and the \n     members of the American Defenders of Bataan & Corregidor \n     Memorial Society for creating this opportunity to meet with \n     you today. I also express my sincere thanks to Rabbi Abraham \n     Cooper for offering the Museum of Tolerance as a venue for \n     the ceremony. And I express my deep gratitude to all others \n     involved in arranging this gathering.\n       I would also like to thank the family members of a non-U.S. \n     POW [Mr. Stanley Gibson from Scotland, whose late father \n     James Gibson, a private in the Argyll and Sutherland \n     Highlanders captured in Malaya in 1942, was also a slave \n     laborer in the Mitsubishi Osarizawa mine] who have come from \n     very far away to attend this ceremony.\n       I truly hope that this gathering marks the starting point \n     of a new relationship between former POWs and Mitsubishi \n     Materials.\n       Thank you very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/05/senate-section/article/S6378-1", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO MELBA CURLS\n\n Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in \ncongratulating my good friend Melba Curls on her retirement from her \nmany years of service to the city of Kansas City and the State of \nMissouri.\n  Melba's journey as an agent of change began early in her life as a \nmember of one of the first classes to integrate Kansas City's Central \nHigh School. Soon thereafter she found herself active in the NAACP's \nYouth Program. It was through that involvement that she met her future \nhusband and my good friend State senator Phil B. Curls. While Phil \npassed from us far too soon, it was not before spending 43 wonderful \nyears wed to Melba.\n  Melba began her career in public service as a valued staff member to \nformer Kansas City mayor Charles Wheeler and then to U.S. Senator Tom \nEagleton. She then dedicated nearly 15 years of her life to improving \nthe lives of countless Missourians, through her work at KCMC Child \nDevelopment Corporation and its Head Start Program.\n  The people of Missouri's 41st House District elected Melba to \nrepresent them in the Missouri House of Representatives in 1999. Her 7 \nyears in the general assembly saw her work across the political aisle, \nwith both urban and rural legislators and with officials from executive \ndepartments in order to make her community and her State a better place \nfor us all.\n  In 2007, Melba was elected as city councilwoman for the third \nDistrict, At-Large in Kansas City, MO. In typical fashion, Melba jumped \nin feet first to tackle a wide range of issues facing the city. Whether \nit was housing, transportation and infrastructure, or issues pertaining \nto public safety, Melba was going to be a leader fighting for the good \nof her community.\n  Melba is now completing her second and final term on the city \ncouncil. During her time in elected office, she has earned the respect \nof her colleagues, civic organizations, and the community at large.\n  I know Melba is now looking forward to traveling and spending more \ntime with her beautiful family. However, I also know Melba--when she \nsees work that needs to be done, she will be there. While her time as \nan elected official may be coming to an end, her time as a force for \ngood is not. Thanks to her lifelong passion and drive, her \nneighborhood, the city of Kansas City, and the State of Missouri are, \nand will continue to be, better places for us all.\n  I ask that the Senate join me in congratulating Melba Curls on a job \nwell done, and wishing her nothing but the best in the years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/05/senate-section/article/S6378-2", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6378-S6379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               STURGIS MOTORCYCLE RALLY 75TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate the \n75th anniversary of the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, taking place this \nweek in Sturgis, SD. No single week in the entire year boasts a greater \ninflux in the State's overall population than the week of the annual \nevent the first week of August. During that week, motorcyclists gather \ntogether in perhaps the largest bike gathering of all time. This year, \nmore than 1 million visitors from across the world are estimated to \nattend the rally--more than the entire population of South Dakota.\n  What began as a single motorcycle race in 1938, the weeklong rally \ntakes place in the small town of Sturgis in the Black Hills of western \nSouth Dakota, a normally quiet town with a population of just over \n6,000. During the week of the rally, however, Main Street Sturgis \nevolves into a platform for chrome, leather, and denim, where \nmotorcycle enthusiasts and other tourists come to enjoy like-minded \ncompany, various forms of entertainment, the South Dakota landscape, \nand local food and grub.\n  The economic impact of the rally is impressive. A study conducted by \nthe Rally Department of the city of Sturgis gauged the economic impact \nof the 2010 rally, which hosted 466,000 attendees, as generating \nroughly $817 million dollars in economic activity for the State. That \nis just in 1 year.\n  And not just the city of Sturgis benefits. Though the rally only \nlasts a week, the magnificence of the State often compels visitors to \nstick around even longer. Many attendees travel to South Dakota weeks \nbefore the rally begins or extend their stay afterward\n\n[[Page S6379]]\n\nto travel our State and take in its beauty and many tourist \nattractions. With the Black Hills National Forest, Badlands National \nPark, Mount Rushmore National Monument, and the Crazy Horse Memorial \nall within driving distance, visitors can experience the buzzing \ncommotion of bikers and chrome one day and the pristine beauty of South \nDakota's Black Hills the next. The contrast is captivating, and it \nboosts economic activity throughout the region. By all accounts, this \nyear has been no different. It appears the 75th Annual Sturgis \nMotorcycle Rally is already off to a great start, and it could very \nwell be a record-breaking year.\n  Rally week is always an exciting time to be in South Dakota, and I \nwish everyone attending this year's rally a safe, happy, and fun-filled \ntrip. Congratulations to everyone who has worked to make the rally a \nworld-renowned event over the past 75 years. I wish our State and the \ncity of Sturgis many more successful years of hosting the Sturgis \nMotorcycle Rally.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/05/senate-section/article/S6379-1", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO CHLOE CHRISTENSEN\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A bill to require each agency to repeal or amend 1 or more \nrules before issuing or amending a rule; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce S. 1944, the \nRED Tape Act of 2015.\n  The letters R-E-D stand for Regulations Endanger Democracy. They do, \nand they are. This bill will help cut burdensome regulations--\nregulations that I think everybody agrees have been strangling our \neconomy, regulations that many of my colleagues and I and economists \naround the country and around the world believe are at the heart of why \nwe can't grow the great American economy.\n  Let me spend a few minutes on the economy, what the regulations are \ndoing, and why I believe this bill is so important and why we are \nworking hard to get bipartisan support for it.\n  There is a debate going on in this country and on the Senate floor: \nAre we in decline? Is America in decline? Are our best days behind us? \nIs China going to own the 21st century the way we did the last century?\n  Now, I am an optimist. I don't think we are in decline. We don't need \nto be in decline. Here is the reason why. We don't hear about it much, \nbut when we look and compare the United States to other countries, we \nhave so many comparative advantages. We still have so many comparative \nadvantages.\n  Imagine the United States is in a global poker game with all the \nother major nations of the world around the table. We don't hear this \nmuch, but relative to other countries, we look at our hand and we hold \naces. As a matter of fact, we hold most of the aces. Let me give a few \nexamples.\n  The high-tech sector. Whether it is Silicon Valley, Massachusetts, \nplaces throughout the entire country, we still have the most vibrant, \ninnovative high-tech sector of anyplace in the world, the ability to \ncommercialize ideas with private equity and financing. If you have a \ngood idea, an entrepreneurial idea in America, you can commercialize \nthat, you can take that to market more quickly, more efficiently than \nany other place in the world.\n  Our agriculture sector for decades has been probably the most \nefficient agriculture sector in the world, feeding the world, \nliterally.\n  Universities. Look at America's universities relative to any other \nplace, any other country. I had the great honor--my oldest daughter of \nmy three teenaged daughters graduated from high school last year. My \nwife and I took her to a number of universities she was looking at \nacross the country. We have States--Massachusetts, California--that \nprobably have better top research universities just in those States \nthan other countries have in their entire country. In my State of \nAlaska, we have great universities. It is a huge advantage.\n  Energy. Once again through American innovation, we are the world's \nenergy superpower again, the way we used to be, producing more oil, \nmore gas, more renewables than any other country in the world. It is a \nhuge advantage.\n  Fisheries. We are one of the top countries in the world in terms of \nthe harvest of fisheries, and my State of Alaska is the superpower of \nAmerican seafood. We harvest more than 50 percent of all seafood in \nAmerica--a huge advantage for our country.\n  The military. I don't have to say much more about the military. We \nhave the best, most professional military in the world, probably in the \nhistory of the world, unrivaled by any other nation, not even close.\n  Then even issues like--we talk a lot about immigration and how our \nsystem is broken and how the border needs to be secured. Absolutely. \nBut we are still the country of the world that other people of the \nworld want to come to. They want to come here.\n  I recently attended a naturalization ceremony in Juneau, AK. If you \nwant to take pride in our country, if you want to see something great, \ngo to a naturalization ceremony. See people who have been thinking \nabout becoming an American for most of their lives finally achieving \nthat goal. It will bring tears to your eyes. It brought tears to my \neyes.\n  Then, of course, in terms of comparative advantages, there is our \nform of government, our Framers, our Constitution--the longest standing \nconstitutional democracy in the world. It certainly is not perfect, but \nagain, relative to other countries, it is a huge advantage.\n  So, as I mentioned, we have all the aces. In that big global game of \npoker, we have a great hand. As President Reagan said a couple decades \nago, we are ``the greatest, freest, strongest nation on earth.'' And I \nbelieve we still are.\n  But, of course, like all countries, we have challenges. Here is the \nbiggest challenge, I believe: If we have all the aces, if we have all \nthese comparative advantages, why can't we grow our economy anymore? \nWhy can't we create opportunities for young college graduates?\n  Our gross domestic product shrunk the first quarter of this year for \nthe third time in the last 9 years. That hasn't happened in more than \n60 years. From 2011 through 2014, our gross domestic product only grew \nat a little bit below 2 percent.\n  The comparative advantage, the growth rate that made our country \ngreat from 1790 to 2014--U.S. real GDP growth in real dollars--averaged \nan annual rate of 3.7 percent--almost 4 percent GDP growth. That is the \naverage for our country's history. That is real, robust American \ngrowth. That is what made us great. The Obama administration's average \nis 1.36 percent per year.\n  Just last week--and I know this is an issue that you and I have \ntalked a lot about--it was revealed that we now\n\n[[Page S6385]]\n\nhave officially the worst economic recovery in 70 years.\n  An article in the Wall Street Journal says that new GDP revisions \nshow the worst recovery in 70 years and it was even weaker than we \nthought. This is a huge problem. We can no longer grow our economy. \nWhen that happens, we hurt the most vulnerable in society. But what is \neven more frustrating than that is when you come to Washington, it \nseems that nobody actually seems to care about this topic anymore or \nthat we are going to dumb down our expectations.\n  It was pretty amazing. Some economists cheered. Our growth rate that \nwas announced last quarter was a little bit over 2 percent GDP growth, \nand they cheered it. But, again, the issue doesn't even seem to be \nsomething that people here are focused on.\n  Let me give you an example. The first quarter of this year, the U.S. \neconomy--the greatest economy in the world--went back into recession. \nWe shrunk. That is a big deal. That should frighten people. Did the \nWhite House say anything? Did the Secretary of the Treasury come out \nand say: Oh, my gosh, we are back in a recession; here is what we are \ngoing to do to grow this economy because we know growth is the key to \nalmost everything.\n  Not a word--in fact, what is starting to happen is--and it is a very, \nvery dangerous trend in Washington--we are just going to dumb down our \nexpectations. Yes, traditional levels of U.S. economic growth are \nalmost 4 percent since the founding of our Nation. But guess what we \nare going to call it now. We are going to call 2 percent growth--which \nis all we can achieve, it seems--the new normal. We are not going to \ntry to get back to 4 percent, the traditional levels. Democrats and \nRepublicans have done that for decades, centuries. We are going to say: \nNo, America, you need to be satisfied with the new normal--2 percent \nGDP growth.\n  Terms such as the ``new normal,'' ``secular stagnation''--some are \neven talking that this is our destiny as a nation. I don't like that \nterm--``new normal.'' It is a surrender. It is a surrender of American \ngreatness. It is a surrender of our future, and it is a surrender of \nour kids' future.\n  If we stay at these levels of growth--1.5 percent, 2 percent of GDP \ngrowth; the Obama administration growth levels--the challenges that we \nface are huge debt, infrastructure, funding the military, funding \nsocial programs, and even the cohesion of our great American country. \nAll of these challenges will be much, much harder to address.\n  I believe one of the most important things we can do in this body, \nwhich we are not doing enough of, is to focus on this issue. Why are we \nnot growing the American economy anymore? We have to get back to these \nrobust levels of growth--Democratic, Republican levels. We have to get \nback to traditional levels of growth.\n  We can do better. Our history is better. This is the greatest economy \nin the world, and we need to unleash it. What is the problem? How do we \ndo this? How do we get back to these levels of growth? If we are \nholding all the aces, what is holding us back?\n  I believe a huge part of the problem of what is holding us back is \nactually this town, the Federal Government, and the agencies here that \nare stifling economic growth with redtape from the alphabet soup of \nagencies--the IRS, the EPA, and the BLM--that are constantly \npromulgating new regulations. As opposed to being partners in \nopportunity, our Federal Government wants to regulate everything, all \naspects of our economy.\n  Regulations across the country, from Alaska to Maine, are hurting \nbusinesses, are hurting the economy, and are hurting our citizens, \nespecially the most vulnerable. Again, this is not a partisan issue. \nAlmost all of us on both sides of the aisle agree that we need to cut \nredtape. Even President Obama's own Small Business Administration puts \nthe number--the annual cost of regulations that grow every year--at \n$1.7 trillion per year. It is almost $1.8 trillion per year. If that \nwere the economy, that would be one of the largest economies in the \nworld. That is a staggering number, and they are growing. Regulatory \ncosts amount to an average of almost $15,000 per household. It is \naround 29 percent of an average family budget of $51,000. People are \nnoticing, not only in this country but globally.\n  On Friday, the Financial Times had an article: ``The land of free \nmarkets, tied down by red tape.''\n\n       Every nation needs a unifying idea. Americans love to see \n     themselves as champions of free markets and entrepreneurial \n     zeal.\n\n  That halo is coming off America because of regulations. What should \nwe do? I believe we need to freeze the growth of regulations. That is \nwhat my bill, the RED Tape Act of 2015, does.\n  The cumulative Federal rules since 1976 is what we do here. We grow \nthem like some irresistible force of nature. But it doesn't have to be \nthat way. Unfortunately, my State has been ground zero for many \noverburdensome regulations--bridges, roads, and mines that take years \nsimply to permit, not to build.\n  In rural Alaska, we are letting trash pile up because they don't make \nsmall, portable incinerators that comply with EPA regulations. Because \nof Federal roadless rules in southeast Alaska, we can't even build new \nalternative energy plants for energy-starved citizens of my State. \nNationally, bridges are crumbling and can't get built because of overly \nburdensome regulations.\n  Let me provide one more example that you are aware of, Mr. President. \nBanks are failing. Because of regulations and a bad economy, over 1,300 \nsmall community banks have disappeared since 2010, and only two new \nbanks in the United States have been chartered in the last 5 years. \nEven during the Great Depression we had on average 19 new banks a year. \nIn the last 5 years, we have had two. As the article said, ``the \nentrepreneurial halo is starting to slip, too, since increasing \nquantities of red tape are making life harder for start-ups.''\n  Let me be clear. Regulations are not all bad. Many of them keep us \nsafe from harm. But the mountains and stacks of regulations over the \ndecades undermine our future.\n  What my bill would do is very simple. It is using a simple one-in, \none-out method. New regulations that cause financial or administrative \nburdens on businesses for the people of the United States would need to \nbe offset by repealing existing regulations. You issue a new reg and \nyou repeal an old reg. If an agency doesn't want to do this, the cost \nof living adjustments for the agency personnel will be withheld until \nthe agency abides by this law. It is very simple.\n  What we need to do is stop this growth of regulations on the American \npeople and on our economy. This bill will help keep the regulatory \nsystem under control. It will help cut the redtape that binds us. It \nwill bind the regulatory system instead, and it will help bring back \nthe shine of that entrepreneurial halo in great American spirit that we \nall yearn for.\n  Finally, it will make sure that the aces we have in our hand--the \ncomparative advantages that we have over every other country in the \nworld--are used to benefit our country, grow our economy, and create a \nbrighter future for our children.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Lankford, Mr. Cotton, Mrs. \n        Capito, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Merkley, and Mr. Crapo):\n  S. 1957. A bill to require the Attorney General to provide State \nofficials with access to criminal history information with respect to \ncertain financial service providers required to undergo State criminal \nbackground checks, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the State \nLicensing Efficiency Act with my colleagues Senators Lankford, Cotton, \nCapito, Leahy, Merkley, and Crapo.\n  This bill provides a simple, commonsense change to the Secure and \nFair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act, SAFE Act, which became law \nin 2008 as part of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act.\n  Overall, this bipartisan bill streamlines the licensing process for \nfinancial service providers, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The SAFE Act required that state banking regulators use the \nelectronic Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System, NMLS, to license or \nregister mortgage loan originators.\n  As the author of the SAFE Act, I have been pleased to see the NMLS' \nsuccess over the past five years in facilitating mortgage loan \noriginator licensing.\n\n[[Page S6386]]\n\n  The use of the NMLS for mortgage loan originators benefits state \nregulators, those seeking licenses to conduct financial services, and \nconsumers.\n  First, it increases efficiency and consolidates the licensing process \nand relevant information in one place for state regulators. This also \nallows for easier coordination between regulators.\n  Second, it provides a uniform licensing process for mortgage loan \noriginators seeking licenses.\n  Finally, it allows consumers to verify the credentials of financial \nservice providers to ensure that they are truly licensed or registered \nin the state in which they are conducting business.\n  Today, over half of the States now use the NMLS for licensing \nentities other than mortgage loan originators, including for non-\ndepository financial service providers like check cashers, debt \ncollectors, and money transmitters.\n  Many States require Federal background checks as part of the \nlicensing process for financial service providers.\n  However, the SAFE Act only provided the Attorney General with the \nauthority to share federal background check information with the NMLS \nfor mortgage loan originators.\n  The FBI does not have the authority to share this information with \nthe NMLS for any other financial service provider.\n  This means that while the rest of the licensing process for other \nfinancial service providers can be conducted through the NMLS, the \nbackground check cannot.\n  I believe background checks are a critical component of State \nlicensing and regulation. It does not make sense to allow for the \nlicensing process to be delayed by barring certain background checks \nfrom being coordinated through the NMLS.\n  The State Licensing Efficiency Act would provide the authorization \nneeded for the Attorney General to allow the FBI to share background \ncheck information for non-depository financial service providers with \nstate regulators through the NMLS, just as it currently does for \nmortgage loan originators.\n  Let me be clear that this bill does not change any state licensing \nrequirements or impact any state laws. States fully retain the ability \nto determine when they want to use the NMLS for other financial service \nproviders.\n  However, should states continue to expand their utilization of the \nNMLS, it makes sense to allow them to fully do so by ensuring federal \nbackground checks can be coordinated through the NMLS.\n  Additionally, this bill will help financial service providers seeking \nlicenses in multiple states.\n  Instead of submitting federal background check requests for each \nState where they are seeking a license, they can submit one request via \nthe NMLS for Federal background check information, which will be sent \nto the NMLS.\n  States conducting the licensing process will then have access to the \ninformation through the NMLS.\n  This should reduce the number of background check processing fees \npaid by financial service providers seeking licenses and reduce the \nprocessing period for the background checks so that financial service \nproviders can get licensed more efficiently.\n  The State Licensing Efficiency Act makes a reasonable change to allow \nstate regulators who use the NMLS for licensing financial service \nproviders to fully benefit from a streamlined, transparent, and more \nefficient process.\n  Many regulatory associations support this bill including: the \nConference of State Bank Supervisors, the American Association of \nResidential Mortgage Regulators, the Money Transmitter Regulators \nAssociation, the North American Collection Agency Regulatory \nAssociation, and the National Association of Consumer Credit \nAdministrators.\n  Additionally, associations representing a variety of financial \nservice providers have voiced support, including: the Appraisal \nInstitute, the Mortgage Bankers Association, and the Money Services \nRound Table.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this legislation and am \nhopeful that this Congress will move it forward.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself and Mrs. Shaheen):\n  S. 1960. A bill to establish a statute of limitations for certain \nactions of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing legislation that \nextends the time period the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, \nwould have to seek civil monetary penalties for securities law \nviolations.\n  This legislation continues to be necessary in light of the Supreme \nCourt's decision in Gabelli v. SEC in which the Court held that the 5 \nyear clock to take action aginst wrongdoing starts when the fraud \noccurs, not when it is discovered. Unfortunately, Gabelli has made it \nmore difficult for the SEC to protect investors by shortening the \namount of time that the SEC has to investigate and pursue securities \nlaw violations.\n  Financial fraud has evolved considerably over the years and now often \nconsists of multiple parties, complex financial products, and elaborate \ntransactions that are executed in a variety of securities markets, both \ndomestic and foreign. As a result, the evidence of wrongdoing needed to \ninitiate an action may go undetected for years. Securities law \nviolators may simply run out the clock, now with greater ease in the \naftermath of Gabelli.\n  Couple this with the reality that while we have given the SEC even \ngreater responsibilities, Congress, despite my ongoing efforts to urge \notherwise, has not provided the agency with all the resources necessary \nto carry out its duties.\n  To give an example of the impact of this resource shortfall, SEC \nChair White on May 5, 2015, before the Senate Financial Services and \nGeneral Government Appropriations Subcommittee testified that ``even \nwith the SEC's efficient use of limited resources to improve its risk \nassessment capabilities and focus its examination staff on areas posing \nthe greatest risk to investors--efforts that helped to increase the \nnumber of investment adviser examinations approximately 20 percent from \nfiscal year 2013--the SEC was only able to examine 10 percent of \nregistered investment advisers in fiscal year 2014. A rate of adviser \nexamination coverage at that level presents a high risk to the \ninvesting public.''\n  This legislation would address some of these challenges by giving the \nSEC the breathing room it needs to better protect our markets and \ninvestors. Specifically, this bill extends the time period the SEC has \nto seek civil monetary penalties from five years to ten years, thereby \nstrengthening the integrity of our markets, better protecting \ninvestors, and empowering the SEC to investigate and pursue more \nsecurities law violators, particularly those most sophisticated at \nevading detection.\n  In addition, the bill would align the SEC's statute of limitations \nwith the limitations period applicable to complex civil financial fraud \nactions initiated pursuant to the Financial Institutions Reform, \nRecovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, FIRREA. For more than 20 years, \nthe Department of Justice, DOJ, has benefited from FIRREA, which allows \nthe DOJ to seek civil penalties within a 10-year time period against \npersons who have committed fraud against financial institutions. The \nSEC, which pursues similarly complex financial fraud cases, should have \nthe same time necessary to bring wrongdoers that violate the securities \nlaws to justice.\n  I thank Public Citizen, U.S. PIRG, Consumer Action, the Consumer \nFederation of America, and Americans for Financial Reform for their \nsupport, and I urge my colleagues to join Senator Shaheen and me in \nsupporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Casey, Mr. Bennet, \n        Mr. Brown, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Menendez):\n  S. 1964. A bill to amend parts B and E of title IV of the Social \nSecurity Act to invest in funding prevention and family services to \nhelp keep children safe and supported at home with their families, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue of great \nimportance: helping vulnerable children stay safe and cared for by \nstrengthening their families and connecting them to kin.\n  I would like to begin with a hypothetical. Imagine a single mom with\n\n[[Page S6387]]\n\ntwo kids and multiple part time jobs. She works long hours to provide \nfor her family, but even then it is a struggle to pay the bills and \nkeep food on the table. Reliable child care is extremely costly and out \nof reach. Because her work schedule changes week to week she is forced \nto leave her children unattended at times. Out of concern, a neighbor \nplaces a call to Child Protective Services, and a social worker then \nhas to choose between two bad options--breaking up the family, or doing \nnothing at all to help them.\n  Today, most youngsters in foster care aren't there because of \nphysical or sexual abuse. Kids predominantly wind up in foster care \nbecause their biological families, like that hypothetical single mom, \nare ensnared in terribly desperate circumstances that lead to neglect.\n  The fact is, whenever you talk with kids who have aged out of foster \ncare about what could have helped them the most, you hear them say \nthings like, ``helping my mom . . . helping my dad . . . helping my \nfamily.'' What that tells me is that youngsters know they're best \nserved when a family can be propped up, not dismantled.\n  Unfortunately, the child welfare system has too few tools for that to \nhappen. Yesterday, the Finance Committee held a hearing to explore how \nto turn that system around--how to make a difference for kids early on \nso that they can grow up surrounded by family in a safe and loving \nhome. I commend Chairman Hatch for his commitment to improving the \nlives of vulnerable kids and their families. The hearing was an \nimportant step forward.\n  Back in the mid-1990s, there was a debate over whether sending kids \nto orphanages was the right idea. And I saw an opportunity for our \nchild welfare policies to break into the enormous, untapped potential \nof kin. So I authored the Kinship Care Act, which said that aunts and \nuncles or grandparents who met the right standards would have first \npreference when it came to caring for a niece or nephew or grandchild. \nIt became the first federal law of its kind.\n  Now in 2015, I see an opportunity for Congress to take a similar \napproach, but go even further. I believe that building child welfare \npolicies around proactivity and flexibility will help a lot more \nfamilies stay together and thrive. States have already shown that with \nwaivers from the rigid Federal funding system, they're able to turn \nsmart ideas into meaningful results for kids and their families, There \nis a tremendous example that my home state of Oregon is currently \nputting in place. It's called Differential Response. Differential \nResponse, as I see it, is all about recognizing that every kid is \ndifferent, and every family faces unique challenges. So Oregon's system \nis approaching every case with the nuance it deserves.\n  Today I--along with Senators Stabenow, Bennet, Casey, Brown, \nCantwell, Schumer, and Menendez--am introducing the Family Stability \nand Kinship Care Act that will make badly needed flexibility a core \npart of our child welfare system. The purpose of this bill is to give \nstates and tribes the ability to make modest front-end investments in \nfamily services and kinship placement in order to reduce costly and \ntraumatic stays in foster care. Under current law, title IV-E of the \nSocial Security Act, the nation's largest child welfare funding stream, \nprovides states and tribes with a Federal funding match for children \nonly after they are placed in foster care. In contrast, State and \ntribal innovations implemented through title IV-E waivers suggest that \npermitting spending for preventive family services can reduce the \nprevalence and length of foster care placements while maintaining or \nimproving safety and permanency outcomes for children. Further, State \nexperiences with subsidized guardianship demonstrate that when children \ncannot remain with their parents, they do best when placed with kin.\n  This bill enhances Federal funding available under parts B and E of \ntitle IV of the Social Security Act for prevention and family services \nto help keep children safe and supported at home with their parents or \nother family members. It gives states and tribes the flexibility to \nadapt evidence-based family services to the specific needs of each \nfamily. It ensures that states and tribes are held accountable for \nallocating services in ways that maximize safety, permanency, and well-\nbeing for children, while minimizing the prevalence of lengthy foster \ncare placements.\n  We need more than two options--foster care or nothing--when the child \nprotection system gets involved. By helping families afford child care, \nmaybe it is possible to prevent outright neglect. Maybe mom or dad \nneeds counseling or medical help. Maybe they need help covering the \nbills or finding employment. Oftentimes, a youngster's aunt, uncle, or \ngrandparents could step up and take them in, but they shouldn't have to \ntake on that job without assistance. More often than not, in my \njudgement, it's absolutely worth exploring those avenues before \nbreaking a family apart. In fact, it can save resources in the long run \nwithout compromising on safety.\n  I look forward to working with Chairman Hatch and the full Senate to \nadvance this legislation and I am hopeful that together, we can make \nthis critical investment in children and their families.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOOKER (for himself, Mr. Paul, Mr. Lee, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 1965. A bill to place restrictions on the use of solitary \nconfinement for juveniles in Federal custody; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, today I am proud to stand here with \nSenators Rand Paul, Mike Lee, and Dick Durbin in introducing the \nMaintaining dignity and Eliminating unnecessary Restrictive Confinement \nof Youths Act of 2015, or the MERCY Act. This bipartisan bill would \nprohibit juvenile detention facilities from placing federally \nadjudicated delinquents in solitary confinement and would limit the use \nof such confinement for all juveniles in federal pretrial detainment. \nProlonged use of solitary confinement of young people often results in \nsevere psychological harm and it is time the federal government leads \non this issue and bans the practice.\n  The juvenile justice system was created because it has always been \nunderstood that children are different than adults and need special \nprotection. It was founded on the principle that youth are malleable \nand, therefore, the focus should be on rehabilitation rather than \npunishment. Adolescents are still developing psychologically and \nphysiologically and have different needs than adults. In fact, research \nhas shown that brains in humans do not fully develop in most \nindividuals until the age of 25, which underscores the fragility of \nthese young Americans. Unfortunately, our juvenile justice system has \nlost its way and the emphasis has shifted from one of rehabilitation to \npunishment. Children are finding themselves trapped in a criminal \njustice system that does more harm than good and nowhere is that more \nevident than in the practice of solitary confinement.\n  In 2011 alone, more than 95,000 youth were held in prisons and jails, \nand a significant number were held in isolation. In 2013, the \nDepartment of Justice found that 47 percent of juvenile detention \ncenters locked youth in solitary confinement for more than four hours \nat a time, and some held youth for up to 23 hours a day with no human \ninteraction. Words can hardly explain the horrors many children face \nwhile placed in isolation. Young people held in solitary suffer from \nresounding psychological and neurological damage, including depression, \nhallucinations, paranoia, anger, and anxiety. U.S. Supreme Court \nJustice Anthony Kennedy recently commented on the practice of solitary \nconfinement in an opinion and said, ``The penal system has a solitary \nconfinement regime that will bring you to the edge of madness, perhaps \nto madness itself.'' The negative impact that this practice can have on \nyouth is evidenced by the fact that studies have shown that half of all \nsuicides by juveniles in detention facilities occurred in isolation.\n  Medical experts to civil and human rights advocates have made calls \nto end this horrible practice. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on \nTorture called for the practice to be banned across the globe. Despite \nthe extensive data that demonstrates the harmful nature of solitary, \nthe United States continues to use solitary confinement at alarming \nrates. It is time the United\n\n[[Page S6388]]\n\nStates catch up to international standards and ban the use of \nunnecessary juvenile solitary confinement.\n  The MERCY Act would prohibit the use of solitary confinement of youth \nadjudicated delinquent in the Federal system, unless it is a temporary \nresponse to a serious risk of harm to the juvenile or others. \nAdditionally, it would preclude the use of solitary confinement of any \nyouth awaiting trial in federal court regardless of whether that person \nis being tried as an adult or juvenile. The bill ensures that before a \njuvenile is placed in room confinement, the staff member must use the \nleast restrictive techniques, including de-escalation techniques or \ndiscussions with a qualified mental health professional. It mandates \nthat juveniles be informed of why the room confinement placement \noccurred and that release will occur upon the youth regaining self-\ncontrol or a certain period of time has elapsed. The Mercy Act limits \nsolitary confinement on juveniles that pose a risk of harm to others to \nno more than 3 hours and to juveniles who pose a risk of harm to \nthemselves to no more than half an hour. Finally, after the maximum \nperiods of confinement expires, the bill mandates that juveniles be \ntransferred to a facility where appropriate services can be provided.\n  If we truly want our criminal justice system to reflect our founding \nprinciples as a nation of liberty and justice for all, we must promote \na more compassionate, common sense approach to rehabilitation that \nhelps restore promise in our young people. It is time we ban the \nsolitary confinement of youth and I urge the speedy passage of the \nbipartisan MERCY Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 1971. A bill to expand the boundary of the California Coastal \nNational Monument, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the California \nCoastal National Monument Expansion Act, legislation that would expand \nthe current Monument to include about 6,200 acres of pristine public \nlands across four California counties. I am proud to be joined in this \neffort by my friend from California, Senator Dianne Feinstein.\n  In 2000, President Clinton made history when he designated the \nCalifornia Coastal National Monument, which stretches the entire 1,100 \nmiles of California's coastline and protects more than 20,000 small \nislands, rocks, exposed reefs and islands between Mexico and Oregon. It \nalso protects the habitat for a variety of wildlife including seabirds, \nCalifornia sea lions and southern sea otters.\n  In 2012, I introduced legislation with Senator Feinstein and \nCongressman Mike Thompson to expand the Monument to include the Point \nArena-Stornetta Public Lands in Mendocino County. We were grateful when \nPresident Obama took action last year to add these spectacular lands as \nthe first onshore addition to the monument.\n  The legislation we are introducing today would expand the California \nCoastal National Monument again to include five more onshore sites, \ncreating a new network of federal coastal properties for the public to \nenjoy. By highlighting these sites, the measure would also boost \ntourism and the economy of communities up and down the coast.\n  Each one of these new areas is unique, with its own rugged landscape, \nits own majestic views of the Pacific Ocean and its own history. Each \npiece tells us part of the fascinating story of the development of \nCalifornia and our Nation.\n  In Humboldt County, one of my State's northern most counties, this \nlegislation would protect Trinidad Head--13 acres of rocky shoreline \nwhich offers visitors breathtaking views of offshore sea stacks and the \nCity of Trinidad, the oldest town on the northern California coast. The \nland is also home to the historic Trinidad Head lighthouse, which dates \nback to 1871 when it helped guide vessels carrying lumber up and down \nthe Redwood Coast.\n  The Lost Coast Headlands in Humboldt County would also be included, \nproviding visitors access to 440 acres of some of the most spectacular \nscenery in northern California. From alpine forests and rolling \nmountains to coastal bluffs south of the mouth of the Eel River, this \narea offers a little something for every outdoor enthusiast, whether it \nis hiking, bird watching or beachcombing. These lands also played an \nimportant role during the Cold War when the U.S. Navy opened a post \nthere to monitor Soviet submarines.\n  The Monument would be expanded to encompass Lighthouse Ranch, about \n11 miles south of Eureka, which sits on eight acres of a former U.S. \nCoast Guard station once used as a Christian commune. Today, it offers \nbreathtaking, panoramic views of the Eel River Delta, Humboldt Bay and \nthe Pacific Ocean.\n  Drive about 350 miles south of Humboldt County to Santa Cruz County \nand you will discover the Cotoni-Coast Dairies--5,780 acres of former \ndairy and cement plant lands. Its name is a nod to the Cotoni Indians, \nwho lived there for thousands of years, and the Swiss dairy farmers who \nran the land as a farm and ranch for much of the 20th century. The \narea, which would also be included in the Monument, draws in visitors \nwith its redwoods, coastal grasslands, foothills and watersheds that \nflow directly into the northern Monterrey Bay.\n  The bill would also preserve Piedras Blancas--20 acres with 425 \nstate-owned acres cooperatively managed by the Bureau of Land \nManagement, BLM, in Big Sur. Named for three white rocks just off the \nend of the point, the area is well-known for its historic 19th century \nlighthouse and is also an important ecological research area. Tourists \ncome to catch a glimpse of a beautiful landscape untouched by \ndevelopment and see wildlife like Elephant Seals, sea lions and sea \nbirds.\n  Additionally our legislation would protect one offshore site--a group \nof small rocks and islands off the coast of Orange County. Back in the \n1930s, the Coast Guard considered using these properties for \nlighthouses, but the agency now agrees they should be permanently \nprotected as part of the National Monument. Under this bill, these \namazing rocks and islands will remain a pristine part of California's \nnatural heritage.\n  These are some of the most magnificent lands in the country, and we \nhave a responsibility to protect them for current and future \ngenerations. That is why expanding the California Coastal National \nMonument is so critical.\n  The new designation would permanently protect each site from \ndevelopment and would ensure stronger protections for a diverse array \nof wildlife that call the area home, many of which are endangered. It \nwould also help restore habitats and protect water quality by placing \nthese properties under one management plan to allow for better \ncoordination of available resources.\n  Expanding the Monument is not just good for our conservation \nefforts--it is also good for the economy. Each of these natural \ntreasures showcases the breathtaking coastlines and recreational \nopportunities that draw visitors from California and across the world.\n  Listen to the numbers from these three California counties: In \nHumboldt County, tourism is responsible for more than $330 million \nevery year. In Santa Cruz County, tourism brings in more than $700 \nmillion every year and is one of the county's top industries. Tourism \nin San Luis Obispo County produces more than $1 billion annually and is \nalso the county's largest industry, supporting 15,570 jobs in 2011.\n  Designating these sites as part of the National Monument will not \nonly generate more economic activity, it will help attract increased \nresources to support the needs of the area, including additional \nconservation programs.\n  The expansion of this National Monument has strong support from a \nlarge coalition of local governments, elected officials, business \nowners, landowners, farmers, private individuals, and many conservation \nand outdoor industry groups. This impressive grassroots effort shows \nhow deeply our citizens care about the future of these public lands, \nand I am proud to support their hard work and commitment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill to expand the California \nCoastal National Monument and help protect these spectacular lands for \ngenerations to come.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. HEITKAMP:\n\n[[Page S6389]]\n\n  S. 1974. A bill to require the Bureau of Consumer Financial \nProtection to amend its regulations relating to qualified mortgages, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, the mid-2000s housing bubble was fueled \nby cheap access to credit and unsound, deceptive, and sometimes \nfraudulent mortgage lending practices. Borrowers were offered risky, \nhigh-cost loans they could neither afford nor understand by originators \nwho abandoned traditional underwriting process, accepted loan \napplications with little or no documentation, and directly profited \nfrom selling unsustainable loans wholesale. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street \nReform and Consumer Protection Act contains many necessary and \nimportant reforms to the mortgage origination industry to prevent \nfuture abuses. However, the law is complex and has, unintentionally, \nimposed onerous, one-size-fits-all rules on community banks and local \nfinancial institutions that originate mortgages to entrepreneurs and \nfarmers.\n  For over a decade, and under supervision of the Federal Housing \nFinance Agency, the Federal Home Loan Banks, FHLBanks, have operated a \nset of mortgage programs that ensure small financial institutions can \nexpand access to credit and originate affordable mortgages in their \ncommunities. The Mortgage Partnership Finance program--and the similar \nMortgage Purchase Program--provides members an alternative secondary \nmortgage market. A FHLBank purchases a mortgage and manages the \nliquidity, interest rate, and prepayment risks while the originating \nbank member assumes some credit risk for the loans.\n  The FHLB mortgage programs' guidelines prior to the passage of the \nDodd-Frank Act often met or exceeded the standards that we now know as \nQualified Mortgage, QM, but the requirements were flexible and not \nunduly burdensome. QM status provides originators the legal and \nregulatory certainty they need to expand safe access to affordable \nmortgages. The FHLBanks have since harmonized their standards with QM, \nbut some member banks struggle to comply due to the strict \nrequirements, such as Appendix Q, for assessing a consumer's ability to \nrepay. For example, the general QM option in some circumstances \nprevents community banks and credit unions that originate mortgages to \nthe self-employed from selling those loans to the FHLBanks. This \noutcome is problematic because the FHLBank System is the only avenue \nfor mortgage resale for many small financial institutions; without the \nability to resell to the FHLBanks, credit availability is constrained \nin communities served by these institutions.\n  Small financial institutions that participate in the FHLBank System \nengage in relationship lending--their customers are their neighbors, \ntheir youth sports coaches, their community leaders--and they should \nnot be required to comply with burdensome regulations designed to clamp \ndown on unsound mortgage lending practices at large institutions. The \nlegislation I am introducing today, the Relationship Lending \nPreservation Act, would allow these financial institutions to continue \nserving farmers and entrepreneurs while ensuring the safety and \nsoundness of the mortgage origination system. The bill simply requires \nthe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, CFPB, to establish a distinct \nQM option for loans eligible to be purchased by a FHLBank or loans \nparticipating in a credit risk sharing program established by a FHLBank \npursuant to regulations issued by the Federal Housing Finance Agency. \nThis legislation is supported by The Council of FHLBanks and others in \nthe financial community.\n  In practice, the bill will provide QM status to loans sold to the \nFHLBanks that would have otherwise qualified for the general QM option \nexcept for the income and debt rules. Institutions would still be \nrequired, by FHLBank regulation, to adhere to underwriting and \ndocumentation requirements. The legislation provides parity between the \nFHLBanks and Fannie and Freddie, and it mirrors a request by the \nFHLBanks to the CFPB to modify QM to accommodate sales to the FHLBanks. \nJust as mortgages sold to Fannie and Freddie qualify for QM status, \nparticipants of the FHLBank mortgage programs should be eligible for \nQM.\n  It is important to note that this legislation is narrowly tailored to \nbenefit truly community financial institutions--the new option is \nlimited to the commonly accepted definition of community banks, those \ninstitutions with less than $10 billion in assets--and does not \nincrease systemic risk. Sixty-seven percent of participants in the FHLB \nmortgage programs are institutions with less than $500 million in total \nassets--these are the smallest of the small lenders. Additionally, the \nFHLB mortgage programs require lenders to retain a portion of the \nloan's credit risk. This ``skin in the game'' provision ensures \noriginators are making quality loans that will be repaid; in fact, \nloans participating in the FHLB mortgage programs have a 1.47 percent \n90-day delinquency rate, less than 2/3 the national average of 2.29 \npercent.\n  Community-based financial institutions are central to promoting \ngrowth and economic prosperity in small and rural communities \nthroughout North Dakota and the Nation. These institutions were not the \ncause of the housing and financial crises and should not be subject to \nregulations meant for large-scale mortgage-origination institutions. \nThe Relationship Lending Preservation Act will ensure small financial \ninstitutions can continue to do what they do best: serve their \ncommunities by providing affordable mortgages. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bill--community financial institutions, and the families \nthey serve, are too important for our country's future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself, Ms. Baldwin, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. \n        Cantwell, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. Gillibrand, Ms. Heitkamp, Ms. \n        Hirono, Ms. Klobuchar, Mrs. McCaskill, Mrs. Murray, Mrs. \n        Shaheen, Ms. Stabenow, and Ms. Warren):\n  S. 1975. A bill to establish the Sewall-Belmont House National \nHistoric Site as a unit of the National Park System, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the urgent need to \nauthorize the Sewall-Belmont House & Museum as part of the National \nPark Service.\n  Sewall-Belmont is a critical piece of our Nation's history. It was \nthe home of Alice Paul and the National Woman's Party, whose \nperseverance brought the movement for women's suffrage over the finish \nline with the enactment of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. \nToday it helps tell the story of one of the most important chapters in \nour Nation's history by highlighting the political strategies and \ntechniques of Alice Paul and the National Woman's Party, which became \nthe blueprint for civil rights organizations throughout the 20th \ncentury.\n  The Sewall-Belmont House was more than a house--it was a home to \ngreat minds and leaders, thanks to the generosity of women like Alva \nBelmont. It was a place where women could live, rest, and work without \nfear of harassment while they fought boldly for the ballot.\n  In the 1970s, when they were threatening to tear down this building \nto make way for the Senate offices, Pat Schroeder and the women of the \nHouse rallied to save it. Now it is a museum where today's generation \ncan learn about the courageous women who came before them. This house \nhas always been the scene of making history, and has always stood for \nwomen's empowerment.\n  However, today Sewall-Belmont is in dire need of federal support if \nit is to continue to serve the public. While the National Woman's Party \nhas been successfully operating the House and managing its historic \ncollection, it has been forced to cut back on public tours, research \nrequests, and educational programs due to the growing capital needs of \nmanaging an aging building.\n  Sewall-Belmont is a National Historic Landmark, listed on the \nNational Register of Historic Places, and one of four designations \nsupported by the Save America's Treasures legislation. The National \nPark Service recently completed a feasibility study which concluded \nthat Sewall-Belmont's deep\n\n[[Page S6390]]\n\nhistorical significance and unique contribution to our Nation's history \nwarrants its full inclusion into the National Park Service. This would \nnot only give it the resources it needs to continue to educate the \npublic, but would send a powerful message that women's history is an \nimportant part of our Nation's history.\n  Women fought for decades against great onslaught to secure the right \nto vote. One hundred and sixty-seven years ago, in July 1848, the \nfirst-ever women's rights convention was held in Seneca Falls. This \nconvention was the beginning of one of the greatest social movements of \nall time, kicking off the actions of the first generation of \nsuffragists and making women's suffrage a national topic.\n  At this convention, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott stood up \nto meet the challenges of their time. They mobilized and they organized \nthe American women's rights movement. They called for a convention; \nthey called for action; they made history; they changed history. And \nthat revolution keeps on going.\n  In the 20th century, Alice Paul took the lead in the women's suffrage \nmovement. In 1916, she formed the National Woman's Party which would \nfight for suffrage until the 19th Amendment to the Constitution was \nfinally enacted in 1920--long overdue.\n  Alice Paul was a groundbreaker and a changemaker, risking arrest and \ninhumane treatment so the women of America could be part of a true \ndemocracy. With their banners and sashes, Alice Paul led the Iron Jawed \nAngels marching on Washington to President Wilson's White House. Her \nSilent Sentinels stood in rain, sleet, and snow as daily reminders of \nAmerica's conscience. They called for women's right to vote at a time \nwhen women didn't have a voice. Their cause captivated the nation! With \neach step they took, they marched toward a future where women weren't \njust able to vote, but were on the ballot.\n  Wouldn't Alice Paul be so proud to see twenty women in the United \nStates Senate? I'm so proud to be one of them. The women of the Senate \nare changing history by changing the tide and changing the tone. When I \narrived in the Senate in 1986, I was the first Democratic woman elected \nin her own right, and the sixteenth woman to serve. There are more \nwomen serving right this minute, today--fourteen Democrats and six \nRepublicans--than had served in all of American history when I arrived.\n  I am so proud of all of the accomplishments made by the women of the \nSenate. But we didn't get here by ourselves. Not a single one of us \nwould be here without Alice Paul and the National Woman's Party. That \nis why it is so important that we not only preserve the place where \nthey fought for women's full inclusion in society, the Sewall-Belmont \nHouse, but elevate it to its rightful spot among our Nation's most \nimportant national treasures.\n  There are very few sites in the National Park System that celebrate \nwomen's history. I am proud that Maryland is home to one of those sites \nwith the newly authorized Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National \nHistorical Park in Cambridge. But it is not enough.\n  Today, women have the right to vote and the right to be on the \nballot. But we have so much more to accomplish to become fully equal \nmembers of society. It is critical that we remind today's generation of \nwomen and men of this long and important history so that we can keep in \nmind the lessons learned from these movements as we march toward full \nequality. As I serve my last term in the United States Senate, there is \nnothing more important to me than preserving the legacy of this fight.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself and Mr. Boozman):\n  S. 1982. A bill to authorize a Wall of Remembrance as part of the \nKorean War Veterans Memorial and to allow certain private contributions \nto fund the Wall of Remembrance; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Korean War \nVeterans Memorial and the legislation I am introducing along with \nSenator Boozman. This legislation authorizes the addition of a ``Wall \nof Remembrance'' to the Korean War Veterans Memorial, without the use \nof public funds.\n  The Korean War, often referred to as the ``Forgotten War,'' began on \nJune 25, 1950. During the three-year course of the war, some 5.7 \nmillion Americans were called to serve, and by the time the Korean \nArmistice Agreement was signed in July 1953, more than 36,000 Americans \nsacrificed their lives, 103,284 were wounded, 7,140 were captured, and \n664 were missing.\n  To honor the Americans who served during the Korean War, on October \n28, 1986, Congress passed H.R. 2005, Public Law 99-572, authorizing the \nconstruction of the Korean War Veterans Memorial located in West \nPotomac Park, southeast of the Lincoln Memorial and just south of the \nReflecting Pool on the National Mall. For those of you who have visited \nthis memorial, it is quite a moving experience. But unlike some other \nmemorials, it does not list the names of those who died while serving \ntheir country.\n  My legislation authorizes the addition of a Wall of Remembrance to \nthe existing Korean War Veterans Memorial. The Wall of Remembrance \nwould list the names of members of the Armed Forces of the United \nStates who died in theater in the Korean War, as well as the number of \nservice members who were wounded in action, are listed as missing in \naction, or who were prisoners of war during the Korean War. The Wall \nwould also list the number of members of the Korean Augmentation to the \nU.S. Army, the Republic of Korean Armed Forces, and other nations of \nthe United Nations Command who were killed in action, wounded in \naction, are listed as missing in action, or were prisoners of war.\n  Korean War Veterans Memorials that display the names of a nation's \nfallen soldiers can be found across the globe. Authorizing a Wall of \nRemembrance here in the United States is just one way we can help \nensure that those who died while serving our country in the ``Forgotten \nWar'' are no longer forgotten. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 1983. A bill to authorize the Pechanga Band of Luiseno Mission \nIndians Water Rights Settlement, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to reintroduce the Pechanga \nBand of Luiseno Mission Indians Water Rights Settlement Act of 2013. \nThis legislation will implement a settlement concerning the water \nrights of the Pechanga Band of Luiseno Mission Indians, who have been \nengaged for several decades in a struggle for recognition and \nprotection of their federally reserved groundwater rights.\n  Since 1951, the Pechanga have been involved in litigation initiated \nby the United States concerning water rights in the Santa Margarita \nwatershed. The Pechanga's interest has been in protecting their \ngroundwater supplies, which are shared with municipal developments in \nthe San Diego region. Beginning in 2006, the Pechanga worked with local \nwater districts to negotiate a cooperative solution and put an end to \ntheir dispute.\n  The Pechanga Settlement Agreement is a comprehensive agreement \nnegotiated among the Pechanga, the United States on their behalf, and \nseveral California water districts, including the Rancho California \nWater District, Eastern Municipal Water District, and the Metropolitan \nWater District. The Settlement recognizes the Pechanga's tribal water \nright to 4994 acre-feet of water per year and outlines a series of \nmeasures to guarantee this amount. It is a watershed wide solution that \nprotects the rights of the Pechanga while providing greater certainty \nand resources to the management of the basin's water supplies.\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senator Feinstein in introducing this \nlegislation. Our bill not only provides the Pechanga with long-overdue \nassurances of their water rights, but also exemplifies all the good \nthat can be accomplished when parties put aside their differences and \ncome to the table to negotiate collaborative solutions.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 1986.

A bill to eliminate the sunset date for the Choice Program \nof the Department of Veterans Affairs, to expand eligibility for such \nprogram, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this Friday marks 1 year since the \nVeterans' Access to Care through Choice, Accountability and \nTransparency Act was signed into law by President Obama. This \nbipartisan legislation was intended to address the nationwide scandal \ninvolving the death of at least 40 veterans who had been waiting for \nweeks, months, and even years for necessary care from the VA. \nUltimately, we learned that senior VA officials purposely denied care \nand lied about it to obtain financial bonuses. We are still cleaning-up \nthe aftermath of this scandal and Congress' work continues today.\n  The hallmark of that law is the VA Choice Card, which for the first \ntime allows veterans who can't make an appointment in a reasonable time \nframe or who live far from a VA medical facility, to see the doctor of \ntheir choice to get the care they need. But, with all the bureaucratic \nhoops that the VA has required veterans to jump through to use the \nChoice Card since that law's enactment and the lack of information the \nVA has provided veterans and relevant providers on how to get and use \nthe Card, the VA has clearly been reluctant to expanding choice for \nveterans. Even after a year, I continue to get e-mails, letters and \nphone calls from veterans and their caregivers who are extremely \nfrustrated with the inability to use the VA Choice Card.\n  As I said at the time, last year's bill was meant as a beginning, not \nan end, to addressing inadequate care for our veterans. While the \ncurrent law authorizes a three-year pilot program to begin \nimplementation of the VA Choice Card, the year that has passed since \nits enactment has shown is that there is overwhelming demand for \nveterans to have the same freedom of choice for their health care that \nmilitary and civilian retirees have.\n  I have long advocated for our veterans to have the flexibility to \nchoose where and when they receive the care they have earned. And the \nPermanent VA Choice Card Act that I am introducing today moves us in \nthat direction.\n  The Permanent VA Choice Card Act makes the current 3-year pilot \nprogram for the VA Choice Card permanent. This would help remove \nuncertainty both within the VA, among providers, and especially among \nour disabled veterans that this program is here to stay.\n  Also, the Permanent VA Choice Card Act would expand eligibility for \nthe Choice Card. Any service-connected veteran enrolled through the VA \nshould have access to this level of choice. It would do so by removing \nthe requirement that a qualified veteran live more than 40 miles from a \nVA facility or have to wait 30 days for an appointment.\n  It is clear our veterans are in need of care and are not able to \nreceive it. More than a year after the VA scandal and a year since the \nChoice Act was signed into law, wait-times are still too long and in \nsome facilities are even longer than they were a year ago. The VA has \nmade it challenging for those with the VA Choice Card to make \nappointments, get follow-ups, and to see specialists near their homes. \nBy enacting the Permanent VA Choice Card Act, we will make sure that no \nveteran should be denied needed care due to wait times or distance to a \nVA facility.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON:\n  S. 1999. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the department in which \nthe Coast Guard is operating to act, without liability for certain \ndamages, to prevent and respond to the threat of damage from pollution \nof the sea by crude oil, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, tourists flock every year to enjoy the \ninviting waters of the South Florida--sunbathing on Miami Beach, \nboating in Biscayne Bay National Park, snorkeling on treasured coral \nreefs of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. And you might take \na souvenir picture at the Southernmost Point in Key West. Standing \nthere, you are closer to Cuba--90 miles away--than you are to Miami, \nwhich is 160 miles away.\n  In 1977, the U.S. negotiated a Maritime Boundary with Cuba for \nfisheries and other continental shelf activities, like oil exploration, \nroughly halfway between our nations--or 45 miles from the Southernmost \nPoint in Key West. Since 2005, several oil companies have leased blocks \nin Cuban waters south of that line to drill for oil. Can you imagine \nthe damage to our environment and our economy if oil was to coat two \nnational parks, a national marine sanctuary, a national wildlife \nrefuge, iconic coral reefs, world-class fisheries, and beloved beaches? \nIt would be catastrophic. In fact, the Florida Keys National Marine \nSanctuary was created specifically to protect against threats like an \noil spill.\n  In 2012, four companies tried and failed to find oil. But recently, \nan Angolan company has ramped up plans to drill in late 2016. We are \nsimply not prepared to protect U.S. interests from an oil spill off \nCuba. The loop current that saved South Florida from the brunt of the \ndamage from Deepwater Horizon becomes the Florida current as it runs \nbetween the Keys and Cuba and then those waters enter the Gulf Stream \nhugging the coast of Florida and heading north along the eastern \nseaboard. An oil spill in Cuban waters would almost certainly follow \nthat same path.\n  For a decade, I have fought tooth and nail to protect our environment \nand economy from a Cuban spill. Given the news that drilling will \nresume next year, it is imperative that the agencies we rely on to \nprevent and respond to oil spills are prepared. And even though Cuba is \nthe closest threat, an oil spill off Mexico, Bahamas, or Jamaica could \nenter U.S. waters. So today, I am introducing the Caribbean Oil Spill \nIntervention, Prevention, and Preparedness Act--a comprehensive \nframework to protect U.S. interests from foreign oil spills.\n  The bill would strengthen the authority of the Coast Guard to \nintervene\n\n[[Page S6392]]\n\nand make sure that we have up-to-date accurate information about the \nocean currents off of Cuba's coast so that we know where an oil spill \nmight go. It requires the relevant Federal agencies to negotiate oil \npollution prevention and response with countries bordering the Gulf of \nMexico and Straits of Florida especially to protect our National Marine \nSanctuaries like the Florida Keys. The bill ensures we have a plan to \nprotect coral reef ecosystems all through the Straits of Florida--\nbecause domestic fisheries rely on healthy corals. Finally, it requires \nany oil company that wants to drill in both U.S. waters and Cuban \nwaters to show they have the resources and plans to adequately prepare \nfor a worst-case oil spill in both areas.\n  These common-sense provisions should have broad support. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN:\n  S. 2002.

An even greater number of individuals who \n     are detained in jails each year have mental health problems \n     that do not rise to the level of a serious mental illness but \n     may still require a resource-intensive response.\n       (2) Adults with mental illnesses cycle through jails more \n     often than individuals without mental illnesses, and tend to \n     stay longer (including before trial, during trial, and after \n     sentencing).\n       (3) According to estimates, almost \\3/4\\ of jail detainees \n     with serious mental illnesses have co-occurring substance use \n     disorders, and individuals with mental illnesses are also \n     much more likely to have serious physical health needs.\n       (4) Among individuals under probation supervision, \n     individuals with mental disorders are nearly twice as likely \n     as other individuals to have their community sentence \n     revoked, furthering their involvement in the criminal justice \n     system.

Res. 242\n\n       Whereas, on September 10, 1990, the Office of Research on \n     Women's Health (in this resolution referred to as ``ORWH'') \n     was established at the National Institutes of Health (in this \n     resolution referred to as ``NIH'') to--\n       (1) ensure that women were included in NIH-funded clinical \n     research;\n       (2) set research priorities to address gaps in scientific \n     knowledge; and\n       (3) promote biomedical research careers for women;\n       Whereas ORWH was established in law by the National \n     Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 (Public Law \n     103-43; 107 Stat. 122) and implemented the law requiring \n     researchers to include women in NIH-funded tests of new drugs \n     and other clinical trials;\n       Whereas, today, more than \\1/2\\ of the participants in NIH-\n     funded clinical trials are women, enabling the development of \n     clinical approaches to prevention, diagnosis, or treatment \n     appropriate for women;\n       Whereas, in 2015, ORWH, with enthusiastic support from NIH \n     leadership, announced that, beginning in January 2016, NIH-\n     funded scientists must account for the possible role of sex \n     as a biological variable in vertebrate animal and human \n     studies;\n\n[[Page S6402]]\n\n       Whereas ORWH, along with NIH leadership, enhances awareness \n     of the need to adhere to principles of rigor and \n     transparency, including the need to publish sex-specific \n     results to inform the treatment of women, men, boys, and \n     girls;\n       Whereas, over the past 25 years, ORWH has helped expand \n     research on women's health beyond its roots in reproductive \n     health to include--\n       (1) the study of the health of women across the lifespans \n     of women; and\n       (2) biomedical and behavioral research from cells to \n     selves;\n       Whereas, by studying both sexes, ORWH is leading the \n     scientific community to make discoveries headed toward \n     treatments that are more personalized for both women and men;\n       Whereas, today, ORWH communicates through programs and \n     policies that sex and gender affect health, wellness, and how \n     diseases progress;\n       Whereas turning discovery into health for all, the NIH \n     motto, means studying both females and males across the \n     biomedical research continuum;\n       Whereas the ORWH Specialized Centers of Research on Sex \n     Differences program supports established scientists who do \n     basic, clinical, and translational research with a sex and \n     gender focus;\n       Whereas all NIH Institutes and Centers fund and encourage \n     scientists at universities across the nation to conduct \n     research on the health of women and on sex and gender \n     influences;\n       Whereas, over the past 25 years, ORWH has established \n     several career-enhancement initiatives for women in \n     biomedicine, including the Building Interdisciplinary \n     Research Careers in Women's Health program that connects \n     junior faculty with mentors who share interests in women's \n     health research;\n       Whereas ORWH co-directs the NIH Working Group on Women in \n     Biomedical Careers, which develops and evaluates policies to \n     promote the recruitment, retention, and sustained advancement \n     of women scientists;\n       Whereas the Women's Health Initiative (in this resolution \n     referred to as ``WHI'') marked the first long term study of \n     its kind and resulted in a wealth of information so that \n     women and their physicians can make more informed decisions \n     regarding postmenopausal hormone therapy;\n       Whereas WHI reduced the incidence of breast cancer by \n     10,000 to 15,000 cases per year, and the overall health care \n     savings far exceeded the WHI investment;\n       Whereas ORWH supported the National Cancer Institute's \n     development of a vaccine that prevents the transmission of \n     Human Papilloma Virus, resulting in a decrease in the number \n     of cases of cervical cancer;\n       Whereas, in 1994, ORWH co-sponsored with the National \n     Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases a landmark \n     study, the results of which showed that giving the drug AZT \n     to HIV-infected women with little or no prior antiretroviral \n     therapy reduced the risk of mother-to-child transmission of \n     HIV by \\2/3\\;\n       Whereas, according to the CDC, perinatal HIV infections in \n     the United States have dropped by more than 90 percent;\n       Whereas ORWH co-funded a large clinical study of the \n     genetic and environmental risk factors for ischemic stroke, \n     which identified a strong relationship between the number of \n     cigarettes smoked per day and the probability of ischemic \n     stroke in young women, prompting the targeting of smoking as \n     a preventable and modifiable risk factor for cerebrovascular \n     disease in young women; and\n       Whereas, over the past 25 years, ORWH has contributed \n     support toward major advances in knowledge about the genetic \n     risk for breast cancer, and discovery of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 \n     genetic risk markers has enabled better-informed genetic \n     counseling and treatment for members of families that carry \n     mutant alleles: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) ORWH has improved and saved the lives of countless \n     women worldwide and must remain intact for this and future \n     generations;\n       (2) there remain striking sex and gender differences in \n     many diseases and conditions, on which ORWH should continue \n     to focus, including--\n       (A) autoimmune diseases;\n       (B) cancer;\n       (C) cardiovascular diseases;\n       (D) depression and brain disorders;\n       (E) Alzheimer's disease;\n       (F) diabetes;\n       (G) chronic diseases and disorders;\n       (H) infectious diseases;\n       (I) obesity; and\n       (J) addictive disorders;\n       (3) ORWH must continue to focus on ensuring that NIH funds \n     biomedical research that considers sex as a basic biological \n     variable, across the research spectrum from basic to clinical \n     studies;

Res. 243\n\n       Whereas America's Small Business Development Center \n     (referred to in this preamble as ``SBDC'') network will \n     celebrate the 35th anniversary of the SBDC network at a \n     conference to be held September 8 through 11, 2015, in San \n     Francisco, California;\n       Whereas the conference will be held--\n       (1) to continue the professional development of employees \n     of SBDCs; and\n       (2) to commemorate the educational and technical assistance \n     offered by SBDCs to small businesses across the United \n     States;\n       Whereas for 35 years, SBDCs have been among the preeminent \n     organizations in the United States for providing business \n     advice, 1-on-1 counseling, and in-depth training to small \n     businesses;\n       Whereas, during the 35 years before the date of approval of \n     this resolution, the SBDC network has grown from 9 fledgling \n     centers to a nationwide network of 63 State and regional \n     centers with more than 4,200 business advisors providing free \n     counseling at nearly 1,000 individual locations;\n       Whereas the SBDC network has worked for 35 years with the \n     Small Business Administration, institutions of higher \n     education, State governments, Congress, and others, to \n     significantly enhance the economic health and strength of \n     small businesses in the United States;\n       Whereas SBDCs--\n       (1) have assisted more than 22,500,000 small businesses \n     during the 35 years before the date of approval of this \n     resolution; and\n       (2) continue to aid and support hundreds of thousands of \n     small businesses annually;\n       Whereas 28 percent of all SBDC clients are minorities, 44 \n     percent of SBDC clients are women, and 9 percent of all SBDC \n     clients are veterans;\n       Whereas SBDCs provide over 1,250,000 hours of counseling to \n     small businesses and invest over $140,000,000 annually in \n     supporting small business;\n       Whereas, since 2012, SBDCs have helped small businesses \n     create over 750,000 jobs, add $67,500,000,000 in sales and \n     attract over $38,000,000,000 in capital;\n       Whereas, since the inception of SBDCs, SBDCs have continued \n     to redefine and transform the services offered by SBDCs, \n     including training and advising, and have taken on new \n     missions, in order to ensure that small businesses have \n     relevant and significant assistance in all economic \n     conditions; and\n       Whereas Congress continues to support SBDCs and the role of \n     SBDCs in assisting small businesses and building the economic \n     success of the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) celebrates the 35th anniversary of America's Small \n     Business Development Center network; and\n       (2) expresses appreciation for--\n       (A) the steadfast partnership between America's Small \n     Business Development Center network and the Small Business \n     Administration; and\n       (B) the work of America's Small Business Development Center \n     network in ensuring quality assistance to small business and \n     access for all to the American dream.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/05/senate-section/article/S6402-2", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6402-S6403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 244--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n  ``LAUDATO SI'' ENCYCLICAL OF POPE FRANCIS, AND GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN (for himself, Mr. Udall, Mr. Leahy, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. \nMerkley, and Mr. Sanders) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Environment and Public Works:\n\n                              S. Res. 244\n\n       Whereas on June 18, 2015, Pope Francis published an \n     encyclical letter on the environment that--\n       (1) declares, ``A very solid scientific consensus indicates \n     that we are presently witnessing a disturbing warming of the \n     climatic system. In recent decades this warming has been \n     accompanied by a constant rise in the sea level and, it would \n     appear, by an increase of extreme weather events, even if a \n     scientifically determinable cause cannot be assigned to each \n     particular phenomenon. Humanity is called to recognize the \n     need for changes of lifestyle, production and consumption, in \n     order to combat this warming or at least the human causes \n     which produce or aggravate it. It is true that there are \n     other factors (such as volcanic activity, variations in the \n     earth's orbit and axis, the solar cycle), yet a number of \n     scientific studies indicate that most global warming in \n     recent decades is due to the great concentration of \n     greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxides \n     and others) released mainly as a result of human activity.'';\n       (2) states, ``If present trends continue, this century may \n     well witness extraordinary climate change and an \n     unprecedented destruction of ecosystems, with serious \n     consequences for all of us. A rise in the sea level, for \n     example, can create extremely serious situations, if we \n     consider that a quarter\n\n[[Page S6403]]\n\n     of the world's population lives on the coast or nearby, and \n     that the majority of our megacities are situated in coastal \n     areas.'';\n       (3) affirms, ``There is an urgent need to develop policies \n     so that, in the next few years, the emission of carbon \n     dioxide and other highly polluting gases can be drastically \n     reduced, for example, substituting for fossil fuels and \n     developing sources of renewable energy. Worldwide there is \n     minimal access to clean and renewable energy. There is still \n     a need to develop adequate storage technologies.'';\n       (4) emphasizes, ``The deterioration of the environment and \n     of society affects the most vulnerable people on the planet: \n     `Both everyday experience and scientific research show that \n     the gravest effects of all attacks on the environment are \n     suffered by the poorest'.''; and\n       (5) proclaims, ``Climate change is a global problem with \n     grave implications: environmental, social, economic, \n     political and for the distribution of goods. It represents \n     one of the principal challenges facing humanity in our \n     day.'';\n       Whereas leading scientific organizations in the United \n     States have affirmed that human activity is the primary cause \n     of climate change, including the American Association for the \n     Advancement of Science, the National Academy of Sciences, the \n     American Meteorological Society, the American Chemical \n     Society, the American Geophysical Union, the American \n     Institute of Biological Sciences, and many others;\n       Whereas the U.S. Global Change Research Program's 2014 \n     National Climate Assessment documents that, over the past \n     several decades, as a result of climate change, the United \n     States has experienced more frequent and intense heat waves, \n     record droughts, increased flooding in certain regions, \n     increased hurricane intensity, frequency, and duration, \n     increased frequency and intensity of winter storms, rising \n     sea levels, and other ecologically problematic trends; and\n       Whereas if present climate trends persist, the effects of a \n     warming planet will become more catastrophic, as the 2014 \n     National Climate Assessment states, ``Children, the elderly, \n     the sick, and the poor are especially vulnerable. There is \n     mounting evidence that harm to the nation will increase \n     substantially in the future unless global emissions of heat-\n     trapping gases are greatly reduced.'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate stands with Pope Francis and the \n     scientific consensus that--\n       (1) human activity is the primary driver of climate change;\n       (2) present climate trends are unsustainable; and\n       (3) immediate action must be taken to significantly reduce \n     greenhouse gas emissions in order to limit the deleterious \n     effects of human-induced climate change.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/05/senate-section/article/S6403-1", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6403-S6404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 245--DESIGNATING THE WEEK BEGINNING SEPTEMBER 13, \n  2015, AS ``NATIONAL DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS RECOGNITION WEEK''\n\n  Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Brown, Mr. Portman, Mr. \nKing, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Murphy, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. \nBooker, Mr. Markey, Mr. Blumenthal, Ms. Ayotte, and Mrs. Murray) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 245\n\n       Whereas direct support professionals, direct care workers, \n     personal assistants, personal attendants, in-home support \n     workers, and paraprofessionals (in this resolution \n     collectively referred to as ``direct support professionals'') \n     are the primary providers of publicly funded long-term \n     support and services for millions of individuals with \n     disabilities;\n       Whereas a direct support professional must build a close, \n     respectful, and trusting relationship with an individual with \n     disabilities;\n       Whereas a direct support professional assists individuals \n     with disabilities with intimate personal care assistance on a \n     daily basis;\n       Whereas direct support professionals provide a broad range \n     of individualized support, including--\n       (1) preparation of meals;\n       (2) helping with medications;\n       (3) assisting with bathing, dressing, and other aspects of \n     daily living;\n       (4) assisting individuals with physical disabilities in \n     accessing their environment;\n       (5) providing transportation to school, work, religious \n     activities, and recreational activities; and\n       (6) helping with general daily affairs, such as assisting \n     with financial matters, medical appointments, and personal \n     interests;\n       Whereas direct support professionals provide essential \n     support to help keep individuals with disabilities connected \n     to the families, friends, and communities of the individuals;\n       Whereas direct support professionals support individuals \n     with disabilities in making choices that lead to meaningful, \n     productive lives;\n       Whereas direct support professionals are integral to \n     helping individuals with disabilities live successfully in \n     the communities of the individuals, avoiding more costly \n     institutional care;\n       Whereas the participation of direct support professionals \n     in medical care planning is critical to the successful \n     transition from medical events to post-acute care and long-\n     term support and services;\n       Whereas many direct support professionals are the primary \n     financial providers for the families of the direct support \n     professionals;\n       Whereas direct support professionals are a critical element \n     in supporting individuals--\n       (1) who receive health care services for severe chronic \n     health conditions; and\n       (2) with functional limitations;\n       Whereas direct support professionals are hardworking, \n     taxpaying citizens who provide an important service to \n     individuals with disabilities, yet many direct support \n     professionals continue to earn low wages, receive inadequate \n     benefits, and have limited opportunities for advancement, \n     resulting in high turnover and vacancy rates, adversely \n     affecting the quality of support for, and the safety and \n     health of, individuals with disabilities;\n       Whereas there is a documented critical and increasing \n     shortage of direct support professionals throughout the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the Supreme Court of the United States, in Olmstead \n     v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), recognized the importance of \n     community-based services for individuals with disabilities in \n     holding that, under the Americans with Disabilities Act of \n     1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.), States must provide \n     community-based treatment to individuals with disabilities \n     when--\n       (1) the services are appropriate;\n       (2) the affected individuals do not oppose community-based \n     treatment; and\n       (3) community-based treatment can be reasonably \n     accommodated, taking into account the resources available to \n     the State and the needs of other individuals with \n     disabilities; and\n       Whereas, in 2015, the majority of direct support \n     professionals are employed in home-based and community-based \n     settings, and this trend is projected to increase over the \n     next decade: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning September 13, 2015, as \n     ``National Direct Support Professionals Recognition Week'';\n       (2) recognizes the dedication and vital role of direct \n     support professionals in enhancing the lives of individuals \n     with disabilities of all ages;\n       (3) appreciates the contribution of direct support \n     professionals in supporting individuals with disabilities and \n     their families in the United States;\n       (4) commends direct support professionals as integral to \n     the long-term support of and services for individuals with \n     disabilities; and\n       (5) finds that the successful implementation of the public \n     policies affecting individuals with disabilities in the \n     United States depends on the dedication of direct support \n     professionals.\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to submit, with my colleague \nSenator Collins, a resolution designating the week beginning September \n13, 2015, as ``National Direct Support Professionals Recognition \nWeek.'' The Senate has passed a similar resolution each year for the \npast seven years, and National Direct Support Professionals Recognition \nWeek holds special significance this year as we celebrate the 25th \nanniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA.\n  Direct support professionals play an incredibly important role in \nproviding essential community supports to millions of Americans with \ndisabilities. These dedicated workers assist individuals with \ndisabilities with daily life activities such as dressing, eating, and \nbathing, and they help ensure that people with disabilities can be \nactive participants in their communities.\n  Let me share with you the story of Ed Wainwright, Jr., a direct \nsupport professional who was recognized this year for his incredible \nwork and dedication when he was given Maryland's Direct Support \nProfessional, DSP, of the Year Award by the American Network of \nCommunity Options and Resources, ANCOR. Ed works for New Horizons \nSupported Services in Upper Marlboro, MD, and has been a direct support \nprofessional for over 6 years. He and his staff provide essential \nsupport to 33 individuals with disabilities. Ed's primary job is to \nteach and reinforce practical life skills for individuals with \nintellectual and developmental disabilities by integrating strategic \ngoal setting with daily living, with the goal of achieving self-\nsufficiency.\n  Ed is committed to helping individuals with disabilities realize \ntheir full potential. For example, Ed once worked with a man who had \nsuffered a traumatic brain injury in a car accident as a youth. After \nthe accident, he could not walk, and the prognosis for regaining his \nmobility was poor. After work, Ed would often take this young man to \nthe gym with him to help rebuild his strength, on Ed's own time\n\n[[Page S6404]]\n\nand using his personal gym membership. Recognizing this young man's \ncreative abilities, Ed also took it upon himself to research and apply \nfor a grant to help pay for his college expenses. Thanks in large part \nto Ed's commitment and dedication, that young man is a now graphic \ndesigner and, as he continues to work on his rehabilitation, taking \nsteps again is a real possibility.\n  As Ed's story demonstrates, the job of a direct support professional \nis not easy. The hours are often long, and the wages are low. The job \ncan be physically laborious, as well as emotionally draining. The \nreward for direct support professionals, however, is that they are able \nto improve the lives of individuals with disabilities and help fulfill \nthe promise of the ADA by making it possible for these Americans to \nparticipate in their communities to the fullest extent possible.\n  Today, we have the opportunity to recognize the millions of direct \nsupport professionals who provide essential services to individuals \nwith disabilities, to thank them for their commitment and dedication, \nand to express our appreciation for the critically important work they \ndo every day throughout our country.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator Collins in expressing our \nappreciation for our country's direct support professionals and \nsupporting the resolution designating the week beginning September 13, \n2015, as ``National Direct Support Professionals Recognition Week.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/05/senate-section/article/S6404-1", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6404-S6405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 246--COMMEMORATING 80 YEARS SINCE THE CREATION OF \n                            SOCIAL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Schumer, Ms. Stabenow, Ms. \nCantwell, Mr. Nelson, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Carper, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Brown, \nMr. Bennet, Mr. Casey, Mr. Warner, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. \nBooker, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Coons, Mr. Donnelly, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. \nFeinstein, Mr. Franken, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Heinrich, Ms. Heitkamp, \nMs. Hirono, Mr. Kaine, Mr. King, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Manchin, \nMr. Markey, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Merkley, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Murphy, Mrs. \nMurray, Mr. Peters, Mr. Reed, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Schatz, Mrs. Shaheen, \nMr. Tester, Mr. Udall, Ms. Warren, and Mr. Whitehouse) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\n                              S. Res. 246\n\n       Whereas on August 14, 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt \n     signed the Social Security Act into law, thereby establishing \n     a vital - and ultimately universal - insurance program for \n     workers and families under which workers earn coverage by \n     working and paying Social Security taxes on their earnings;\n       Whereas Congress further strengthened Social Security over \n     the years by enacting improvements to, and expansion of, \n     retirement, survivors, and disability benefits for workers \n     and their families, and now Social Security provides economic \n     security to the Nation, and touches the life of nearly every \n     American;\n       Whereas Social Security is one program that offers two \n     essential earned benefits that are fundamentally linked: \n     benefits for workers with disabilities and benefits for \n     retired workers;\n       Whereas in 2014, more than 48,000,000 retirement and \n     survivors beneficiaries and about 11,000,000 disability \n     beneficiaries, including eligible family members, received \n     Social Security benefits;\n       Whereas Social Security benefits are modest but fundamental \n     to the economic security of our Nation, with the average \n     disability benefit less than $1,200 per month, or less than \n     $14,000 per year--falling just above the poverty line--and \n     the average retirement benefit of close to $1,300 per month, \n     or less than $16,000 per year;\n       Whereas older Americans rely heavily on Social Security, \n     with 9 out of 10 individuals age 65 and older receiving \n     Social Security benefits, and among elderly Social Security \n     beneficiaries, 52 percent of married couples and 74 percent \n     of unmarried persons receive more than half of their income \n     from Social Security;\n       Whereas the Social Security Administration will issue \n     almost $900,000,000,000 in earned benefits this year, while \n     more than 1,200 Social Security field offices nationwide \n     provide essential, accurate, and face-to-face services to \n     millions of Americans each day;\n       Whereas workers who are supported by disability benefits \n     today will receive retirement benefits at full retirement age \n     because Social Security Disability Insurance ensures that \n     workers who are no longer able to work and their families are \n     protected from the loss of future retirement benefits;\n       Whereas Social Security's Disability Insurance protections \n     are especially important to older workers, with 70 percent of \n     Social Security Disability Insurance beneficiaries are older \n     than 50 and 30 percent are older than 60;\n       Whereas Social Security has evolved with changes in the \n     American workforce, with the number of working women who are \n     fully insured for Social Security benefits more than doubling \n     between 1970 and today;\n       Whereas Social Security provides fundamental protection to \n     workers of every age, including young workers, who have a \n     one-in-three chance of dying or needing Social Security \n     disability benefits before reaching retirement age;\n       Whereas Social Security is America's ``family insurance \n     plan,'' providing more than 9 out of 10 American workers and \n     their families basic but critical protection in the event \n     they can no longer work to support themselves and their \n     families due to a severe medical condition;\n       Whereas, Social Security provides a lifeline for almost \n     7,000,000 children nationwide who receive benefits directly \n     because a parent has died, become disabled, or retired, or \n     indirectly because they live with a relative who is eligible \n     to collect benefits;\n       Whereas Social Security is efficient - administrative \n     expenses are less than one percent of benefits paid - and \n     benefit payments are 99 percent accurate; and\n       Whereas Social Security has dramatically reduced poverty, \n     with research indicating that the entire reduction in elderly \n     poverty between 1967 and 2000 was due to Social Security, \n     that without Social Security 40 percent of the population \n     older than 65 would be poor, and that Social Security \n     benefits lifted an estimated 2,000,000 children out of \n     poverty in 2013: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) Social Security provides earned benefits that are \n     crucial to the economic security of our Nation and must be \n     preserved to ensure future generations of Americans are \n     protected;\n       (2) with the strong support of the Federal Government, \n     Social Security must continue to deliver guaranteed \n     retirement and life insurance benefits for workers and their \n     families, as well as serve as an indispensable safety net for \n     the most vulnerable segments of American society, including \n     children, persons with disabilities, the elderly, and the \n     poor; and\n       (3) while the Trust Funds that support Social Security are \n     projected to pay all benefits through 2034, Congress should \n     act to ensure this vital program can support workers and \n     families far into the future, but should reject proposals \n     that weaken or privatize Social Security and should consider \n     proposals to strengthen Social Security benefits.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes in my capacity \nas ranking Democrat on the Committee on Finance to talk about the \nupcoming 80th anniversary of a great moment in our country's history--\nthe creation of the Social Security Program on August 14, 1935.\n  I am very pleased to be joined by all of my colleagues on this side \nof the aisle in the introduction of a resolution demonstrating how much \nwe appreciate this historic anniversary. Thanks in large part to Social \nSecurity, old age in America is no longer synonymous with hardship. \nAmerican workers have the great comfort of knowing that if the worst \nhappens, Social Security will be there for them and their families.\n  I remember how essential Social Security was to many of the older \npeople I worked with when I was director of the Oregon Gray Panthers. \nHowever, eight short decades ago, seniors often lived in poverty and \nhard-working Americans had no guarantee of economic security. Our \ncountry was in the throes of the Great Depression. Unemployment topped \n20 percent. You had bread lines for blocks, and the homeless population \nwas growing. There was no social safety net, no lifeline that offered \nsome measure of dignity. If a person lost their job, became disabled, \nsuffered the loss of a family member, they were on their own. There was \nnowhere to turn. Life was difficult for many Americans but none more so \nthan the poor, the elderly, or the disabled. Tragically, many aging and \ndisabled Americans without family to care for them ended up destitute \nor on the street.\n  America is now a different place, thanks in no small part to the \nprotection of Social Security. It is one of the strongest threads in \nAmerica's safety net, protecting the well-being of millions and keeping \nmillions more out of poverty. This year nearly 60 million American \nworkers and eligible family members will receive nearly $900 billion in \nretirement, survivors, and disability benefits.\n  Among older Social Security beneficiaries, more than half of married \ncouples and nearly three-quarters of\n\n[[Page S6405]]\n\nunmarried individuals get the majority of their income from Social \nSecurity. As of 2014, 151 million Americans had earned the protection \nof disability insurance. That is a tremendous accomplishment. Well over \n100 million workers and their families can go about their days with the \nconfidence that they are financially protected in the event of a \nmedical catastrophe because of Social Security.\n  The program also provides indispensable benefits to nearly 7 million \nchildren. Without those benefits, many of the youngsters would face \ndire circumstances after the death or disability of a parent. None of \nthis could have happened without the continuing support of the \nCongress.\n  Time and time again, Members have come together on a bipartisan basis \nto ensure this vital program remains strong. The 1939 amendments to \nSocial Security expanded retirement benefits. In 1954, the Congress \npassed amendments that provided protection for workers who became \ndisabled. The Social Security amendments of 1980 and 1983 also made \nimportant changes that helped ensure the program's long-term viability.\n  Social Security is one of America's great economic successes. The \nprogram is robust. In my view, there is big bipartisan interest in \nkeeping it that way. I look forward to working with my colleagues and \nthe ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee so that on both sides of \nthe aisle we work together to ensure that Social Security continues to \nthrive for generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/05/senate-section/article/S6405-1", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 247--COMMEMORATING AND HONORING THE ACTIONS OF \n PRESIDENT HARRY S.

Res. 248\n\n       Whereas over 2,900,000 families in the United States live \n     with prostate cancer;\n       Whereas 1 in 7 males in the United States will be diagnosed \n     with prostate cancer in their lifetimes;\n       Whereas prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed non-\n     skin cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related \n     deaths among males in the United States;\n       Whereas in 2015, the National Cancer Institute estimates \n     that 220,800 men will be diagnosed with, and more than 27,000 \n     men will die of, prostate cancer;\n       Whereas 40 percent of newly diagnosed prostate cancer cases \n     occur in males under the age of 65;\n       Whereas the odds of developing prostate cancer rise rapidly \n     after age 50;\n       Whereas African-American males suffer from a prostate \n     cancer incidence rate that is significantly higher than White \n     males and have double the prostate cancer mortality rate of \n     White males;\n       Whereas obesity is a significant predictor of the severity \n     of prostate cancer;\n       Whereas the probability that obesity will lead to death and \n     high cholesterol levels is strongly associated with advanced \n     prostate cancer;\n       Whereas having a father or brother with prostate cancer \n     more than doubles the risk of a man developing prostate \n     cancer, with a particularly high risk for men who have a \n     brother with the disease;\n       Whereas screening by a digital rectal examination and a \n     prostate-specific antigen blood test can detect the disease \n     at the earlier, more treatable stages, which could increase \n     the chances of survival for more than 5 years to nearly 100 \n     percent;\n       Whereas only 38 percent of males survive more than 5 years \n     if diagnosed with prostate cancer after the cancer has \n     metastasized;\n       Whereas there are no noticeable symptoms of prostate cancer \n     while prostate cancer is in the early stages, making \n     appropriate screening critical;\n       Whereas ongoing research promises further improvements in \n     prostate cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment; \n     and\n       Whereas educating people in the United States, including \n     health care providers, about prostate cancer and early \n     detection strategies is crucial to saving the lives of males \n     and preserving and protecting families: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 2015 as ``National Prostate Cancer \n     Awareness Month'';\n       (2) declares that steps should be taken--\n       (A) to raise awareness about the importance of screening \n     methods for, and treatment of, prostate cancer;\n       (B) to encourage research so that screening and treatment \n     for prostate cancer may be improved, the causes of prostate \n     cancer may be discovered, and a cure for prostate cancer may \n     be developed; and\n       (C) to continue to consider ways for improving access to, \n     and the quality of, health care services for detecting and \n     treating prostate cancer; and\n       (3) calls on the people of the United States, interest \n     groups, and affected persons--\n       (A) to promote awareness of prostate cancer;\n       (B) to take an active role in the fight to end the \n     devastating effects of prostate cancer on individuals, \n     families, and the economy; and\n       (C) to observe National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month \n     with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/05/senate-section/article/S6405-3", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6405-S6406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2616.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Commercial Privacy Bill of \n     Rights Act of 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Personal privacy is worthy of protection through \n     appropriate legislation.\n       (2) Trust in the treatment of personally identifiable \n     information collected on and off the Internet is essential \n     for businesses to succeed.\n       (3) Persons interacting with others engaged in interstate \n     commerce have a significant interest in their personal \n     information, as well as a right to control how that \n     information is collected, used, stored, or transferred.\n       (4) Persons engaged in interstate commerce and collecting \n     personally identifiable information on individuals have a \n     responsibility to treat that information with respect and in \n     accordance with common standards.\n       (5) On the day before the date of the enactment of this \n     Act, the laws of the Federal Government and State and local \n     governments provided inadequate privacy protection for \n     individuals engaging in and interacting with persons engaged \n     in interstate commerce.\n       (6) As of the day before the date of the enactment of this \n     Act, with the exception of Federal Trade Commission \n     enforcement of laws against unfair and deceptive practices, \n     the Federal Government has eschewed general commercial \n     privacy laws in favor of industry self-regulation, which has \n     led to several self-policing schemes, some of which are \n     enforceable, and some of which provide insufficient privacy \n     protection to individuals.\n       (7) As of the day before the date of the enactment of this \n     Act, many collectors of personally identifiable information \n     have yet to provide baseline fair information practice \n     protections for individuals.\n       (8) The ease of gathering and compiling personal \n     information on the Internet and off, both overtly and \n     surreptitiously, is becoming increasingly efficient and \n     effortless due to advances in technology which have provided \n     information gatherers the ability to compile seamlessly \n     highly detailed personal histories of individuals.\n       (9) Personal information requires greater privacy \n     protection than is available on the day before the date of \n     the enactment of this Act. Vast amounts of personal \n     information, including sensitive information, about \n     individuals are collected on and off the Internet, often \n     combined and sold or otherwise transferred to third parties, \n     for purposes unknown to an individual to whom the personally \n     identifiable information pertains.\n       (10) Toward the close of the 20th Century, as individuals' \n     personal information was increasingly collected, profiled, \n     and shared for commercial purposes, and as technology \n     advanced to facilitate these practices, Congress enacted \n     numerous statutes to protect privacy.\n       (11) Those statutes apply to the government, telephones, \n     cable television, e-mail, video tape rentals, and the \n     Internet (but only with respect to children and law \n     enforcement requests).\n       (12) As in those instances, the Federal Government has a \n     substantial interest in creating a level playing field of \n     protection across all collectors of personally identifiable \n     information, both in the United States and abroad.\n       (13) Enhancing individual privacy protection in a balanced \n     way that establishes clear, consistent rules, both \n     domestically and internationally, will stimulate commerce by \n     instilling greater consumer confidence at home and greater \n     confidence abroad as more and more entities digitize \n     personally identifiable information, whether collected, \n     stored, or used online or offline.\n\n     SEC. 203.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Ambulatory surgery centers were not covered under the \n     provisions of the HITECH Act of 2009, which created \n     certification standards and incentives for adopting \n     electronic health record (EHR) technology in the physician \n     office and hospital settings.\n       (2) The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) \n     defines a meaningful EHR user as an eligible professional \n     having 50 percent or more of the professional's outpatient \n     encounters at practices or locations equipped with certified \n     EHR technology.\n       (3) Physicians with patient encounters in an ambulatory \n     surgical center are at a disadvantage when attempting to meet \n     meaningful use requirements because there currently is not \n     certified EHR technology for such centers.\n       (4) Until such time as EHR technology is certified \n     specifically for use in the ambulatory surgical centers, \n     patient encounters that occur in such a center should not be \n     used when calculating whether an eligible professional meets \n     meaningful use requirements, unless an eligible professional \n     elects to include those encounters.\n\n     SEC. 3.
