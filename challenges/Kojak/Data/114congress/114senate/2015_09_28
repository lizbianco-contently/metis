Madam President, a new Senate majority came to office \nthis year with a new outlook on government funding from the previous \nmajority. First, we passed a budget. Then we worked across the aisle to \npass through the committee the dozen bills necessary to fund the \ngovernment. That is the first time either of these things has happened \nin 6 long years.\n  Our commonsense approach represented real hope that with the \nnecessary cooperation from across the aisle, a new and better way of \nfunding the government was actually possible. Democrats initially gave \nAmericans reason to believe they might be ready to offer that \nbipartisan cooperation. Democrats gave bipartisan committee backing to \nnearly all of the dozen government funding bills, and a majority of \nthese bills attracted support from at least 70 percent of Democratic \nAppropriations Committee members. Democrats even bragged about \nsupporting these funding bills in press releases to their constituents.\n  But this was before Democrats hatched their filibuster summer plan--\nin other words, block all of the government funding bills in the hopes \nof provoking a crisis Democrats might exploit to grow the IRS and the \nDC bureaucracy. As a result, you actually saw Democratic leaders \ndeclare that they would use procedural moves to prevent the full Senate \nfrom even debating the same funding legislation members of their party \nhad already praised in their press releases to the media.\n  Democrats even voted repeatedly to block the bill that funds our \nmilitary. Think about that--funds for our military. It would have been \ncynical enough for our colleagues to block a bipartisan defense \nspending bill Democrats had hailed as a ``win, win, win'' and a \n``victory'' for their States in their press releases, but we are all \nliving in a time of unparalleled international crises. Threats seem to \nmount less by the day than by the hour. Yet last week Democrats voted \nagain to block the bipartisan bill that funds pay raises and medical \ncare for our troops. It was very extreme.\n  I wish I could say it was the only extreme position our Democratic \nfriends took last week. On Thursday Senators were given a choice \nbetween funding women's health or funding a scandal-wracked \norganization called Planned Parenthood. Republicans stood up for \nwomen's health; Democrats stood up for their political friends.\n  I think Democrats will come to regret their continued prioritization \nof the needs of the far left over women, over our military, and over \nseemingly everything else. The question before us now is how to keep \nthe government open in the short term, given the realities we face.\n  This is what the president of National Right to Life had to say on \nthe matter:\n\n       There are two different roads that we can take. One is to \n     insist that no more money go to Planned Parenthood and cause \n     a government shutdown (which [interestingly enough] won't \n     result in actually defunding Planned Parenthood). The other \n     is to take a slightly longer-term approach, taking advantage \n     of the fact that we have the attention of the country as \n     probably never before. . . .\n\n  Had Democrats not prevented the Senate from passing the same \nappropriations bills they voted for and praised, we wouldn't be having \nthis discussion right now. But they did. They pursued a deliberate \nstrategy to force our country into another of these unnecessary crises. \nThis leaves the funding legislation before us as the only viable way \nforward in the short-term. It doesn't represent my 1st, 2nd, 3rd or \n23rd choice when it comes to funding the government, but it will keep \nthe government open through the fall and funded at the bipartisan level \nalready agreed to by both parties as we work on the way forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/28/senate-section/article/S6961-6", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6961-S6962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Madam President, a path to avert yet another Republican-\nmanufactured shutdown is before us now. This evening the Senate will \nvote to invoke cloture on a clean continuing resolution that keeps the \nFederal Government open and funded. We believe debate should continue \non this issue, and that is why we are voting the way we are going to \nvote. Following that vote, the Senate will then proceed to final \npassage of a clean funding measure--sometime tomorrow or Wednesday. \nThat will take a simple majority. I am pleased that we are on the verge \nof avoiding another Republican-sponsored shutdown of the Federal \nGovernment. We are fortunate cooler heads are prevailing.\n  But I would be remiss if I didn't remind everyone--especially my \nRepublican colleagues--that this last-minute scramble to do our most \nbasic job is as unnecessary as it is reckless. We are 2 days from a \nshutdown--only 2 days. And why? Because Republicans made it their No. 1 \npriority to undermine women's health. Keeping the government open, \nfunded, and serving the American people was a secondary concern for \nthese extremists in the Republican Party. My friend the Republican \nleader, in talking about this choice a few days ago, the choice \nbetween--he said Planned Parenthood; I say the health of women--\nunderstand, the Republicans couldn't even get a majority vote on this. \nThey couldn't get a majority vote; they were down in the forties. So \neven the Republicans think what is going on now is foolish. Keeping \ngovernment open and funded and serving the American people was a \nsecondary concern for those extremists. That is too bad.\n  So while I am pleased that we now have a path forward to avoid a \nshutdown, I am nonetheless concerned about the Republican modus \noperandi of always governing by crisis. Remember, this is the fifth \ntime in 2 years the Republicans have manufactured an unnecessary \nshutdown crisis. Two years ago they actually shut down the government. \nFor 17 days, Republicans shut down the government, and we were only \nable to get ourselves out of that morass because--for example, in the \nHouse of Representatives, two-thirds of the Republicans in the House \nvoted to keep the government closed. That is unbelievable, but that is \nthe way it was. Here it is now 2 years later, and we are on the verge \nof another shutdown.\n  Remember this: This is the fifth time in 2 years that Republicans \nhave manufactured an unnecessary showdown crisis--and it is a showdown. \nToo bad it is leading to a shutdown.\n  Exactly 2 years ago, as I indicated, of course, they shut down the \nFederal Government because of health care. Seven months ago, \nRepublicans almost shut down the Department of Homeland Security. Why? \nOver an immigration issue. The Department of Homeland Security--they \nwere going to shut it down. It was saved in the last minute. These are \nthe agencies within this Department that protect us. They protect us \nfrom terrorists, and they protect us from those many things that happen \nin our country that we need protection from.\n  This past spring, it shut down key national security programs that \nwere part of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Why? They were \nfighting among themselves. The Republican leader wanted a bill for a \ncertain length of time. People within his caucus wanted one for another \nlength of time. There was a fight among them, not among us, but they \ncame close to wreaking havoc. They did wreak some havoc because the \nprogram was shut down for a while.\n  More recently, Republicans shut down the Export-Import Bank, \nendangering the hundreds of thousands of jobs this program supports. It \nis still closed.\n  Now we are just days from another shutdown--another kind of shutdown \nbut a big one. And although it appears we will sidestep a Republican-\nmanufactured crisis this week, the disaster is looming. We still have a \nlong, difficult road ahead.\n  The continuing resolution will pass this week, but it is for a short \nterm, and it funds our government through December 11. The measure is \nvery shortsighted--December 11. That means within the coming weeks, we \nwill again be negotiating with Republicans to avoid another shutdown.\n  We will also have to find a way to pay our bills to avoid a \ncatastrophic default on our debt. Republicans tried that once. We came \nwithin minutes of doing that. The Federal Government--this great \ncountry of ours--wouldn't be able to pay its bills.\n  But we see the press. We see all these stories about the Speaker, who \nis going to step down in 5 weeks, and we hear the Republicans over \nthere. They are joyous. One Republican running for President announced \nthis, and there was cheering. And the person running for President--who \nserves in the Senate--was part of the cheer. Another Republican \nPresidential candidate came to the same meeting, and the same thing \nhappened. It is hard to comprehend that people are cheering for this \ngovernment to be closed. That is what they are doing. We shouldn't pay \nour debt?\n  The Republican House is in a sad state. Last week the far right \nshowed that it can depose a Speaker and has emerged more powerful than \never, more outspoken than ever. Members of the House will hold their \nleadership elections in the coming days, and I hope they elect some \nsensible leaders. I am deeply concerned.\n  I came to the floor on Friday and spoke as honestly as I could of my \nrespect for John Boehner. I think it is unfair that people are piling \non. Did I always agree with him? No. But he never misled me and always \ntold me the way it was.\n  I am deeply concerned that even those Republican leaders previously \ninclined toward compromise have already lost the courage to stand up to \nthe far right when it matters the most, and they have said so in the \npress. That is too bad.\n  Come November 1, we have no way of knowing what House Republicans \nwill do--this is after their elections to replace Congressman Boehner. \nWe have no idea what they are going to do, whether they will try to \nagain steer our government off a cliff, as numerous House Members have \nsaid in the last few days. Do they want to go off that cliff or do they \nwant to recklessly hammer the global economy? Maybe both.\n  We need to get to work immediately to avoid being right back here on \nDecember 11 facing another Republican shutdown because if one thing is \nclear, it is that Republicans see impending catastrophe as a political \ntool that they need to exploit.\n  The American people don't want another 15 months of Republican \nbrinkmanship. Our constituents don't want every simple legislative task \nto turn into a doomsday clock. So I invite my Republican colleagues to \nquit governing by crisis. Let's put the threat of government shutdown \nto bed now, and then let's turn our attention to something that both \nsides agree on--getting rid of the dangerous sequester cuts.\n  I have heard speeches given by the senior Senator from Arizona--\nsomeone who knows a little bit about the military--and he says \nsequester cuts are terrible. I agree with him.\n\n  These devastating cuts were never supposed to happen. They were meant \nto drive bipartisan budget negotiations. Getting rid of sequestration \nhas wide bipartisan support in both Chambers, I hope. We should start \nworking right now on a bipartisan budget fix that helps the military, \nhelps the middle class, and puts our country on a more sound economic \nfooting. And let's do it without the threat of a government shutdown. \nWe can do it, but only if Republicans don't divert us to yet another \ncatastrophe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/28/senate-section/article/S6962-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6962-S6963]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until the \ncloture vote on the motion to concur with an amendment in the House \namendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 719 will be equally divided \nbetween the two leaders or their designees.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, Wednesday night is the deadline. On \nWednesday night, the authority of the government of the United States \nto do business ends. The funding for our government ends. It is a scary \ntime. We don't want that to happen--most of us--because we know it will \nbe catastrophic. There will be people who will suffer if we fail to do \nour job.\n  Now, this isn't the first time we have been up against a deadline. We \nhave faced them before, and many times we have to buy a little extra \ntime to negotiate the budget. That is understandable. In this \ncircumstance, though, we actually have announced candidates for the \nPresidency of the United States who are calling for a government \nshutdown.\n  What happens when our government shuts down? Well, it is pretty \nobvious. Agencies stop doing business as usual. What we find, though, \nis that the impact goes far beyond just that simple statement.\n  I went back to Illinois this last weekend, and I went for a visit to \nScott Air Force Base. It is the largest single employer in the State of \nIllinois and downstate.\n  In 2013--the last time we had a government shutdown--the junior \nSenator from Texas, Senator Ted Cruz, wanted to shut down our \ngovernment to protest ObamaCare. So he successfully closed down the \ngovernment and found other Republicans who would join him in that \neffort, and it went on for a long period of time.\n  In 2013, at Scott Air Force Base, one of the most important defense \nfacilities in our country, in Belleville, IL, we saw two-thirds of the \ncivilian workforce--that is about 3,400 people--sent home immediately \nwithout pay. Those who were required to report for duty, including all \nof the base's 5,000 military personnel, would have been given IOUs \nrather than paychecks. Scott Air Force Base families were forced to \nlimit their spending and stretch their savings while the Senator from \nTexas gave speeches on the floor about Dr. Seuss. I am not making this \nup.\n  This had an impact on the entire region of Southwestern Illinois. \nScott Air Force Base has a $1.6 billion economic impact on the local \narea, including supporting thousands of indirect jobs. Every part of \nthis regional economy felt the impact of this decision to shut down the \ngovernment 2 years ago--gas stations, restaurants, small businesses, \ncontractors, everybody.\n  Now, this brinksmanship goes far beyond flowery speeches on the floor \nand press attention. The last shutdown hurt the gross domestic product \nof the United States of America. Consumer confidence drops when the \ngovernment shuts down. We saw $2 billion in lost productivity from \nfurloughed employees.\n  Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen said:\n\n       We have a good recovery in place that's really making \n     progress and to see Congress take actions that would endanger \n     that progress, I think that would be more than unfortunate. \n     So to me that's Congress' job.\n\n  The CEO of JPMorgan Chase, a man named Jamie Dimon, speaking of the \nlast Republican government shutdown, said, ``Washington has really \nslowed American down.'' I agree. And if that were the only thing that \nwas happening, it would be bad enough. But there is more.\n  Today I went to a neighborhood in Chicago, the All Saints Episcopal \nChurch in Ravenswood. They are doing a restoration on this beautiful \nchurch built back in the 19th century. I met with the pastor there. We \nwere at the food pantry of this church. This Episcopal Church tries to \nhelp neighborhood residents who are struggling to find enough to eat.\n  We had a little press conference with the local Congressman, Mike \nQuigley and Jan Schakowsky, and people who represented the food \npantries of Chicago in that area. They are worried about a shutdown and \nwhat a shutdown means to them. How would it affect the All Saints \nEpiscopal Church food pantry and the men and women who go in there on a \nregular basis to pick up some canned goods to get by? Here is what it \nmeans. Many of these people are on food stamps. We call it the SNAP \nprogram now. The SNAP program, on average, gives a person food worth $7 \na day, so the notion that people are going out for steak dinners on \nfood stamps is not quite accurate.\n  Sara--and I won't use her full name--who is 81 years old, came up to \ntalk about what life is like for her. She was a hard-working person, \nstricken with cancer in 2002, which recurred in 2004, and she had to \nquit working. She has a walker now and she gets around, but all she has \nis her Social Security check and food stamps. That is how she survives \nfrom week to week and month to month.\n  What happens when there is a government shutdown? They cut off food \nstamps. Did that happen last time? No. The last time the Senator from \nTexas shut down the government, it didn't happen because President \nObama had a surplus in his recovery fund and he took the surplus and \nput it in the food stamps so there would be no interruption of service. \nYou see, most of the recipients of food stamps are children. Single \nmoms raising kids and not making enough money supplement their income \nwith food stamps and buy food for their kids. Food stamps are also used \nby elderly people like Sara who are struggling on a fixed income.\n  This time is different. If these Presidential wannabes who are \ndetermined to shut down the government this time are successful, we are \ngoing to have problems right away. It turns out the only surplus left \nin the food stamp or SNAP benefit fund is about $3 billion. That will \nkeep the program going for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, they cut off the \nfood stamps. What does that mean? Well, for a lot of people it means a \nlot of suffering--primarily for the poorest people among us.\n  Did anyone notice last week what happened in Washington? The city was \ntransformed by the visit of Pope Francis. Congress was in awe of this \nman who came and spoke to us in very human terms about what he thinks \nwould be our obligation, not just as elected officials but as human \nbeings. One of his highest priorities is that we have some caring and \nsensitivity for those who struggle--the poor, the people on food \nstamps.\n  So for all the applause and all of the posing for pictures that went \non last week with the Pope, here we are this week discussing a \ngovernment shutdown. Here we are this week discussing whether we are \ngoing to cut off food stamps for poor people in America.\n  It is a sad reality to think of what a government shutdown would do \nin human terms to those wonderful folks working at Scott Air Force Base \nin Belleville, IL, or to Sara who will go into the All Saints Episcopal \nChurch food pantry and try to get by, as food stamps are cut off.\n  Why? Why would we do that? How can we possibly be serving this \nNation--this great Nation--by stalling our economy and hurting innocent \npeople and punishing those who are serving our country in uniform and \notherwise?\n  Some think it is a grand strategy--a great political strategy. It may \nmove\n\n[[Page S6964]]\n\nthem up from the smaller debate to the big-time debate when it comes to \nrunning for President. To me it is an indication we have lost our way.\n  In June, I joined with the other leaders on this side of the aisle in \nsending a letter to the Republican leader saying: Please, don't wait \nuntil the end of September to face this budget reality. Sit down now--\nback in June--with the President, with the leaders on the Republican \nside and the Democratic side. Let us compromise in good faith. Let us \nmeet our responsibilities.\n  Well, that is what we face. As Senator Reid said a few minutes \nearlier, there is a suggestion that maybe as a parting gift to Speaker \nBoehner we will extend the budget temporarily until December 11, 2 \nweeks before Christmas, just days before the Hanukkah season--that we \nwould extend the budget until then and then, once again, be up against \nthe deadline and the prospect of shutting down our government.\n  We can do better. We should do better. We need to make certain we \nkeep faith with the people who send us here. We need to make certain we \ndo our job--not just to send a continuing resolution to the President \nbut to resolve this issue. We should not be threatening a government \nshutdown now or in December when we know how devastating that can be.\n  I hope Congress gets busy taking care of the work we were sent here \nto do. I think it is time for those bipartisan budget negotiations. It \nis beyond time. Now is the time for Congress to act responsibly to \ndevelop a budget that allows America to thrive.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I wish to talk about an amendment I plan \nto offer in a little while, once somebody comes from our side or the \nother side because they would like to be here to talk about it with me, \nas I understand it--maybe even to object to it, maybe to agree with it. \nBut I wish to speak about the amendment, if I could, for a moment.\n  Right now, we are debating the continuing resolution. This would be \nto continue a level of spending from now until December 11. There are a \nbunch of changes in that from last year's spending, but it is basically \na continuation of the previous year until we can work out our \ndifferences. It is not the way to govern around here. What we should be \ndoing instead is having individual spending bills come up. There are 12 \ndifferent appropriations bills.\n  The ideal way to handle this is the way it used to be done, which is \nthat the Appropriations Committee and its subcommittees deal with these \nindividual spending bills. For instance, one is for Commerce, the State \nDepartment, and the Justice Department. One is for the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, and one is for the Department of Defense. \nWhen we do that, what happens is we have oversight hearings, and we \nhave Congress playing its rightful role of saying: Are these agencies \ndoing the right thing? Are these programs working or aren't they \nworking? We might increase spending with a program that is actually \nworking well, decrease spending from another program, and eliminate a \nthird program that is not working well at all. That is what Congress is \nsupposed to do. That is our job here.\n  Under the Constitution, Congress was given the power of the purse, \nmeaning that every dime has to be appropriated by the Congress. What \nhas happened over the years--particularly in the last several years--is \nthat Congress has not moved forward on these appropriations bills \nbecause they have been blocked. In this case, this year we have been \ntrying to bring up appropriations bills and the other side, the \nDemocrats, have been blocking even considering an appropriations bill.\n  We have had this debate here on the floor. Many of us have heard it. \nBut the bottom line is the committees have actually done their work and \nreported out 12 different appropriations bills. So 12 bills are ready \nto come to the floor. By the way, most of these bills have been \nreported out with huge bipartisan majorities. I saw one the other day. \nIt was 24 to 3, for instance. I know the Presiding Officer has been \ninvolved in some of these issues over the years. It is typical, \nactually, that appropriators do their jobs. Senator Mikulski, Senator \nCochran, and others work out the differences, but we simply can't get \nthem voted on on the floor.\n  People may say: Why can't you? Well, because it requires 60 votes. We \nhave to overcome a 60-vote hurdle in order to even proceed to the \nlegislation. So we haven't been able to vote on a single appropriations \nbill before September 30, which is the fiscal year-end and which is \ncoming up this week. It is no way to run a railroad, much less a \ngovernment--by the way, the government that has the biggest budget of \nany government in the world, the government of the greatest nation in \nthe world. We can't even bring these individual spending bills up here \nfor a debate and a vote. It is just wrong.\n  Again, when we don't do that, what we don't have is the oversight. I \nwould think both sides would want to have oversight over these agencies \nand departments so we understand what is working and what is not \nworking and so that those tax dollars are spent wisely. That is the \nkind of stewardship that we are responsible for. As taxpayers, as \nrepresentatives of taxpayers, we should want to be sure those dollars \nare spent in a way that is most effective. Yet, without having these \nappropriations bills, it is just impossible to do. Instead, we are \nfaced with this possibility of on September 30 not having any of what \nis called discretionary spending, which is not all of the spending of \ngovernment, but it is the spending that Congress appropriates every \nyear, and having the possibility of parts of government actually not \nbeing able to operate because September 30 is the fiscal year-end. It \nis just the wrong way to do business.\n  So the amendment I am going to offer later this afternoon is an \namendment that simply says: Let's adopt a new bill, new legislation \nthat says: Let's end government shutdowns.\n  How would we do it? We would say that as of September 30, if there is \nany bill that is not passed, any one of the 12--remember that this year \nnone of the 12 were passed--none of them. But on any year, if any one \nof those were not passed, then we would simply continue the spending \nfrom the previous year, but there would be a reduction in that spending \nover time. After 120 days there would be a 1-percent reduction, giving \n120 days to work with the Appropriations Committee to say: OK, we know \nyou don't want to see the spending cut, and we know you have priorities \nyou would like to fund, but it is going to be cut 1 percent after 120 \ndays, then 1 percent after the next 90 days, 1 percent after the next \n90 days, and 1 percent after the next 90 days. So we get to a point \nwhere we have to see a reduction in spending every year, which is not \nnecessarily a bad thing because Congress spends more than it takes in \nevery year. But if appropriators and others here in Congress don't want \nto see that, they would have to get their act together and actually \npass appropriations bills. Once an appropriations bill is passed, the \nEnd Government Shutdowns Act would not apply.\n\n  This seems to me to be a really logical bipartisan commonsense \nsolution to the problem that we are facing here. Again, the problem is \nCongress is not doing its work. We are not getting these appropriations \nbills done. It is not for lack of work in the committees this year. \nAgain, all 12 bills were reported out of committee. I believe the same \nis true in the House. Yet we cannot get here on the floor of the Senate \nthe 60 votes needed to come up with the ability to proceed to these \nappropriations bills. It is called a filibuster. They are being \nfilibustered. We are not even debating them. This is just wrong. I \nthink, again, the way to get around that is to say: OK, if you want to \ntry to block these bills, what is going to happen is we are going to \nhave automatic spending from last year with no increases--in fact, \ndecreases--and decreasing more over time, until Congress gets its act \ntogether and actually passes this legislation.\n  This idea is so commonsense that when we had a vote on it a couple of \nyears ago, when I was able to bring it\n\n[[Page S6965]]\n\nup for a vote--and we will see tonight whether I am permitted to do \nthat--we actually had 46 Senators support it. Now, not everybody \nsupported it on the Appropriations Committee. Some of them obviously \nhad concerns about it. Not every Republican supported it. There were a \nfew Republicans who didn't support it. By the way, one Republican who \ndidn't support it last time is now a cosponsor of the legislation \nbecause she has looked at it, she has understood the system is not \nworking, and she has been persuaded it is the right way to go. It was \nbipartisan last time. Senator Tester and I were the two cosponsors of \nit.\n  So I hope I will have the opportunity to offer that amendment here \nthis afternoon because I think it makes all the sense in the world. As \nwe are debating a continuing resolution again, the so-called CR--which \nis the wrong way to govern--let's also pass as part of that a new \ndiscipline, a new idea, a new approach that says: Let's not do this \nagain. Let's not ever have the threat of a government shutdown hanging \nover us. Instead, come September 30, if an appropriations bill isn't \ndone, fine, continue the spending from last year, with a slow \nratcheting down of that spending. I think that makes all the sense in \nthe world. It takes away this political football that is being thrown \nback and forth. It takes away the specter for our economy, for our \nbusinesses, and for our families of not knowing whether they are going \nto have this government operation continue after September 30 in \nwhatever area is affecting our economy or those businesses or those \nfamilies. I think it makes a lot of sense, and I think it provides an \nincentive for Congress to get its work done. And Congress should be \ndoing every year all 12 appropriations bills--doing the oversight that \ngoes into that, deciding what gets more money, what gets less money, \nwhat gets thrown out altogether. It doesn't make any sense.\n  In the huge bureaucracy of the vast Federal Government, not every \nprogram is perfect. Let's be honest; a lot of them need reform. If we \ndon't have this process of the power of the purse--the leverage of the \npower of the purse to be able to say ``Prove this program is working,'' \nand when it doesn't, ``We are going to pull the funding away''--you \nlose the ability for Congress to be an effective partner with the \nexecutive branch and the judicial branch the way our Founders set it \nup.\n  Again, Congress alone has the power of the purse. Every dime has to \nbe appropriated by this Congress, and Congress is not doing its job. \nThis amendment, if we put in place this new practice, would be a \ntremendous help to get Congress back on track. It wasn't too long ago \nthat this happened. I have been here almost 5 years now or 4\\1/2\\ \nyears. We haven't had a single year where all the appropriations bills \nwere done. In fact, very few appropriations bills have been voted on at \nall. This year not a single appropriations bill--zero--has come to the \nfloor of the Senate because they have been blocked. They have all come \nout of committee now, but not a single one is allowed to get voted on \nhere in the Senate.\n  I do hope that my own leadership on the Republican side will keep \nbringing these bills up. At least then we have an opportunity to talk \nabout them--what is in the bills and why it is a good idea for us to \nhave the oversight. Again, the reforms to these programs--the spending \ncuts, the spending increases for programs that are working well, the \nelimination altogether of programs that aren't working--we should at \nleast have the opportunity to discuss them and talk about it.\n\n  I was hopeful we would see a colleague from the other side of the \naisle show up or a member of the Appropriations Committee. I was told I \ncould give this little talk at 5, and I had the opportunity to offer \nthis amendment. I will have to come back later and offer it again.\n  I don't know if my colleague from Iowa is planning to speak----\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. No.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, earlier I had the opportunity to talk a \nlittle about the amendment I am about to offer. This is an amendment to \nthe underlying bill, which is a continuing resolution. The amendment \nhas to do with a piece of legislation called the End Government \nShutdowns Act.\n  Excuse me.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to speak for 5 \nminutes in order to finish the conversation that we started earlier \nthis evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I talked about the fact that here we are, \nonce again, without the appropriations bills done and forced to do a \ncontinuing resolution from now until December 11, and that is because \nlater this week, on September 30, when the fiscal year ends and comes \nto a close, we will not have done the appropriations bills. It is not \nthat we haven't done one or two or three; we haven't done any of them, \nand there are 12 of them.\n  I think it is time for us to take a new approach; that is, to have an \nend government shutdowns discipline put before this Congress which \nsays: Any time you get to this point with any of the appropriations \nbills--including now where we have all of them--that we instead have a \ncontinuation of last year's spending but that it ratchets down over \ntime to provide an incentive for all of us in Congress--Democrats and \nRepublicans alike, the Appropriations Committee, and all of us--to get \nour work done and to do our job under the Constitution. The power of \nthe purse is exclusively delegated to the Congress. It will help us to \nget our job done if we had this by having the end government shutdowns \ndiscipline in place.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment and call up my amendment No. 2702, the end government \nshutdowns amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if I understand the Senator's suggestion \ncorrectly, his amendment would create an automatic continuing \nresolution to fund the Federal Government in the event an annual \nappropriations bill is not enacted by the time the fiscal year expires. \nThat may sound harmless enough, but what we are saying is that not only \nis the power of the Senate suspended and put on hold but the \nobligations of the committee system are put under a threat--that unless \nyou complete action on legislation that is referred to the committee of \njurisdiction by a certain time, you are out of business, and whoever \nwants to offer an amendment as a substitute gets to offer that and pass \nit on a majority vote. We are already required to have three-fifths of \nthe Members vote to cut off debate in order to be sure that all \nSenators--not just a bare majority--get to decide the decisions of the \nSenate and get to actively participate in the process by offering \namendments.\n  My friend's amendment abolishes offering any other alternatives for a \nfull debate--unlimited debate--which is why the Senate is here, to cool \ndown the passions of the moment. A Senator might have a good idea and \nwant to change a law, repeal a resolution, deny access to Federal funds \nfor this, that or the other that goes to a State that is very \nimportant, and their interests are just as important.\n  This is a terrible amendment, and it ought to be rejected. I hope the \nSenator will withhold offering the amendment. We can have hearings on \nthis and see what other Senators may think about it, but at first \nblush, this seems like this is an amendment whose time has not come. We \nare not ready to dismantle the rules of the Senate piece by piece. \nWell, we have the right of unlimited debate, and Senators can talk as \nlong as they wish to. We don't have to go through a rules committee to \nget permission or get permission from any other Senator. These are \ndirect responsibilities of individual Senators selected by their States \nto stand up for their interests, not to go to Washington and cave in on \nsomething that might be a good-sounding amendment\n\n[[Page S6966]]\n\nor might have the passions of the moment behind it so that there \nappears to be a wave of support, but until you have a chance to \nseriously consider the individual issues involved, until three-fifths \nof the Senate decides to cut off debate--I strongly object to this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my friend \nand my colleague, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. I look \nforward to talking to him more about this. As I said earlier, 46 \nSenators supported this in the past, including all but two or three \nRepublicans, by the way, and one of them is now a cosponsor of the \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call \nunder rule XXII be waived with respect to today's cloture vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. I wish to \nhave 1 minute in order to debate the matter that is before us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I stand with the Senator from Mississippi. \nWe may be from opposite political parties, but I certainly agree with \nhim that the suggestion by the Senator from Ohio does not serve the \nbest interests of this country.\n  Imagine if his proposal went through and we were faced with \ninadequate funding for medical care for our veterans. I am sorry to say \nthe Senator from Ohio has suggested that we would have last year's \nlevel of funding with potentially a 4-percent cut. It would be the same \nfor fighting fires and the National Institutes of Health. There would \nbe a 4-percent cut in medical research.\n  I think what we are doing, if we accept this approach, is giving up \nour responsibility that the taxpayers sent us to carry out; that is, to \nmake careful choices when it comes to budgets.\n  I just want to be on the record supporting my colleague from \nMississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I hadn't planned to have a debate on \nthis, but I am happy to have one. Let me just be very clear. This is \nabout putting the Appropriations Committee in business, not out of \nbusiness. This is not about cutting spending; it is about forcing \nCongress to get its work done.\n  Here we sit about to pass a continuing resolution because none of the \n12 appropriations bills has been voted on because each of them has been \nblocked in the Senate. The committee has done its work. Yet we can't \nget them to the floor. Yet we have the other side saying: Gosh, this \nwould somehow hurt the process.\n  How can the process be hurt any worse? We want the process to work, \nand that is why 46 of us, on a bipartisan basis, have supported this \nidea. What it says is, if at the end of the day, on September 30, \nappropriations bills have not been passed, then we would simply \ncontinue the spending from last year, and, yes, over time we would \nratchet it down, giving 120 days for the committee to get its act \ntogether that it did not in the previous year when it was supposed to, \nto get these bills done, to do the oversight, and to make the decisions \nabout NIH, as the Senator has said, and to make the decisions about our \nveterans.\n  If we truly want to help our veterans, a CR is not the way to do it. \nThe way to do it is to let the VA bill come to the floor, have a \ndebate, and take the committee's good ideas--and, by the way, it came \nout of committee with a large bipartisan vote. That is how we should be \nlegislating. That is our job. The power of the purse resides \nexclusively with us. Yet once again this year we are not doing our job. \nIt is not that we are just doing a couple of appropriations bills; we \nare not doing a single appropriations bill. I think it is time for us \nto change course and that is what this legislation is about. I am \nsimply saying that in the process of passing the CR, which we now have \nto do, set up a discipline for the future that provides an incentive \nfor us to get our work done so the good work being done by Senator \nCochran and others--including Senator Mikulski--in the Appropriations \nCommittee can come to the floor for a vote, and we can get back to \ngoverning.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request to waive the \nmandatory quorum?\n  Mr. DURBIN. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending \ncloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. \n     719 with an amendment, No. 2689.\n         Mitch McConnell, John Cornyn, Orrin G.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nmotion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. \n719 with amendment No. 2689, offered by the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. \nMcConnell, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

The Senator from Texas.\n\n[[Page S6967]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, there is a reason the American people are \nfed up with Washington. There is a reason the American people are \nfrustrated. The frustration is not simply mild or passing or ephemeral; \nit is volcanic. Over and over again, the American people go to the \nballot box. Over and over again, the American people rise and say: The \ndirection we are going does not make sense; we want change. Over and \nover again, the American people win elections--in 2010, a tidal wave \nelection; in 2014, a tidal wave election. Yet nothing changes in \nWashington.\n  I would like to share with the Presiding Officer and the American \npeople the real story of what is happening in Washington, why it is \nthat our leaders cannot stop bankrupting this country, cannot stop the \nassault on our constitutional rights, cannot stop America's retreat \nfrom leadership in the world. It is a very simple dynamic when you have \ntwo sides allegedly in a political battle, one side that is \nrelentlessly, unshakably committed to its principles and the other side \nthat reflectively surrenders at the outset. The outcome is \nforeordained.\n  I will give President Obama and the Senate Democrats credit. They \nbelieve in principles of Big Government. They believe in this \nrelentless assault on our constitutional rights. They are willing to \ncrawl over broken glass with a knife in between their teeth to fight \nfor those principles. Unfortunately, leadership on my side of the aisle \ndoes not demonstrate the same commitment to principles.\n  How is it, you might wonder, that a preemptive surrender is put in \nplace? Well, it all begins with a relatively innocuous statement: There \nshall be no shutdowns. That is a statement leadership in both Houses--\nRepublican leadership in both Houses has said: We are not going to shut \nthe government down.\n  You can understand--to folks in the private sector, folks at home, \nthat sounds pretty reasonable, except here is the reality in \nWashington. In today's Washington, there are three kinds of votes. No. \n1, there are show votes--votes that are brought up largely to placate \nthe voters, where the outcome is foreordained, where most Republicans \nwill vote one way and most Democrats will vote the other. Republicans \nwill lose, and the conservatives who elected Republican majorities in \nboth Houses are supposed to be thrilled that they have been patted on \nthe head and given their show vote that was destined to lose.\n  We had a vote like that in recent weeks on Planned Parenthood. \nLeadership told us: You should be thrilled. We voted on it. What else \ndo you want?\n  We voted on it in a context where it would never happen. Indeed, it \ndid not.\n  The second kind of vote is a vote that simply grows government, \ndramatically expands spending, and expands corporate welfare. Those \nvotes pass because you get a bipartisan coalition of Republican \nleadership and Democrats, both of whom are convinced that career \npoliticians will get reelected if they keep growing and growing \ngovernment and in particular handing out corporate welfare to giant \ncorporations. Oh boy. If you have the lobbyists on K Street pushing for \nsomething, you can get 60, 70, 80 in this Chamber because Republican \nleadership loves it and Democrats are always willing to grow \ngovernment.\n  Then there is the third kind of vote--votes on must-pass legislation. \nIn an era when one side--the Democratic Party--is adamantly committed \nto continuing down this path that is causing so many millions of \nAmericans to hurt, must-pass votes are the only votes that have real \nconsequence in this Chamber. They typically fall into one of three \ncategories: either a continuing resolution, an omnibus appropriations \nbill, or a debt ceiling increase. All of those three are deemed must-\npass votes. If you actually want to change law, those are the only \nhopes of doing so. But, as I mentioned before, you have one side who \nhas preemptively surrendered.\n\n  Republican leadership has said they will never ever shut down the \ngovernment, and suddenly President Obama understands the easy key to \nwinning every battle: He simply has to utter the word ``shutdown'' and \nRepublican leadership runs to the hills. So President Obama demands of \nCongress: Fund every bit of ObamaCare--100 percent of it--and do \nnothing, zero, for the millions of Americans who are hurting, millions \nof Americans who have lost their jobs, who have lost their health care, \nwho have lost their doctors, who have been forced into part-time work, \nthe millions of young people who have seen their premiums skyrocket.\n  President Obama: You can do nothing for the people who are hurting.\n  Senate Democrats say: We don't care about the people who are hurting. \nWe will do nothing for them.\n  Here is the kicker. President Obama promises: If you try to do \nanything on ObamaCare, I, Barack Obama, will veto funding for the \nentire Federal Government and shut it down.\n  Republican leadership compliantly says: OK. Fine. We will fund \nObamaCare.\n  President Obama then understands he has got a pretty good trump card \nhere he can pull out at any time. So next he says: OK. Republicans, \nfund my unconstitutional Executive amnesty. It is contrary to law. It \nis flouting Federal immigration law. But you, Republicans, fund it \nanyway or else, I, Barack Obama, will veto funding for the entire \nFederal Government and shut it down.\n  Republican leadership says at the outset: OK. We will fund amnesty.\n  Now we turn to Planned Parenthood. Barack Obama--this will surprise \nno one--says: Fund 100 percent of Planned Parenthood with taxpayer \nmoney.\n  Mind you, Planned Parenthood is a private organization. It is not \neven part of the government. But it happens to be politically favored \nby President Obama and the Democrats.\n  Planned Parenthood is also the subject of multiple criminal \ninvestigations for being caught on tape apparently carrying out a \npattern of ongoing felonies. In ordinary times, the proposition that we \nshould not be sending your or my Federal taxpayer money to fund a \nprivate organization that is under multiple criminal investigations--\nthat ought to be a 100-to-0 vote. But, as I mentioned before, Barack \nObama is absolutely committed to his partisan objectives. He is like \nthe Terminator. He never stops. He never gives up. He moves forward and \nforward and forward.\n  So what does he say? If you don't fund this one private organization \nthat is not part of the government, that is under multiple criminal \ninvestigations, I, Barack Obama, will veto funding for the entire \nFederal Government and shut it down.\n  What does Republican leadership say? Well, it will surprise no one. \nRepublican leadership says: We surrender. We will fund Planned \nParenthood.\n  You know, President Obama has negotiated a catastrophic nuclear deal \nwith Iran. Republican leadership goes on television all the time and \nrightly says: This is a catastrophic deal. The consequences are that it \nis the single greatest national security threat to America. Millions of \nAmericans could die.\n  I would suggest that if we actually believed the words that are \ncoming out of our mouths, then we would be willing to use any and all \nconstitutional authority given the Congress to stop a catastrophic deal \nthat sends over $100 billion to Ayatollah Khamenei. Yet President Obama \nsays he will veto the entire budget if we do, and, to the surprise of \nnobody, Republican leadership surrenders.\n  You know, I will draw an analogy. It is as if at a football game, the \nbeginning of the football game the two team captains go out to flip the \ncoin. One team's coach walks out and says: We forfeit. They do it game \nafter game after game right at the coin flip.\n  Leadership says: We forfeit. We surrender. We, Republicans, will fund \nevery single Big Government liberal priority of the Democrats.\n  If an NFL team did that over 16 games, we know what their record \nwould be; it would be 0 and 16. You know, I am pretty sure the fans who \nbought tickets and who went to the game would be pretty ticked off as \nthey watched their coach forfeit over and over again.\n  You want to understand the volcanic frustration with Washington? It \nis that Republican leadership in both Houses will not fight for a \nsingle priority we promised the voters we would fight for when we were \ncampaigning less than a year ago.\n  You know, this past week was a big news week in Washington. The \nSpeaker\n\n[[Page S6968]]\n\nof the House, John Boehner, announced he was going to resign, and there \nwas lots of speculation in the media as to why the Speaker of the House \nresigned. I am going to tell you why he resigned. It is actually a \ndirect manifestation of this disconnect between the voters back home \nand Republican leadership. Speaker Boehner and Leader McConnell \npromised there will be no shutdown. Therefore, they will fund every \nsingle priority of Barack Obama.\n  We are right now voting on what is called a clean CR. I would note it \nis clean only in the parlance of Washington, because what does it do? \nIt funds 100 percent of ObamaCare, 100 percent of Executive amnesty. It \nfunds all of Planned Parenthood, and it funds the Iranian nuclear deal. \nIt is essentially a blank check to Barack Obama. That is not very clean \nto me. That actually sounds like a very dirty funding bill, funding \npriorities that are doing enormous damage.\n  In the Senate the votes were always there for a dirty CR, a CR that \nfunded all of Barack Obama's priorities. The Democrats will all vote \nfor it--heck, of course they will. They have the other side funding \ntheir priorities. Of course, every Democrat will vote for that over and \nover and over and twice on Sunday. The simple reality on the Republican \nside is when leadership joins with the Democrats, about half of the \nRepublican caucus is happy to move over to that side of the aisle. So \nthe votes were always preordained.\n  The motion I made just a moment ago was a motion to table the tree. \nYou remember filling the tree. It is something we heard a lot about in \nthe previous Congress. Harry Reid, the Democratic leader, did it all \nthe time.\n  Senators on this side of the aisle stood over and over and said: It \nis abuse of process. In fact, we even campaigned with our leadership \nsaying: We are going to have an open amendment process. Yet what has \nhappened here is that Majority Leader McConnell has taken a page out of \nLeader Reid's playbook and filled the tree. I moved to table the tree, \nand what you then saw was leadership denying a second.\n  What does ``denying a second'' mean? Denying a recorded vote. Why is \nthat important? When you are breaking the commitments you have made to \nthe men and women who have elected you, the most painful thing in the \nworld is accountability. When you are misleading the men and women who \nshowed up to vote for you, you don't want sunshine making clear that \nyou voted no. A recorded vote means each Senator's name is on it.\n  Now, why did I move to table the tree? Simply to add the amendment \nthat I had, which, No. 1, would have said that not one penny goes to \nPlanned Parenthood, and No. 2, not one penny goes to implementing this \ncatastrophic Iranian nuclear deal unless and until they comply with \nFederal law--the administration complies with Federal law--and hands \nover the full deal, including the side agreements with Iran. What you \nsaw was that Republican leadership desperately does not want a vote on \nthat.\n  Tomorrow I intend to make that motion again. And when I make that \nmotion again, I would encourage those watching to see which Senators \nare here to give a second or not and to vote yea or nay.\n  I would note that when you deny a second, which is truly an \nunprecedented procedural trick--it used to be that was a courtesy that \nwas afforded to all Senators. Indeed, in the opposing party routinely \nover and over when a Democrat or Republican asked for a second, \neveryone raised their hand. But leadership has discovered: We can do \nthis in the dark of the night.\n  But I would encourage those watching to see, No. 1, when this motion \nis offered again, who shows up to offer a second and who either doesn't \nraise his hand or just doesn't come to the floor.\n  One of the ways you avoid accountability is you are somehow somewhere \nelse doing something very important instead of actually showing up for \nthe battle that is waging right here and now.\n  But I would also encourage people to watch very carefully what \nhappens after that. After that you have a voice vote. A voice vote is \nstill a vote. Let's be clear. Standing on the floor, there were two \nSenators--Senator Lee and I--who voted aye, who voted to table the tree \nand take up the amendment barring funding for Planned Parenthood and \nbarring funding for this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal.\n  The remaining Senators on the Republican side--Leader McConnell, Whip \nCornyn, Senator Alexander, and Senator Cotton--those four Senators \nloudly voted no. It is still a vote, even though it is not a recorded \nvote. It is a vote on the Senate floor.\n  So why did Speaker Boehner resign? Well, I mentioned to you that the \nvotes were always cooked here. The Democrats plus Republican leadership \nand the votes they bring with them ensure plenty of votes for a dirty \nCR, a CR that funds ObamaCare, that funds amnesty, that funds Planned \nParenthood, that funds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal. But the \nHouse was always the bulwark.\n  The Presiding Officer will remember in 2013 when we had a fight over \nObamaCare. The Presiding Officer was serving in the House at the time. \nIn that fight we never had the votes in the Senate. Actually, the \nSenate was under control of the Democrats. They were going to do \neverything they could to defend ObamaCare regardless of the millions of \npeople who were hurt.\n  But the House was the bulwark in that fight, and in particular there \nwas a core of 40 or 50 strong, principled conservatives who cared \ndeeply about honoring the commitments they made to the men and women \nwho elected them. That was always the strength we had in that fight.\n  You know, it has been interesting reading some of the press coverage, \nspeculating that there would be some magic parliamentary trick that \nwould somehow stop this corrupt deal. Well, in the Senate there are no \nmagic parliamentary tricks. When you have the Democrats plus Republican \nleadership and a chunk of the Republicans, those votes can roll over \nany parliamentary trick you might use. Even with the Blood Moon we just \nhad, there are no mystical powers that allow you to roll over them.\n  But in the House we still have those 30, 40, 50 strong conservatives. \nSo how is it that Speaker Boehner and Leader McConnell could promise \nthere will never, ever be a shutdown? Because, I believe, Speaker \nBoehner has decided to cut a deal with Leader Nancy Pelosi, the leader \nof the Democrats, that this dirty CR is going to be passed out of the \nSenate and is going to go to the House. The Speaker is going to take it \nup on the floor and pass it with all the Democrats--just as Leader \nMcConnell did--and a handful of Republicans who will go with Republican \nleadership. A very significant percentage of Republicans will vote no. \nBut here is the problem: Speaker Boehner has done that more than once. \nIn this instance, there were too many Republicans who were tired of \nseeing their leadership lead the Democrats rather than lead the \nRepublican Party.\n  I believe if Speaker Boehner had done that--had passed a dirty CR \nfunding Planned Parenthood, funding this Iranian nuclear deal--he would \nhave lost his speakership. A Member of the House had introduced a \nmotion to vacate the Chair because House Republicans were fed up with \ntheir leader not leading--at least not leading their party, leading the \nDemocratic Party.\n  So Speaker Boehner faced a conundrum. If he did what he and Leader \nMcConnell promised, which is to fund all of Barack Obama's priorities, \nhe would have lost his job. And so what did he do? He announced that he \nis resigning as Speaker and resigning as a Member of Congress. That is \nunsurprising, but it also telegraphs the deal that he has just cut. It \nis a deal to surrender and join with the Democrats. Notice he said he \nis going to stay a month. He is going to stay a month in order to join \nwith the Democrats and fund Barack Obama's priorities.\n  Now let's talk about some of the substantive issues that we ought to \nbe talking about. Let's start with Planned Parenthood. In the past \ncouple of months, a series of videos have come out about Planned \nParenthood. To some of the people watching this, you may never have \nseen the videos. Why is that? Because the mainstream media has engaged \nin a virtual media blackout on them: ABC, NBC, CBS, the last thing they \nwant to do is show these videos.\n  If you watch FOX News, you can see the videos. But the mainstream \nmedia, in the great tradition of Pravda, wants\n\n[[Page S6969]]\n\nto make sure the citizenry doesn't see what is in these videos. I would \nencourage every American--Republican or Democrat--regardless of where \nyou fall on the right to life, even--and, in fact, especially--if you \nconsider yourself pro-choice--to just watch these videos. Go online and \nwatch them and ask yourself: Are these my values? Is this what I \nbelieve?\n  These videos show senior officials from Planned Parenthood laughing, \nsipping chardonnay and callously harvesting and selling the body parts \nof unborn children over and over and over. One senior official was \ncaught on video laughing and saying she hopes she sells enough body \nparts of unborn children to buy herself a Lamborghini. Again, I would \nsuggest to just ask yourself: Are these my values?\n  In another video a lab tech describes a little baby boy--unborn, \naborted, about 2 pounds, his heart still beating. She was instructed to \ninsert scissors under his chin to cut open the face of this little boy \nand harvest his brain because the brain was valuable. Planned \nParenthood could sell the brain.\n  This is something out of ``Brave New World.'' These are human beings. \nThat little boy had a heart that was still beating, had a brain that \nwas being harvested. He had a soul given to him by God Almighty. He was \nmade in the image of God.\n  We are now a nation that harvests the body parts of little baby boys \nand girls. It is the very definition of inhumanity to treat children \nlike agriculture, to be grown and killed for their body parts, to be \nsold for profit. There is a reason that the media and the Democrats \ndon't want these videos shown, because anyone watching these videos \nwill be horrified.\n  But they are not just horrific; they are also prima facie evidence of \ncriminal activity. There are multiple Federal statutes--criminal \nstatutes--that Planned Parenthood appears to be violating, perhaps on a \ndaily basis. The first and most direct is a prohibition on selling the \nbody parts of unborn children for a profit. Federal criminal law makes \nthat a felony with up to 10 years of jail time.\n  Now these videos show them very clearly selling body parts. They also \nshow them bartering a price. They will argue it wasn't for a profit. \nBut you watch these videos. You watch the undercover buyer saying: How \nmuch will you give me for them? And you see the Planned Parenthood \nofficial saying: Well, how much can I get? I don't want to bargain \nagainst myself.\n  On its face, that is evidence of bargaining for a profit. If you want \nthe highest price you can get, it is not tied to your costs. It is tied \nto whatever dollars, whatever revenue you can bring in. Planned \nParenthood is the largest abortion provider in the country. As another \none of these videos reflects, it is a volume business--Planned \nParenthood--taking the lives of unborn children and then selling them--\napparently for profit. It is also a Federal criminal offense to alter \nthe means of an abortion for the purpose of harvesting the organs of \nthe unborn child. That is a separate criminal offense. On video after \nvideo, you see Planned Parenthood officials saying: OK. What parts \nwould you like? We can perform a different abortion depending on what \nparts you want us to harvest. On the videos they essentially admit to \nthis crime. They are filmed in the act.\n\n  There is the third criminal offense that provides that you cannot \nharvest the organs of an unborn child without informed consent from the \nmother. Yet again these videos seem to indicate that Planned Parenthood \ntreats informed consent as a technicality that is sometimes complied \nwith and sometimes ignored.\n  Now, I will say as an aside that ordinarily, when a national \norganization is caught on film committing a pattern of felonies, the \nnext steps are predictable: The Department of Justice opens an \ninvestigation; the FBI shows up and seizes their records. Everything on \nthose videos suggests those felonies are still occurring today.\n  What does it say about the Obama Justice Department that no one on \nthe face of the planet believes there is any chance the Justice \nDepartment would even begin to investigate Planned Parenthood? What \ndoes it say about the most lawless partisan Department of Justice that \nthere is this group that is a political ally of the President, so that \nis apparently all that matters. If it is an ally of the President, it \ndoesn't matter that they are videotaped committing a felony. The \nDepartment of Justice will not even look at it.\n  I am an alumnus of the U.S. Department of Justice. I was an Associate \nDeputy Attorney General. I spent much of my adult life working in law \nenforcement. The Department of Justice has a long, distinguished record \nof remaining outside of partisan politics, of staying above the \npartisan fray, of being blind to party or ideology and simply enforcing \nthe law and the Constitution. I am sorry to say that under Eric Holder \nand Loretta Lynch, the Department of Justice has completely besmirched \nthat tradition.\n  No one remotely believes the Obama Justice Department will even begin \nto investigate this pattern of felonies. You don't see Democrats \nsuggesting it. No one in the media suggests it. And by the way, if this \nwere a Republican administration and the entity that admitted to a \npattern of felonies was a private entity that supported Republicans, \nyou would see on CBS, NBC, and ABC an indictment clock every night. You \nwould see the anchors saying: When will this investigation be opened? \nWhen will they be indicted? Instead, the media pretends these videos \ndon't exist.\n  In the face of what appears to be a national criminal enterprise, we \nare faced here with a much simpler question: Will we continue to pay \nfor it? Will we continue to pay for it with your and my tax dollars? \nWill we send $500 million a year to a private organization to use to \nfund this ongoing criminal organization?\n  What is the position of the Democrats? Hear no evil, see no evil. \nThey do not care. What Democrat do you see calling for the enforcement \nof criminal laws against Planned Parenthood? What Democrat do you hear \nsaying, at a minimum, let's not send taxpayer money to fund this? Not \none. Not a single Democrat stood up and said that.\n  Let me ask you, Mr. President, what happens if Planned Parenthood \ngets indicted? Because even though the U.S. Department of Justice under \nPresident Obama has become little more than a partisan arm of the \nDemocratic National Committee, there are State and local prosecutors \nwho are investigating Planned Parenthood right now. If Planned \nParenthood is indicted, will the Democrats maintain their wall of \nsilence and say: We are going to continue to fund them under \nindictment. By all indications, that answer is yes. We haven't heard a \nsingle Democrat say: Well, if they are indicted, then we will stop.\n  The response from our leadership is that we can't win this fight. \nThat is their response. They say: Well, we can't win the Planned \nParenthood fight. Why? Because we don't have 60 votes; because we don't \nhave 67 votes. If that is the standard, then the Republican leadership \nstandard is that we will do only what Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi \napprove of. That is what it means.\n  You want to understand why the American people are frustrated? We \nwere told: If only we had a Republican House of Representatives, then \nthings would be different. In 2010, millions of us rose up in \nincredible numbers and won an historic tidal wave election. The \nPresiding Officer was a youth pastor, called to minister, yet he stood \nup and said: My country is in crisis. I am going to step forward and \nserve. The 2010 election was historic, yet very little changed.\n  Then we were told: OK. We have a House of Representatives, but the \nproblem is the Senate. As long as Harry Reid is majority leader, we \ncan't do anything. Over and over again Washington gray beards would go \non television, and in gravelly tones they would say: You cannot govern \nwith one-half of one-third of government. The House of Representatives \nis not enough, but if we had the Senate, then things would be \ndifferent. The problem is Harry Reid.\n  The Presiding Officer will recall during the fight over ObamaCare a \nnumber of Members of this body--Republicans--said: No, no, no, no. We \ncan't fight on ObamaCare. We have to wait until we have a Republican \nSenate to fight. So the American people obliged. In 2014, millions of \nus rose up for the second tidal wave election in a period of 4 years. \nWe won nine Senate seats.\n\n[[Page S6970]]\n\nWe retired Harry Reid as majority leader. We won the largest majority \nin the House of Representatives since the 1920s.\n  It has been now over 9 months since we have had Republican majorities \nin both Houses, and I ask: What exactly have those Republican \nmajorities accomplished?\n  I have asked that question all over the country in townhalls. I have \nnever been at a townhall where the response, spontaneous, was not \nabsolutely nothing. That is true in every State I visit.\n  And sadly, my response over and over again is: You know, it's worse \nthan that. I wish the answer were absolutely nothing. It would have \nbeen better if the Republican majorities had done absolutely nothing \nbecause what, in fact, have they done? Well, the very first thing that \nhappened, right after that election in November, is we came back to \nWashington, and Republican leadership joined up with Harry Reid and the \nDemocrats and passed a trillion dollar CR omnibus bill that was filled \nwith pork, corporate welfare, and grew government, grew the debt.\n  Then Republican leadership took the lead in funding ObamaCare. Then \nRepublican leadership took the lead in funding Executive amnesty. Then \nRepublican leadership took the lead in funding Planned Parenthood. And \nthen, astonishingly, Republican leadership took the lead in confirming \nLoretta Lynch as Attorney General.\n  Now, I ask: Which one of those decisions is one iota different from \nwhat would have happened with Harry Reid and the Democrats in charge of \nthis Chamber? Those decisions are identical.\n  And I would note, by the way, with Loretta Lynch, the Republican \nmajority could have defeated that nomination. The Senate majority \nleader could have done so. She looked at the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, and she looked at the Senate, and when asked how she would \ndiffer from Eric Holder's Justice Department--the most lawless and \npartisan Justice Department we would ever see--and she said: No way \nwhatsoever. When asked to point to a single instance in which she would \nbe willing to stand up to President Obama to stop his lawlessness, to \nstop his abuse of power, she could not identify any circumstance in \nwhich she would ever stand up to the President who appointed her. \nAttorneys general from both parties have done that, for centuries.\n  Now, with Eric Holder, the Senate could be forgiven because his \nlawlessness manifested primarily after he was confirmed. With Loretta \nLynch, she told us beforehand. She looked us in the eyes and said: Hey, \nI am going to do exactly what my predecessor has done. And Republican \nleadership confirmed her anyway.\n  Is it any wonder the American people are frustrated out of their \nminds? We keep winning elections, and the people we put in office don't \ndo what they said they would do.\n  Now, some people across the country ask me: Is Republican leadership \njust not very capable? Are they not that competent or are they \nunwilling to fight? Mr. President, it is neither. They are actually \nquite competent, and they are willing to fight. The question becomes \nwhat they are fighting for.\n  There is a disconnect right now. If you or I go to our home State and \nto any gathering of citizens and we put up a white board and we ask the \ncitizens in the room to give the top priorities they think Republican \nmajorities in Congress should be focusing on, and we wrote the 20 \npriorities that came from the citizens of Oklahoma or the citizens of \nTexas or, for that matter, the citizens of any of the 50 States, those \ntop 20 priorities--at least 18 of them--would appear nowhere on the \nleadership's priority list.\n  On the other hand, if you drive just down the street in Washington to \nK Street--K Street is the street in Washington where the lobbyists \nprimarily reside, where their offices are--and you get a gathering of \ncorporate lobbyists that represent giant corporations and ask them \ntheir top priorities, the list that comes out will not just bear \npassing similarity but will be identical to the priorities of the \nRepublican leadership. That's the disconnect.\n  Do you know why we are not here fighting on this? Because not giving \ntaxpayer money to Planned Parenthood is not among the priorities of the \nlobbyists on K Street, so leadership is not interested in doing it. \nThat is the disconnect.\n  Leadership does know how to fight. Just a couple of months ago, in \ndealing with the Export-Import Bank, we saw leadership in both Chambers \ngo to extraordinary lengths with Herculean procedural steps to \nreauthorize a classic example of corporate welfare--hundreds of \nbillions of dollars of taxpayer-guaranteed loans to giant corporations. \nNow, for that, leadership is incentivized because those corporations \nhire lobbyists and those lobbyists distribute checks, typically by the \nwheelbarrow.\n  There is no incentive greater in this body than getting reelected, \nand the view of leadership is that you get reelected by raking in the \ncash. How do you think we have gotten an $18 trillion national debt? \nBecause the way you reach bipartisan compromise in this body today, in \nthe broken world of Washington, is you grow and grow and grow \ngovernment, and you sit around in a room and say: I will spend for your \npriority, your priority, your priority--another trillion dollars and we \nare done.\n  The only people to lose are your children and mine. The only people \nto lose are the next generations who find themselves mired deeper and \ndeeper and deeper in debt. I think of my little girls Caroline and \nCatherine. They are 7 and 4. If we don't stop what we are doing, your \nchildren and my children will face a debt so crushing they will not be \nable to spend in the future for the priorities of the future--for their \nneeds, for their wants, for whatever crises come up that the next \ngeneration confronts. They will spend their whole lives simply working \nto pay off the debts racked up by their deadbeat parents and \ngrandparents. No generation in history has ever done this to their \nchildren and grandchildren. Our parents didn't do it to us. Their \nparents didn't do it to them. The reason is the corruption of this \ntown, and it boils down to a simple proposition: The Democrats are \nwilling to do anything to push their priorities, and the Republicans, \nthe leadership, are not listening to the men and women who elected us.\n\n  But it is actually an even deeper problem than that. On the \nDemocratic side, the major donors that fund the Democratic Party, they \ndon't despise their base. The billionaires who write the giant checks \nthat fund President Obama, Hillary Clinton, and the Democrats on that \nside of the aisle don't despise the radical gay rights movement or the \nradical environmentalist movement or all the people who knock on doors \nand get Democrats elected. The simple reality is a very large \npercentage of the Republican donors actively despise our base--actively \ndespise the men and women who showed up and voted you and me into \noffice. I can tell you, when you sit down and talk with a New York \nbillionaire Republican donor--and I have talked with quite a few New \nYork billionaire Republican donors, California Republican donors--their \nquestions start out as follows. First of all, you have to come out for \ngay marriage, you need to be pro-choice, and you need to support \namnesty. That is where the Republican donors are. You wonder why \nRepublicans will not fight on any of these issues? Because the people \nwriting the checks agree with the Democrats.\n  Now mind you, the people who show up at the polls who elected you and \nme and who elected this Republican majority--far too many of the \nRepublican donors look down on those voters as a bunch of ignorant \nhicks and rubes. It is why leadership likes show votes.\n  It wasn't too long ago when the Washington cartel was able to mask it \nall with a show vote or two, and they told the rubes back home: See, we \nvoted on it; we just don't have the votes.\n  When I was first elected to this body, many times I heard more senior \nSenators saying some variation of the following: Now, Ted, that is what \nyou tell folks back home. You don't actually do it.\n  Here is what has changed. The voters have gotten more informed. They \nnow understand the difference between show votes and a real vote. They \nunderstand the vote we had 1 week ago on Planned Parenthood was \ndesigned to lose, to placate those silly folks who think we shouldn't \nbe sending taxpayer funds to a criminal organization that is selling \nthe body parts of unborn children. But on the actual vote that could\n\n[[Page S6971]]\n\nchange policy, leadership has no interest in fighting whatsoever.\n  In the past couple of weeks, one of my colleagues sent me a letter \nthat really embodied the leadership message. This letter said: \n``Explain to me how you get 67 votes to defund Planned Parenthood. If \nyou can't produce 67 votes, I won't support it.'' If that is our \nstandard, then we should all be honest with the men and women who \nelected us: We do not have 67 Republican votes in this Chamber, and \nthere is no realistic prospect of our getting 67 votes any time in the \nforeseeable future. If the standard is, unless we get 67 votes, \nRepublican leadership will support no policy issue, then each of us \nwhen we run should tell the voters: If you vote for me, I will support \nwhatever policy agenda Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi decide because that \nis my standard. If I don't have 67 votes--do you ever recall Harry Reid \nand the Democrats saying: How can we get Republican votes? No. Their \nside is absolutely committed to their principles. You don't see them \nholding back at all.\n  If the standard is, how do we get 67 votes, name one thing that \nleadership will fight for. Well, the answer I mentioned, the three \ntypes of votes are they will fight for big government, they will fight \nto grow government, and they will fight to expand corporate welfare. \nWell, that can indeed get 67 votes. But I have never been to a townhall \nonce where citizens said to me: The problem is we don't have enough \ncorporate welfare. I need more subsidies for Big Business. If 100 \npercent of the agenda of Republican leadership is more subsidies for \nBig Business, what the heck are we doing in the Senate in the first \nplace? That certainly wasn't why I ran, and I know it wasn't why you \nran either. You don't have to win every fight, you don't have to fight \nevery fight, but you do have to stand for something.\n  Let's look beyond Planned Parenthood for a minute. Let's look to \nIran. Of all the decisions the Obama administration has made, there may \nbe none more damaging than this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal. If \nthis deal goes through, there will be three consequences: No. 1, the \nObama administration will become, quite literally, the world's leading \nfinancier of radical Islamic terrorists. Now, when I said that a couple \nmonths ago, President Obama got very, very upset. He said it was \nridiculous that I would say such a thing, but despite attacking me \ndirectly, President Obama didn't actually endeavor to refute the \nsubstance of what I said.\n  So let's review the facts: Fact No. 1, Iran is today the world's \nleading state sponsor of terrorism. That fact is undisputed even by \nthis administration. Fact No. 2, if this deal goes through, over $100 \nbillion will go directly to Iran to the Ayatollah Khamenei. Fact No. 3, \nif that happens, billions of those dollars will go to Hamas, to \nHezbollah, to the Houthis, to radical Islamic terrorists across the \nglobe who will use those billions to murder Americans, to murder \nIsraelis, and to murder Europeans.\n  It is worth remembering, 14 years ago this month, the horrific \nterrorist attack that was carried out on September 11. Osama bin Laden \nhated America, but he never had billions of dollars. He never had $100 \nbillion. The Ayatollah Khamenei hates America every bit as much as \nOsama bin Laden did, and this administration is giving him control of \nover $100 billion. Imagine what bin Laden could have done. Look at the \ndamage he did with 19 terrorists carrying box cutters. Now imagine that \nsame zealotry with billions of dollars behind it. The consequences of \nthis deal could easily be another terrorist attack that dwarfs \nSeptember 11 in scale, that kills far more than the roughly 3,000 lives \nthat were snuffed out. Who in their right mind would send over $100 \nbillion to a theocratic zealot who chants ``Death to America''?\n  A second consequence of his catastrophic deal is that we are \nabandoning four hostages--four American hostages--in Iranian jails: \nPastor Saeed Abedini, an American citizen whose wife Naghmeh lives in \nIdaho. I have visited with Naghmeh many times. Pastor Saeed has two \nlittle kids who desperately want their daddy to come home. Pastor Saeed \nwas sentenced to 8 years in prison for the crime of preaching the \nGospel. Just last week was the 3-year anniversary of Pastor Saeed's \nimprisonment. Reports are that he is being horribly mistreated, that \nhis health is failing, and yet President Obama cannot bring himself to \nutter the words ``Pastor Saeed Abedini''--$100 billion to the Ayatollah \nKhamenei, and Pastor Saeed Abedini remains in prison.\n  Also in prison is Amir Hekmati, an American marine the President has \nabandoned. Also in prison is Jason Rezaian, a Washington Post \nreporter--I note to the reporters in the Gallery, a colleague of \nyours--abandoned by President Obama in an Iranian prison, thrown in \njail for doing his job, reporting on the news--and Robert Levinson, \nwhose whereabouts remain unknown.\n  Why is the President refusing to even utter their names?\n  The third consequence of this deal is this deal will only accelerate \nIran acquiring nuclear weapons.\n  The administration claims the deal will prevent Iran from acquiring \nnuclear weapons. Why? Because they promised not to do it. We have \nlearned from Iran, they break their promises over and over and over \nagain. And what we do know is that they will have an extra $100 billion \nto develop nuclear weapons. Now, I will say the administration \nlaughingly suggested: Well, they will use that on infrastructure, to \nrebuild their roads, to rebuild their energy industry. Right now they \nare sending vast sums to Hamas and Hezbollah, funding terrorism across \nthe world, and they have those same infrastructure needs. With another \n$100 billion, you don't think they are going to funnel an awful lot of \nit to developing nuclear weapons?\n  I would point out, it is not by accident that the Ayatollah Khamenei \nrefers to Israel as the Little Satan and America as the Great Satan. \nThis is the one threat on the face of the Earth that poses a real \npossibility of millions of Americans being murdered in the flash of an \neye.\n  Everything I am saying the Republican leadership has said over and \nover again. Yet Republican leadership refuses to enforce the terms of \nthe Iran review legislation--Federal law that the administration is \ndefying by not handing over the entire deal. I have laid out a clear \npath, a detailed path that leadership can follow to stop this deal, and \nleadership refuses to do so. Instead, we had a show vote that was \ndesigned to lose, and it did exactly what we expected. The Democrats, \nby and large, put party loyalty above the national security of this \ncountry, above standing with our friend and ally the nation of Israel, \nabove protecting the lives of millions of Americans.\n  If we truly believed what so many of us have said, that this poses \nthe risk of murdering millions of Americans, is there any higher \npriority? The most powerful constitutional tool Congress has is the \npower of the purse. If we had the ability to stop this deal--and we \ndon't--and millions of Americans die, how do we explain that to the men \nand women who elected us?\n  I am not advocating that we fight willy-nilly. I am advocating that \nwe fight on things that matter. Don't give $500 million to Planned \nParenthood, a corrupt organization that is taking the lives of vast \nnumbers of unborn children and selling their body parts, in a criminal \nconspiracy, directly contrary to Federal law. Don't give $100 billion \nto the Ayatollah Khamenei, who seeks to murder millions. In both \ninstances, those are defending life. Yet Republican leadership is not \nwilling to lift a finger. If only all the people who might be murdered \nby a nuclear weapon could create a PAC in Washington and hire some \nlobbyists, maybe leadership would listen to them. But the truckdriver \nat home, the waitress at home, the schoolteacher at home, the pastor, \nthe police officer, the working men and women--the Washington cartel \ndoes not listen to them.\n\n  I will note where this deal is headed. In December, when this dirty \ncontinuing resolution expires, leadership is already foreshadowing that \nthey plan to bust the budget caps. Why? We talked about it at the \nbeginning. Barack Obama has discovered that when he says the word \n``shutdown,'' the Republican leadership screams, surrenders, and runs \nto the hills. Obama, understanding that quite well, says: If you don't \nbust the budget caps, I will shut the government down.\n  In this bizarre process, Republican leadership will blame whatever \nObama\n\n[[Page S6972]]\n\ndoes on other Republicans. You noticed how much energy leader McConnell \ndevotes to attacking conservatives? You notice how much energy Speaker \nBoehner devotes to attacking conservatives? Just yesterday the Speaker \nof the House went on national television, and on national television he \ndirected an obscene epithet at me personally. He is welcome to insult \nwhomever he likes. I don't intend to reciprocate. But when has \nleadership ever shown that level of venom, that level of animosity to \nPresident Obama and the Democrats who are bankrupting this country, who \nare destroying the Constitution, who are endangering the future of our \nchildren and grandchildren, who are retreating from leadership and the \nworld, and who have created an environment that has led to the rise of \nradical Islamic terrorists?\n  One of the dynamics we have seen in fight after fight is that Harry \nReid and the Democrats sit back and laugh. Why? Because it is \nRepublican leadership that leads the onslaught, attacking \nconservatives, saying: No, you can't, and we will not do anything to \nstop ObamaCare. No, you can't, and we will not do anything to stop \namnesty. No, you can't, and we will not do anything to stop Planned \nParenthood. No, you can't, and we will not do anything to stop Iran \nfrom acquiring nuclear weapons.\n  If Republican leadership really believes we can accomplish nothing, \nthen why does it matter if you have a Republican House or Senate? Every \n2 years come October, November, we tell the voters it matters \nintensely. To paraphrase the immortal words of Hillary Clinton, what \ndifference does it make if the standard for Republican leadership is, \nanything that gets 67 votes we will support. That means Harry Reid and \nNancy Pelosi remain the de facto leaders of the Senate and the House.\n  I would note, by the way, if leadership goes through with their \nsuggestion to bust the budget caps, they will have done something \nastonishing. Historically, the three legs of the conservative stool \nhave been fiscal conservatives, social conservatives, and national \nsecurity conservatives. Between Planned Parenthood, Iran, and the \nbudget caps, leadership will have managed to abandon all three. No \nwonder the American people are frustrated. No wonder the American \npeople do not understand why leadership isn't listening to them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's postcloture time has expired.\n  Mr. CRUZ.

Mr. President, I rise to recognize the 50th anniversary of \nthe Southern Nevada Group of the Sierra Club.\n  The Southern Nevada Group of the Sierra Club was established in 1965 \nand encompasses Clark, Lincoln, Nye, Esmerelda, and White Pine \nCounties. During that time, its membership has helped shape Nevada's \nfuture by honoring the pristine beauty of Nevada.\n  Today, Nevadans and visitors from around the country travel to \nsouthern Nevada to see the life, history, and culture of the Silver \nState. The Southern Nevada Group of the Sierra Club has worked \ntirelessly to protect places, such as the Great Basin National Park, \nthe Spring Mountain National Recreation Area, the Sloan Canyon and Red \nRock Canyon National Conservation Areas, and the recently designated \nTule Springs Fossil Beds and Basin and Range National Monuments. These \nspecial places have inspired tens of millions of people and will \ncontinue to inspire our children and grandchildren. The Sierra Club has \nalso been key to the protection of millions of acres of pristine \nlandscapes as wilderness in southern and eastern Nevada. Today, the \nSierra Club's dedication to Nevada continues in its efforts to protect \ntreasured sites that highlight Nevada's unique geological and cultural \nhistory, including Gold Butte.\n  These wonderful parts of Nevada are owned by everyone, and their \nprotection has helped solidify Nevada's status as a world class \ndestination. The progress the Southern Nevada Group has made to protect \nthese wonderful parts of Nevada continues through its work to fully \nrealize Nevada's clean energy potential. These efforts notably began \nwith opposition to the construction of new coal plants in White Pine \nCounty. More recently, the Southern Nevada Group teamed with the Moapa \nBand of Paiutes and others to support meaningful legislation that \nresulted in the closure of the Reid-Gardner coal plant and its \nreplacement with clean energy.\n  I have been gratified to work with the Southern Nevada Group on so \nmany of these efforts and was honored earlier this year to receive the \nSierra Club's Edgar Wayburn Award. I commend the Southern Nevada Group \nof the Sierra Club on their 50 years of success and wish the \norganization continued success in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/28/senate-section/article/S6973-4", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6973-S6974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            RECOGNIZING THE 160TH BIRTHDAY OF MILLER BREWING\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, as the son of a former general \nmanager of a brewery and a loyal customer I wish to acknowledge the \nfounding of a true American success story, Miller Brewing, and to \ncongratulate it on the occasion of its historic 160th anniversary \ncelebration.\n  In 1855, just a few years after Wisconsin joined the Union, 30-year \nold Frederick J. Miller brought his brewing passion from his native \nGermany to the United States, taking over what was then the Plank Road \nBrewery in Milwaukee. Now, 160 years later, Milwaukee is known \nworldwide as Brew City, and the company he founded is celebrating the \naccomplishments of this young, brash entrepreneurial brewmaster who \nturned a pocketful of yeast into a global beer brewing icon. From its \nfounding, through its expansions and partnerships, Miller Brewing has \nbecome a quintessential success story, having forever woven itself into \nthe fabric of American society and culture.\n  As Miller Brewing celebrates its 160th anniversary, guests from \naround the world have come to Milwaukee to hear and read stories of a \nyoung Frederick Miller. Each week the company is highlighting a \ndifferent era from Miller's storied past, and visitors to the historic \nMiller Valley plant can even taste a sample of 1855 celebration Lager \nduring brewery tours. Earlier this month, I toured Miller's Milwaukee \nbrewery and enjoyed some of the same sights and smells I experienced as \na young boy hanging around\n\n[[Page S6974]]\n\nthe small brewery managed by my father.\n  After decades of continued success, Miller joined with Colorado-based \nCoors in 2008, thus combining more than 300 years of brewing heritage. \nOperating out of eight breweries in eight States, the most talented and \nprofessional brewmasters in the world now provide beer drinkers in \nAmerica with a portfolio of beers that are second to none. But, Miller \nBrewing and MillerCoors are more than the product they make; they are \ngreater than the sum of their parts. They are economic engines in \nWisconsin, Colorado, and throughout the country, providing family-\nsupporting jobs to more than 8,000 employees nationwide. Because of \ntheir presence, over $5 billion is injected in the economy each year, \nmoney that is spent on goods and services, and which helps support the \nbusinesses of thousands of suppliers. Miller pays more than $1 billion \nannually in State, local and Federal taxes.\n  As they celebrate the past 160 years, current employees are taking \nnote of the efforts made by the earliest employees of Miller Brewing, \nwho knew the importance of civic leadership and sustainable business \npractices. We see those traditions continue today, as Miller Brewing \nand MillerCoors remain a deeply rooted presence in the communities in \nwhich they brew and sell their beer. Support of local charities and \nresponsible consumption programs, and efforts to reduce water and \nenergy usage and waste are only a few examples of how the company \nproves itself to be a valuable corporate citizen.\n  Frederick J. Miller arrived in Milwaukee with a passion and ambition. \nHe committed himself to brew ``confoundedly good beers'' with \n``uncompromising quality.'' After founding Miller Brewing Company in \n1855, he worked hard to achieve that goal. For the past 160 years, \nmillions of Americans have reaped the benefits of his efforts, one \nbottle, one can, or one glass at a time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/28/senate-section/article/S6974-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING BEVERLY C. DAGGETT\n\n Mr. KING. Mr. President, today we solemnly remember Senator \nBeverly Daggett. A dedicated public servant, Beverly died on September \n6, 2015, 3 days before her 70th birthday, after a valiant, lifelong \nbattle with kidney disease. Bev will be remembered for her dedication \nto her family, community, and State. The State of Maine has lost a \nwoman of true integrity, and she will be greatly missed.\n  Bev was an exceptionally intelligent and hard-working woman who found \ncountless successes in life. She began her tenure in the Maine House of \nRepresentatives in 1987 as a member of the 113th legislature. She \nserved in the Maine House of Representatives from 1987 through 1996 and \nin the Maine Senate from 1997 through 2004. In the Senate, Bev rose to \nleadership as the Senate Democratic leader in 2000. She worked closely \nwith members on both sides of the aisle to achieve the historic power-\nsharing deal that stemmed from the Senate's first ever partisan tie.\n  In 2002, in recognition of her strong leadership, her colleagues \nelected Beverly Daggett to serve as the first woman President of the \nMaine Senate.\n  Bev's dedication to community was obvious as she served in countless \nways other than her political activities. Senator Daggett was also \nKennebec County Commissioner for several terms. She served for 25 years \non the Board of Crisis and Counseling, culminating in her role as board \nchair. She also sat on the school board and was a member of the Green \nStreet United Methodist Church, where she was a substitute organist. \nAbove all else, Beverly was a devoted wife, mother, and friend.\n  I had the honor of working with Beverly during my time as the \nGovernor of Maine and witnessed firsthand her strong leadership and \ncommitment to the betterment of Maine. I am deeply saddened by her \npassing and would like to join her friends and family in reflecting on \nher many life accomplishments and honor her memory.\n  Beverly will be remembered for her deep and abiding faith, her \nleadership, encouragement of those around her, ceaseless advocacy for \nthose without a voice, sense of humor, and wisdom. Her firm devotion to \nthe betterment of Maine will never be forgotten. I, along with all the \npeople of Maine, am thankful for her immeasurable contributions to our \nState and the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/28/senate-section/article/S6974-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 4:33 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 348.

A bill to ensure that Social Security contributions made by \nworkers are available to pay all benefits which they have earned; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes today to \ndiscuss the enormous importance of America's most critical safety net \nprogram--Social Security. In particular, I want to talk about the \nSocial Security Disability Insurance program and introduce a proposal \nto secure the financing of Social Security. Of all the strands woven \ntogether in America's safety net, disability insurance is one of the \nmost successful at keeping vulnerable people in Oregon and across the \ncountry out of poverty. It is a vital lifeline for people who suffer \nfrom catastrophic illnesses or disabilities, including a million \nveterans. The time has come for Congress to take an expected but \nimportant step to preserve Social Security's strength into the future.\n  The trust fund for the disability insurance portion of Social \nSecurity is set to be depleted in 2016. This doesn't mean the program \nwill stop paying benefits but does mean that it will only have \ndedicated tax revenue to pay about 80 percent of benefits. This isn't a \nlate-breaking crisis; this is something that Congress has anticipated \nfor more than two decades. And it is a simple issue to resolve.\n  For a defined-benefit system like Social Security, it is not unusual \nto adjust the dials of funding between the retirement program and the \ndisability program as needed. That way, the entire program remains as \nstrong as possible. Benefits go out in full and on time. Nobody in \nOregon or elsewhere is stuck in limbo, worrying about suddenly being \nunable to make rent or pay the bills.\n  Congress has adjusted resources within Social Security 11 times and \nhas shifted funding both to and from the disability insurance program. \nThe last time it did, in 1994, it set the disability insurance program \non strong footing for about 20 years. That is the practical way to \nstrengthen disability insurance for the future. I am introducing \nlegislation today along with 27 colleagues that would do just that, and \nWays and Means Ranking Member Levin is introducing a similar measure in \nthe House of Representatives.\n  This is a straightforward, commonsense proposal supported by a number \nof prominent advocates for Americans with disabilities, including the \nNational Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, the \nConsortium for Citizens with Disabilities Social Security Task Force, \nSocial Security Works, and the Strengthen Social Security Coalition.\n  Despite that, there are some members of Congress who are ringing \nfalse alarm bells and insisting on changes to the program that may be \nharmful to workers and beneficiaries. They make the misguided case that \ndisability insurance is plagued by fraud or that it is a big giveaway. \nThat is not the case--as I will explain in a moment.\n  The reason I am introducing this legislation now is the House of \nRepresentatives has adopted a rule that prevents a clean reallocation \nof funding between the retirement and disability programs. I want to \nmake sure that harmful changes to these programs are not included in \nend-of-year or other must-pass legislation.\n  In my view, there are opportunities to further strengthen Social \nSecurity,\n\n[[Page S6977]]\n\nand I believe the Congress should be open to policies that would not \nharm workers and beneficiaries. However, it is important that Congress \nnot take any action that would reduce protections for those who desire \nto attempt work, add more complexity in benefits or administration, or \nrig up another trust fund depletion scenario. There have been some \nideas thrown around that don't pass those tests.\n  As Congress debates the future of disability insurance, it is \nimportant to get the facts straight. First, the Social Security \nAdministration makes stopping program fraud and abuse a top priority. \nDisability insurance payments are more than 99 percent accurate, due in \nno small part to the agency's robust efforts to combat waste, fraud, \nand abuse.\n  For example, the agency uses a highly effective method of preventing \nimproper payments called ``continuing disability reviews,'' which \nreturns $9 in savings for every dollar invested. The agency has \ndemonstrated that it can do this important work when we here in \nCongress provide it with sufficient resources.\n  In addition, let me be clear: nobody is getting rich off of \ndisability insurance. The benefits average just over $1,100 a month, \nwhich is slightly over the individual poverty level. If SSDI went away, \nhalf of the families receiving benefits would fall into poverty.\n  And it is important to recognize that the qualifications for \ndisability insurance are strict, which means only those who are so \nimpaired they can't perform substantial work receive benefits. The \nprogram is not a giveaway. Workers earn coverage by paying into the \nprogram. Less than 40 percent of applications for disability insurance \nare approved, even after appeals. The people who qualify suffer from \nsevere medical conditions that have derailed their lives and left them \nextremely vulnerable. In my view, it is deeply unfair to delay the \nsimple changes that will keep the disability insurance program running \nfor years to come.\n  One year ago, the Finance Committee heard testimony from a woman \nnamed Stephanie Dempsey who suffered from debilitating chronic \nillnesses and received disability insurance benefits. Stephanie's long \nlist of health problems began in her late twenties, when she was \ndiagnosed with a hereditary heart disease. She had quadruple bypass \nsurgery at age 30. Over the following years, she had 27 stents placed \nin her arteries over the course of several more operations. That \nenormous burden was compounded by Lupus, arthritis, and a seizure \ndisorder. A mountain of prescription bottles was stacked on the witness \ntable the day Stephanie came before the Finance Committee.\n  As Stephanie told us, she wanted to work, but her illnesses made it \nimpossible. Rather than sliding backward into poverty or having to rely \nentirely on others to stay afloat, disability insurance benefits helped \ncover the bills.\n  I am sorry to say that Stephanie passed away in December. But there \nare vulnerable people across the country who rely on disability \ninsurance in the same way Stephanie did. On the Social Security \nAdministration's website is a page where many of these individuals have \nshared their stories.\n  Let me tell you about three other individuals who rely on disability \ninsurance: Charlotte, Christine, and Carrie.\n  Charlotte was working three jobs and pursuing her degree in social \nwork when she suffered two strokes in 2007. After the strokes, \nCharlotte now has trouble getting around and climbing steps. She gets \nhelp from her niece with day-to-day chores. She says disability \ninsurance keeps her from becoming homeless and helps her pay her bills, \nafford her medications, and keep food on the table.\n  Christine has a disorder of the nervous system that has left her in a \nwheelchair. Her disability insurance benefits give her independence. \nShe said that without Social Security, she would be stuck in a nursing \nhome, but instead, she is able to be a productive citizen.\n  Carrie is a mother who suffers from multiple sclerosis, MS. She \nworked in the insurance industry and shrugged off the early symptoms of \nher MS. But the fatigue and forgetfulness grew, and she became unable \nto work. Carrie's Social Security benefits help her family pay for \nfood, clothes, and school supplies.\n  Mr. President, these individuals and millions more across the country \nhave earned their benefits, and they are relying on Congress to keep \nboth parts of Social Security running at full strength. I urge my \ncolleagues to work on a bipartisan basis to ensure that benefits \ncontinue in full and as promised, to guarantee that millions of \nvulnerable Americans remain protected.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/28/senate-section/article/S6977-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6977]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 271--RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF DINOSAUR \n   NATIONAL MONUMENT AND DESIGNATING OCTOBER 4, 2015, AS ``DINOSAUR \n                        NATIONAL MONUMENT DAY''\n\n  Mr. GARDNER (for himself and Mr. Bennet) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.
