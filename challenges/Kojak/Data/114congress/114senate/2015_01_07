Yesterday we inaugurated the 114th Senate of the \nCongress. We welcomed back many dedicated Members and swore in many new \nones. I have high hopes for our new colleagues. They share the resolve \nof my conference to restore the Senate to a place of high purpose, and \nthey are determined to make a positive difference in the lives of the \npeople who sent them.\n  The men and women we have just sworn in have inaugurated one \nsignificant change already; that is, the majority we seated yesterday. \nI look to this new beginning with optimism and a profound sense of \npurpose, and I look to my colleagues with gratitude for their trust. \nNext to serving the people of Kentucky, this is the highest of honors. \nI recognize the serious expectations of the American people and I know \nthey are counting on us--and I do mean all of us--every single Member \nof this body.\n  We are in a moment of great anxiety as a nation. The people we \nrepresent have lost faith in their government. They no longer trust \nWashington to do the right thing. Many face the reality of losing \nhealth plans after being told otherwise. Many struggle with rising \nmedical costs after Washington officials repeatedly said they would be \nlowered. Confidence in the American dream has plunged. Anxiety about \nthe type of country we leave to the next generation is widespread. For \nmany it has never seemed more difficult just to get by.\n  When Americans look overseas they see a world filled with chaos: \ninstability roiling the Middle East, terrorists pressing an aggressive \nagenda, and autocrats scoffing at a superpower that doesn't seem to \nhave a real plan.\n  At home they see a government that is either uninterested in or \nincapable of addressing their concerns, a government that seems to be \nworking for itself instead of them. Whether it is Washington's \ndysfunction or a bureaucracy that has grown so Byzantine and \nunaccountable, it tried to muzzle political opponents and ignore the \nneeds of veterans.\n  The American people have simply had enough, and this past November\n\n[[Page S28]]\n\nthey had their say. The message they sent was clear. If voters hit the \nbrakes 4 years ago, this time they have spun the wheel. They said they \nwant the administration to change course and move to the middle. They \nsaid they want Congress to send legislation to the President that \naddresses their concerns. This November the American people didn't ask \nfor a government that tries to do everything and fails, and they didn't \ndemand a government that aims to do nothing and succeeds. They asked \nsimply for a government that works.\n  They want a government of the 21st century, one that functions with \nefficiency and accountability, competence and purpose. They want a \nWashington that is more interested in modernizing and streamlining \ngovernment than adding more layers to it, and they want more jobs, more \nopportunity for the middle class, and more flexibility in a complex age \nwith complex demands.\n  That is why we plan to pursue commonsense jobs ideas, including those \nwith bipartisan support: measures such as reforming a broken tax system \nto make it simpler and friendlier to job creation, opening more markets \nto American-made products so we can create more jobs at home, and \nmoving forward with bipartisan infrastructure projects such as the \nKeystone XL Pipeline.\n  Americans are challenging this Congress and this President to work \nfor them. They are challenging lawmakers in Washington to work for jobs \nfor Americans, not just jobs for themselves. It seems simple enough. \nBut in the end, in the era of divided government control, we are going \nto have to work hard to meet expectations and we are going to have to \nwork together.\n  Step No. 1 is getting Congress functioning again. That means fixing \nthe Senate. Last session the House sent over countless commonsense \nbipartisan bills. Too many of them died right here without so much as a \nhearing, and Senators from both parties with ideas for jobs and growth \nwere routinely stopped.\n  So it is time to change the business model. We need to return to \nregular order. We need to get committees working again. We need to \nrecommit to a rational, functioning appropriations process. We need to \nopen the legislative process in a way that allows more amendments from \nboth sides.\n  Sometimes it is going to mean actually working late, but restoring \nthe Senate is the right and practical thing to do because we are only \ngoing to pass meaningful legislation if Members of both parties are \ngiven a stake in the outcome. That is the genius of regular order. That \nis the genius of the Senate.\n  I am reminded of this every time I walk into my office. On the wall \nare portraits of John Sherman Cooper, a Republican, and Alben Barkley, \na Democrat. Keeping watch from below is a bust of Henry Clay. Each of \nthese Senators--each of these Kentuckians--came from a different \npolitical party. Each viewed the world through a different ideological \nlens, but all of them believed in the Senate and all of them left \nbehind important lessons for today: Clay, about putting country first \nand pursuing principled compromises; Cooper, about choosing when to \nmake a stand and making it; and Barkley, about having the courage to \nthink differently from a President of the same political party he had \nserved dutifully for years.\n  These lessons echo into the present and they help point the way \ntoward a better functioning government. A Senate and a Congress that \nfunction again will help move us past an era of government by crisis. \nIt doesn't mean everything will be perfect, it doesn't mean we will \nnever come up against a deadline, and it doesn't mean we will always \nagree, but together we can commit to changing the way Washington \noperates. This can be done. It can be done.\n  This Senate has seemed imperfect at moments, but it has been proven \nto be a place of high purpose at many other times, a place where our \ncountry has come together to confront great challenges and advance \nsolutions that once seemed completely out of reach. That is the Senate \nI saw when I saw Senator Cooper whip votes for the Civil Rights Act \nmany believed would never pass, that is the Senate I saw when President \nReagan worked with Democratic leaders to pass major reforms to taxes \nand Social Security, and that is the Senate I saw when a Republican \nCongress worked with President Clinton to pass historic welfare reform.\n  The promise of the Senate is real. Time and time again it has been an \nengine for bipartisan achievement to which both parties can assume \neither credit or blame, and that is how we should view it today.\n  So, yes, the American people elected divided government, but that \ndoesn't mean they don't want us to accomplish anything. If there is a \nwill to do so, we can come together to achieve great things. If \nPresident Obama is interested in a historic achievement of his own, \nthis can be his time as well.\n  The President has already indicated a willingness to work with us on \ntrade and infrastructure and comprehensive tax reform. These efforts \nare going to require a lot of work. Navigating the political pitfalls \nwill not be easy, but passing these types of measures will represent a \nwin for the American people--wins we could all be proud of. The truth \nis we could work for bigger things too. We could work together to save \nand strengthen Medicare, to protect Social Security for future \ngenerations, to balance the budget and put our growing national debt on \na path to elimination. But bipartisan reform can only be achieved if \nPresident Obama is interested in it. The President is the only one who \ncan bring his party on board. He is the only one, obviously, who can \nsign something that Congress sends him. I assure you, threatening to \nveto a jobs and infrastructure bill within minutes of a new Congress \ntaking the oath of office--a bill with strong bipartisan support--is \nanything but productive.\n  I appreciate that bipartisan compromise may not come easily for the \nPresident--not his first inclination. The President's supporters are \npressing for militancy, not compromise. They are demanding the comforts \nof purity over the duties of progress.\n  From DC to Montpelier, they see the limits of an exhausted 20th \ncentury mindset asserting itself, even when nearly every lever of power \nhas been in hand. Across the Atlantic, they see the Sun setting on the \nsocial democratic idea. They see the tragic legacies of welfare \nstates--empty promises and fear of the future. It is understandable why \nthe President's supporters might want to retreat to past comforts, but \nnow is the time to accept reality. Now is the time to actually move \nforward.\n\n  Americans know that democracy is not about what you can get away \nwith, it is about what you can achieve together. Many in this body, on \nboth sides of the aisle, understand that. I have talked to many \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle who understand this fully.\n  We are calling on the President to ignore the voices of reaction and \nto join us. Whatever he decides, though, this Congress is going to \nfunction again. Let's pass legislation that focuses on jobs and the \nreal concerns of the middle class.\n  After so many years of sluggish growth, we are finally starting to \nsee some economic data that can provide a glimmer of hope. The uptick \nappears to coincide with the biggest political change of the Obama \nadministration's long tenure in Washington--the expectation of a new \nRepublican Congress. This is precisely the time to advance a positive, \nprogrowth agenda.\n  Some of the measures the new Congress will pass may seem significant; \nothers may seem modest. That is OK. As we have seen in recent years, a \nbigger bill does not always mean a better bill.\n  While we are always going to search for areas where we can agree, the \nPresident may not be enamored of every bill we pass, and that is OK \ntoo. It is not our job to protect the President from good ideas. A \nlittle creative tension between the Executive and the legislature can \nbe pretty healthy in a democracy such as ours. Presidents and \nCongresses have disagreed before. They have confronted challenges that \neclipse the ones we see today. What is important to remember is that \nthe Senate has always endured--always. We have a duty to restore it now \nso we can meet the mandate of the people who sent us here.\n  Former majority leader Howard Baker once noted that making the Senate \nwork is like ``trying to make 99\n\n[[Page S29]]\n\nindependent souls act in concert under rules that encourage polite \nanarchy.'' Yet he also reminded us that ``it doesn't take Clays and \nWebsters and Calhouns to make the Senate work.'' It simply takes men \nand women of honor working in a spirit of good faith.\n  It may be difficult, but it has been done before and it can be done \nagain, and if we are going to get there, it helps to recall in whose \nfootsteps we walk today. This is the same Chamber where Dirksen and \nMansfield allied for historic progress. This is where Byrd drew from \nantiquity to rouse colleagues to present challenges and where in later \nyears he would critique successors on the finer points of procedure. \nThis is where Mitchell honed the skills he needed to help bring warring \ncommunities together, enemies who responded to critics not just with \nfloor speeches or press conferences but actually live ammunition. This \nis where Dole shared war stories with Inouye, and with a fateful tap on \nthe shoulder, he would partner with Moynihan in their effort to reform \nSocial Security.\n  The names of many Senators who came before us are etched into the \ndesks we sit at today. The men and women who precede us include future \nPresidents and Vice Presidents. They include former athletes, veterans, \nand astronauts. We have forgotten some, we remember others, but their \nlegacies live on.\n  Here is how Senator Claude Pepper put it:\n\n       The Senate is inefficient, unwieldy [and] inconsistent; it \n     has foibles, its vanities, its members who are great . . . \n     and those who think they are great. But like democracy . . . \n     it is strong . . . it has survived many changes, it has saved \n     the country [from] many catastrophes, [and] it is a safeguard \n     against any form of tyranny.\n\n  In the last analysis, Pepper noted, the Senate ``is probably the \nprice we in America have to pay for liberty.'' For everything Senator \nPepper and I may not have agreed on, we certainly agreed on that.\n  In the same way, each of us here may not agree on every issue. We may \nbe Republican, we may be Democrat, but we are all Americans. We each \nhave a responsibility to make the Senate function, and we each have a \nduty to work for the people who sent us here in serious times to get \nserious results.\n  Let's restore the Senate we love. Let's look for areas of agreement \nwhen we can. Above all, let's make Washington work again for the people \nwe serve.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/07/senate-section/article/S29-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S29]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Boozman).

That \nis the procedure of the Senate which historically had been honored but \nfell, sadly, into disrepair over the last several years.\n  Although we hope our minority status in the Senate is short-lived, I \nthink we will establish that the Democrats are a much better minority \nwhen it comes to the Senate than perhaps those on the other side of the \naisle, but only time will tell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/07/senate-section/article/S29-3", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S29]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NEW CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have the opening remarks from the Democratic leader, \nHarry Reid, which I wish to read into the Record.\n  Senator Reid states:\n\n       As some already know, I had a mishap in my home last week \n     while exercising. As a result, I sustained several broken \n     bones in my face and ribs. As bad as that sounds, I am doing \n     well and recovering quickly.\n       I regret I am not on the Senate floor to make these remarks \n     in person, but my doctors have urged caution and ordered me \n     to stay home while I recuperate.\n       I thank my friend, the Assistant Democratic Leader, for \n     delivering my remarks today.\n       A Greek philosopher once wrote: ``There is nothing \n     permanent except change.'' Our nation's elections prove that \n     theory every two years. This is one of those times of \n     change--for the Senate and for our country.\n       The desks in this Chamber have been rearranged, committee \n     assignments adjusted, and a new majority assumes control for \n     the next two years. Or in other words, it's just another \n     Wednesday in January at the start of a new Congress.\n       For all of the changes, our duties as United States \n     Senators remain the same: We are here to help working \n     Americans and ensure our government has all it needs to serve \n     the people.\n       In spite of almost no Republican cooperation over the last \n     six years, we've made significant strides in many regards. \n     The new Majority Leader claims the Senate hasn't achieved, in \n     his words, ``squat'' in recent years. The numbers, however, \n     tell a different story. Today the U.S. unemployment rate \n     stands at 5.8 percent. Over the last six years the American \n     economy has added 10 million jobs. The stock market has \n     reached all-time highs. Our nation's manufacturers are \n     thriving. The American automobile industry was brought back \n     from the brink of collapse in spite of Republican opposition. \n     And let's not forget that there are more than 10 million \n     Americans newly insured with health care coverage.\n       While some here in Washington may see that as ``squat,'' \n     the economic recovery has been very real to American \n     families. I know how important it has been to working \n     Nevadans.\n       And while we worked to improve the economy without \n     Republicans' help, we also worked to fulfill our \n     constitutional obligation to offer advice and consent on \n     Presidential nominations.\n       Just last Congress we confirmed 132 judges--the most since \n     the Carter Administration. Overall, we confirmed 611 of the \n     President's nominees last Congress in spite of Republican \n     opposition. As we speak, we have an Attorney General and a \n     Secretary of Defense waiting to be confirmed. I remind \n     everyone that last Congress the Republicans mounted an \n     unprecedented filibuster for a nominee for Secretary of \n     Defense [a former Republican Senator].\n       I challenge my friend, the Majority Leader, to change \n     course and work with Senate Democrats in confirming the \n     President's nominees in the 114th Congress. Working together, \n     we can easily meet and surpass last Congress's benchmark of \n     611 confirmations.\n       My Republican colleagues, and especially the Majority \n     Leader, should also know that Senate Democrats are especially \n     eager to continue to help American families.\n       Working together, we can send meaningful, bipartisan \n     legislation to the President for his signature.\n       The mistakes of the past, the gratuitous obstruction and \n     wanton filibustering will not be a hallmark of the Democratic \n     minority in the 114th Congress. The filibuster is an \n     indispensable tool of the minority, but Republicans' abuse of \n     it last Congress has come to epitomize the gridlock here in \n     the United States Capitol.\n       To be clear, I have no intention of just rolling over. I \n     can't. Not when the middle class is teetering on the verge of \n     extinction.\n       Any attempt to erode protections for working American \n     families--the dismantling of Dodd-Frank, the weakening of net \n     neutrality rules, or the Republicans' never-ending quest to \n     repeal the Affordable Care Act, known as ObamaCare--will be \n     met with swift and unified Democratic opposition.\n       But we'd rather legislate together. And there's plenty of \n     common ground for bipartisan compromise if Republicans are \n     willing.\n\n  That is the end of the statement from Senator Reid.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/07/senate-section/article/S29-4", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S29-S30]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            TERRORIST ATTACK\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, throughout the history of the United \nStates of America, we have had a remarkable alliance with the nation of \nFrance. It bears remembering and repeating that the French stood by our \nside when America was fighting for its independence from Great Britain. \nThe French were honored in many ways for that alliance and help, \nincluding, as I recall, a portrait of the Marquis de Lafayette which \nhangs in the U.S. House of Representatives to this day.\n  That was not the only time by any means that the French have stood \nwith us and we have stood by their side. It happened during World War \nI, World War II, and many times after that. Through the NATO alliance \nand in many other ways, we have worked with the people of France for \ncommon goals and common purpose, and that is why we were so saddened \nthis morning to learn of the news that was reported by the Tribune:\n\n\n[[Page S30]]\n\n\n       Masked gunmen shouting ``Allahu akbar!'' stormed the Paris \n     offices of a satirical newspaper Wednesday, killing 12 people \n     before escaping. It was France's deadliest terror attack in \n     at least two decades.\n       With a manhunt on, French President Francois Hollande \n     called the attack on the Charlie Hebdo weekly . . . ``a \n     terrorist attack without a doubt.'' He said several other \n     attacks have been thwarted in France ``in recent weeks.''\n       France raised its security alert to the highest level and \n     reinforced protective measures at houses of worship, stores, \n     media offices and transportation. Top government officials \n     were holding an emergency meeting and Hollande planned a \n     nationally televised address in the evening. Schools closed \n     their doors.\n       World leaders including President Barack Obama and German \n     Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned the attack, but supporters \n     of the militant Islamic State group celebrated the slayings \n     as well-deserved revenge against France.\n\n  This event in Paris recalls what we lived through not that long ago \nwhen the United States--on September 11, 2001--was attacked by \nterrorists and more than 3,000 innocent Americans lost their lives in \nNew York, in Washington, and in the countryside of Pennsylvania. Many \nof us recall that at that moment--that sad, awful moment--people around \nthe world rallied to stand with the United States in our grief and in \nour determination for justice. We particularly remember that the people \nof France did that, and they spoke out in one voice saying they were \ngoing to be by our side in this battle against terrorism. I think it is \nappropriate today that we follow suit, that we join in that same \nspirit. ``A ce moment tragique, nous sommes tous Parisiens, nous sommes \ntous Francais.''\n\n  Let us all work together not only to bring justice to this horrible \nsituation--this attack on free press in France--but let us also work \ntogether to bring an end to terrorism in our time. We can work with our \nallies and friends in France to achieve that goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/07/senate-section/article/S30-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S30]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Paul).

Mr. President, 40 years ago this week, a young prosecutor \nfrom Vermont was sworn into the Senate. He was part of a historic group \nof lawmakers often referred to as the ``Watergate babies.'' Today that \nman is President pro tempore emeritus as well as the most senior Member \nof the Senate. It is an honor to serve with him and to recognize \nSenator Patrick Leahy for reaching this historic milestone.\n  Patrick Leahy remains the youngest Senator--and the only Democratic \nSenator--ever sent to this body by the people of his home State of \nVermont. But that is not what makes Patrick Leahy exceptional. What \nmakes him exceptional is the fact that he is a consensus builder--a \nthoughtful man committed to making government work better. It has been \na privilege for me to work closely with Senator Leahy serving on the \nSenate Judiciary Committee.\n  As a member of that committee since 1979 and for many years as \nchairman, Senator Leahy made a profound mark on America's system of \njustice. He has voted on the nominations of every sitting member of the \nU.S. Supreme Court. He has fought to preserve the balance between \nliberty and security during especially difficult times. Senator Leahy \nhas also fought to make America's respect for human rights a \ncornerstone of our Nation's foreign policy. He has been a leader in the \nglobal effort to ban antipersonnel landmines. He championed the ``Leahy \nLaw'' to prevent U.S. tax dollars from benefiting human rights abusers \nabroad. He was a leader in recent efforts to free U.S. citizen Alan \nGross from a Cuban jail and in the modernization of our Nation's policy \ntoward that island.\n  One last point, Pat Leahy is also, almost certainly, the biggest \n``Dead Head'' in the Senate. Twenty years ago, he invited his good \nfriend, Jerry Garcia--the lead guitarist for the Grateful Dead--to join \nhim for lunch here in the Capitol. Two other members of the band came, \ntoo: drummer Mickey Hart and bass player Phil Lesh. As one might \nimagine, this unusual foursome created a bit of a stir in the Senate \nDining Room. Then in walked Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina. \nEver the bridgebuilder, Senator Leahy walked over to Senator Thurmond \nand said: ``Please join us. There's someone I want you to meet.''\n  It is a story worth pondering as we begin the 114th Congress. If we \ncould all be so open to creating unlikely alliances, there is no \ntelling what we might achieve in the next 2 years.\n  Again, I thank my friend Senator Leahy on his 40 years of service to \nthe people of Vermont, America, and to the great causes that face our \ngeneration.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to address the state of the \nSenate and how to restore its greatness.\n  Yesterday, I was sworn in as the President pro tempore. Although \nthere have been some notable exceptions throughout history, the modern \npractice of the Senate has been to elect as the President pro tempore \nthe most senior Member of the majority party. As one noted historian of \nthe Senate has generously written, ``election of a senator to the \noffice of president pro tempore has always been considered one of the \nhighest honors offered to a senator by the Senate as a body.''\n  I am greatly honored to have been selected for this position, but I \nam keenly aware of the great responsibilities that come with it. The \nPresident pro tempore of the Senate is one of only three legislative \noffices established by the U.S. Constitution, and in recent decades it \nhas been occupied by true giants of the Senate. Their names, which \ninclude Vandenberg, Russell, Byrd, Stevens, Inouye, and Leahy, resonate \nas some of the greatest legislators ever to serve in this body.\n  Beyond the President pro tempore's formal responsibilities in \npresiding over the Senate and helping ensure the continuity of \ngovernment, this office represents a unique opportunity to assist the \nmajority leader in guiding the Senate as it addresses the critical \nissues facing our Nation. In that sense, the President pro tempore \nserves as an elder statesman, sharing accumulated knowledge and lessons \nlearned through long experience.\n  I consider it fortuitous that the beginning of my service as \nPresident pro tempore coincides with the start of a new year. For many, \nthe new year is a time for reflecting upon the past and reviewing \ncommitments for the future. I believe we as Senators should use this \nopportunity for some much needed introspection about the state of this \ninstitution.\n  The Senate has long been heralded as the world's greatest \ndeliberative body. With so many critical challenges facing our Nation \ntoday, there has never been a more important time for the Senate to \nlive up to its storied legacy and to fulfill its responsibilities to \nthe American people.\n  Central to properly understanding our responsibilities as Senators is \nto appreciate the Senate's role in our system of government. This means \nunderstanding both the Senate's purposes and its unique place at the \ncenter of our constitutional structure. It is important for us to \nconsider these issues.\n\n[[Page S31]]\n\n  James Madison famously called the Senate the great anchor of the \ngovernment. He described its purpose as twofold: ``first to protect the \npeople against their rulers; secondly to protect the people against the \ntransient impressions on to which they themselves might be led.''\n  The Senate accomplishes the first goal--protecting the people against \ntheir rulers--by playing a crucial role in the appointment and removal \nof both judges and executive branch officers. The President's power to \nappoint is tempered by the requirement that his appointees receive the \nSenate's advice and consent. Additionally, the Senate possesses the \npower to remove from office any official that has engaged in high \ncrimes and misdemeanors. The President's power to enter into treaties \nis also critically checked by the requirement that the Senate provide \nits advice and consent to a treaty before ratification.\n\n  As such, the President does not have unfettered power to fill up \nexecutive offices, pack the courts or make agreements with foreign \nnations. He cannot staff agencies with corrupt, incompetent or \nideologically extreme cronies unless the Senate allows him to do so. He \ncannot conclude treaties that will harm American interests unless the \nSenate gives its assent. In selecting life-tenured judges to apply the \nConstitution and laws of the land, the President cannot act unless the \nSenate confirms his nominee. In all of these settings, the Senate \nserves as a crucial check against executive abuse.\n  The Senate accomplishes the second of Madison's goals--protecting \nagainst temporary shifts in popular opinion--through its character and \nits institutional structure. In contrast to the large, transient House, \nthe Senate is small, more stable, and therefore, it has the opportunity \nto be more thoughtful. Four hundred thirty-five Members inhabit the \nHouse, and only 100 fill this Chamber. The entire House stands for \nelection every 2 years. Naturally, reelection is constantly on \nRepresentatives' minds. Senators, by contrast, have 6-year terms and \nonly one-third go before the voters each election. Even with the \npressures of modern campaigns, these divergent characteristics produce \nfundamentally different institutions.\n  But the Framers designed the Senate to do much more than merely check \ntransient and occasionally intemperate impulses. They created the \nSenate to refine the public's will and to give more wisdom and \nstability to the government. The Framers chose the Senate's relatively \nsmall size to enable more thorough debate and to provide individual \nMembers greater opportunity to improve legislative proposals. Longer, \nstaggered terms would give Members greater flexibility to resist \ninitially popular yet ultimately unwise legislation. They would also \nguard against temporary majorities. A fluke election may produce \nsignificant majorities for one party that 2 years later disappears. \nThis can lead to wild swings in the law as each new majority seeks to \nenact a vastly different agenda during its brief period of power. \nOverlapping terms help to avert this danger.\n  Finally, statewide constituencies require Senators to appeal to a \nbroader set of interests--including the concerns of the State \ngovernments themselves--than do narrow, more homogenous House \ndistricts.\n  To these constitutional characteristics, the Senate has added a \nnumber of traditions--some formal and others informal--that have \nenhanced its deliberative character. These include the right to \nextended debate, an open amendment process, and a committee system that \ngives all Members--from the most seasoned chairmen to the newest \nfreshmen--a hand in drafting and improving legislation.\n  The late Senator Byrd liked to say that ``as long as the Senate \nretains the power to amend and the power of unlimited debate, the \nliberties of the people will remain secure.''\n  The Senate protects liberty by giving each Senator an active role in \nthe legislative process. This multiplies the checks against bad laws \nand expands the universe of individuals working to make good laws \nbetter. It erects what Madison called a necessary fence against hasty \nand unwise government action. It enables each Senator to bring his or \nher own wisdom and considered judgment to bear on pressing national \nissues.\n  When the Senate functions properly, it is a truly deliberative body \nin which all Senators work to identify the common good and the best \nmeans to achieve that common good. The Federalist describes the common \ngood as the permanent and aggregate interests of the community. This is \nto be distinguished from the individual good, which may vary from \nperson to person and which may not result in the Nation's benefit.\n  Much like the Senate is designed to protect against transient shifts \nin public opinion, it is also designed to enable Senators to pursue the \ncommon good. Senators are able to prioritize achieving the correct \nresults over doing what is politically convenient. The best answers do \nnot always immediately present themselves nor are they always easily \nexplained. Longer terms give Senators more time to investigate, to \nanalyze, to reconsider, and to recalibrate, and so do robust debate and \nan open amendment process. These are critical elements of our \ndeliberative pursuit of the common good.\n  Another crucial component of our pursuit of common good is prudence. \nAristotle called prudence the legislative science because it concerns \nthe best means of achieving the most good in practice. Prudence \nrestrains us from seeking immediate and complete vindication of a \nsingle abstract principle. Instead, it counsels us to work within our \nexisting circumstances to vindicate the enduring principles upon which \nour liberty depends.\n\n  While we should remain true to our principles, we must also recognize \nthat we operate in an imperfect world where we do not control all of \nthe levers of power. We cannot simply charge forward blind to present \nrealities. To do so is to jeopardize our hopes for achieving any \nmeaningful success, because in the messy world of politics, adopting an \nall-or-nothing strategy usually produces only the latter--nothing.\n  Politics is the art of the possible. Ideology is important, and \nrhetoric is captivating. But at the end of the day, when the campaign \nis over, the American people sent us here to govern. We are here to \nprotect their liberties and to protect and improve their lives. When we \ngrandstand or hold out for impossible demands, we do nothing but a \ndisservice. The Framers gave us staggered, extended terms so that we \ncould use our independent judgment to get things done. We should try to \nget to it.\n  An astute commentator observed that the Senate stands at the \ncrossroads of our constitutional system. It shares power with the other \nbranches of the Federal Government. It ensures temperance in the \nlegislative branch. It must consent or not consent to the President's \ntreaties and appointments, and it plays a critical role in appointments \nto the Supreme Court.\n  But it also--and this is unique among the branches of the Federal \nGovernment--embodies the interests of federalism and State power at the \nnational level.\n  The Framers created the Senate to be much more than a simple \nlegislative body. The Senate is uniquely positioned to mediate both \namong the Federal branches of government and between the Federal and \nState governments. As such, the Senate truly embodies the role \ndescribed by one wise commentator as the sober guardian of the \nRepublic.\n  Our responsibilities as Senators follow directly from the Senate's \nconstitutional role. As the people's representatives and as envoys of \nour individual States' interests, we are accountable to our States and \nto our Nation. We do not serve any one party or principle, or any \nparticular ideology or faction. We may align ourselves into certain \ngroups--Republican and Democrat, conservative and liberal--for purposes \nof organization and cooperation, but we are Senators first. Other \nlabels are secondary.\n  Civility and statesmanship must be our constant ideals. Madison once \ninstructed that ``the Senate is to consist in its proceeding with more \ncoolness, with more system, and with more wisdom, than the popular \nbranch.'' A key purpose of this body is to calm the passions that arise \nfrom the heat of political discourse. As such, we must always be \ncourteous in our communications one with another, both formal and \ninformal, on the floor and off, face-to-\n\n[[Page S32]]\n\nface or on a video screen. When we disagree we need to do so with \ndignity and respect, acknowledging the sincere motives and passions of \neven our most firm adversaries.\n  Statesmanship connotes public spiritedness and a willingness to \ncompromise in pursuit of broader goals. Petulance and unilateralism \naccomplish nothing in this body. Any Senator who would choose the glow \nof the camera over the prospect for meaningful achievement seriously \nmisunderstands their role as a Senator.\n  Next on the list of practices Senators must follow are prudence and \nconsidered judgment. I have already spoken about prudence. It is a \nhabit of mind that focuses on present realities and achievable goals--\nnot pie-in-the-sky pipedreams. Prudent lawmakers make experience--not \ntheory--their guide, and they recognize that success in a republic \nrequires harmonizing competing values.\n  Considered judgment is closely tied to prudence. Prudence is not \nrash. It requires deliberation and thoughtful analysis. Our \nconstituents sent us here because they trusted our judgment and favored \nthe general outlines we presented in our campaigns. Now that we are \nhere, it is time to put our plans into action. We do this by studying \nproblems, investigating proposals, and carefully choosing solutions \nthat best cohere with our principles. Exercising judgment is an \nindividual matter. Colleagues and opinion leaders may guide our \ndeliberations, but the ultimate choice of policy is one which we each \nmust make on our own.\n  The final two obligations I wish to highlight are our \nresponsibilities: first, to seek the common good through earnest \ndeliberation, and second, to achieve consensus to the extent possible.\n  As I explained, the Framers designed the Senate so that Members would \nbe able to seek the common good encumbered by few political \nconstraints. Because we stand for election only every 6 years, we are \nless susceptible to swings in public opinion. We have the independence \nto value long-term impact over short-term politics. And because we are \na small body--relatively speaking--all Members are able to participate \nfully in the legislative process and to add their voice of praise, \nwarning or suggestion to each proposal that we consider. We deliberate \nnot to score points or to craft sound bites but because we believe that \nin the contest of opposing views, the best answers will win out.\n  I mentioned consensus. Although much of our day-to-day operations are \nconducted by unanimous consent, obviously we do not do everything \naround here by consensus. We are 100 fiercely independent legislators. \nEven at the end of a lengthy debate with numerous opportunities for \namendment, we may remain sharply divided about a bill's wisdom or the \nobjective it seeks to achieve. But that does not mean consensus should \nnot be our goal. We should take counsel from past legislative victories \nwhich show that broad victories produce lasting reform, whereas narrow \npartisan power plays tend to yield only rancor and repeated attempts to \nrepeal.\n  For 38 years I have had the extraordinary privilege of serving in the \nSenate. During that time, I have witnessed it at its best and, more \nrecently, at its worst. My experience throughout the last four decades \nhas confirmed to me the wisdom of the first Adlai Stevenson, then Vice \nPresident, who in his 1897 farewell address captured the essence of the \nSenate:\n\n       In this Chamber alone are preserved without restraint two \n     essentials of wise legislations and good government: the \n     right of amendment and of debate. Great evils often result \n     from hasty legislation; rarely from the delay which follows \n     full discussion and deliberation.\n\n  In recent years these foundations of the Senate's unique character--\nmeaningful debate and an open amendment process--have come under \nsustained assault by those who have prioritized scoring political \npoints over preserving the Senate's essential role in our system of \nself-government.\n  Rather than simply bemoan this recent institutional damage, we have a \nduty to use this new Congress to restore the Senate. By returning to \nregular order and committee work, promoting robust debate, and enabling \na deliberative amendment process, we can make the Senate work again--\nboth Democrats and Republicans.\n  First, robust debate. Senators' ability to engage in meaningful, \nsubstantive debate is at the core of the Senate's identity. Through \nrobust discussions and inclusive deliberation, Senators examine all \nsides of an issue. We air opposing views and ensure that in haste we do \nnot make worse the problems we are trying to solve.\n  When individual Senators have the right to debate a matter fully, it \nengenders confidence that the final legislation produced represents the \nbest possible bill upon which the Senate can agree. Many pieces of \nlegislation that seemed imperfect passed this way and have gone on to \nbenefit the Nation greatly. For over 200 years, the Senate has provided \neach Member broad prerogative to debate and discuss the critical issues \nof the day. In the early years of the Republic, visitors flocked to the \nSenate gallery to hear Senators such as Daniel Webster, Henry Clay, and \nJohn C. Calhoun, just to mention three, to hear them expound upon \nmatters of national concern.\n  It was in this body that some of our Nation's most important debates \nover taxation, slavery, expansion, and foreign affairs took place. For \nmany years, free-flowing debate was so intertwined with the identity of \nthe Senate that no effective cloture mechanism to cut off debate even \nexisted until well into the 20th century.\n  While the need to end debate in certain circumstances is clear, we \nhave strayed too far from this important deliberative tradition. In \nparticular, the practice of filing for cloture at the very same time a \nbill is brought up for consideration has proliferated to a disturbing \ndegree. When a full and robust debate has occurred, invoking cloture is \noften appropriate. But we must not abuse this power by reflexively \nseeking to cut off debate before it even begins. Let us return to a \nsystem where all Senators have a say in what the Senate does and are \nable to express their views without getting cut off.\n  The second Senate hallmark we must restore is an open amendment \nprocess. The reason for an open amendment process is to improve \nlegislation. No single Member can foresee all contingencies that may \narise or identify all of the potential pitfalls.\n  There is a reason there are 100 Senators, not just 1. More eyes mean \nmore mistakes caught and more opportunities for improvement. An open \namendment process also facilities consensus. One amendment may resolve \na particular Senator's concern, allowing him to support what he or she \nonce opposed. Another may make a bill politically palatable to Senators \nwho support the bill in principle but not in its current form.\n  Amendments may also achieve buy-in as Senators who successfully amend \na bill find themselves more committed to final passage. When Senators \nretain the ability to amend legislation, such input can establish a \nwide and lasting base of support that crosses partisan and ideological \nlines. Indeed, an open and honest amendment process has frequently \nenabled diverse coalitions to find important areas of agreement.\n  I even found that the former Senator from Massachusetts, the late Ted \nKennedy, the famed liberal lion of the Senate, a man I came to \nWashington to battle, could be a productive partner. In the process, he \nbecame one of my closest friends, even if we widely disagreed on a lot \nof things. I miss him personally. We were able to do things that would \nnot have been done had it not been for the work we did together.\n  Unfortunately, over the past several years, the Senate's \ntraditionally open amendment process has come under increasing attack. \nFor the sake of shielding electorally vulnerable Senators from tough \nvotes, we have emasculated one of this institution's critical \ncharacteristics. It is time to stop manipulating Senate rules to \nprevent amendments. It is time to stop blocking amendments for fear of \ntough votes. It is time to return to healthier ways of doing things, \nwhere we work together to improve legislation rather than doing all we \ncan to keep Members out of the process.\n  The third hallmark we must restore is a vigorous and productive \ncommittee system. Although perhaps not as moribund as our amendment \nprocess, the role our committees play in drafting and refining bills \nhas indeed suffered in recent years. For centuries Senate\n\n[[Page S33]]\n\ncommittees have served as the primary forum for critical deliberation \nand amendments in this body.\n  Bills introduced in the Senate are referred to the relevant \ncommittees where Members have the opportunity to consider, debate, and \namend the bill at length. Committees are the workhorses of the Senate \nor at least should be. On the floor we can do only one thing at a time. \nBut any number of committees and subcommittees may operate \nsimultaneously, allowing Senators to work out language and make \ncompromises on multiple bills at the same time.\n  Committees also perform a crucial investigative function. They hold \nhearings, call witnesses, and solicit expert opinions on a wide variety \nof issues, enabling Members to expand their understanding and to better \nfine-tune individual bills. Lately, however, we have witnessed a \ndisturbing trend of bypassing the committee process altogether by \nbringing bills directly to the floor for votes.\n  This practice undermines committee work and frustrates Members who \ndiligently seek to move their legislative priorities through the \ncommittee. It also deprives bills of the benefits of committee review, \nwhich include more search and consideration of language, opportunities \nfor comment by outside experts, and the ability to address support for \namendments without tying up precious floor time.\n  A healthy committee process is essential to a well-functioning \nSenate. This body is not a fiefdom. We do not convene merely to give \nour assent to immutable messaging bills. We are supposed to work \ntogether to write, amend, and pass important legislation. When Senators \nbring up for consideration bills they have written without input from \nother Members, manipulate Senate procedure to prevent floor amendment \non those bills, and then simultaneously file cloture to cut off debate, \nthey act as autocrats rather than agents of democracy.\n  Let's return this body to one that operates by consensus, not \ndictate. Let's return the committee process to its proper place in our \nlegislative landscape, as the first line of review rather than an utter \nirrelevancy. Let's restore the Senate to its proper role in our \nconstitutional system by restoring the traditions that have made this \nbody so great: robust debate, an open amendment process, an active, \nmeaningful committee process.\n  Equipped with these tools, the Senate historically never shied away \nfrom taking on what everyone agreed were the toughest issues of the \nday. Yes, we had to take tough votes. Yes, we could not rush \nlegislation through as fast as we sometimes would have liked. Yes, we \nsometimes felt deep disappointment when proposals we championed fell \nshort. But while the Senate's rules can be frustrating and politically \ncumbersome, they are what allowed the Senate to serve the country so \nwell for so very long.\n  Restoring the Senate in this manner will not be easy. After years of \nbitter partisan tension, we cannot expect a complete change to come \novernight. But by reestablishing our historic aims and reinstituting \nour designing modes of operation, including robust debate, an open \namendment process, and regular order through committee work, the Senate \ncan once more be about the peoples' business and observe the title of \nthe world's greatest deliberative body.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/07/senate-section/article/S33-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S33]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              WISHING SENATOR HARRY REID A SPEEDY RECOVERY\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, one of my friends in this body is the \ndistinguished minority leader, Harry Reid. Harry and I have been \nfriends for a long time. He has served here for a long time. He served \nwell in many respects. He certainly was a tough majority leader. He is \na tough guy.\n  Recently he suffered some very severe injuries. He is mending. These \ninjuries seem to be injuries he can handle, although very strong, tough \ninjuries. I wish him the best, that he may be able to recuperate well, \ncome back again to this deliberative body, and play the role he needs \nto play for the minority in this illustrious body.\n  Harry and I believe many things together, especially in the religious \narea. He is a fine man. His wife Landra is a very fine woman. I am glad \nto see that her health has improved. She is a terrific person. Both of \nthem are terrific people in their own right. I pray that the Lord will \nheal Harry and make it easier for him to come back as soon as he can. \nBeing a tough guy, he will be back here pretty soon. I wish him the \nbest. It is no secret that Elaine and I have been praying for him. \nHopefully, those prayers will be efficacious.\n  I have great respect for my colleagues on the other side as well as \nmy own colleagues on this side. These are good people. There are very \nfew Senators--not more than 2--in my 38 years in the Senate that I \nthought might not have much redeeming value. Everybody else has played \nsignificant roles in this body, sometimes that I hotly contested and \ndiffered with, but nevertheless very good people over all these years.\n  Harry Reid is one of the nicest people one will ever meet off the \nSenate floor. He is all right on the Senate floor too. All I can say is \nthat I wish him well. I am praying for his recovery. I want him to \nsucceed in every way. He is from our neighboring State. Nevada is very \nimportant to us. We like both Senators from Nevada. Senator Heller is \none of the finest Senators here. They work well in Nevada's interests \ntogether. I hope everything goes well with Senator Reid and his wife \nLandra and his lovely family. They are good family people.\n  I wanted to make those comments on the floor because of the high \nesteem in which I hold Harry. Yes, we disagree on a lot of issues, \nsometimes pretty strongly we disagree, but great Senators can do that. \nThey can get over it quickly too.\n  I hope the remarks I made earlier in the day on this deliberative \nbody will be taken up by everybody in the Senate to realize this is the \ngreatest deliberative body in the world. We need to make sure it \nremains such. That means tough votes. It means tough amendments. It \nmeans long days here sometimes, but it also means an ability to have a \nrapport with my friends, not only on this side but the other side as \nwell and for them to have a rapport not only with their side but with \nour side.\n  Let's hope we can build something and let's hope we can bring our two \nsides together and work in the best interests of the country and get \nsome things done that are sorely in need and do things that both \nDemocrats and Republicans can say: We did it together. Yes, there were \ntough times. Yes, we differed from time to time. But we did it \ntogether, and we did it in the best interest of the country.\n  I hope both leaders will be able to work together in this manner and \nthat all of us will do our work in the best interest of this country. I \ndo not think we necessarily have to forget politics, but we ought to \nsublimate them sometimes to the point where they do not interfere with \ngetting very important work done.\n  I wish Harry Reid the best. As I said, he is in my prayers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/07/senate-section/article/S33-2", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S33-S36]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  JOBS\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, first of all, this is the first opportunity \nI have had to follow our new President pro tempore of the Senate on the \nfloor. He was just elected yesterday.\n  I have spoken on the floor at times when he has been in other \nleadership roles. He is a solid Member of this Senate whom we rally \naround in so many ways. The comments he just made about the leader of \nour friends on the other side and the importance of family to Senator \nReid--that is also important to Senator Hatch. People are important to \nSenator Hatch. I believe he is going to be a tremendous President pro \ntempore of the Senate, chairman of the Finance Committee, and a \ncritical leader at a critical time.\n  The comments he made on the floor today about Senators being willing \nto take tough votes, to take positions on issues, to let the American \npeople know where we stand--that is not only where the Senate ought to \nbe but in so many ways it is where Senator Hatch has always been as a \nMember of the Senate and now as the highest elected official in the \nSenate, the President pro tempore of the Senate. I look forward to \nseeing him do that job, seeking his advice, and watching his leadership \nas he leads us now in multiple ways in the Senate.\n  Mr. HATCH. Would the Senator yield for a comment?\n\n[[Page S34]]\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my dear friend from Missouri for being so kind and \nthoughtful to me and the Senate. I appreciate our friendship and the \nleadership he provides in this body.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I thank my friend for his leadership and his comments.\n  The Presiding Officer and I are looking at legislation we looked at \nlast year where the Senate would simply have to stand up on rules and \nregulations that have an impact on the economy and say ``Yes, we are \ngoing to improve those'' or ``No, we are not going to do those.'' That \nwould be a role for the Senate where the regulators for the first time \nhave an obstacle and an opportunity to come to the people who have to \ngo to the voters and say: What do you think about this rule? What do \nyou think about this regulation?\n  I look forward to seeing the REINS Act again that would put some more \ncontrols over regulators, which both the Presiding Officer and I have \nworked on.\n  Today I will talk for a few moments about the work we will hopefully \nget to quickly.\n  The first numbered bill in this new Senate is the bill to authorize \nthe Keystone Pipeline. In the 6 years that Canada has been waiting to \ntry to sell us a product that we need, I have spoken about this--as \nmany of us have--many times. It is hard to actually think about what I \nmight say today that hasn't been said before in that 6-year period of \ntrying to do what I believe and what most Americans believe is the \nlogical thing for us to do.\n  Our best trading partner, Canada--more North American energy is one \nof the critical keys to our economic future. As I over and over again \nthink of the list of opportunities in front of us, that has to be near \nthe top. What happens when we have more American energy? What happens \nwhen we are more self-sufficient with our two closest neighbors for the \nenergy we use, the energy we need? What happens when we are less \ndependent on economies that we don't do as much business with or places \nthat aren't as friendly to us as our neighbors to the north and our \nneighbors to the south?\n  More American energy has an impact on utility bills, it has an impact \non transportation, and it has an impact on whether we are going to make \nmore things. An economy that grows things and makes things is stronger \nthan an economy where we just trade services with each other. We should \nbe looking for those things which create that competitive incentive for \nus to get back into manufacturing.\n  In the last session of Congress, we were able to pass a bill I \ncosponsored with Senator Brown from Ohio on advanced manufacturing, and \nI think it is going to have an impact on doing things in different \nways, but I don't suggest that it would have a greater impact than a \nutility bill that somebody thinking about building a factory understood \nthat they had a great likelihood of being able to pay for a long time \nand in a competitive way or a delivery system that works. Those are the \nkinds of things that will create more American jobs.\n  The Keystone Pipeline clearly creates some jobs in and of itself. I \nthink 20,000 jobs or so is the estimate just to build the pipeline and \nanother 20,000 for all of the support of material and things that go \ninto that pipeline.\n  I think the President's own State Department has a number of 42,000 \njobs that would be created if we go to this shovel-ready project. We \nhad a lot of discussion in the country when the President became \nPresident about the importance of finding shovel-ready projects. This \nis a project where people have had the shovels in hand for a long time. \nThey have a product we need. We are their best trading partner. It is \nlogical that they would want to sell it to us. It is equally logical \nthat we should want to buy it from them. The State Department says over \nand over again--and this is the State Department where the Secretary of \nState was put in place by the President, who yesterday said he would \nveto this bill--the State Department says over and over again that \nthere is no environmental impact we should be concerned about.\n  For people who say: Well, the Canadians should be concerned about the \nimpact of taking that oil out of the ground, that is really going to \nhappen. The oil sands are going to be heated up. The oil is coming out \nof the ground. It is going to be sold to somebody. The question is, Do \nwe take advantage of that logical opportunity or do we give that \nopportunity to somebody else?\n  When we get into this debate next week, somebody will say: Well, \nmaybe there are 40,000 jobs to build the pipeline, but there are only \nthree or four dozen jobs to run the pipeline. Well, of course--it is a \npipeline. It is not complicated to do, but it is the logical and \neasiest way to move fuel that we need, oil that we need, oil that would \nbecome part of our commerce and other commerce.\n\n  But anybody who thinks that those are the only jobs that would be \ncreated when we grasp the idea of more American energy just isn't \nthinking about what this means to our economy. There are many jobs to \nbe created. That is why this has become such an important issue and \nsuch an important vote--not just for the pipeline itself but for the \nmessage it sends to the American workforce, the message it sends to \npeople who are thinking about making things in America, and the message \nit sends about our future economy. This is one of many things that are \njust waiting for us to take advantage of them so that we can grow our \neconomy in new and positive ways.\n  Among the things that will be said that I will disagree with on this \nin the next few days: Well, this is only 35 permanent jobs. Anybody who \nbelieves that embracing more American energy is only 35 American jobs \nis either kidding themselves or just trying to kid the American people.\n  We need to take advantage of this opportunity. There is no government \nfunding involved. It is just government approval. This is a $7 billion \nproject, 42,000 jobs. The government just has to say yes.\n  Six years and several months ago ago--I think about 2 months ago now \nwe passed the 6-year anniversary of the Canadians having the \napplication and asking us to let them do this. Why do they even have to \ndo that? Because they cross an international border. We build pipelines \nin the country all the time with very little Federal involvement.\n  This is revenue for the States, communities, and counties this \npipeline goes through. There is a revenue stream there. You pay for the \npermanent ability to have that infrastructure available to you. It is a \n$7 billion project, revenue for State and local government, but most \nimportantly, it is a sign from the people of the United States of \nAmerica through their government that we are going to take advantage of \nthis great opportunity of more American energy that is in front of us.\n  Since he came to the Senate the same day I did 4 years ago, Senator \nHoeven has been a leading advocate as a North Dakotan. He understands \nwhat energy can do for the economy. He also understands the importance \nof being able to transport that energy product around in the right way. \nIt frees train cars for manufactured goods, agriculture, and other \nthings. It does so in the best way. Senator Manchin, joining with \nSenator Hoeven as the principal sponsors of the bill, is a leader on \nthese energy issues. He understands energy issues. I am pleased to be a \ncosponsor of this bill. I believe there are 60 of us who have \ncosponsored the bill--clearly enough to send the bill to the \nPresident's desk. It would be nice if the President would look at the \nopportunity and decide to sign this bill.\n  This is an important part of the future of the country. It is time \nfor the Senate, the Congress, and the Government of the United States \nto wrap its arms around what this means to the people of the United \nStates. It means good jobs. It means a different future than if we \ndon't have it.\n  One other topic I wish to mention while on the floor is--speaking of \ngood jobs--jobs for veterans. A bill I filed in the last Congress in \nthe Senate has passed the House again last night, the Hire More Heroes \nAct. I hope we can get to it quickly. Last year it passed in the House \n406 to 1, but the Senate wouldn't take up the bill that passed the \nHouse 406 to 1.\n  How do we hire more heroes under this act? We give people who already \nhave veterans health benefits--TRICARE or other VA benefits--a little \nbit of an exception as an employee. Employers don't have to count them\n\n[[Page S35]]\n\ntoward the 50 employees that trigger a law that many employers are \ntrying to avoid being affected by, the so-called Affordable Care Act.\n  We have a chance to go to those who served us and say: Look, we are \ngoing to create one additional opportunity. We are not going to count \nthe fact that you already have health care against you; we are actually \ngoing to let it work in favor of your opportunity to get a job and to \nmove forward with that job.\n  Whether it is more American energy or hiring our heroes for jobs they \nneed to have--the veteran unemployment numbers are unacceptable. \nVeterans who have served since 9/11 at one time last year had an \nunemployment rate right at the 9 percent number. Any number is \nunacceptable. We need to take those veterans' skills and put them to \nwork. I hope we do that by quickly following our colleagues on the \nother side of the building--who now have passed this bill twice--and \ngetting this bill on the President's desk as well.\n  Hiring our heroes, creating jobs, looking at more American energy--I \nam hopeful these are the kinds of things this Congress will quickly \nsend a message to the President and the country--these are the kinds of \nthings we want to see happen for more opportunity for young Americans \nand for all Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I share the view of my colleague from \nMissouri about the importance of the Keystone Pipeline. We will have an \nopportunity over the next several days to talk more extensively about \nthat and the importance it has to our economy and to energy security. \nObviously it is something that we think is about jobs and the economy, \nwhich is why there is so much support for it in the Senate among \nRepublicans in the Senate, and I would argue--I think there will be a \nlot of Democrats as well.\n  Yesterday Republicans assumed the majority in the Senate thanks to \nthe overwhelming support of the American people, and we are ready to \nroll up our sleeves and go to work.\n  This week President Obama is going to be traveling around the country \nattempting to take credit for the recent shred of economic good news we \nhave finally seen after 6 years of economic stagnation under the \nPresident's policies. Unfortunately, all of the campaign-style tours in \nthe world cannot disguise the fact that our economy is nowhere near \nwhere it should be. More than 5 years after the recession supposedly \nended, Americans are still feeling the pinch. Wages are stagnant. \nHousehold income has declined by almost $3,000 on the President's \nwatch. The price of everything from health care to education has risen. \nAnd the President's policies have done nothing to help. In fact, the \nPresident's policies have actually made things worse. Whether it is the \ntaxes in the President's health care law or the energy tax proposed by \nthe President's out-of-control EPA, the President's policies have done \nnothing to help the economy.\n  But there is reason for Americans to be hopeful. Poll after poll has \ndemonstrated that the American people are concerned about jobs and the \neconomy, and in the new Congress Republicans are going to make jobs and \nthe economy our priorities. We are committed to passing legislation \nthat would help create jobs, grow the economy, and expand opportunities \nfor struggling middle-class families, and we plan to get started right \naway.\n  This week the senior Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Hoeven, \nreintroduced legislation to approve the job-creating Keystone XL \nPipeline. According to the President's own State Department, this \ncommonsense project would support more than 42,000 jobs. It would also \nsubstantially increase revenue to State and local governments, \nproviding increased funding for local priorities such as schools, \nroads, and bridges.\n  I can speak firsthand to that because it would cross my home county, \nJones County, in South Dakota. I can say the people in my home county \nsee the opportunity to generate revenues that would help support the \nlocal school district in an area of the State which is losing \npopulation and having a harder and harder time keeping the school open.\n  The pipeline has bipartisan support in both Houses of Congress, and I \nam hopeful that the President will drop his inexplicable opposition and \nfinally sign off on this job-creating project.\n  Republicans also plan to take up the other job-creating measures that \nspent far too long languishing in the Democratic-led Senate. The \nObamacare tax on lifesaving devices, such as pacemakers and insulin \npumps, has already had a negative impact on jobs and the medical device \nindustry. At a time when our economy is still suffering from years of \nstagnation, repealing this tax is a no-brainer. I am confident we will \nhave bipartisan support for this repeal, and I hope--I hope--the \nPresident will sign it.\n  Republicans also plan to repeal the Obamacare provision that changed \nthe definition of full-time work from 40 hours per week to 30 hours per \nweek. This provision is forcing businesses to reduce employees' hours \nand wages and hire part-time rather than full-time workers in order to \ncomply with the Obamacare requirements. Millions of Americans who want \nfull-time work are currently stuck in part-time jobs because they can't \nfind anything else. The last thing the government should be doing is \nmaking it more difficult for employers to offer full-time positions.\n  Another Obamacare position that is making it difficult for employers \nto hire is the employer mandate. Later today I will introduce a bill \ncalled the HIRE Act, which would make it easier for employers to hire \nnew workers by exempting Americans who have been unemployed for more \nthan 27 weeks from counting as employees for whom a tax penalty must be \npaid by the employer under Obamacare's employer mandate.\n  In addition to passing job-creating legislation, the new Republican \nmajority is committed to increasing congressional oversight. Executive \nbranch agencies have been out of control under the Obama \nadministration. The President's EPA alone has proposed billions of \ndollars' worth of regulations that will have a catastrophic effect on \nour economy and eliminate tens of thousands of jobs, if not hundreds of \nthousands of jobs. Just one of these regulations--the backdoor national \nenergy tax on coal-fired powerplants--would cause Americans' energy \nprices to soar and destroy families' livelihoods.\n  In my State of South Dakota, household energy prices could increase \nby as much as 90 percent. South Dakotans with incomes below $50,000 a \nyear already spend one-fifth--one-fifth--of their aftertax income on \nresidential and transportation energy costs, which is twice the \nnational average, I might add. They can't afford a 90-percent increase \nin their costs.\n  What is more, this national energy tax will have almost no effect on \nour air quality. It would devastate communities and drive up energy \nbills in this country for nothing.\n  The EPA is far from the only Federal agency to have abused its power \nunder the Obama administration. Take the Obama IRS, for example, which \ntargeted organizations for extra scrutiny based on their members' \npolitical beliefs. It is past time for Congress to assert its oversight \nauthority and check the executive branch's overreach.\n  While Republicans want to work with Democrats as much as possible, we \nwill not hesitate to draw a bright line between Democratic and \nRepublican priorities.\n  Republicans want to address some of the biggest challenges facing our \neconomy, to put our Nation on the path to long-term prosperity. That \nmeans doing things such as reforming our Tax Code, which is inefficient \nand bloated, making it simpler and fairer for families and businesses \nin this country. It also means reforming our regulatory system to \neliminate inefficient and ineffective regulations that are discouraging \njob growth.\n  The Democratic-led Senate was pretty dysfunctional. The minority \nparty was largely shut out of the legislative process. Bills were \nfrequently written behind closed doors. The committee process was \nlargely defunct. Too often the Senate floor was a forum for partisan \npoliticking rather than serious debate. What was the result? The voices \nof too many Americans got shut\n\n[[Page S36]]\n\nout of the process and the Senate accomplished next to nothing for the \nAmerican people.\n  Republicans intend to change all of that. Under Republican control, \nthe Senate will return to regular order. That means bills will once \nagain be debated and amended in the open, in committee, before coming \nto the Senate floor. Once bills come to the floor, all Senators, \nregardless of party, will have the opportunity to offer amendments and \nto fully debate legislation before it comes to a vote.\n  The American people deserve a Senate that works and Republicans \nintend to give it to them. The American people have spent a long time \nstruggling in the Obama economy, but they are about to get some relief. \nRepublicans are determined to pass solutions that will help create \njobs, grow our economy, and expand opportunities for American families. \nWe hope--we hope--the Democrats in the Senate and the President will \njoin us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/07/senate-section/article/S36-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S36-S38]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IMPORTANT ISSUES FACING OUR COUNTRY\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, as we begin this new session, I think \nit is important for us to remember why we are here and what our job is \nas Senators. What our job is, it seems to me, is to try to understand \nthe needs of the American people, the problems facing our constituents, \nand propose real solutions to those problems. So before we get involved \nin all of the debates I know we are going to have, let me put on the \nfloor what I believe--in hearing from the people of the State of \nVermont--are some of the most important issues facing our country and \nthe need for the Senate, the Congress, and the President to address \nthose issues.\n  First and foremost, to my mind, is the state of American democracy. \nWe are a democracy, and men and women have fought and died to preserve \nAmerican democracy, which means the people of America--not kings, not \nqueens, not an aristocracy but the people of this country--regardless \nof where they come from or their economic status, have the right to \nparticipate in the political process, to elect their leaders and create \nthe future they want for themselves and their kids.\n  What is the status of American democracy today? We just came out of a \nmidterm election where Republicans did very well. But I think it is \nimportant to understand that in that election--that national election--\n63 percent of the American people didn't vote. Eighty percent of young \npeople didn't vote. The overwhelming majority of low-income and working \npeople didn't vote.\n  There are a million reasons an individual doesn't vote, but my guess \nis that for many people they look at the political process and they \nsay: Yes, my family is hurting. I am working longer hours for lower \nwages. My job went to China. My kid can't afford to go to college. I \ncan't afford health insurance. What are those people in Washington \ndoing to protect my interest? Not much--not the Republicans, not the \nDemocrats. I am hurting. What are they doing? People say: Hey, I don't \nwant to participate in this process. It doesn't mean anything. I am not \ngoing to vote.\n  I think another aspect about why people don't vote is they turn on \ntheir TVs and they are bombarded with 30-second ugly television ads--\noften ads that come not even from the candidate but from people who do \n``independent expenditures.'' As a result of the disastrous Supreme \nCourt decision on Citizens United, billionaires, corporations are now \nallowed to spend unlimited sums of money in a political process. If \nsomebody is a billionaire, they can now spend hundreds and hundreds of \nmillions of dollars to destroy other candidates or to elect the \ncandidates they want.\n  Is that truly what American democracy is supposed to be about? Do we \nbelieve that men and women fought and died for us so billionaires can \nelect candidates to protect the wealthy and the powerful?\n  I would say at the very top of the agenda for this Congress should be \na movement to overturn, through a constitutional amendment, this \ndisastrous Supreme Court ruling on Citizens United. In my view, we \nshould move toward public funding of elections so all of our people, \nregardless of their economic status, can participate in the political \nprocess and run for office.\n  I think the next issue we have to take a very hard look at is the 40-\nyear decline of the American middle class. I know some of my Republican \nfriends talk about what has happened under the Obama administration, \nand they are right in saying we are nowhere where we should be \neconomically. No one debates that. But let us not forget where we were \n6 years ago when George W. Bush left office. Everybody remembers where \nwe were: 700,000 people a month--a month--were losing their jobs.\n  People say: Hey, we are growing 200,000 or 300,000 jobs a month now, \nnot good enough. Right, it is not good enough, but growing 200,000 or \n300,000 jobs a month is a heck of a lot better than losing 700,000 jobs \na month.\n  Our financial system--the U.S. and the world's--was on the verge of \nfinancial collapse. That is where we were when Bush left office. Now \nWall Street is doing very well.\n  In terms of our deficit, when Bush left office we had a $1.4 trillion \ndeficit. Now that deficit is somewhere around $500 billion. Are we \nwhere we want to be? No. Are we better off than we were 6 years ago? \nAbsolutely.\n  But when we look at the middle class today, we understand the \nproblems are not just the last 6 years or the last 12 years. The \nproblems are what has been going on over the last 40 years. The fact \nis, we have millions of working people who are earning, in real \ninflation-accounted dollars, substantially less than they were 40 years \nago.\n  How does it happen, when we are seeing an explosion in technology, \nwhen worker productivity has gone up, that the median male worker--that \nmale worker right in the middle of the economy--earns $783 less last \nyear than he made 41 years ago?\n  Look at why people are angry. That is why they are angry. In \ninflation-accounted-for dollars, the median male worker is making $783 \nless last year than he made 41 years ago. The median woman worker made \n$1,300 less last year than she made in 2007.\n  Since 1999, the median middle-class family has seen its income go \ndown by almost $5,000 after adjusting for inflation. So people all over \nthis country look to Washington and they say: What is going on? You \ngave us this great global economy. You have all these great unfettered \nfree-trade agreements. We have all this technology. Yes, I know the \nbillionaires are getting richer, millionaires are getting richer, with \n95 percent of all new income going to the top 1 percent. We have one \nfamily, the Walton family, now owning more wealth than the bottom 40 \npercent of Americans. Yes, the billionaires are doing great, but what \nis happening to me?\n  What is happening to the middle class? The answer is, for a variety \nof reasons, in the last 40 years the middle class has shrunk \nsignificantly. Today we have more people living in poverty than at \nalmost any other time in American history, and we have the highest rate \nof childhood poverty of any major country on Earth.\n  So what do we do? What do we do to rebuild the middle class? What do \nwe do to create the millions of decent-paying jobs we need? Let me \nthrow out a few suggestions that I hope in this session of Congress we \nwill address.\n  For a start, everybody in America understands our infrastructure is \ncollapsing--no great secret. According to the American Society of Civil \nEngineers, nearly one-quarter of the Nation's 600,000 bridges are \nstructurally deficient or functionally obsolete, and more than 30 \npercent have exceeded their design life.\n  What that means is that all over this country bridges are being shut \ndown because they are dangerous and they need repair, almost one third \nof America's roads are in poor or mediocre condition, and 42 percent of \nmajor urban highways are congested. As we speak, in cities all over \nAmerica people are backed up in traffic jams, burning fuel and wasting \ntime because we don't have proper infrastructure. The American Society \nof Civil Engineers says we must invest $1.7 trillion by 2020--5 years--\njust to get our Nation's roads, bridges, and transit to a state of good \nrepair--more than four times the current rate of spending.\n\n[[Page S37]]\n\n  So what happens when we invest in infrastructure? I will introduce \nlegislation to invest $1 trillion in rebuilding our roads, bridges, \nwater systems, wastewater plants, aquifers, older schools, and rail. \nWhen we do that, $1 trillion in infrastructure investment not only \nmakes our country more productive and efficient, but it also creates a \nsubstantial number of decent-paying jobs. A $1 trillion investment \nwould maintain and create 13 million decent-paying jobs. The fastest \nway to create good-paying jobs is to rebuild our crumbling \ninfrastructure. In my view, that should be a very, very high priority \nfor this Congress.\n  The second issue I think we need to address--and I understand there \nare differences of opinion on this issue. I think when our kids and our \ngrandchildren look back on this period and they look at an issue such \nas the Keystone Pipeline, they will be saying: What were you people \nthinking about? How could you go forward in terms of increasing the \nexploration and production of some of the dirtiest oil on this planet \nwhen virtually all of the scientists were telling us that we have to \nsubstantially reduce carbon emissions and not increase carbon \nemissions?\n  In my view, an important mission of this Congress is to listen to the \nscience and the scientific community. They are telling us loudly and \nclearly that climate change is real, climate change is caused by human \nactivity, climate change is already causing devastating problems in \nAmerica and around the world in terms of drought, in terms of flooding, \nin terms of extreme weather disturbances, and we have to transform our \nenergy system away from fossil fuel and into energy efficiency, into \nweatherization, into wind, into solar, into geothermal, and into other \nsustainable energies. When we do that, we not only lead the world in \nreversing climate change, but we also create a significant number of \njobs.\n  In this last election, interestingly enough in some of the most \nconservative States in America, voters voted to raise the minimum wage \nbecause they understand that a minimum wage of $7.25 an hour--here in \nWashington, DC, the Federal minimum wage--is literally a starvation \nwage. No family, no individual can live on $7.25 an hour. I applaud all \nthose fast food workers all over this country--people who work at \nMcDonald's and Burger King--for having the courage to go out on the \nstreets and say: We have to raise the minimum wage. I applaud their \ncourage in doing that, and I applaud the many States around this \ncountry, including the State of Vermont, who have raised the minimum \nwage. In my view, if someone works 40 hours a week, they should not be \nliving in poverty. I hope that one of the major priorities in this \nCongress is to raise the minimum wage to a living wage. Over a period \nof years, I would raise that minimum wage to $15 an hour.\n  It is also unacceptable that in America today women who do the same \nwork as men earn 78 cents on the dollar compared to male workers. I \nthink we have to address this discrimination, and we need to move \nforward with pay equity for women workers.\n  When we talk about the decline of the American middle class and the \nfact that millions of workers are working longer hours for lower wages, \nwhen we talk about the fact that in the last 14 or so years this \ncountry has lost 60,000 factories and millions of good-paying \nmanufacturing jobs--when we put that issue on the table, we begin the \ndiscussion which is long, long overdue about our trade policies. That \nis what we have to talk about. The truth of the matter is that from \nRepublican leadership in the White House to Democratic leadership in \nthe White House, there has been support for a number of trade policies \nwhich, when looking at the cold facts, have failed. NAFTA has failed. \nCAFTA has failed. Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China--PNTR--\nhas failed. Over the last 30 years, Republican Presidents and \nDemocratic Presidents have continued to push unfettered free trade \nagreements which say to American workers: Guess what. You are now going \nto be competing against somebody in China who makes $1.50 an hour. If \nyou don't like it, we are going to move our plant to China.\n  And many companies have done exactly that. Do we think that is fair? \nDo we think that is right? I don't.\n  We are going to be coming up with the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade \nagreement, TPP. Without going into great detail at this point, I have \nvery, very serious problems with that agreement. In terms of the \nprocess, no Member of this Congress has been able to walk into the \noffice where these documents--highly complicated legal documents--are \nheld, bring staff in there, and copy the information. We are not \nallowed to do that, but we are supposed to vote on a fast-track \nagreement to give the President the authority to negotiate that \nagreement. It doesn't make a lot of sense to me.\n  So I hope we use the TPP as an opportunity to rethink our trade \nagreements. Trade is a good thing, but American workers should not \nsuffer from unfettered free trade. Trade should be used to benefit the \nmiddle class and working families of this country and not just the \nmultinational corporations.\n  We live in a highly competitive global economy. Everybody understands \nthat. I think we also understand that our young people are not going to \ndo well and our economy does not do well unless our people have the \neducation they need to effectively compete in this global economy. It \nsaddens me to note that a number of years ago the United States of \nAmerica led the world in terms of the percentage of people who had \ncollege degrees. We were number one. Today we are number 12. The reason \nis that the cost of college has soared at the same time that the income \nof many middle-class and working-class people has declined. We are in a \nposition now where hundreds of thousands of young people thinking about \ntheir future look at the cost of college, look at the debt they will \nincur when they leave college, and they are saying: I don't want to go \nto college. I am not going to go to college. I am not going to get \npost-high school education. That is a very bad thing for this country. \nIt is a bad thing for our economy. We should put high up on the agenda \nthe issue of how in America all of our people, regardless of the income \nof their families, can get the education they need without going deeply \nin debt. This issue of college indebtedness is a horror.\n  I remember a few months ago talking to a young woman in Burlington, \nVT, who left medical school $300,000 in debt. Her crime was that she \nwanted to become a doctor and work with low-income people. She \nshouldn't be punished with a debt of $300,000. Other people are \ngraduating college $50,000 in debt. And graduate school--we have \nattorneys in my office who have a debt of over $100,000. We can do \nbetter than that as a nation.\n  Those are some of the issues. There are others out there. But I think \nwhat is most important is that we try to listen to where the American \npeople are today--to the pain of a declining middle-class, to single \nmoms desperately struggling to raise their kids with dignity, to older \npeople trying to retire with a shred of dignity.\n  On that issue, let me be very clear. If there is an attempt going to \nbe made here in the Senate to cut Social Security or to cut Medicare, \nthere will be at least one Senator fighting vigorously on that. Poverty \namong seniors is going up. Millions of seniors in this country are \ntrying to make it on $12,000, $13,000, $14,000 a year. The last thing \nwe should be talking about is cutting Social Security. In fact, we \nshould be talking about expanding Social Security.\n  There are a lot of issues out there. I hope we don't get lost in the \nweeds. I hope we focus on those issues that are major concerns to the \nAmerican people. I hope very much that we have the courage to stand up \nto the very, very wealthy campaign contributors and their lobbyists who \nhave enormous influence over what takes place here, and that we in fact \nrepresent the people who sent us here who are overwhelmingly middle-\nclass and working-class people.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, under the direction of our new majority \nleader, the Senator from Kentucky, we have been entrusted with a great \nopportunity to lead this new Congress--the 114th Congress--and it is a \ngreat honor. Maybe people assume that to be the case, but it is always \na good idea to express it out loud and to say how grateful we are for \nthe opportunity to be able to lead the 114th Congress and serve in the \nmajority in the Senate.\n  It is also important to say we approach this opportunity with great \nhumility--not just with humility but with also a determination and a \ncommitment to address the top priorities of the American people. If \nthere is one issue I heard about from my constituents in Texas during \nmy reelection campaign, which concluded on November 4, it is: Why can't \nyou guys and gals get things done? How come you can't address the \nproblems that confront the American people? By and large, at the top of \nthat list were jobs and stagnant wages, part-time work when people want \nto work full-time. They were kitchen table, bread-and-butter sorts of \nissues.\n  Now we have an opportunity starting this week to address one of those \npriorities, which is creating jobs with the approval of the Keystone XL \nPipeline. The Keystone XL Pipeline is important for a lot of reasons, \none of which is job creation. It obviously transports oil from Canada \nthrough the United States, bypassing the delivery of this oil in \nrailcars, which has been the subject of some news reports when some of \nthem have gone off-rail and created some accidents. The oil ends up in \nSoutheast Texas, where we have a lot of refineries which create a lot \nof jobs but where that crude oil will then be refined into gasoline and \njet fuel and other refined products.\n  This is also important because this is a supply of oil from a \nfriendly neighbor, Canada--one of our closest allies--and reduces our \ndependence on oil from parts of the world that aren't quite as stable \ncertainly as Canada is. So it is important from a jobs perspective. It \nis important from a geopolitical perspective and a national security \nperspective as well.\n  I went back and looked and noted that the President actually formed a \nJobs Council during his first term in office. The job of the members of \nthe council was to put their heads together and provide strategic \nadvice on ways to boost the economy. This is the President's Jobs \nCouncil that he created during the first term of his Presidency. The \ngroup's main homework assignment was to produce this framework for job \ncreation and enhance national competitiveness. In fact, they produced \nsomething entitled ``Road Map to Renewal.'' I haven't Googled that or \nBinged it or put it in a search engine, but I bet if anybody who \nhappens to be listening is interested, they could type that into a \nsearch engine on the Internet--the ``Road Map to Renewal''--and find \nout all they want to know about it. It includes a number of specific \nand practical recommendations for action.\n  One of those recommendations to the President was to ``optimize all \nof the nation's natural resources and construct pathways (pipelines, \ntransmission and distribution) to deliver electricity and fuel.''\n  That would seem to be right in the wheelhouse of the Keystone XL \nPipeline.\n  The report added that regulatory and ``permitting obstacles that \ncould threaten the development of some energy projects, negatively \nimpact jobs and weaken our energy infrastructure need to be \naddressed.'' So the President's own Jobs Council recognized that the \nkey to America's energy security is to focus on America's energy \ndevelopment, including the transmission lines and pipelines by which \nthis natural resource is transported.\n  I know perhaps coming from an energy State such as Texas we are \nperhaps a lot more familiar with the pipelines and the oil and gas \nindustry because it creates so many jobs and so much prosperity in my \nState, but some people are a little apprehensive about the idea of a \npipeline going under the ground. I invite them to again type into their \nfavorite search engine on the Internet ``oil and gas pipelines'' and \nlook at the map that pops up. It is astonishing how many existing \npipelines exist in the United States today. I bet 98 percent of \nAmericans don't even know they exist. Maybe that is too high; maybe it \nis 95 percent. So this is a safe and efficient and effective way of \ntransporting these natural resources all around the United States. \nObviously, if they are transported by pipeline, they don't have to be \ntransported by railcar, including through some populated parts of our \ncountry, and subjected to some of the accidents we have read and heard \nso much about. These underground pipelines are a fairly common reality \nin our country, which leads me to be absolutely mystified at the \nresistance from some on the other side of the aisle and in the White \nHouse to doing what should be in our self-interests, which should be \nsomething that addresses one of the most important things the American \npeople care about, which is jobs, and the other thing they care an \nawful lot about, which is security and reducing our dependence on \nimported energy from the Middle East.\n  That was 3 years ago last month that the President's Jobs Council \nmade this recommendation. Then there is last month, when the President \nsaid this: ``I'm being absolutely sincere when I say I want to work \nwith this new Congress to get things done.''\n  Hearing that was like music to my ears and I think to a lot of \npeople, to have the President say he wants to work with the Congress, \neven though Republicans won the majority in the House and in the \nSenate. So imagine my confusion and the confusion on the part of so \nmany Americans when yesterday the White House Press Secretary said the \nPresident would veto any legislative approval of the Keystone \nXL Pipeline.\n\n  Think about the timing of that statement. We had an election on \nNovember 4, we had the new Congress sworn in yesterday, the President \nsaid a month ago he wanted to work with the Congress, and then the \nfirst day of the Congress, before the legislation was even filed much \nless voted out of committee and brought to the floor, the President \nsaid: If you pass that, I am going to veto it. I am probably not the \nonly one who is confused by the contradiction.\n  We know this pipeline would produce thousands of well-paying jobs and \nwould enhance the supply of energy from a close ally and neighbor, as I \nsaid earlier.\n  So the President issued a veto threat on the day the new Congress was \nsworn in, and it is clear to me that notwithstanding the President's \nprevious statements, he is either confused or he has changed his mind \nabout cooperating with the Congress. I hope he meant what he said when \nhe said he would work with us to try to address the concerns of middle-\nclass families when it comes to jobs and help grow the economy and help \nAmerica prosper. But I am here to say that Republicans who now have the \nhonor and responsibility of serving as the majority in the Senate and \nin the House did listen. We heard the message delivered to us by the \nvoters on November 4. We know they don't want more bickering. They \ndon't want more dysfunction. The American people, including my \nconstituents in Texas, want results. They want jobs. They want full-\ntime, not just part-time work, and they want the security that would \ncome with legislation such as this that we are considering today.\n  That is why this week our new majority leader, the senior Senator \nfrom Kentucky, Mr. McConnell, has decided we will take up this energy \nproject as job No. 1. This is bipartisan legislation. I was watching TV \nthis morning, I think with the Presiding Officer, and we were together \nand saw that Senator Manchin from West Virginia and Senator Hoeven from \nNorth Dakota were appearing on a morning TV show talking about the \nimportance of this legislation, and they estimate they have as many as \n63 votes in the Senate, which by definition is a bipartisan majority, \nto pass this legislation.\n  This place can be pretty confusing at different times, and I am \nperplexed why the same President who said he wants to work with us is \nissuing premature veto threats, even though there is a bipartisan \nmajority for this legislation.\n  Again, the President said he is for an ``all of the above'' approach \nto take care of our energy future. If that is true, then this should be \na part of that approach. He has acknowledged the important connection \nbetween job growth\n\n[[Page S39]]\n\nand energy development. If there is a poster child for the role that \nthe energy sector can play in growing the economy, it is my State. \nTexas is a State where we are quite familiar with the oil and gas \nindustry. We are not just sold on oil and gas because we do produce the \nmost electricity from wind turbine of anywhere in the country. We are \ntruly an ``all of the above'' State. But after years of anemic economic \ngrowth and the lowest workforce participation in four decades, does the \nPresident of the United States think this is an inconsequential piece \nof legislation? Why does he not work with us as opposed to remaining an \nobstruction to real progress the American people are crying out for?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/07/senate-section/article/S39-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S39-S40]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, this is my first ``Time to Wake Up'' \nspeech in the Senate as a Member of the minority. Being in the minority \nwill give me the opportunity, for the first time, to use the tools \nuniquely available to Members of the Senate minority. On the issue of \nclimate change, which is affecting all of our States but particularly \nRhode Island, I intend to use those tools politely and persistently.\n  We have just left a period of partisanship and obstruction by the \nminority unique in the Senate's history. I do not intend to return us \nto those days. My intent is to enliven the Senate and see to it that it \ndoes its duty, that we as Senators do our duty to our fellow Americans. \nMy intent is not to blockade and degrade this great institution with \nobstruction for the sake of obstruction. My goal, in short, is Senate \naction, not Senate inaction.\n  Pope Francis recently spoke to the world about mankind's care of \nGod's creation. He warned us against what he called negligence and \ninaction. I hope to be a constant spur in the Senate against negligence \nand inaction, specifically the negligence and inaction that is our \npresent Senate standard of care for God's Earth.\n  I know that powerful forces of negligence and inaction are arrayed \nagainst us. I know the Supreme Court's reckless and shameful decision \nin the Citizens United case has empowered those forces as never before. \nI know there has resulted an unprecedented campaign by polluting \ninterests of political spending and threats. It is plain to see that \nthe polluters' campaign has, for now at least, silenced meaningful \nbipartisan debate about carbon pollution. We can line up the Citizens \nUnited decision and the silence almost exactly. Coal and oil interests \nare enjoying massive economic subsidies--massive subsidies--and similar \nto any special interest, they will fight to protect those special \nbenefits. But it can't last. It can't last. My confidence is strong \nbecause our American democracy is ultimately founded in the will of the \nAmerican people, and the American people understand the need to end our \ndays of negligence and inaction. They want us to run the blockade that \npolluters have built around Congress.\n\n  Polling shows this. More than 80 percent of Americans say they see \nclimate change happening right around them. Two-thirds say they would \npay more for electricity if it would help solve this problem. Among \nIndependents, that is 64 percent.\n  Even among young Republicans, voters get it--young voters, anyway. \nUnder the age of 35, most Republican voters, according to polls, think \nthat climate denial is ignorant, out of touch or crazy. Those are the \nwords from the poll. Under 50 years of age, a majority of Republicans \nand Republican-leaning Independents support action against climate \nchange. Among all Republicans of all ages, fully half support \nrestrictions on carbon dioxide, and nearly half think the United States \nshould lead the fight.\n  Trusted American institutions get it, too--from the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff of our military services to the U.S. Conference of Catholic \nBishops, from all of America's major scientific societies to the \nexperts we trust day in and day out at NOAA and at NASA, and from the \nleaders of America's corporate community--Walmart and Target, Apple and \nGoogle, Ford and GM, Mars and Nestle USA, Alcoa and Starbucks, Coke and \nPepsi. From all of them and from many other respected voices comes the \nmessage that climate change is a serious threat. I have confidence that \nCongress will soon have to heed their voices.\n  We might mention the recent agreement in Lima where 194 countries all \nagreed to carbon reductions. Does the Republican Party in the United \nStates of America really want to be aligned with Vladimir Putin, the \ngreat international climate denier?\n  My confidence also comes from necessity. This simply must be done. \nOur human species developed on this earth in a climate window that has \nalways been between 170 and 300 parts per million of carbon dioxide in \nthe atmosphere--always. For as long as human kind has been here on \nEarth, carbon concentration has wobbled up and down but always within \nthat range--through our entire history, going back a million and \nprobably more years. We have now rocketed outside that range and broken \n400 parts per million, a condition on Earth that is a first, again, in \nmillions of years.\n  Our oceans, as a result, are acidifying measurably at a rate \nunprecedented in the life of our species. One has to go back into \ndistant geologic time to find anything similar. If you go back that far \nand look at what the geologic record tells us about what life was like \non the planet in those primal eras, it presents a daunting prospect.\n  The scientific warnings about what this means are now starting to be \nmatched in our experience with unprecedented rain bursts and droughts, \nwildfires and heat seasons, sea levels and ocean temperatures. In the \ntropic seas, coral reefs are dying off at startling rates; in the \nArctic seas, sea ice is vanishing at levels never recorded until now. \nEverywhere the oceans shout a warning to those who will listen. Rhode \nIsland, as a coastal State, as the Ocean State, is particularly hard \nhit. We get the land problems such as the rain bursts heavily \nassociated with climate change, which in 2010 brought unprecedented \nflooding along our historic rivers. We have the sea level rise. It is \nexpected now to be several feet by the end of the century--by a warming \nsea that has also disturbed our fisheries and distressed our fishing \neconomy. ``It is not my grandfather's ocean out there,'' as one \ncommercial fisherman told me.\n  This only goes one way. There is no theory of how this magically gets \nbetter on its own. Every theory--and now most observations--all point \nto all this getting worse and perhaps very badly worse. The time for \nnegligence and inaction has passed.\n  In the Senate we need to begin a conversation about this. We have to \nbegin at the beginning. We have to agree on a baseline of facts, \nprinciples, and laws of nature that can then inform our judgments about \nwhat to do. I do not think it is asking too much of the new majority in \nthe Senate to begin an honest conversation about carbon dioxide and \nclimate change. I don't think that it is too much to ask the new \nmajority in the Senate that we undertake this conversation in a serious \nand responsible manner. I do not think that is extreme or unreasonable. \nWe need to begin at the beginning in this conversation, and I will make \nevery effort to see to it that we begin. But even as we begin, we can \nkeep the end in sight. That end is a world where polluters pay the \ncosts of their pollution. That in turn creates a world where market \nforces work properly in our energy markets. The end is a world where it \nis America that seizes the economic promise of these new energy \ntechnologies, where we are builders--not buyers--of the energy devices \nof the future. The end is a world that turns back from the brink of a \nplainly foreseeable risk where the consequences of negligence and \ninaction could well be dire for us and for the generations that follow \nus.\n  In sum, we in this Senate have a duty before us, and negligence and \ninaction will not meet what that duty demands. For those of you with a \ncoal economy or an oil economy in your States, I understand and I want \nto work with you. There are answers to be found. But please, do not \npretend that this problem doesn't exist. That is false and \nunacceptable.\n  I must, on behalf of my State and on behalf of our future, insist \nthat we in the Senate meet our duty, even under this new Senate \nmajority--and I will.\n\n[[Page S40]]\n\n  I yield the floor, and I thank the Presiding Officer for his \npatience.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/07/senate-section/article/S40-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S40]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, along with Senator Joe Manchin--and \nactually a total of 60 sponsors--I have filed S. 1, which is the \nKeystone approval bill. It is a very simple, straightforward bill. This \nis legislation we have seen before in this body. What it does, under \nthe commerce clause of the Constitution, is authorize Congress to \napprove the Keystone XL Pipeline project.\n  I have this map in the Chamber to show you the project. It runs from \nHardisty in Alberta, Canada, all the way down to our refineries in \nTexas along the gulf coast.\n  This project will move 830,000 barrels of oil a day. Some of that \nwill be oil from Canada. Some of that will be domestic oil from the \nBakken region in Montana and North Dakota.\n  This is part of building the infrastructure so we can build a \ncomprehensive energy plan for our country. We are producing more and \nmore oil and gas in our country from shale from places such as the \nBakken in North Dakota and Montana, the Eagle Ford in Texas, natural \ngas from places such as the Barnett and the Marcellus in New York, \nPennsylvania, and Ohio.\n  What we are working toward is--some people refer to it as energy \nindependence, but really energy security for our country.\n  What does that mean? It means we produce more energy than we consume. \nObviously, energy has a global market. The market for energy is a \nglobal market. We know that. The market for oil and gas is a global \nmarket.\n  But the point is, working together with our closest friend and ally, \nCanada, we can have North American energy security where we produce \nmore energy than we consume.\n  Why is that important? That is important because it is about creating \njobs. It is important because it is about economic growth. It is \nimportant because it is a national security issue.\n  Why do we continue to rely on oil from the Middle East? Why are we \ncontinuing to send dollars to the Middle East where you have--look at \nwhat happened in Paris today with an attack by Islamic extremists. One \nof the ways we fight back, one of the ways we push back is we take \ncontrol of our own energy destiny. We can do it. We are doing it. Why \nare gas prices lower today at the pump? Is it because OPEC decided to \ngive us a Christmas present? I do not think so. It is because we are \nproducing far more energy than we ever have before. But to continue to \nproduce that energy, we have to have the infrastructure to move that \nenergy from where it is produced to were it is consumed. That means \npipelines. That means roads. That means rail. For electricity, that \nmeans transmission. But we cannot have an energy plan for this country \nthat really works without the infrastructure to move that energy safely \nand effectively. That is what this project is all about.\n  So why are we here talking about it today? It seems like a pretty \nstraightforward proposition. After all, I think there are something \nlike 19 different pipelines that cross the border. In fact, there are \nmillions of miles of pipelines in this country. Here is a map I have in \nthe Chamber of just some of them. We have millions of miles of pipeline \nin this country. A lot of them, as you can see, cross the border.\n  So why are we standing here today talking about another pipeline \nproject? Because for the past 6 years--for the past 6 years--the \nadministration has held this project up. They keep saying: There is a \nprocess. As a matter of fact, Josh Earnest, just yesterday, said: Oh, \nwe have a process. Congress should not intervene in the Keystone XL \nPipeline approval issue because there is a process. Really, Mr. \nPresident, there is a process? Let's see. The TransCanada company filed \napplication to build the Keystone XL Pipeline in September of 2008--\nSeptember 2008. If you do the math, that is more than 6 years ago. And \nthere is a process somehow to get to a conclusion?\n  So that company, which has invested hundreds of millions already, \nwants to build, ultimately, an $8.9 million project that will move \n830,000 barrels of oil a day. And here they are 6 years later still \nwaiting for approval. That is why today we are asking Congress to step \nforward and do what the American people want.\n  Keystone is not a new issue. The American people understand this \nissue. Poll after poll shows the American people, by a margin of about \n70 percent to 20-some percent, support this project. Whom do we work \nfor? We work for the people of this great country, and 70 percent of \nthe people of this great country say: Approve the project. After 6 long \nyears, where all of the requirements have been met, approve the \nproject.\n  But the President, of course, continues to hold it up, and even \nyesterday issued a veto threat. Why? Why is he wanting to threaten a \nveto on a project that 70 percent of the American people support? It is \nreally hard to understand, isn't it? Because every time an objection \ncomes up, we have worked to address that objection.\n  When there was an objection on the route, the company rerouted. So \nthe President says: Well, it is an environmental concern. He says: \nWell, it is an environmental concern. Really? An environmental concern?\n  This is what his own study found. After 6 years of study, the State \nDepartment, in multiple environmental impact statements--three draft \nstatements and two final environmental impact statements--this is what \nthey found: no significant environmental impact, according to the U.S. \nState Department environmental impact statements.\n  That is not something I did. That is not something the company did. \nThat is something the Obama administration did--repeatedly--and came to \nthe same conclusion: no significant environmental impact. In fact, if \nyou do not build the pipeline, you have to move that oil with 1,400 \nrailcars a day.\n  Now, Canada is going to produce the energy. North Dakota, Montana, \nother States, are going to continue to produce the energy. So that \nenergy is going to move. The question is, how and where? If we cannot \nbuild the pipeline, then it has to go by railcar. So do we really want \n1,400 railcars a day moving that product around or do we want it to \nmove more safely, more cost-effectively, with better environmental \nstewardship through a pipeline? Common sense.\n  Then there is this idea somehow: Well, Canada is not going to produce \nthat oil if they do not have a pipeline. Wrong. They will move it by \nrail, and they will build other pipelines. Here are several that are \nalready in the planning stages, as shown on this map. They will move it \nto the East Coast to refineries they have there or they will send it \nwest and it will go to China.\n  Now, does that make sense? It does not make sense to the American \npublic, which is why the American public wants to work with Canada as \nwell as produce energy in our country to become energy secure. The idea \nthat we would say no to our closest friend and ally, Canada: We are not \ngoing to work with you, we are going to continue to buy oil from the \nMiddle East, and we are going to have you send your oil to China, makes \nno sense to the American people. And it should not. It should not. That \nis why they overwhelmingly support this project.\n  So here we are. We are starting the new Congress. I think, very \nclearly, in the last election, the people said: We support this \nproject. You saw it time after time with candidate after candidate who \nsupported this project who won their election. But on an even bigger \nissue, an even bigger message, the people of this great country said: \nWe want the Congress to work together in a bipartisan way to get things \ndone. We\n\n[[Page S41]]\n\nwant the Congress to work together in a bipartisan way to get things \ndone.\n  So here we have legislation that has passed the House repeatedly with \na bipartisan majority. Here we have legislation that has bipartisan \nsupport in this body. Here we have legislation that the American people \noverwhelmingly support, after clearly giving the message in the last \nelection that they want us working together to get work done, and the \nPresident issues a veto message right out of the gates. Why? For whom? \nWhom is he working for?\n  So it is incumbent upon us to work together in a bipartisan way to \nget this legislation passed. The way we are approaching it--and I see \nmy good friend and colleague from the great State of West Virginia is \nhere. I want to thank him and turn to him, but I want to do it in the \nform of a question.\n  It was my very clear sense from the last election--and I think the \nvery clear sense that we all got from the last election--that they want \nto see Congress working together in a bipartisan way, in an open \nprocess to get the important work of this country done.\n  So with this legislation, it is not just that it is about important \nenergy infrastructure. It is also that we want to return to regular \norder in this body, offer an open amendment process, allow people to \nbring forward their amendments, offer those amendments, debate them, \nand get a vote on those amendments. If they have amendments that can \nadd to and improve this legislation, great, let's have that process. \nLet's have that debate. Let's have those votes. Let's make this bill as \ngood as we can possibly make it. Then the President needs to work with \nus. The President needs to meet us halfway and get this done for the \nAmerican people.\n  So I would like to turn to my good colleague from the great State of \nWest Virginia and say: Aren't we doing all we can here to try to make \nsure we are approaching this in a bipartisan way with an open, \ntransparent process to try to build support for this legislation?\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I say to the Senator, he is absolutely correct. I thank \nhim for this opportunity not only to work with him but also to bring \nthe facts forward.\n  We have heard many times: We are all entitled to our own opinions, we \nare just not entitled to our own facts. If you start looking at what we \nare consuming today in America, at last count 7 million barrels of \ncrude oil is purchased every day in America from other countries--7 \nmillion barrels of crude a day. So this line would possibly furnish \n830,000 barrels of that dependency that we have.\n  Let's look and see where it comes from right now. Mr. President, 2.5 \nmillion barrels we are already purchasing from Canada--our best, \ngreatest ally we could possibly have; the best trading partner and the \nNo. 1 trading partner that 35 of the 50 States have. So it is not an \nunknown there.\n  But let's look at where we are purchasing some of the rest of the oil \nfrom. We purchase 755,000 barrels of heavy crude a day from Venezuela. \nLet's look at Venezuela, where it is an authoritarian regime. It \nimpoverishes its citizens. It violates their human rights. It shows its \nwillingness to put down political protests with horrific violence.\n  We also purchase 1.3 million barrels a day from Saudi Arabia. We all \nhave our concerns about Saudi Arabia and a lot of the money we follow \ngoes into the wrong hands. Forty-two thousand barrels a day from \nRussia--from Russia. We know their intent and what they have been doing \nwith their energy policy. Their regime has invaded its neighbors and \nthey armed pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine.\n  So when we start looking at what we are doing, those are the facts. \nThis is not just hearsay. It is not just rumors. These are facts. We \npurchase 7 million barrels. When I first was approached on this 4 years \nago when I came to the Senate, they said: What do you think about the \nKeystone Pipeline that will be bringing oil from Canada into America?\n  I said: Where I come from in West Virginia it is pretty common sense. \nWe would rather buy from our friends than our enemies. I would rather \nsupport my friends, my allies, my trading partners more so than I would \nthe enemies who use anything I buy from them--the money they receive \nfrom that product that I buy from them and use it against me.\n  It is pretty common sense, not real complicated. I know everybody is \ntrying to make this complicated. Also, they talk about--we just had a \ncaucus talking about what would happen to the oil. I know the Senator \nhas been watching this very closely. But they said the Keystone \nPipeline will strictly be just an avenue and a vehicle for exporting \nthis oil out. They are just going to use America to bring that oil \nthrough.\n  We checked into that a little bit further. That is not true. Even the \nWashington Post gave it three Pinocchios that said it was untrue. We \nfound out, basically, the crude oil from Canada is expected to be mixed \nwith the domestic oil from the Bakkens, from the Senator's region, \nNorth Dakota, and that the Canadian oil is a heavier crude, similar to \nVenezuelan oil. It will be mixed with the light crude from the Bakkens, \nwhich enables it to flow much easier and be produced. Once it \ncommingles, this oil is basically American oil. It lives and dies and \nbasically is marketed with the policies of the United States of \nAmerica. Our policy is not to export crude oil.\n  So I do not know why people are using this argument and scaring \npeople that we will get no benefit. Then we talked about the jobs. They \nsaid there is not that many jobs. In West Virginia, you give us 42,000 \njobs. We would be very appreciative. We will thank you. These are all \nhigh-paying jobs. They said: Well, they are only contract jobs.\n  But yet I hear everybody talking, Republicans and Democrats, about \nbuilding roads and building bridges. Those are also seasonal types of \njobs. Those are also contracting jobs. They are not permanent jobs, but \nwe are tickled to death to get them. That is the whole trade union. All \nthe unions that I know of are supportive of this piece of legislation. \nEvery working man and woman whom we keep talking about who supports \nthemselves and their family supports this legislation.\n  Why we are running into such a roadblock I have no idea. Then when we \nput the map up--the other map we had. I said: When I first heard about \nthis pipeline, I thought it was an anomaly that we did not have many \npipelines in America. Then we put up this map. This is what we have in \nAmerica today. So this is not foreign to any of us in any State we have \npipelines, many in West Virginia and all through this country.\n  Then we look at public support. We think: Here we are Democrats and \nRepublicans. We look at the polls, and we live and die by the polls, \nthey tell us, or we should. But the bottom line is that if we do \nbelieve in the polls, this has been a consistent poll. It has not \nvaried for over 5 years. We have not seen the numbers fluctuate that \nmuch.\n  Overwhelmingly, we have Americans in all aspects of the political \nrealm--whether you are a Democrat, Republican or an Independent--who \noverwhelmingly support this pipeline. So I cannot see the objections to \nit. I was very disappointed when the President said he would veto it--\nor the White House once we said we would go through this process.\n  I think the Senator and I talked about this. We thought this is going \nto be an open process. I was encouraged by my colleagues on the \nDemocratic side who have some good amendments, I believe, that should \nbe considered and I believe would pass and enhance the bill. We only \nneed four more--four more Senators on my side of the aisle who can see \nthe benefit of a good bill, a good process with good amendments to \nstrengthen this bill, to put us in a position that is veto-proof.\n  That should be our goal. Basically, we should not be deterred by the \nWhite House or the President saying already that they are going to veto \nthis bill. Let's see if we can make this bill so good that when we are \nfinished with this product and this process 2 or 3 weeks from now, we \nwill have a product that basically we are all proud of, that the \nAmerican people are proud of and will support, and maybe, just maybe, \nthe White House will change its mind.\n  I am hopeful for that. I appreciate all the effort and work. We are \nworking very well together. At last count, we had nine Democrats \nworking with our Republican colleagues. That puts us at\n\n[[Page S42]]\n\n63. I am hopeful to get four more at least that will look at the \nvirtues of this and the assets and what it will do for our country.\n  My main goal is this: Energy independence makes a secured and \nprotected Nation. Anytime we do not have to depend on oil coming from \nother parts of the world--and the resources we give them when we \npurchase their product, they use those resources against us time after \ntime again. We can see now, with the oil prices dipping, the benefits \nthe consumers in America receive, the strength that gives our country.\n  I am so thankful for that, that we are getting a break. I think we \ncan continue to make that happen for many years to come if we are able \nto be smart strategically in what we do today. I think the Senator \nspoke about the environment. He might want to touch on that again. But \nmost of this oil is being produced now, some way or another, and it is \nalso getting transported in different ways and means.\n  The bottom line is there is no significant environmental impact. I \nthink the State Department has even done five studies that show that to \nbe true. I said also 2.5 million barrels a day are being purchased from \nCanada today. Refineries in Illinois are now refining this product. \nThey said we should not do it. We have been doing it for quite some \ntime. We are using this product. With technology we are using it \nbetter. It has helped us be more independent of foreign oil.\n  That is No. 1, the security of our Nation. Being an American, and for \nWest Virginians, the security of our Nation is first and foremost what \nwe support. That is why I think we see a tremendous amount of people \nfrom the Mountain State, I say to the Senator, who support this piece \nof legislation.\n  We are going to work diligently. We have a long way to go, but I \nthink the facts are on our side. We are all entitled to our opinions, \nbut we cannot change the facts.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senator from \nWest Virginia not only for his support on this project but for his \nwillingness to work hard, to work together to find bipartisan \nsolutions, whether it is this legislation or other legislation. That is \nwhat it is incumbent upon us to do. It is not easy, but we have to be \nwilling to engage in the hard work it takes to get to this legislation, \nto get these solutions in place for the American people.\n  I again thank the Senator for his leadership. I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with the Senator and our colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to come to good solutions. That is what this effort is all \nabout.\n  I want to turn to the Senator from the State of Montana. The pipeline \nproject goes right through his State. Here is somebody who has dealt \nwith the issue on the House side of Congress and who has the project in \nhis home State. So he is talking on behalf of people where the pipeline \nis right there.\n  I would like to turn to him and ask: What are the people in Montana \nsaying? It is fine for somebody far removed from a project to say I am \nOK or I am not OK with it, but how about the people who are right there \non the site? They are directly affected. Tell us what is the sense in \nthe Senator's home State? What is the Senator hearing when he talks to \npeople?\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I applaud, first of all, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota for his leadership on this most important issue and his \ncommitment to making it a priority for this Senate, the first bill \nintroduced into this Senate. I also applaud the Senator from West \nVirginia; one example of, as we sit in this Chamber today, Republicans \nand Democrats discussing and supporting the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  I reiterate many of the comments expressed by my colleagues and \nconvey the importance of this pipeline, because as the Senator from \nNorth Dakota mentioned and showed on his map, the very first State the \nKeystone Pipeline enters as it comes from Canada is the State of \nMontana. Let me tell you something. It is not just a pipeline. This is \nalso changing the way of life and economic stimulus for our great \nState.\n  I spend a lot of time traveling around the State in my pickup. As I \ndrive around Eastern Montana, where the Keystone Pipeline will travel, \nI recognize this is a lifeline for many of our rural communities. In \nfact, Circle, MT--Circle, MT, is a small town of around 600 people. It \nis located in McCone County. It is one of six Montana counties that the \nKeystone XL Pipeline will run through. Circle, similar to a lot of \nsmall communities in Montana, has experienced the same economic and \npopulation declines that other towns have faced in recent years.\n  In fact, the county has significant infrastructure needs that have \ngone unresolved in the wake of a shrinking tax base. For towns such as \nCircle, the Keystone XL Pipeline is not just about energy. It \nrepresents economic opportunity and hope for the future. You see, \nMcCone County alone would see $18 million in property tax revenue from \nthe Keystone Pipeline construction. That is just in the pipeline's \nfirst year of operation. That is money for neighborhoods. It is money \nfor roads, not to mention the influx of jobs for the area.\n  Another $45 million would be distributed among five other Montana \ncounties, and $16 million would go to Montana's schools and university \nsystems. You see, the Keystone XL Pipeline means lower energy costs for \nMontana families, for our senior citizens, and for small businesses.\n  In Glasgow, MT--I remember traveling in my pickup into Glasgow. I met \nwith the NorVal Electric Co-op. They told me that if the Keystone \nPipeline is approved, they will hold electric rates flat for their \ncustomers for the next 10 years. That is several thousand Montana \nfamilies up in the northeast part of our State.\n  The reason for that is because they will supply electricity to these \npump stations on the Keystone Pipeline. If the Keystone Pipeline is not \napproved, those ratepayers will see an approximate 40-percent increase \nin their utility rates over the next 10 years. That is a potential \nincrease of $480 per year for the average household in Montana.\n  As the Senator from North Dakota mentioned, 100,000 barrels a day of \nthe oil traveling through the Keystone Pipeline will be Montana and \nNorth Dakota oil. That supports the Bakken formation. With the \nrevolution of hydraulic fracturing, what it is creating now is lower \ngas prices at the pump today.\n  Montanans know this pipeline is not just a lofty idea or some kind of \nDC-based rhetoric. It is hope for the people of my State. It is a \ntangible result and a solution that Montanans deserve. I have to tell \nyou, that is why it is so disappointing that once again we are seeing \nthe President and some Senate Democrats playing political games and \nperpetuating the 6 years of gridlock that have held back this job-\ncreating project.\n  Rather than putting the American people first, the President has \nthreatened to refuse the people of Montana their right to determine \ntheir economic future. It took the Canadians just 7 months to approve \ntheir end of the Keystone Pipeline. It has taken this President more \nthan 6 years. That is 6 years without the hundreds of good-paying jobs \nthat will be created in Montana and thousands more across the Nation.\n  That is 6 years without millions of dollars in critical revenue for \nMontana schools, for infrastructure, for teachers. That is 6 years \nwithout the answers and actions that Montanans deserve. I think the \npipeline checks every box of common sense. It is environmentally sound, \nit creates jobs, it is economic opportunity, and it is going to help us \nmove toward North American energy independence.\n  So the question is: Why are we still waiting? The people of Montana, \nthe people of this country have said they have had enough. That is why \nwe are here today speaking in support of this important project. I am \nproud the Senate is taking steps to move forward with the Keystone XL \nPipeline. I know the House intends to do the same shortly. President \nObama can continue to obstruct progress on American jobs and American \nenergy independence, but the American people have sent a strong message \nthat they are ready to remove any roadblocks that President Obama \nintends to put in the way.\n  The time for partisanship, the time for political games is over. It \nis time the Congress and this government gets to work for the American \npeople and starts getting results for this country.\n\n[[Page S43]]\n\nThe polls are clear. Sixty-seven percent of the American people want \nthe Keystone Pipeline approved.\n  Seventy-five percent of Montanans want the Keystone Pipeline \napproved. Prior to serving in Congress, I spent 28 years in the private \nsector, where we were focused on getting results in the real world. It \nseems only in DC are we outside of the real world of doing something \nand getting results on behalf of the American people. That starts with \napproving the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I would like to thank the Senator from Montana again. We \nare hearing from somebody who is there, who is talking to people, where \nthis project is going to be located, one of the States it would pass \nthrough. I thank the Senator for his perspective and for his hard work \nand commend him for being here and for his continued efforts not only \nto work with our caucus but to reach out to the Democratic caucus as \nwell and find common ground on this important issue--something the \nSenator from West Virginia said a minute ago; that is, let's focus on \nthe facts. I think the more understanding we create as to what the \nfacts are, the more this gets done on the merits.\n\n  I turn to the Senator from Wyoming--somebody who has long experience \nwith energy, somebody who comes from an energy State, a State that \nproduces a variety of sources of energy, and pose the same question to \nhim. In terms of focusing on the facts, whether it is the environmental \naspect, whether it is the jobs, whether it is making our country energy \nsecure, talk to us a little bit about the importance of this kind of \nvital infrastructure--projects such as Keystone--for our country.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. First let me thank and congratulate the Senator from \nNorth Dakota for his dogged determination in fighting for these \nAmerican jobs and for energy security for our country. I am so grateful \nfor his hard work. He has really been tenacious in this fight to get \nthis bill past the Senate and to the President's desk.\n  I also congratulate my friend and colleague from Montana. Last fall \nthe American people elected 12 new Republican Senators to work in this \nbody, and he is one of them. I have had the opportunity to travel with \nhim in Montana. He has a great background. He is innovative, and he is \nenergetic. He is going to do a tremendous job not only for his State \nand the Rocky Mountain West but for the entire United States as a \nMember of the Senate. He just took his oath yesterday. We were able to \nhear from him today, and he is going to be a remarkable addition to \nthis body.\n  I know that all of these dozen new Republican Senators are as eager \nas the rest of us in the new Republican majority to start fulfilling \nour obligation to the people we represent. Americans elected a \nRepublican Congress because they wanted a change. They wanted to change \nthe direction that President Obama and Democrats have taken the \ncountry.\n  Under the Democratic leadership over the past several years, the \nSenate was a place of dysfunction and gridlock. More than 40 jobs bills \npassed by the House of Representatives in the last Congress never even \ncame up for a vote in the Senate. Many of those bills had overwhelming \nbipartisan support, just like this one we are debating today. Those \ndays are over. That is a completely unacceptable way to run the Senate.\n  All of us here in the Senate, Republicans and Democrats, have been \ngiven an opportunity to work together and to get things done. That is \nwhat the American people told us on election day, that is what they are \nexpecting from us, and I believe that is what they are demanding of us.\n  The poster child for the gridlock and dysfunction of Washington has \nbeen the Keystone XL Pipeline. For more than 6 years it has been a \nsymbol of out-of-control Washington bureaucracy. The State Department \nhas absolutely refused to do its job and to make any kind of decision \non the pipeline's application.\n  The Keystone XL Pipeline has also been a symbol of gridlock in the \nSenate. A small group of extreme environmentalists with deep pockets \nhas bullied Democratic Members of the Senate to block a bill that would \nmove this important jobs project further.\n  According to the latest figures, America's labor force participation \nrate is woefully low; it is just 62.8 percent. Are Democrats in this \nbody satisfied with that number? Is the President of the United States, \nPresident Barack Obama, satisfied with this pathetic participation in \nAmerica's labor force? I can say that people in my State, Republicans \nall across the country--they are not satisfied. That is why we are \ndetermined to push job-creating legislation such as this Hoeven bill to \nadvance the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  The President said there is no benefit to this important \ninfrastructure project. During a press conference last month, President \nObama actually claimed that the project is ``not even going to be a \nnominal benefit to U.S. consumers.'' Apparently, that is what the \nPresident believes. Well, he is wrong. Just ask the Obama \nadministration's own State Department. It says the pipeline would \nsupport more than 42,000 jobs. Some of those are construction jobs. \nSome of them are in the transportation field and the manufacturing \nfield. It includes jobs at warehouses, restaurants, and motels along \nthe route. Does President Obama think that a good job is not even a \n``nominal benefit'' to the Americans who could get those 42,000 jobs \nfrom this pipeline?\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, there are already 19 \npipelines operating across U.S. borders. Why is this the one that \nsuddenly offers not even a nominal benefit, according to President \nObama? Why does President Obama refuse to make a decision about whether \nto approve the pipeline? Well, the President has taken a position on \nthis bipartisan bill--according to the White House Press Secretary on \nTuesday, the President will not sign this bill once Congress passes it.\n  The State Department has done one study after another showing that \nthe pipeline would create jobs and that it would have no significant \nenvironmental impact. President Obama has been downplaying those \nbenefits and threatening to veto the bill. That is not Presidential \nleadership.\n  Now Republicans are going to show the leadership that the American \npeople have been asking for and that they voted for last November. We \nare going to bring a bill to the floor and force the President to \nfinally do something by putting it on the President's desk.\n  Democrats have been playing politics with this pipeline bill. The \nRepublican majority will now get it done. We are going to allow a vote \non this project. We are going to allow Senators to offer amendments. \nWhat a unique situation in the Senate. We are going to let everyone say \nwhich side they are on. This will be a bellwether decision. Are Members \nof the Senate in favor of 42,000 jobs for American workers or are they \nin favor of more Washington delay? Democrats will have a chance to make \ntheir arguments. The extreme opponents of this project will make \nmisleading claims to try to discount the pipeline's benefits, and they \nwill try to stoke people's fears. We have seen it all before.\n  At the end of the day, here is what this all comes down to--four \nthings:\n  No. 1, the Keystone XL Pipeline will support more than 42,000 jobs in \nthe United States.\n  No. 2, it will be a private investment of $8 billion--not taxpayer \nspending, private spending.\n  No. 3, it will have minimal effect on the environment.\n  No. 4, the pipeline is actually safer than other methods of getting \nthat oil to market.\n  Congress should approve this pipeline and pass this bill and the \nPresident should sign it.\n  The Keystone XL Pipeline is a job creator. It has bipartisan support. \nIt has been stuck in Washington's bureaucratic gridlock.\n  It is interesting. When I listen to and think of the President and \nhis comments about jobs and what the impact is going to be, it makes me \nthink of what the president of the Laborers' International Union of \nNorth America said in the summer 1 year ago. He was scheduled to \ntestify today at the Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing--a \nhearing that now the minority, the Democratic acting leader, Senator \nDurbin, objected to having yesterday. He objected to just a hearing and \na discussion.\n  It is interesting. There was a press release from the president of \nthe union,\n\n[[Page S44]]\n\nwho was quoted on the subject of the economic benefits associated with \nthe construction of the pipeline. Terry O'Sullivan said:\n\n       The President [President Obama] seems to dismiss the \n     corresponding economic opportunities that would benefit other \n     laborers, manufacturers, small businesses, and communities \n     throughout Keystone's supply chain.\n\n  He said:\n\n       The Washington politics behind the delay of the Keystone XL \n     pipeline are of little concern to those seeking the dignity \n     of a good, high-paying job. We renew our call to the \n     President [President Obama] to approve this important, job-\n     creating project without delay.\n\n  This is what a job is. It is about someone's dignity, their identity, \nand their self-worth. People take a lot of personal pride in their work \nand in their job. I think we ought to approve it. I am ready to vote \nfor it.\n  The American people have been clear: They are tired of Washington's \ngridlock and delay, and they are tired of the direction President Obama \nhas been taking this country. The American voters demanded change, they \ndemanded action, and this Republican Congress is going to deliver just \nthat.\n  So I say to my friend and colleague from North Dakota--and I see that \nthe chairman of the Senate energy committee has arrived--thank you both \nfor your leadership. To the Senator from North Dakota, former Governor \nthere, thank you for your leadership on energy in North Dakota. And to \nthe senior Senator from Alaska, the chair of the energy committee, \nthank you specifically for your leadership. I look forward to working \nwith both of you specifically on this project and on additional issues \nthat will bring American energy security and jobs to our Nation.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his comments today \nand for his continued hard work in support of the issue. I look forward \nto working with him again to get this done for the American people.\n  I turn to our leader on the energy committee, the chairman of the \nenergy committee, the Senator from Alaska, who understands energy. She \nis from another State that produces a huge amount of energy for this \ncountry, wants to produce more, and can produce more but only with the \ninfrastructure to do it. Isn't that what we are talking about here \ntoday? This country can have more jobs, more economic growth, and more \nenergy that we produce right here at home. But, Senator, don't we need \nthe infrastructure to move that energy as safely and as cost-\neffectively as possible?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. To my friend and colleague from North Dakota, it is \nall about infrastructure.\n  In Alaska, my home State, we have boundless supplies of oil and \nnatural gas, but until we were able to build that 800-mile pipeline \nacross two mountain ranges to deliver oil from Alaska's North Slope to \ntidewater in Valdez, that oil didn't do anybody any good. Today,the oil \npipeline in Alaska is less than half full.\n  So we are working to try to figure out how we can do more as a State \nto contribute more to our Nation's energy needs, to allow us as a State \nto be producing more for the benefit not only of our State but of the \nNation as well, but we are held back by policies that limit us. So it \nis policies and it is infrastructure. It is absolutely infrastructure.\n  We are trying to move Alaska's natural gas to market as well. But, \nagain, if we don't have the infrastructure, it sits. It stays. It \ndoesn't benefit consumers, it doesn't create jobs, and it doesn't help \nany of us out.\n  So Keystone truly is about infrastructure. I thank my colleague from \nNorth Dakota for leading on this issue for years now and for \nreintroducing the legislation, S. 1, the first bill to be filed in the \nSenate this year. It will be among the first bills to pass in this new \nCongress and appropriately so. This is a measure that not only enjoys \nbipartisan support in the Senate, it enjoys broad support over in the \nHouse, and it enjoys support across our Nation for great reason. So why \nare we where we are? Why are we looking at this situation and saying \nthere is so much frustration going on?\n  Senator McConnell has promised to allow open and full debate on the \nKeystone XL Pipeline project, the legislation in front of us. I think \nwe are looking forward to it. As the chairman of the energy committee, \nI am looking forward to robust debate on Keystone XL and what it will \nprovide for this country in terms of jobs and in terms of \nopportunities.\n  We are all frustrated. We are all frustrated by a President's \ndecision--or unwillingness, really, to make a decision about this \npipeline. It has been 2,301 days and counting since the company seeking \nto build it submitted an application for this cross-border permit--\n2,301 days. That is more than 6 years ago.\n\n  Yesterday the President was finally able to make a decision. He \nissued his statement of administration policy. In his statement he says \nthat by advancing this measure, it would cut short consideration of \nimportant issues.\n  Excuse me, Mr. President--cut short a process that has been underway \nfor over 6 years? That is amazing to me. Again, when we talk about \ndecisions, let's get moving with this.\n  The President seems to be advancing some pretty interesting things \nwhen it comes to the energy discussion. He was quoted in an interview \njust this morning in the Detroit News. He basically told Americans that \nwe are enjoying lower energy prices right now, but we had better enjoy \nthem fast because they are not going to last.\n  He said we have to be smart about our energy policy. I am with you \nthere, Mr. President. We do have to be smart about our energy policy. \nBut to think the suggestion is just enjoy low prices while they last, \ntake advantage of the sunshine--no. Mr. President, your energy policies \nneed to make sense for today, for the midterm, and for the long term. \nFor the long term and for the short term we need to make sure we have \ninfrastructure that will allow us the energy supply that is so \nimportant to this country. It amazes me we would be so defeatist with \nthis approach.\n  We have an opportunity in this Congress. We had an opportunity this \nmorning in the energy committee. We had scheduled a hearing on the \nKeystone XL Pipeline. We were going to hear testimony on original \nlegislation to approve Keystone XL as we did last year on a bipartisan \nbasis. But as Members in the body know, there was objection to that \nunanimous consent. We had to postpone the hearing. I quite honestly was \nsurprised. It would have been nice to know an objection was coming \nbefore we had organized the hearing, before we had invited witnesses, \nbefore we had completed all the preparation. We are going to do our \nbest in our committee to adhere to regular order. I hope our colleagues \nwill work with us.\n  I wish to introduce for the Record some of the testimony we received \nfrom the three witnesses who graciously agreed to participate in our \nhearing we had scheduled for this morning.\n  Andrew Black, president and CEO of the Association of Oil Pipe Lines, \ndescribed pipeline safety issues and the gains Keystone XL would bring \nto the American economy in terms of jobs and payrolls. An excerpt from \nhis testimony is as follows:\n\n       While there is much controversy associated with the \n     Keystone XL Pipeline, the facts are that pipelines are the \n     safest way to transport crude oil and other energy products. \n     A barrel of crude oil has a better than 99.999 percent chance \n     of reaching its destination safely by pipeline, safer than \n     any competing transportation mode.\n\n  A second witness we had invited was David Mallino, legislative \ndirector of the Laborers' International Union of North America. In his \ntestimony he explored the positive jobs impact of the pipeline and \nresponded to some environmental concerns. Here is an excerpt from Mr. \nMallino's testimony:\n\n       Regardless of characterizations by the project's opponents, \n     it is indisputable that jobs will be created and supported in \n     the extraction and refining of the oil, as well as in the \n     manufacturing and service sectors.\n\n  We also invited Greg Dotson, vice president for energy policy at the \nCenter for American Progress. He submitted his testimony in opposition. \nWe made sure we had opposition testimony presented as well. He \ndiscussed climate change. He responded to the arguments in favor of \nKeystone. While he may be an opponent of the pipeline and as usual \nwould have been outnumbered by the supporters of the project, I will \nstill reference his testimony for the Record.\n  A copy of the testimony of Mr. Black, Mr. Mallino, and Mr. Dotson\n\n[[Page S45]]\n\nmay be found on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee Web site.\n  I do believe that had we been allowed to hold the hearing this \nmorning, we would have heard very strong bipartisan statements in \nsupport of Keystone XL from many members of our committee. The majority \nof our committee supports this pipeline and is already cosponsoring \nthis bill.\n  I will close my comments by assuring members of this body, we are in \nday 2 of this 114th Congress. This is not going to be our only debate \non energy legislation over the years. I know it has been a long 7 years \nsince we have had comprehensive energy legislation. A lot has changed. \nA lot of people have great ideas to improve and reform our policies, \nand I welcome those ideas. I am looking forward to the debate, to \nadvancing these proposals through the energy committee. I think we can \nmake significant progress on supply and infrastructure, on efficiency, \non accountability. Those areas in particular should be the forum or the \nfocus of an energy bill that we would hope to report out.\n  We are going to work hard on the energy committee. We are planning on \nlegislating. Keystone XL is a natural point for this Congress because \nit has been delayed for so long, 2,301 days. It is clear this President \nis not going to make a decision on this, so the Congress needs to make \nit instead.\n  I look forward to coming back to the floor in a couple days when we \nhave S. 1 officially in front of us. We are going to have good debate \non it. I look forward to working with my colleague who has been so \ndetermined on this issue for so long. His leadership has been key in \ngetting us here, but we need to finish it. We need to make the connects \nso we can move the resource and provide jobs for this country and for \nour allies and friends in Canada.\n  I again thank my friend and look forward to these next couple days \nand the next couple weeks where we will have an opportunity to put this \nbefore the American people on the floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska for her \nleadership on the Energy Committee and also for her willingness to work \nin an open way on these important issues.\n  Across this body, on both sides of the aisle, there should be a deep \nappreciation for her willingness to bring these bills forward so we can \ndebate them and we can offer amendments and we can build the kind of \nenergy future for this country our people so very much want to have.\n  The Senator from Alaska is somebody who lives and breathes this topic \nwhen we talk energy--somebody who is truly committed to it but truly \ncommitted to an open dialogue on all types of energy, giving everybody \nan opportunity to weigh in and build the best energy plan for our \ncountry that we possibly can.\n  So I extend my thanks to her and also my appreciation, and likewise \nsay I look forward to working with her on this issue and on so many \nimportant energy issues.\n  I wish to turn to my colleague from the State of North Dakota and ask \nher for her perspective on why this project is so important for our \ncountry and for the energy future of our country.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota.\n  I rise to join my colleagues on the other side who represent States \nthat know a little bit about energy and certainly my colleague from \nNorth Dakota who has led this effort from the first day he arrived in \nthe Senate.\n  It is no big surprise because we know we can have much oil out there \nand we can know where the reserves are, but if we don't have the \ninfrastructure to move that oil to market, what it does is drive up \nprices. I haven't checked today, but oil price is below $40 a barrel. \nIf someone doesn't think that is supply-demand economics 101, they \ndon't understand what is happening. The fact is we have known reserves \nin places such as North Dakota and Alaska, we have produceable reserves \nin Canada, and we have an opportunity to continue to develop these \nresources in a way that benefits in an incredible way American \nconsumers.\n  Think about what is happening for the average American family today \nwhen they fill up at the pump, and think what that means and how that \nwill ripple through our economy as discretionary income grows. But that \nis only possible when we have a known supply that is moveable, it is \ntransportable, it is in fact capable of reaching its market or reaching \nthe refinery. That is what we are talking about when we are talking \nabout North American crude oil.\n  We are going to hear a lot of stories about this debate about how \nthis crude oil is more dangerous to the environment, how it is \ndifferent than Bakken crude. Guess what. It is different than Bakken \ncrude, but it is not different than the crude refined in refineries in \nTexas, where we will be displacing crude that is refined from \nVenezuela, and we are going to be replacing it with crude that is \nproduced by our friends to the north, Canada.\n  So infrastructure is a huge part. In fact, that is why, when \nSecretary Moniz declared the Quadrennial Energy Review, he looked at \nnot just where is the supply and the future of supply of energy, he \nfocused on transportation of energy because that is a huge part of our \nchallenge.\n  As we look at the Keystone XL Pipeline--and we say Keystone XL \nbecause a lot of people don't know we already have a Keystone Pipeline. \nWe already have a pipeline that is bringing oil sands from Canada into \nthe United States for refining. A lot of people don't realize this is \nthe second pipeline that will be named Keystone, and it is a pipeline \nthat has been in process for literally a decade, from their planning \nprocess to the time they actually ask for a permit.\n  I am going to address some of the concerns of some of my colleagues \nas we hear them so we can kind of lay the groundwork.\n  We frequently hear the Keystone XL Pipeline will be exporting, and \nall of the oil that is coming down will find its way directly into \nChina. That gets said all the time, and guess what the Washington Post \ngave it: three Pinocchios. It is not true.\n  It is going to get refined. It is going to get refined in the United \nStates of America, it is going to displace Venezuelan crude, and it is \ngoing to find its way into the American markets and continue to provide \nthat supply that is in fact today driving down costs. So let's get rid \nof the first argument that this is going to somehow not benefit \nAmerican consumers, that this is going to somehow find its way onto a \nbarge immediately upon arrival into the gulf. That is the first thing \nwe need to be talking about, which is let's actually have a fact-based \ndiscussion about what this pipeline is.\n  The second argument we will hear is that this somehow will have a \nhuge effect on climate and on climate change, and for those reasons \nalone it ought to be rejected. Let's take a look at what the experts \nwho have repeatedly looked at this very issue--because one thing we \nknow that I think is beyond dispute when we talk to the officials in \nCanada, is that we are going to produce oil sands oil from Canada, \nregardless of whether we build a pipeline. That oil is going to find \nits way into the transportation system and quite honestly is going to \nburden our rail transportation system because we haven't figured out \nhow to build a pipeline.\n  So all those who want to confuse the issue about the pipeline versus \nthe development in Canada of the oil sands, let's separate it. Let's \nlook at what in fact is the decision before the United States of \nAmerica; that is, the decision of whether it is in our national \ninterest to approve a permit for a pipeline.\n  I will say this over and over again as we pursue this debate: This is \na pipeline and not a cause. So many people have talked about it, and I \nthink in some ways this process has gotten exaggerated on both sides. I \nmean it is going to be a panacea and prevent all unemployment or it is \ngoing to be the worst thing--an Armageddon for the environment. And you \nknow what, this is a pipeline. This is a transportation system. This is \nan essential part of the infrastructure to bring an important fossil \nfuel into our country so that it can be refined and utilized by the \nAmerican people. And by the way, knowing those reserves are there, \nknowing that we have the reserves we have in the Bakken, and knowing \nthat we are developing more untraditional sources of supply has driven \nthe price down and has created the situation we have today that is \nsaving consumers millions and billions of dollars in our country.\n\n[[Page S46]]\n\n  The second thing I want to say is people say we have to respect the \nprocess. I respect the process as part of what I have done my whole \nlife--I am a lawyer. So you hear repeatedly about due process and \nhaving to go through due process. Occasionally, the process is broken--\n6 years to site a pipeline.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). The time reserved for the Senator \nfrom North Dakota has expired.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I ask unanimous consent to exceed for 5 minutes to wrap \nup the colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Back to the process. When you look at 6 years, we \nfought World War II and defeated the greatest evil known to mankind, \nAdolf Hitler, in 4 years, and we cannot site a pipeline in 6 years. The \nprocess is broken.\n  The other issue that is raised is that the pipeline is somehow going \nto disrupt what is happening in Nebraska. I think the Senator from \nNorth Dakota was absolutely correct to put as part of this bill a \nprovision in that says that all bets are off if Nebraska reverses the \ndecisions that were made in Nebraska. But somehow that is getting \nforgotten in this debate.\n  So we are going to have a lot of hours of debate, I think, on \nKeystone XL Pipeline. We are going to have a lot of amendments.\n  I am grateful for the opportunity to go back to regular order. I am \ngrateful for the opportunity to talk about amendments. But I want so \nbadly for us to have a reasoned and fact-based debate--not an emotional \ndebate but a debate that basically puts this pipeline issue in \nperspective.\n  I want to congratulate my colleague from North Dakota for the success \nin raising this issue and bringing this issue to an early debate. I \nhope that we will be able to move this along and that we will be \nsuccessful in getting enough people to provide the momentum to achieve \nready approval.\n  Finally, I want to say why it is so important that we do it now. \nThose of us who live in the northern tier, we know what construction \nseason is, and you cannot put pipeline in the ground in September and \nOctober--not without a lot of additional costs with which we have \nalready burdened this pipeline. We need to get this decision done, get \nthis going in the spring as early as possible so plans can be made and \npeople can begin their construction season and we can begin to \nrationally address the infrastructure needs for development of our \nenergy resources in North America.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I want to thank my colleague from North Dakota for \nspeaking on the important points she made, and that is that the energy \nwe are producing in this country is helping consumers at the pump by \nbringing down prices.\n  I want to turn to my colleague from Kansas who wants to close this \ncolloquy and address the very point that we need this infrastructure to \nkeep doing that, to benefit our consumers at the pump.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank my colleague, Senator Hoeven, for leading this \ncolloquy and I thank the distinguished Senator from North Dakota for \nher remarks.\n  In the Washington Times today, Jack Gerard, the President and CEO of \nthe American Petroleum Institute said:\n\n       Falling oil prices have empowered the United States and \n     weakened OPEC and Russia. The result is that increased U.S. \n     production in North Dakota has ``fundamentally reordered the \n     world's energy markets.''\n\n  This is a national security issue. This is an issue where Russia--I \nthink the break-even point for them is about $110 a barrel. Right now \nit is at $48. They never dreamed this would happen. Their entire \neconomy is at stake, and hopefully it will cause Mr. Vladimir Putin to \nstart thinking about some of his adventuresome antics around the world.\n  In addition, the pipeline represents not only everything that the \ndistinguished Senator has brought out but it is a symbol that says that \nwe are going to go ahead with all of our energy production. We are \ngoing to go ``all of the above'' here. This is not either-or with green \nprojects or fossil fuels or whatever. So if you vote for the pipeline \nyou are voting for something that really affects our national security.\n  Think about potential exports to Europe. They could be less dependent \non Russia and so Vladimir does not have his choke hold on them, if you \nwill. There is a lot going on with regard to this issue that people \nhaven't thought about.\n  Additionally, the President told us at a meeting with a group of \nRepublicans 2 years ago--2 years ago--that he would make a decision \nbetween 2 and 3 months and that it was just a matter of tying down some \nlegal matters. Now he says he is not for it and obviously he will never \nbe for it. You can make whatever conclusion you want to make about \nthat, but it is not a good conclusion. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senator from \nKansas, and with that we will wrap up the colloquy. I would like to \nthank my colleagues, and we will be back.\n  Again, we are looking to work with all of our colleagues here in an \nopen process to offer amendments and pass legislation that is important \nfor the American people.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and with that I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order the time until 4:15 \np.m. will be controlled by the Democratic leader or his designee.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Thank you, Mr. President. I take this time--and some of \nmy colleagues will be joining me--to express concerns about the first \nmajor bill that has been brought to the floor under the Republican \nleadership dealing with the Keystone Pipeline.\n  I want to start first by talking about the so-called urgency for us \nto take this issue up and circumvent the normal process. The normal \nprocess would be for this matter to continue through the regulatory \nreview, which is there to protect the public interest. To short-circuit \nthat in an unprecedented way and for Congress to approve a site for a \npipeline is not the way it is done.\n  In order to consider this there must be some urgency. First, let me \njust share with my colleagues what the American people are experiencing \nwith the price of gasoline at the pump. It is at a historic low over \nthe last 5 years, with $2.19 the average price for gasoline at the \npump. So there is certainly no urgency if we are talking about trying \nto get more oil in the pipelines for the cost of energy. By the way, I \nthink we all understand that our actions here in this Congress will \nhave very little to do with the availability of oil in the near term. \nIt would take some time to construct the pipeline and for it to have an \nimpact on the level of oil that is available.\n  The second issue that I find somewhat puzzling with regard to the \nurgency of this issue--and some of my colleagues have pointed it out on \nboth sides of this issue--is that there is already a pipeline that is \navailable that could be used. Admittedly, it is not as efficient as \nwhat they are trying to do with the Keystone, and that is to make tar \nsand, the dirty oil we have, more economically available and feasible \nto be transported. That makes little sense under today's economics and \nthe price of gasoline makes it even more hard to understand. \nConstruction of this pipeline and the approval of this Congress will \nhave very little to do with the consumer availability of energy here in \nthe United States.\n  Now, compound the fact that we are talking about Canadian oil, the \ndirtiest oil--the tar sand oil--that is being transported through the \nUnited States because Canada doesn't want to transport it through their \nown country because of their concerns on the environmental side and \nwhich ends up in Texas at the Port Arthur, TX, refinery. Now for those \nwho are not familiar, that is a foreign tax zone which is tax-free. So, \ntherefore, the oil can go into the international marketplace in a very \neasy manner. Valero, which is one of the potential users--consumers of \nthis oil--is building export facilities in order to handle more exports \nto the international communities. None of us can speak with any \ndefinitive judgment as to how much of this oil will in fact end up in \nthe United States, but the fact that they are transporting it to a \nsouthern port--they are not transporting it to a refinery in the \nMidwest, which would be a lot closer and a lot cheaper--is a clear \nindication this oil will end up in the international marketplace and \nwill have very little to do\n\n[[Page S47]]\n\nwith energy security in the United States. I think we have to make that \nclear.\n  We are bypassing the normal process to allow Canadian oil to enter \nthe international marketplace more efficiently with risk to the United \nStates and very little benefit. Why are we doing this? We hear it will \ngive us jobs. I am for job creation. I would like to see us work on a \ntransportation bill where we could create millions of jobs in a far \nmore harmonious way than we can with Keystone. I am for clean energy \npolicies which will create great permanent jobs in the United States. \nBut the job creation estimates for the Keystone Pipeline are that it \nwill create literally a few thousand temporary construction jobs. They \nare not permanent jobs. There are only a handful of permanent jobs. So \nit isn't about creating jobs, and it is not about energy security in \nthe United States.\n\n  What is this all about? There is very little benefit compared to the \nrisk factors in the United States. Let me talk about the risk factors \nwhich give most of us concern. The environmental risk factors have us \nthe most concerned. Tar sand is a multitype of product that is \nliterally mined and processed into a crude oil which is very thick and \ndirty. There are different ways to get to the tar sand, but one way to \nget to the tar sand is to take the topsoil off the property and mine it \nthrough a strip mining process. That has been done in Canada, and it is \nstill being done in Canada, causing tremendous environmental damage. It \nis, in and of itself, a process that most of us would want to avoid. \nYet this legislation does nothing to prevent that type of processing of \nthe tar sands. Tar sands produce a very thick oil product that can only \nmake its way through the pipeline by it being processed, and it creates \nadditional risk factors because of the way it is processed.\n  There have been oil spills of the tar sands product. We have seen it \nin Arkansas and we have seen it in Michigan. It caused devastating \ndamage. It is not easy to clean up. It is not like normal crude. It \ncauses permanent-type damage to a community, as we saw most recently in \nMichigan. So there are risks associated with taking Canadian oil in an \neffort to make it easier to reach the international marketplace, \nunlikely to end up in the United States, creating few permanent jobs. \nFrankly, a lot of us don't quite understand this.\n  As I said, it is dirty. The use of this tar sands oil produces a much \nlarger carbon footprint than other crude oil, causing additional \nproblems in dealing with climate change. We have a serious issue with \nwhat is happening to our environment. I am proud to represent the State \nof Maryland. Most of the people in my State live in coastal areas. They \nknow the consequences of global climate change. They understand it. \nThey know what is happening along the coast, and they know we are at \nrisk. They understand the fact that we have inhabitable islands in the \nChesapeake Bay that have disappeared and are disappearing. They \nunderstand that our seafood crop, the blue crab, is threatened because \nthe warming water affects the sea grass growth which is critically \nimportant for juvenile crabs to survive. They understand the risks and \nwant us to be responsible in dealing with climate change. They also \nknow that we are getting a lot more extreme weather in the east coast \nof the United States and throughout our country.\n  They know on the west coast. They are getting dry spells and \nwildfires. They understand the risks. They understand the cost to \nAmerica of not dealing with climate change issues. The costs involve \nnot only direct damage that is caused but also in the global \nconsequences of climate change.\n  So we are worried about our carbon fingerprint. We are proud the \nUnited States is joining other countries in dealing with climate \nissues.\n  I applaud the work of President Obama, in the most recent \ninternational meetings, when he dealt with climate change issues. We \nneed to do a better job.\n  Why are tar sands an issue? Because tar sands produce more carbon \nemissions than other types of oil. It is about 81 percent higher than \nthe average use of crude oil and 17 percent higher than the well-to-\nwheels basis of producing oil. That is a concern. That translates into \nmillions and millions of cars--the difference between that and having \nmillions of cars on the roads. It is an important part of our \nleadership.\n  If we are trying to establish international credibility and then we \nfacilitate more of this dirty tar sands oil, what message does that \nsend? What type of cooperation should we expect to receive?\n  I am trying to figure out why this is the new priority of the \nleadership in the Senate. Why is this the very first bill to come to \nthe floor of the Senate when, as I pointed out earlier, there seems to \nbe no urgency. I have been told it has been delayed and delayed and \ndelayed. The reason it was delayed is because the construction \noperating firm changed the routes of the pipeline. They had one route \nmapped out--and no alternative routes--but didn't check to make sure it \ndidn't violate State laws. Now they are wondering why it is taking so \nlong. It is taking so long because they had to change the route. It is \nnot the governmental process that is slowing this down, it is the fact \nthat the proposers of this route did not have their ducks lined up in a \nrow before they submitted the route that could be approved. We are \nstill not sure about that.\n  As I said earlier, for Congress to dictate where a pipeline should be \nis wrong. That is not our role. We should let the regulatory process, \nwhich is there to protect the public, go forward. It would also trample \non States rights. There are some serious legal challenges pending in \nState courts as to the actions of a Governor dealing with a location \nissue. That should be resolved by the courts, and we are pretty close \nto having that ruling. It is very unclear to me what impact this \nlegislation would have on States rights as it is currently being \nlitigated in the State court. Why are we doing that?\n  The delays have been caused because of the way this pipeline was \nsuggested. The regulatory process that would protect the public safety \nis moving forward. Considering oil and gasoline prices at the pump \nthere is no urgency. There are serious environmental risk issues.\n  I understand the State Department report has been mentioned \nfrequently. Look at the State Department report and look at what it is \nsaying about the price for oil. The per barrel price of oil was a lot \nhigher when they did that report. Lower costs have a major impact on \nwhat we are talking about here.\n  I urge my colleagues to let the process go forward. I thank the \nPresident for spelling out his concerns and his desire to let the \nregulatory process reach its conclusion, let the State court decision \ngo forward as to what the State believes is the right thing to be done \nhere. I believe all of that will give us a much better process than us \ntrying to substitute our judgment for what should be done through a \nregulatory process.\n  I am going to close by quoting from one of the individuals, Ben \nGotschall, from Nebraska, who has been very active on this issue. He \nsaid:\n\n       The Cowboy Indian Alliance shows our cooperation and our \n     working together in mutual respect. That shared bond proves \n     that we pipeline fighters are not just a few angry landowners \n     holding out, or environmentalists pushing a narrow agenda. We \n     are people from all walks of life and include people who have \n     been here the longest and know the land best.\n\n  I think that is pretty instructive. This is a broad coalition that is \nconcerned about the actions that are being contemplated in the Senate--\nactions that would overrule landowner rights, actions that would take \naway State rights, actions that would shortcut regulatory process, \nactions that help private companies directly without taking into \naccount the regulatory protections that are provided under law.\n  It seems rather unusual that this would be the very first issue where \nwe could work together in a bipartisan way to expand opportunities for \nenergy in the United States. Clean energy produces a lot more jobs, and \nwe could be talking about incentives so we could have a larger \nproduction of clean energy in the United States. Democrats and \nRepublicans would clearly work together to come up with ways we could \nhave more efficient use of energy.\n  Democrats and Republicans could clearly work together in that regard. \nThere are so many areas where we could work together and show the\n\n[[Page S48]]\n\nAmerican people that we understand their frustration with Congress's \nfailure to deal with many of the issues in the last Congress, but \ninstead it looks as though we are picking an issue that is more about \nspecial interest than it is one that will help deal with an energy \nproblem in the United States and has the potential to broaden our \nenvironmental challenges in the United States.\n  For all of those reasons, I hope my colleagues will reject this \napproach and let us go back and work together to find a common way to \nhelp us deal with our environment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I seek recognition to speak for 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, the issue we are going to be debating over \nthe next 2 weeks in the United States is really a story about two \ngasoline stations.\n  In July of 2008, the average price of gasoline in America was $4.11 a \ngallon. In January of 2015 in the United States of America the price is \n$2.21 a gallon. That is great for every driver across our country, and \nthat is great for Americans who buy home heating oil. They are saving a \nlot of money this winter and the predictions are that it will continue \nthroughout the rest of this year. That is great.\n  However, it is not great for the oil companies. It is not great for \nthe Canadians. It is not great for Wall Street. They are not happy with \nthis incredible benefit that is now flowing to Americans all across our \ncountry who now have a gasoline station that has $2.21, on average, as \nto what people will pay.\n  What does the Keystone XL Pipeline truly stand for? It truly stands \nfor the Keystone ``export'' pipeline. That is right. What the Canadians \nwant to do is to basically construct a straw through the United States \nof America, bring that straw down to Port Arthur, TX, which is a tax-\nfree export zone, and then export the oil out of the United States.\n  Why would they want to do that since they advertise that it is all \nabout North American energy independence? There is a simple reason. The \nprice of tar sands oil in Canada right now is getting $13 less per \nbarrel than it would get in the United States, but it is $17 less than \nif they can get it into ships and send it around the world. That is the \nvery simple economic strategy of the Canadians.\n  How do I know this? Because during a hearing in the House of \nRepresentatives I asked the head of the pipeline for TransCanada: Would \nyou accept an amendment to keep all of the oil here in the United \nStates of America? He said: No.\n  By the way, I asked the same question of the head of the American \nPetroleum Institute. He said: No.\n  There is a lot of false advertising going on here. On one hand they \nsay this is great for American energy independence. On the other hand, \nwhen we say let's have an amendment on the floor of the Senate that \nwill keep the Keystone oil here in the United States, they say: Oh, no. \nThey are absolutely opposed to that.\n  Logically, we have to reach the conclusion that their goal is to get \nthe extra $17 per barrel which they will get if they can start selling \nit to China, Latin America, and other parts of the world. That is the \nplan. There are no two ways about it.\n  By the way, that should be their plan. That is what their \nresponsibility is--it is to the shareholders of their companies.\n  What is the strategy for the American driver? That is whom we have a \nresponsibility to. We need to make sure they get the lowest possible \nprice. My goodness. They have been tipped upside down and had their \nmoney shaken out of their pockets at gas stations all across our \ncountry for years, and finally the day of deliverance has arrived and \nthey have $2.21, on average, for the price of a gallon of gas, and now \nwe are told the price of oil is too low. We have to get it back up \nagain. Of course, the best way of accomplishing that is to start \nexporting oil because the less there is in North America, the higher \nthe price will be for American drivers and for American home heating \noil consumers. It is a very simple plan.\n  It is not about helping Americans at the pump. It is about pumping up \nthe prices so oil companies will have new profits. It is very simple. \nIf it is not that, then just accept an amendment that keeps all the oil \nhere. It is a simple thing to do, and then the rhetoric matches with \nthe reality of what is going to happen. The oil should stay here, but \nthey will not accept that, and they have made that clear.\n  This is all part of a wish list we are going to see on the Senate \nfloor for the rest of this year. This is the Big Oil wish list of 2015. \nWe start with the Keystone ``extra large export'' Pipeline to take oil \nand send it out of the country. Then they want to lift the ban on the \nexportation of U.S. crude oil, which is now on the books--a ban on U.S. \ncrude oil. This is Canadian oil. There are no laws against that. Then \nthey want to begin exporting our natural gas, even as consumers and \nbusinesses and natural gas vehicle firms are enjoying record-low \nprices, which in turn is transforming the American manufacturing sector \nand our relationship with natural gas in America. They essentially want \nto declare war on the Environmental Protection Agency and their \nauthority to protect Americans against pollution and to make sure the \nfuel economy standards of the vehicles which we drive continue to rise \nand rise.\n  Honestly, if we want to tell OPEC we are serious and keep them awake \nat night, then we should keep the oil here so the prices will drop, and \nwe also need to increase the fuel economy standards and consume and \nimport less oil. But that is not going to be the agenda that comes out \nhere on the Senate floor from the majority. It is going to be just the \nopposite. In a way, that is why this first debate is actually a preview \nof coming attractions of what will be happening out here on the floor \nof the Senate throughout the course of this entire year.\n  There is kind of a Keystone kabuki theater that is debuting this \nafternoon on the Senate floor. The reality is this bill will never \nbecome law. The President is going to veto this bill. There are not \nenough votes to override the veto. So instead what we have is just a \npreview of this entire agenda, notwithstanding the fact that they are \nnot going to be supporting a national renewable electricity standard or \ndramatically increasing the energy efficiency laws in our country or \nmaking sure the Canadians finally have to pay their taxes for the oil \nliability trust fund which they are now exempt from. American oil \ncompanies have to have a trust fund--in the event there is an oil spill \nin the pipeline--but the Canadians don't have to have a trust fund. \nOver 10 years, that is $2 billion that American companies have to pay, \nwhich Canadians don't have to pay, to make sure that something is done \nto protect against oilspills.\n  Back when the Democrats took over the House and Senate in 2007, we \nworked together to put together a comprehensive energy bill. What was \nin it? Dramatically increasing the fuel economy standards of the \nvehicles in our country, having a new biofuels law to expand that \nproduction, and making sure that energy efficiency in America was \nenhanced dramatically. We worked on a bipartisan basis, and President \nBush, a Republican, signed that bill because it was done in a \nbipartisan, ``all of the above'' approach.\n\n  That is not what this is all about. This is not ``all of the above''; \nthis is ``oil above all.'' That is the strategy the Keystone Pipeline \nembodies--shouts. It is not balanced. It is not where we should be as a \ncountry.\n  So I say let's have an amendment to the bill that keeps the oil here \nin the United States. Let's have this debate here on the floor. Let's \nmatch up the rhetoric of the oil stays here with protection of the \nAmerican economy and the American driver within the reality that we \nvoted for that to keep it here. Let's have that debate. I think it is \nimportant because otherwise the Canadians and the American Petroleum \nInstitute will continue to engage in false advertising about where this \noil is going to be used.\n  So from my perspective, this is the dirtiest oil in the world that is \ngoing to contribute mightily to an expansion of global warming. We know \nthat 2014 was the warmest year ever recorded in history--\nnotwithstanding the fact that it snowed here in Washington, DC, \nyesterday--the warmest year in history. That\n\n[[Page S49]]\n\nis what I think the green generation out there knows as they look at \nthis issue. What are we going to do to make sure we avoid the \ncatastrophic consequences of a dangerously warming planet?\n  We have to engage in preventive care of this planet. There are no \nemergency rooms for planets. We have to engage in preventive care to \nmake sure we do not pass on this ever-increasing danger to future \ngenerations. We are going to get a chance here to debate this. The \nKeystone Pipeline is a good example of how there is not, in fact, a \nbalanced policy.\n  I asked for an amendment on the floor so that we can debate whether \nthe oil goes through a pipeline from Canada--the dirtiest oil in the \nworld--like a straw, potentially causing environmental catastrophes \nacross our country, and then gets exported around the rest of the \nplanet.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. MARKEY. I think this is the kind of debate the American people \nexpect the Senate to engage in.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, the truth is that despite our rather big \negos, much of what we do in the Senate is pretty quickly forgotten. \nPeople have a hard time remembering what we did 2 months ago or \nyesterday, let alone last year. But I have a feeling that the Keystone \nPipeline bill we are now discussing and decisions that will be made \nabout that bill will not soon be forgotten--not by our children or our \ngrandchildren and not by people throughout the world and, in fact, not \nby history. I believe that decades from now our kids and our \ngrandchildren will scratch their heads and they will say: What world \nwere these people--Members of Congress--living in in 2015 when they \nvoted for this Keystone Pipeline? How did it happen that they did not \nlisten to the overwhelming majority of scientists who told us we have \nto cut greenhouse gas emissions, not increase them? I think our kids \nand our grandchildren will be saying to us: Why did you do that to us? \nWhy did you leave this planet less habitable than it could have been?\n  The issue we are dealing with today is of huge consequence. I fear \nvery much that a majority of the Members in the Senate and in the \nCongress are poised to make a very dangerous and wrong decision. In \nthat light, I am more than delighted that President Obama has indicated \nhe will veto this Keystone Pipeline bill if it is passed.\n  Climate change is one of the great threats not only facing our \ncountry but facing the entire planet. It has the capability of causing \nsevere harm to our economy, to our food supply, to access to water, and \nit raises all kinds of international national security issues.\n  Let me read an excerpt from a letter sent to the Senate back in \nOctober 2009:\n\n       Observations throughout the world make it clear that \n     climate change is occurring, and rigorous scientific research \n     demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted by human \n     activities are the primary driver. These conclusions are \n     based on multiple independent lines of evidence, and contrary \n     assertions are inconsistent with an objective assessment \n     of the vast body of peer-reviewed science.\n       Moreover, there is strong evidence that ongoing climate \n     change will have broad impacts on society, including the \n     global economy and on the environment. For the United States, \n     climate change impacts include sea level rise for coastal \n     states, greater threats of extreme weather events, and \n     increased risk of regional water scarcity, urban heat waves, \n     western wildfires, and a disturbance of biological systems \n     throughout the country. The severity of climate change \n     impacts is expected to increase substantially in the coming \n     decades.\n\n  This statement was signed by virtually every major scientific \norganization in this country, including the American Association for \nthe Advancement of Science, the American Chemical Society, the American \nGeophysical Union, the American Institute of Biological Sciences, the \nAmerican Meteorological Society, and many other scientific \norganizations.\n  Scientists are not the only people warning us about the danger of \nclimate change. Hear what the Department of Defense has to say about \nthe impact of climate change on international and national security. \nWhat they point out--and I think what every sensible person \nunderstands--is that when people are unable to grow the food they need \nbecause of drought, when flood destroys their homes, when people \nthroughout the world are forced to struggle for limited natural \nresources in order to survive, this lays the groundwork for the \nmigration of people and international conflict. That is what the \nDepartment of Defense tells us.\n  Now, given all of the scientific evidence and given the concerns \nraised by our own Department of Defense and national security experts \nall over the world and given the fact that the most recent decade--the \nlast 10 years--was the Nation's warmest on record, one would think that \nwhen the National Climate Assessment warns us that global warming could \nexceed 10 degrees Fahrenheit in the United States by the end of the \ncentury--can we imagine this planet becoming 10 degrees Fahrenheit \nwarmer and what this means to the planet? When sea levels have already \nrisen by nearly 7 inches over the last century and are expected to rise \nanother 10 inches to 2.6 feet by the end of the century--when all of \nthat is on the table, one would think this Senate would be saying: All \nright, we have an international crisis. How do we reverse climate \nchange? Instead, what the debate is about is how we transport some of \nthe dirtiest oil in the world and thereby cause more carbon emissions \ninto the atmosphere.\n  I suspect our kids and our grandchildren will look back on this \nperiod and say: What world were you living in? Why did you do that to \nus?\n  It would seem to me that what we should be debating here is how we \nimpose a tax on carbon so that we can break our dependence on fossil \nfuel. That is what we should be discussing, not how we increase carbon \nemissions. We should be discussing what kind of legislation we bring \nforward that moves us aggressively toward energy efficiency, \nweatherization, and such sustainable energies as wind, solar, and \ngeothermal. That is the kind of bill that should be on the floor. We \nshould be having a debate about legislation that makes our \ntransportation system far more efficient, that expands rail and helps \nus get cars and trucks off the road. We should be having a debate about \nhow we can create the kind of automobiles that run on electricity and \nmake them less expensive and how we can get cars running 80 to 100 \nmiles per gallon. Those are the kinds of debates and that is the kind \nof legislation we should be having on the floor, not how do we expand \nthe production and the transportation of some of the dirtiest oil on \nthe planet.\n  In my view, the U.S. Congress in a very profound way should not be in \nthe business of rejecting science because when we reject science, we \nbecome the laughingstock of the world. How do we go forward? How do we \nprepare legislation if it is not based on scientific evidence? And to \nsay to the overwhelming majority of scientists that we are ignoring \nwhat they are telling us and we are going to move in exactly the wrong \ndirection I think makes us look like fools in front of the entire \nworld. How do we go forward and tell China and India and Russia and \ncountries around the world that climate change is a huge planetary \ncrisis at the same time as we are facilitating the construction of the \nKeystone Pipeline?\n  So I am delighted the President will veto this legislation if it \nhappens to pass the Congress. Our job now is not to bring more carbon \ninto the atmosphere; it is to transform our energy system away from \ncoal, away from oil, away from fossil fuel, and toward energy \nefficiency and sustainable energy. That should be the direction of this \ncountry, and we should lead the world in moving in that direction.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Alexander, Mr. Bennet, Mr. Booker, Mr. Burr, and \nMr. King pertaining to the introduction of S. 108 are printed in \ntoday's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint \nResolutions.'')\n\n[[Page S50]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in his first legislative message to the \n89th Congress in 1965, 50 years ago I believe this month, President \nJohnson laid out what would become a key marker in the legislative \nfight for Medicare and Medicaid. Ultimately, the bill was passed in \nJuly 1965. President Johnson signed it in Independence, MO, I believe \nat the home of former President Truman.\n  President Johnson, in his legislative message to the House and Senate \nin 1965 said:\n\n       In this century, medical scientists have done much to \n     improve human health and prolong human life. Yet as these \n     advances come, vital segments of our population are being \n     left behind--behind barriers of age, economics, geography or \n     community resources. Today, the political community is \n     challenged to help all our people surmount these needless \n     barriers to the enjoyment of the promise and reality of \n     better health.\n\n  Fifty years later we have made historic improvements to our health \ncare system, thanks in large part to a couple of things: No. 1, medical \nresearch, funded both by taxpayers and often by drug companies, \nfoundations, universities, and others; and No. 2, because of social \ninsurance programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\n  Before the passage of Medicare--listen to these numbers--30 percent \nof our Nation's seniors lived below the poverty line, only half our \nNation's seniors--at this time 50 years ago, early in 1965, had health \ninsurance, and insurance usually only covered visits to the hospital in \nthose days.\n  Now, thanks to Medicare, 54 million seniors and people with \ndisabilities have access to guaranteed health care benefits.\n  Let me share a letter a constituent named Donald, from Toledo, OH, \nwrote to me last Congress, when the House of Representatives threatened \nto turn Medicare into a voucher program as part of its budget proposal. \nDonald wrote:\n\n       Thank you for your efforts to keep Medicare from being \n     privatized. At the age of 63, I am going to be eligible for \n     Medicare before too long and looking at the affordability of \n     health care is critical. If Medicare is privatized, we will \n     not be able to afford it any more than we can afford private \n     insurance today.\n\n  That is the whole point. The reason there is a government health care \nprogram, the reason there is social insurance, is because people, as in \n1965, only half the people in the country had any kind of health \ninsurance.\n\n       It is a little disconcerting to know that after working all \n     our lives and living comfortably, that in our retirement \n     years we will either have to try to find full-time employment \n     to be in a position of affording Medicare, privatized \n     Medicare. I am sure I don't need to tell you how difficult \n     finding a job is these days when you are an older citizen.\n       I know normally I am writing you from the opposing side, \n     but this time we definitely see eye to eye.\n\n  Ralph Waldo Emerson, 150 or 160 years ago, said that history has \nalways been a fight between conservators and innovators. There is a \nlegitimate place in society for both, creating the tension that moves \nour country one way or the other. Conservators want to protect the \nstatus quo. They want to preserve privilege and want to hold on to \ntheir wealth. Conservators fundamentally don't believe the government \nshould be involved in ensuring a decent standard of living. \nInnovators--what we might call today progressives--understand our \nsociety is only as strong as its most vulnerable members.\n  If we go back to the key congressional votes--the key congressional \nvotes, not necessarily final passage--to advance debate of a Medicare \nbill in 1965, most Republicans voted no. Then it was the John Birch \nSociety that opposed it. Today, 50 years later, it is the tea party \nthat opposes social insurance.\n  Some of the most privileged interest groups in Washington opposed the \ncreation of Medicare. But they were wrong. As I said earlier, 30 \npercent of seniors lived below the poverty line prior to Medicare. \nMedicare helped to cut the poverty rate in half by 1973, only 8 years \nafter its passage.\n  We see the same attacks today. Budgets proposed in the House of \nRepresentatives over the past several years have tried to dismantle \nMedicare, by and large by privatized vouchers, to help offset the cost \nof tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. They would privatize the \nprogram and undermine its guaranteed benefits.\n  Ohio's seniors have worked hard, they have paid into Medicare, and \nthey deserve a program that truly meets their health care needs. They \ndeserve better than the underfunded voucher that would put them at the \nmercy of the private insurance industry. Thankfully, we have been able \nto block this plan in the Senate. We will continue to do that.\n  Interestingly, the Affordable Care Act has provided significantly \nenhanced benefits for Medicare beneficiaries. In my State alone more \nthan 1 million Ohio seniors have gotten free--meaning no copay, no \ndeductible--preventive care benefits under the Affordable Care Act.\n  If you are on Medicare and your doctor prescribes an annual physical \nor asks that you be given an osteoporosis screening, a diabetes \nscreening--all the things doctors order for their patients for \npreventive care--those are provided under the Affordable Care Act and \nunder Medicare, no copays, no deductible.\n  Many of the efforts to privatize and voucherize Medicare mean taking \naway preventive care, taking away prescription drug protections added \nto Medicare under the Affordable Care Act. Others want to raise the \nMedicare eligibility age from 65 to 67.\n  I was in Youngstown, OH, a couple of years ago at a townhall. A woman \nstood up and said: I hold two jobs, and I am barely making it.\n  I think the two jobs were close to minimum wage, so she was probably \nmaking $8 an hour in one and $8.50 in the other. She was a home care \nworker and doing something else. She had tears in her eyes.\n  She said: I am 63 years old. I need to stay alive until I can get \nhealth insurance.\n  This was maybe 5 years before we passed the health care law. Imagine \nbeing 63 years old and your goal in life is just to find a way to stay \nalive so you can have health insurance.\n  Some geniuses in the House and maybe in the Senate think it is a good \nidea to raise the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67. Just because \nwe dress like this and have jobs that aren't all that physical other \nthan walking back and forth from our offices to the floor, just because \nwe have this kind of lifestyle and just because we are privileged \nenough to get to dress like this and get paid well and get to do these \nincredibly privileged jobs as Members of the Senate--there are a whole \nlot of people in this country whose bodies won't last until they are \n67. They can't work until they are 67 to get Medicare. They are working \nat Walmart, standing on floors all day, they are home care workers, \nthey are working at fast food restaurants, they are construction \nworkers.\n  Both my wife's parents died before the age of 70 in large part \nbecause of the work they did, the kind of heavy, strenuous work, and \nthe chemicals they were exposed to and all that. So when I hear my \ncolleagues propose to raise the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to \n67--and I know they say we can't sustain these entitlements, whatever \nthat means. What they really want to do is raise the eligibility age. \nTo raise the eligibility age for Medicare to 67, they need to take \nAbraham Lincoln's advice. His staff wanted him to stay in the White \nHouse and win the war, free the slaves, and preserve the Union. \nPresident Lincoln said: No. I need to go out and get my public opinion \nbath.\n  What did he mean by that? He meant: I have to go out and talk to \npeople. So when I hear Senators say they want to raise the Medicare \neligibility age from 65 to 67--whether they are in Gallipolis or Troy \nor Zanesville, OH--when I hear people say they want to raise the \nretirement age or the Medicare eligibility age--what I think when I \nhear Senators say that is they are not out talking to real people.\n  We know we can do a number of things to improve and strengthen these \nprograms so future generations can continue to move into retirement \nyears with a sense of security.\n  Last Congress I was an original cosponsor of the Medicare Protection\n\n[[Page S51]]\n\nAct, which would make it difficult for Congress to make changes that \nwould reduce or eliminate guaranteed benefits or restrict eligibility \ncriteria for Medicare beneficiaries. With several of my Senate \ncolleagues, I will submit a resolution commemorating the 50th \nanniversary of the creation of Medicare and Medicaid, a reminder that \nthese programs must be protected, not weakened, not rolled back, not \nundercut, not privatized, not voucherized--if that is a word--a \nreminder that all these programs must be strengthened.\n  As we move forward in protecting social insurance, we should remember \nPresident Johnson's words when speaking to the House and the Senate 50 \nyears ago: Whatever we aspire to do together, our success in those \nenterprises--and our enjoyment of the fruits that result--will rest \nfinally upon the health of our people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/07/senate-section/article/S51-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S51]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  TRIA\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I think it is important to understand that \nTRIA is legislation that we need, which is the Terrorism Risk Insurance \nAct. We passed a bill with only two or three ``no'' votes in the Senate \nlast year. But what the House of Representatives has done looks like \nwhat they will probably do in the future: They have taken legislation \nwhich is really important to the country, which passed the Senate on a \nbipartisan basis, and they have loaded on to that legislation \nextraneous provisions.\n  Frankly, that is what people in this country are tired of--when \nlegislation that must pass and has overwhelming support is about to \npass, special interest groups come and add their language to it. That \nis exactly what happened here. If the House of Representatives gets its \nway, if Wall Street gets its way, it is the first step to begin to \nslice away at the Dodd-Frank legislation.\n  When I hear a number of my colleagues in this body and down the hall \nin the House of Representatives say they support progrowth policies and \nderegulation, what they are saying is they want to roll back the \nprotections for consumers in Dodd-Frank, the Wall Street reform bill, \nand they want to weaken the provisions in the rules that govern Wall \nStreet behavior. I don't quite understand it because what I do \nunderstand is less than a decade ago, because of Wall Street greed, \nbecause of Wall Street overreach, because this body and the body down \nthe hall weakened the rules on Wall Street, and because the previous \nadministration appointed regulators who would really look the other \nway, we had terrible damage done to our economy. About a mile north of \nthe ZIP Code I live in in Cleveland had the highest number of \nforeclosures of any ZIP Code in the United States of America because of \nderegulation, because of Bush appointees to many of the bank regulatory \nbodies.\n  So I caution my colleagues, as we accept this legislation, the TRIA \nlegislation--and I assume we will--to understand that is not going to \nbe behavior that we are going to sanction in the Senate, where they \ntake must-pass legislation and they find ways to attach to this \nlegislation rollback of consumer protections and weakening of Wall \nStreet rules. That is what got us into this. We can't let these special \ninterests who have so much power in the House of Representatives, who \nhave so much influence in the House of Representatives--we can't let \nthem have their way on legislation like this.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to highlight a Presidential message \nthat was delivered to the Congress 50 years ago today. But before I go \ninto the importance of Medicare and Medicaid--facts that I think all my \ncolleagues and I can agree to--I would like to take a brief look back \nat where America has been and recall what life was like for so many of \nthose who were poor, disabled, vulnerable, and uninsured or unlucky \nbefore these programs, which today are a lifeline, Medicare and \nMedicaid, were in place.\n  Those were the days of the ``poor farm'' and the ``almshouse.'' These \nwere the places where the poor and uninsured would go for care, very \noften on the outskirts of town--out of sight, out of mind. It was not a \nhappy choice, and more often than not for seniors and the poor it was \nthe only choice.\n  These were places that provided care and was often very basic and \nvery often it carried a stigma. The accommodations were sparse at best. \nIn return for health care and housing, residents were expected to work \non an adjoining farm or do housework or other chores to offset the \ncosts of their stay. This was the primary option for someone whose \nextended family could not offer care--or didn't want to offer care. \nThis was not thousands of miles away from the shores of our country, it \nwas right here in the United States. Not very many Americans remember \nthose days. In fact, I think it is fair to say hardly anybody under 50 \nremembers those days.\n  President Johnson submitted his message to the Congress 50 years ago \ntoday, and fewer than half of America's older people even had any \nhealth insurance. In that era, it was not uncommon for older people who \ngot an illness to be treated like second-class citizens, and many older \npeople without family to care for them and no health care coverage \nended up destitute and would often end up on our streets.\n  It was a time no one wants to revisit. It is a time sociologists \ndescribed as another America--where 40 to 50 million Americans were \npoor and lacked adequate medical care and were socially invisible to a \nmajority of the population.\n  I bring this up because I wish to spend a few minutes this evening \ntalking about how far America has come. I want to make sure that we in \nthe Congress--as we look to this anniversary of these critical \nprograms, Medicare and Medicaid, and the vivid difference they made in \nthe daily lives of Americans, we should all spend just a few minutes \ntalking about the health care advances we have seen over the years.\n  Here are a couple of facts: Today with rock-solid essential medical \nservices, 54 million Americans--or virtually every senior and those \nwith disabilities--now has access to what we call--and I remember this \nfrom my days as director of the Gray Panthers--the Medicare guarantee. \nIt is a guarantee of secure Medicare benefits for our old people.\n  Medicaid has made a critical difference for 68 million of the \nNation's most vulnerable, including more than 32 million kids, 6 \nmillion seniors, and 10 million individuals with disabilities. Because \nMedicare and Medicaid made health care possible for millions of people, \nthey have also been the catalyst for innovation in treatment that \nbenefits people of all ages. I emphasize that fact because it is often \nnot appreciated that Medicare, as the flagship Federal health care \nprogram, often is the spark, the catalyst for innovations that get \ncopied in the private sector.\n  For example, in the first 30 years of Medicare alone, the Medicare \nProgram helped to reduce deaths from heart disease by one-third for \npeople over age 65. By providing coverage and access for millions, \nthese programs became catalysts for change in how medicine is practiced \nand paid for Americans across the age spectrum and helped us to find \nthe root causes of disease and perfecting better therapies to treat. As \ntime has marched on, these programs evolved and improved and the rest \nof the health care system followed.\n  In 1967, Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment \nprograms, comprehensive services for all Medicaid youngsters under age \n21, was created, and that has helped to improve our country's health, \nstarting with our children. In 1981, home and community-based waivers \nwere established so States could provide services in a community \nsetting, allowing individuals to remain in their home for as long as \npossible.\n  Every State uses this option to facilitate better care and services \nto the Medicaid population, and I think it is fair to say that every \nsingle senior--and this is something I heard again and again and again \nin the those Gray Panthers days--would say: Why can't we\n\n[[Page S52]]\n\nhave the option to have good, quality, affordable care at home because \nit will also save money compared to the alternative, which is \ninstitutional care.\n  In 1983, Medicare took one of many big leaps away from fee-for-\nservice with the advent of a new reimbursement system for hospitals. It \nwas called prospective payment--a system that pays hospitals based on a \npatient's illness and how serious it is and not solely on how much it \ncosts to treat them. This was a radical change at the time. Today it is \ncommonplace and acceptable.\n  In 2003, the prescription drug coverage benefit was added to \nMedicare, providing access to necessary medications to those most \nlikely to need them. As a result of greater access to prescription \ndrugs, senior health has dramatically improved.\n  In 2010, as a result of health care reform, preventive services \nbecame free to patients, prescription drugs became cheaper for \nbeneficiaries who fell into what was known as the doughnut hole, and \nagain Medicare moved further away from fee-for-service, volume-driven \ncare and on to paying for quality and value. Not only was that good for \nseniors, it was good for taxpayers because it helped to extend the life \nof the Medicare trust fund.\n  Finally, in 2012, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid began \nreleasing for the public to use actual claims data. Access to this \ninformation, in my view, is a key element of the challenge with respect \nto understanding the costs of care, the variations and the way medicine \nis practiced across the country. Clearly, access to Medicare claims \ndata is part of the path to improving quality and holding down the \ncosts of health care in our country.\n  These examples are easy to forget--the most recent ones--because now \nthey are commonplace, but that makes them no less remarkable.\n  I will close with one last point that I hope will be part of what \nguides the work of the Senate in this session.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin. He is to \nbe joined by the majority leader, Senator McConnell, shortly.\n  I will just close my remarks with respect to these critical programs \nby pointing out--and I hope it will be remembered frequently as big \nissues are tackled in this Congress--Medicare and Medicaid were \nbipartisan efforts, and the enactment of these programs shows that the \nCongress can craft bipartisan solutions to complex and politically \ndifficult problems. That is what happened in 1965 when the Senate \npassed a legislation creating Medicare and Medicaid by a 68-to-32 vote \nafter the House approved it 3 months earlier on a 313-to-115 vote.\n  As this Congress gets underway, and as the leaders come to the floor \nto discuss a critical aspect of how we move ahead, I hope all of us \ntake a page from that particular playbook. Let us recognize that with \nMedicare and Medicaid there was an opportunity to come together to \ntackle a big issue, and my hope is that this Congress will not use \npartisan tactics when the solutions have to be bipartisan, and that is \nthe lesson.\n  Despite sharp differences and partisanship, the Congress of the days \nI have been speaking of was able to rise above the culture and those \nchallenges to find agreement and make our country a better place.\n  As this new Congress begins, I hope we can use that 50-year-old \nspirit to strengthen, protect, and improve Medicare and Medicaid to \nkeep that guarantee strong, ensure health care to those who need it \nmost, and protect a program that has been a lifeline to millions of \nAmericans.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The acting minority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Oregon for \nreminding us of this 50th anniversary of President Johnson's \nrecommendation to Congress to create Medicare and Medicaid. Today, as \nwe witness 54 million people benefitting in America from Medicare--in \nmy State some 2 million--and 68 million from Medicaid--in my State 3 \nmillion--we understand the importance of this program. Almost half the \npeople who live in Illinois are covered with health insurance by \nMedicare and Medicaid. When we add in the Affordable Care Act, we have \nliterally half the population of my State.\n\n  It is a testament to the fact that when we made a commitment and \nfollowed through on a bipartisan basis, as the Senator from Oregon \nsaid, we created programs that had vibrancy and really served people \nfor a long time.\n  I read something the Senator from Oregon is, I am sure aware, of, \nwhich is that because Medicare was a complete Federal payout, it was \nimplemented throughout the United States almost within a year. It took \n17 years for every State to join the Medicaid Program. It wasn't until \n1982 that the last State joined into Medicaid--Arizona--because there \nwas a State contribution. Look at the experience we have now with the \nAffordable Care Act, where some States are reluctant to join in. So \nthat is part of it.\n  The point I wish to get to and which the Senator made so well is how \nit changed life for senior citizens and for those who were poor. It \ngave them a chance for quality health care that didn't bankrupt them in \nthe process.\n  Medicaid has been a dramatic success. For critics of government \nhealth programs and critics of Medicaid, the 2011 survey found that 70 \npercent of physicians across America accept Medicaid patients. People \nwould believe from some of the critics that the opposite is true. \nSeventy percent accept Medicaid patients. So it is a good program. The \nreimbursement attracts 70 percent of physicians willing to treat them.\n  The last point I will make to the Senator from Oregon particularly, \nif he happens to know a good bookstore, I would suggest he consider the \nnew book by Dr. Gawande entitled ``Being Mortal.'' I am virtually \nthrough it, and he really challenges us to look beyond health care for \nthe elderly to where they are living, how they are living, and how they \nare being treated.\n  So I am hoping we can rise to another level of conversation beyond \nMedicare and Medicaid, celebrating this anniversary but accepting a new \nresponsibility to that generation of seniors who served America so \nwell.\n  I thank the Senator from Oregon for reminding us of this anniversary.\n  I am proud to stand with my colleague Senator Wyden today in support \nof his resolution honoring President Johnson's commitment to creating \nthe Medicare and Medicaid Programs.\n  Fifty years ago today, President Lyndon Johnson sent a message to the \nCongress which he titled ``Advancing the Nation's Health.''\n  In that message the Johnson quoted President Thomas Jefferson who in \n1787 wrote, ``without health there is no happiness. An attention to \nhealth, then, should take the place of every other object.'' Those \nwords were true then, true in 1965, and true now.\n  President Johnson was concerned about the health of our nation \nbecause of the staggering effect that no insurance and chronic disease \nhad on the elderly. At that time, 80 percent of people over 65 were \ndisabled or lived with a chronic disease. Unfortunately, 50 percent of \npeople over 65 did not have health insurance.\n  From his concern and effort came the Medicare and Medicaid programs. \nBoth programs created a social safety net that has improved the lives \nof millions of Americans.\n  Today more than 54 million people are enrolled in Medicare, 2 million \nin Illinois. The vast majority of Medicare enrollees are seniors. They \nreceive quality, affordable, care and access to prescription drugs \nbecause of the President Johnson's commitment. In this new Congress, we \nshould work together to ensure this highly successful program remains \nin place for future generations.\n  Medicaid has been a lifeline for millions of people, especially for \nchildren. Sixty-eight million people are enrolled in Medicaid, 3 \nmillion in Illinois. And thanks to the Affordable Care Act, 600,000 \nbecame newly eligible for the program last year. Medicaid makes it \npossible for more than half of the babies born in Illinois to be \ndelivered with medical care. Some argue that Medicaid isn't working \nbecause physicians refuse to see people in the program. But the data \nsays that isn't true. 2011 data shows that 70 percent of office-based \nphysicians nationwide were willing to see new Medicaid patients. I call \nthat a success.\n  As we remember President Johnson's tireless effort today, we should \nalso keep in mind our commitment to these vital programs and work \ntogether to strengthen them.\n\n[[Page S53]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the 50th anniversary \nof Medicare as well. I commend the remarks of both the senior Senator \nfrom Oregon and the senior Senator from Illinois about this 50-year \nanniversary since President Lyndon Johnson first sent his message to \nCongress that would later become both the Medicare and Medicaid \nPrograms. As was referred to earlier, there are 100 million Americans \nbenefiting, including over 4.8 million in my home State of \nPennsylvania, when we consider both programs together.\n  When President Johnson sent this message, he said:\n\n       Our first concern must be to assure that the advance of \n     medical knowledge leaves none behind. We can--and we must--\n     strive now to assure the availability of and accessibility to \n     the best health care for all Americans, regardless of age or \n     geography or economic status.\n\n  So said President Johnson all those years ago, and how prescient he \nwas and how knowledgeable he was as well to be thinking about the \nfuture and to be considering advances in technology and holding all of \nus to the highest possible standard when it came to health care for \nolder Americans or health care for the poor and for children.\n  We know that in the ensuing 50 years we have strived to make that \nvision of President Johnson a reality, first, of course, with Medicare \nand Medicaid; and then more recently--``recently'' meaning the last 20 \nyears or so--with the Children's Health Insurance Program, known by the \nacronym CHIP; and then followed by, a number of years after that, the \nAffordable Care Act, which included an expansion of the Medicaid \nProgram, providing coverage to millions more Americans.\n  We know that when Medicaid was created in 1965, the U.S. Government \nput forth a promise to ensure that the most vulnerable members of \nsociety would have access to health care. Whether it is our children or \nwhether it is frail, elderly members of our family living in nursing \nhomes or individuals with disabilities, Medicaid ensures they have \naccess to health care. So we have made great strides.\n  Let me quote again from President Johnson:\n\n       Poor families increasingly are forced to turn to \n     overcrowded hospital emergency rooms and to overburdened city \n     clinics as their only resource to meet their routine health \n     care needs.\n\n  Again, President Johnson was way ahead of his time in dealing with \nwhat was then a problem and still remains a problem but less so a \nproblem because of Medicaid.\n  This important lifeline--Medicaid--to health care, having been \ncreated 50 years ago, was strengthened in 2010 and helps ensure that \nmillions of Americans have access to quality, comprehensive health \ncare.\n  We must continue to make sure that we guarantee Medicaid remains \nstrong and provides such needed care to those in our society who often \nget overlooked. We must never forget that Medicaid is the program that \nmany middle-class families and lower income older citizens who are on \nassistance and people with disabilities turn to when they need extended \nnursing home care, sometimes referred to as long-term care. So when it \ncomes to long-term care for poorer families as well as long-term care \nfor middle-class families, often millions of Americans are turning and \nhave turned for their long-term care to Medicaid, and we should \nremember that.\n  As we celebrate this 50th anniversary, let's always ensure that both \nMedicare and Medicaid remain strong programs that so many Americans can \nturn to. We must do our best to be true to Lyndon Johnson's vision \n``that the advance of medical knowledge leaves none behind.'' It is a \nvery important anniversary, and it is a good reminder about our \nobligations in the Senate to protect both Medicare and Medicaid.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with Senator Durbin on behalf of the Democratic leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in the 112th Congress the Senate \nadopted a new funding allocation for Senate committees. This approach \nhas served the Senate for the past two Congresses when the Democrats \ncontrolled the majority. I believe this approach will continue to serve \nthe interests of the Senate and the public, regardless of which party \nis in the majority, by helping to retain core committee staff with \ninstitutional knowledge. This funding allocation is based on the party \ndivision of the Senate, with 10 percent of the total majority and \nminority salary baseline going to the majority for administrative \nexpenses. However, regardless of the party division of the Senate, the \nminority share of the majority and minority salary baseline will not be \nless than 40 percent, and the majority share will not exceed 60 \npercent. It is my intent that this approach will continue to serve the \nSenate for this Congress and future Congresses.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this approach met our needs for the last \ntwo Congresses, and I too would like to see it continue. In addition, \nlast Congress, special reserves was restored to its historic purpose. \nWe should continue to fund special reserves to the extent possible in \norder to be able to assist committees that face urgent, unanticipated, \nnonrecurring needs. Recognizing the tight budgets we will face for the \nforeseeable future, it is necessary to continue to bring funding \nauthorizations more in line with our actual resources while ensuring \nthat committees are able to fulfill their responsibilities. I look \nforward to continuing to work with the majority leader to accomplish \nthis.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a joint \nleadership letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         United States Senate,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, January 7, 2015.\n       We Mutually Commit to the Following for the 114th Congress: \n     The Rules Committee is to determine the budgets of the \n     committees of the Senate.

Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a former member of \nthis Chamber, and note with pleasure the passage of S. Res. 19.\n  Senator Edward Brooke of Massachusetts passed away on January 3, 2015 \nat the age of 95. I was deeply saddened by his loss. I had the \nprivilege of hosting an event last year celebrating America's Black \nSenators. We invited Senator Brooke, but he was unable to attend. We \ndid honor him that day, because as one of the two African Americans to \ncurrently serve in this great body, I know that I stand on the \nshoulders of giants like Senator Brooke and those who have come before \nme in public service. Senator Brooke was a true trailblazer, and those \nof us who followed cannot thank him enough. As the first African \nAmerican Senator to be popularly elected to serve, he was a true \ninspiration.\n  From his service to our Nation beginning as a captain in the U.S. \nArmy during World War II, to his service as chairman of the Finance \nCommission for the city of Boston and then as the Commonwealth of \nMassachusetts' attorney general before coming to the Senate, Senator \nBrooke was a committed public servant. Having served\n\n[[Page S54]]\n\nfor two terms in the Senate, he was a powerful voice for housing reform \nand advancing issues like economic opportunity for all Americans. \nRecognized with both the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2004 and the \nCongressional Gold Medal in 2008, our Nation was truly blessed by his \nlife and accomplishments, and his place in history will stand the test \nof time.\n  May God bless the family of Senator Brooke.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/07/senate-section/article/S54-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S54]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING MARIO M. CUOMO\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I wish to speak about the life and \nextraordinary legacy of former New York State Governor Mario M. Cuomo.\n  Governor Mario Cuomo inspired a generation of Americans to be \nunafraid of idealism. He was a role model for Americans with big \ndreams, and he was a champion for the causes and values that we cherish \nin this country.\n  He was a tenacious competitor on the baseball diamond, the basketball \ncourt, and in the halls of the capitol in Albany, but it wasn't merely \nthe abstract desire to win that drove him. The quest for justice and \nfairness in our country motivated him to act, and he used his pulpit as \na public servant to push for a better world for all Americans.\n  Throughout his career, he spoke powerfully to us about the value of \nequality, and the visionary words of his most famous speech, the Tale \nof Two Cities, still hold true today, decades later.\n  Governor Cuomo was a brilliant and generous mentor, and I was honored \nthat he took a risk and helped me when I was an untested Congressional \ncandidate a decade ago. Whenever we met, he was always kind, \nthoughtful, and always generous.\n  I know that Mario Cuomo's most cherished title wasn't Governor--it \nwas husband and father. He took these roles as seriously as his \ngovernorship, and it is clear that he succeeded in both. He loved his \nwife and children, and he instilled in his sons and daughters an \nunwavering commitment to service.\n  Mario Cuomo was one of the great, motivating, and inspirational \nleaders of our time, and I will always be grateful to him for his \nleadership, his service, and his inspirational mentorship. He was a \nfriend that my family and I truly admired.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/07/senate-section/article/S54-2", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S54]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/07/senate-section/article/S54-3", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S54]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/07/senate-section/article/S54-4", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S54]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:31 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 22.

A bill to direct the Federal Communications Commission to \npromulgate regulations that prohibit certain preferential treatment or \nprioritization of Internet traffic; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for nearly a year now, Americans across the \ncountry have made their voices heard on the critical issue of how we \nprotect an open Internet. Their message has been loud and clear--they \nwant meaningful rules that protect the Internet as a platform for free \nexpression and innovation. Consumers want to see the online space as we \nhave always known it, as a place where the best ideas and services can \nreach users on merit rather than based on a financial relationship with \na broadband provider. Last Congress I joined with my friend in the \nHouse, Representative Doris Matsui of California, to introduce \nbicameral legislation requiring the Federal Communications Commission, \nFCC, to ban ``pay-to-play'' deals on the Internet. Today, I am pleased \nto once again join with her to reintroduce this important bill.\n  When we originally introduced this legislation last June, nearly \n300,000 Americans had commented on FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler's open \nInternet proposal. That number alone would have been an impressive \nlevel of public engagement. Since that time, however, the number of \npublic comments filed at the FCC has swelled to nearly 4 million. As \nthe comments show, consumers are concerned that without meaningful \nrules the Internet will become a place where broadband providers charge \ntolls to websites or applications for them to reach end users. This \nwould represent a fundamental departure from the way in which consumers \nand entrepreneurs interact with the Internet. A two-tiered Internet \nbased on ability to pay would harm the innovative and competitive \nenvironment we have all come to expect in the online world.\n  Like an overwhelming number of the public, I have grave concerns that \na pay-to-play Internet would allow larger companies to squeeze out \ntheir competitors, stifling competition online. A small web company in \nVermont that develops an idea to rival the largest Silicon Valley \ntitans should not have to worry that its access to consumers could be \nblocked because its competitors have a paid arrangement with broadband \nproviders. The next generation of Internet companies and retailers \nshould have the same protections that allowed a company like the \nVermont Country Store to become a thriving online success.\n  Pay-to-play arrangements would also harm consumers, who would not \nhave the assurance that the service they are paying for will provide \nthe speed that they want. Too many Americans currently lack real choice \nin broadband providers, particularly those in rural areas. A pay-to-\nplay Internet could result in whole swaths of the Internet becoming \nfunctionally inaccessible to the customers of certain Internet \nproviders. This is not the Internet we know today, and the FCC or \nCongress must act to ensure that it does not come to pass.\n  The Online Competition and Consumer Choice Act is straightforward. It \nrequires the FCC to establish rules preventing providers from charging \nwebsites for priority access. It also requires rules to prevent \nproviders from prioritizing their own affiliated content or services. \nThese are simple rules to preserve the equal platform we know online \ntoday.\n  This legislation should not be used by opponents of meaningful open \nInternet rules to undermine the FCC's important work to craft open \nInternet rules that will protect consumers and innovators. To the \ncontrary, this bill sets out important policy positions that the FCC \nshould adopt in its current consideration of open Internet rules. The \nFCC should not hesitate to act at its February meeting to ban these \ndeals outright.\n  The importance of an open Internet is an issue that resonates in \nhomes and businesses across the country. I spent significant time last \nyear listening to voices outside of Washington, particularly those of \nVermonters, so that I could hear firsthand about the impact the \nInternet has had on small businesses and consumers. The Judiciary \nCommittee held two hearings on this issue, including one in Vermont, \nwhere I heard exactly these kinds of stories. These are not people \nlooking for a handout or special treatment--these are entrepreneurs and \nconsumers who simply want the Internet to remain an equalizing tool \nregardless of where you live or how deep your pockets are.\n  There should be widespread agreement to prevent special deals that \nharm consumers and dampen online innovation. The FCC and Congress \nshould rightly focus on this timely and significant issue to protect \ninnovation and competition online.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 40\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize preferential treatment for certain imports \nfrom Nepal, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Nepal \nTrade Preferences Act.\n  This legislation is simple and straightforward. It grants duty-free \nstatus to imports of Nepalese garments for a ten year period.\n  I have been a friend of Nepal and the Nepalese people for over 25 \nyears. I have witnessed its political struggle and sadly the \ndeterioration of its ready-made garment industry.\n  The Nepal Trade Preferences Act bill will promote much-needed \neconomic development and contribute to lasting political stability in \none of the world's poorest countries.\n  Allow me to go over some basic facts of everyday life in Nepal.\n  Nepal has a per capita income of $730.\n  Approximately 25 percent of the Nepal's 24 million people live in \npoverty.\n  The unemployment rate in Nepal stands at a staggering 47 percent; and \nmost Nepalese live on $2 a day.\n  The 2005 phase-out of the Micro-Fiber Arrangement, which established \nexport quotas from developing nations, has deeply damaged Nepal's \napparel industry.\n  Instead of continuing to import garments from Nepal, U.S. importers \nhave shifted their orders to China, Bangladesh and other low-cost labor \nmarkets.\n  In fact, the number of people employed by the Nepalese garment \nindustry dropped from over 90,000 people to less than 5,000 today; \ntextile and apparel exports from Nepal to the United States fell from \napproximately $95 million in 2005 to $45 million in 2013; and the \nnumber of garment factories plummeted from 212 to 30.\n  Despite Nepal's poverty and the near-collapse of the garment \nindustry, Nepalese garment imports are still subject to an average U.S. \ntariff of 11.7 percent and can be as high as 32 percent.\n  In essence, we are unfairly taxing the imports of a highly \nimpoverished country that cannot afford it. Taxing textile and apparel \nimports from Nepal, which constitute .01 percent of all U.S. imports, \nmakes no sense.\n  I would point out that U.S. tariffs on Nepalese garments stand in \ncontrast to the policies of the European Union, Canada, and Australia, \nwhich all allow Nepalese garments into their markets duty free.\n  It should come as no surprise, then, that while the U.S. share of \nNepalese garment exports has fallen, the European Union's share has \nrisen from 18.14 percent in 2006 to 46 percent in 2010.\n  The purpose of the ``Nepal Trade Preferences Act'' is to ensure that \nwe provide Nepal with the same trade preferences afforded to it by \nother developed countries. No more, no less.\n  Humanitarian and development assistance programs should be critical \ncomponents of our efforts to help Nepal. I was proud to support the \nPresident's budget request of $77 million for Nepal in fiscal year \n2015.\n  But assistance is no substitute for organic economic development. We \nshould help the Nepalese people help themselves by reopening the U.S. \nmarket to a once thriving export industry.\n  In the end, economic growth and prosperity can be best achieved when \nNepal is given the chance to compete and grow in a free and open global \nmarketplace.\n  With this legislation, the United States can make a real difference \nnow to help revitalize the garment industry in Nepal and promote \neconomic growth and higher living standards.\n  There is no doubt that Nepal has struggled to draft a new \nconstitution and coalesce around a governing majority.\n  While only Nepal can chart its political course, passing this measure \nwould undoubtedly help regenerate Nepal's stagnant economy.\n  Let us show our solidarity with the people of Nepal by passing this \ncommonsense measure.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Nepal Trade Preferences Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALEXANDER (for himself, Mr. Bennet, Mr. Burr, Mr. King, \n        Mr. Isakson, and Mr. Booker):\n  S. 108.

The Senator from Colorado, Michael Bennet, and I have \nbeen working for 1 year to make it easier for the 20 million American \nfamilies who fill out the Federal application form each year in order \nto receive grants and loans for college.\n  The piece of demonstrative evidence that Senator Bennet and I have \nbeen carrying around in Tennessee and Colorado is the Free Application \nfor Federal Student Aid or FAFSA. This is the form that 20 million \nAmericans fill out. It is familiar to many families as it has 108 \nquestions, and it is important to them because about half of the \nAmerican families who have students in college have a Federal grant or \nloan to help pay for college.\n  The problem with the 108 questions is that they are generally \nunnecessary. Senator Bennet and I were at a Health, Education, Labor \nand Pensions Committee hearing. We heard four witnesses representing \ndifferent perspectives in our country saying that we only need two \nquestions to know whether we could make a Federal grant or loan to a \nstudent from Wisconsin who wanted to go to community college with \nroughly 95 percent accuracy.\n  So today we are introducing legislation which is named the Federal \nAid Simplification and Transparency, or FAST, Act. It will turn these \n108 questions into two--one about the amount of family income and one \nabout the size of family. It will free students and their families from \nthe dreaded FAFSA. It will eliminate thousands of hours of busywork by \nguidance counselors, college administrators, parents, and accountants.\n  I will use a specific example. On Friday I am going to Tennessee with \nPresident Obama, who has been attracted to our great State because we \nhave become the first State to say to all of our high school graduates \nthat community college is tuition-free. How can we do that in \nTennessee? Tuition at community colleges, like in some places in the \ncountry, is about $3,600 per year, and the Pell grant can pay up to \n$5,700, but on average needy students receive about $3,300. So for \nabout half the students, there is only a small gap between the amount \nthe Federal Pell grant pays and what tuition costs. Tennessee has \ncommitted to make up the difference.\n  But here is the catch: The major obstacle to Tennesseans who want to\n\n[[Page S62]]\n\ntake advantage of the new Tennessee Promise Program is the 108-question \nform. The president of the community college in Memphis, Southwest \nTennessee Community College, tells me he thinks he loses 1,500 students \na semester because of the complexity of the form. They just don't fill \nit out.\n  So it is a terrific example of how the Federal Government, with good \nintentions, has built up over the years an enormous amount of paperwork \nthat is getting in the way of the single greatest need our State has, \nwhich is to have more of our students better trained. This will help \nthe businesses that are attracted there offering good jobs will be able \nto hire people who are properly trained.\n  In addition to that, our bill does the following things:\n  It not only eliminates the 108 questions and replaces them with 2, it \ntells families the result earlier in the process. For example, if you \nhave a daughter who is a junior in high school, now you will be able to \ngo online and find out--answering two questions--how much money you are \neligible for in grants and loans. Now you have to wait until the second \nsemester of your senior year.\n  The next thing it does is it streamlines the Federal grant and loan \nprograms by combining two Federal programs into one Pell Grant Program \nand reduces the six different Federal loan programs into three--one \nundergraduate loan program, one graduate loan program, and one parent \nloan program--resulting in more access for students.\n  Fourth, it enables students to use a Pell grant in a manner that \nworks for them. They can use it year-round--now they cannot use it for \nthree straight semesters--or at their own pace.\n  Next, it discourages overborrowing. Too many students borrow extra \nmoney they do not need to go to college. For example, under the Federal \nrules a student is entitled to borrow the same amount of money if they \ngo full time as they are if they go half time. That makes no sense. It \nsaddles students with debt they cannot pay back.\n  Finally, it simplifies the repayment options. Now there are nine \ndifferent ways to make repayments. We suggest two.\n  Senators King and Burr have their own bill, which they will be \nintroducing today and talking about a little later, that streamlines \nrepayment options.\n  I have been delighted to work with Senator Bennet. I congratulate \nhim. His background as the Denver school superintendent and as a father \nhas made him a very effective advocate for this effort. We have \nlistened to educators and parents in our own States. The bill has been \nout there now for more than half a year. We have attracted other \nsponsors, including Senator Booker and Senator Isakson. We hope other \nSenators will want to join us.\n  Finally, I would say before going to Senator Bennet that as chairman \nof the Senate committee that handles education--the Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions Committee--we are ready to move on this. As soon as \nwe can finish our work on fixing No Child Left Behind, which we have \nbeen working on for 6 years and have held 24 hearings. In addition, \nalmost all of the members of the current committee were there last year \nwhen we reported a bill--as soon as we can finish that work, we will be \nready to move to reauthorize the Higher Education Act to deregulate \nhigher education starting with the FAST Act and the legislation \nSenators King and Burr have promoted.\n  I thank the Senator from Colorado for his partnership on this. I \nsalute him for his leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I am delighted to be on the floor today \nwith, among others, Senator Alexander, who has worked so hard on the \nbill we are talking about today. Through the Chair, I want to wish him \nwell in his new role as chair of the Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee on which I serve. He is quite right to have said \nthis bill came to us as a result of testimony in front of that \ncommittee by a variety of witnesses but all of whom agreed that the \ncurrent system is completely unwieldy. I would also like to thank the \nother cosponsors--Senators Burr, Booker, Isakson, and King--for joining \nthe efforts and for being here today as well.\n  I first became aware of this problem when I was superintendent of the \nDenver public schools. We had a couple who very generously donated $50 \nmillion for scholarships for kids who were graduating from the Denver \npublic schools and who had applied to college. One of the things we \nlearned in that process was how terrible the process was for filling \nout the financial aid forms for the Federal Government. That was a \nrequirement we had for people to be able to be eligible for this \nscholarship. We literally had to put new rooms in our schools, in our \nhigh schools, and staff them with people in order to fill out these \nforms.\n  Every year tens of thousands of students and parents in Colorado and \nmillions more across the country fill out the FAFSA as part of the \ncollege application process. It is the gateway to financial aid. By \nsome estimates, over 2 million people who are eligible for financial \naid and Pell grants do not get it simply because of the complexity of \nthe form.\n  I ask unanimous consent to show some demonstrative evidence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNET. Here is this year's form. It is a different color than \nthe one we had last year. This is the form a student has to fill out--\n108 questions. This is the instruction manual that goes with the form, \nwhich is something in the neighborhood of 66 pages long. It is very \ntiny print.\n  To be honest, the ridiculousness of this form would be funny if it \nwere not for the lost time, money, and energy our country spends on it. \nHere are some of the examples of the questions families have to put up \nwith on this form. Several times there are questions about income. We \nhave been told by the witnesses we had that we only need two questions. \nThere are a number of questions about income, investments, and assets. \nEach requires notes and instructions which are contained in here.\n  Question 36: What was your and your spouse's adjusted gross income \nfor 2014?\n  Question 37: Enter your and your spouse's income tax for 2014.\n  Question 39: How much did you earn from working in 2014?\n  Question 40: How much did your spouse earn from working in 2014?\n  It is ridiculous.\n  The questions become even more complicated.\n  Question 42: As of today, what is the net worth of your and your \nspouse's investments, including real estate but don't including the \nhome you live in?\n  That is the kind of reaction we get all over the country when we talk \nabout this at home.\n  The instruction form here says, for question No. 43, the net worth of \nbusinesses and/or investments.\n\n       Business or farm value includes the current market value of \n     land, buildings, machinery, equipment, inventory, et cetera. \n     Do not include your primary farm. Do not include the net \n     worth of a family-owned and controlled small business with \n     more than 100 full-time or full-time equivalent employees.\n\n  Just to make it really clear, in dark print, bolded print, it says: \nbusiness/farm value minus business/farm debt equals net worth of \nbusiness. This is as complicated as any tax form.\n  At a time when the demands of the global economy require us to have \nmore college access, not less, it is a shame that this bureaucratic \npiling up of questions is making it harder and harder for people to go \nto college.\n  So I think this is going to be great for our students, to get it down \nto a postcard that has two questions. The estimate is that the time \nsaved by moving away from this existing form is the equivalent of \n50,000 jobs that could be spent actually providing college guidance to \nyoung people who will now have the benefit of knowing, as Senator \nAlexander said so eloquently, what financial aid they will be eligible \nfor in their junior year before they apply to college rather than \nwaiting until their senior year, until they have already been admitted \nto college. That makes no sense to the people we represent, and there \nis a reason for it--it is because it makes no sense.\n  My hope is that this is a bill we will be able to move this year. \nAgain, I thank Senator Alexander for his tremendous leadership.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Bennet.\n\n[[Page S63]]\n\n  I would like to send to the desk the FAST Act that Senator Bennet and \nI are introducing, with the cosponsorship of Senator Booker, Senator \nBurr, Senator King, and Senator Isakson.\n  In this colloquy, I would like now to recognize the Senator from New \nJersey for 5 minutes to comment on the bill, if he would like.\n  Mr. President, following that--the Senator from North Carolina and \nthe Senator from Maine, who are cosponsors of this bill, are here, but \nthey also have a separate bill on income repayments which they will \ndiscuss.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BOOKER. I wish to thank Senators Bennet and Alexander for their \nwork on this legislation. It is going to help our Nation's students \nmake better, smarter, and more-informed decisions about higher \neducation.\n  Historically, the United States has been the leader globally in \nexpanding college opportunity. We understand that an educated workforce \nis essential to our Nation's economic competitiveness. Without highly \nskilled workers, America will not be able to compete in the global \neconomy.\n  The average price of a college degree in the United States is \nclimbing--about $13,856. Please put that in perspective with our \ncompetitor nations, nations that are keeping the cost of college low, \nknowing that their long-term competitiveness as a country depends on \nthe education of their children, nations such as the United Kingdom, \nwhere a college education costs less than half of ours, and Germany, \nwhere kids pay a mere $933.\n  The average American student now is graduating from college with \naround $29,000 in loans. In New Jersey, that is up from an average of \n$27,000 in 2011 and $23,000 and change in 2010. This is unacceptable. \nMounting debt is undermining not only the success of our individual \nyoung people in our country, but it is undermining the long-term \ncompetitiveness our Nation has in a global knowledge-based economy. \nThat is one reason why it is important that we work to make the process \nof obtaining financial aid simpler and more straightforward.\n  We saw the ridiculousness which Senator Bennet held up in the length \nof the form and the explanation document. Well, this has to change. \nThis is something I recognized when I was mayor of the city of Newark. \nWe had classes. Literally we called it, I think, Financial Aid \nUniversity, where we brought experts in just to try to help students \nnavigate all of that. We spent so many resources knowing that for our \nkids from Newark to be competitive, we had to help them navigate this \nlabyrinth of challenging questions and documents that it takes perhaps \na college degree or even more to figure out.\n  When I first came to the Senate about 13 months ago, one of the first \npieces of legislation I offered, having had that experience, was a way \nof simplifying these forms. There is an urgency here because the \nCollege Board estimates that 2.3 million students do not fill out the \nFAFSA form, the free application for financial aid. Because the form is \na gateway to financial aid, having 2.3 million being deterred from \nactually filling it out is a harm to our Nation, not just to those \nindividual students. Many students who qualify for Federal aid skip the \nform because they find it--as we obviously saw--too complex.\n\n  Because eligibility is currently based on income information for the \nyear immediately preceding enrollment, financial aid deadlines mean \nthat tax data is not yet available. As a result, students must \ndetermine how to fill out financial aid questions on the FAFSA form and \ntake additional steps then to submit later the tax documents.\n  We know more can be done to make this process simpler and accessible, \nwhich is why I am pleased. I was really rejoicing when Senator \nAlexander and Senator Bennet showed me there was a way we could work--\neven further than the legislation I introduced in the last Congress--to \nreduce it to two questions--saving time, saving energy, saving stress \nbut even more importantly empowering students to get their education \nand contribute to our economy so that we can compete with those other \ncountries that seem to be doing a much better job than we are in \nkeeping the cost of college low.\n  This bill streamlines the financial aid system, simplifies the FAFSA \nform, discourages overborrowing--which is a problem--and, most \nimportantly, gives students and families better information earlier in \nthe process to enable them to make better decisions for them. This bill \nis a good step.\n  This bill is a great step. I am looking forward to working with the \nhigher education community as well as students and families in New \nJersey on how we can be successful in simplifying this process, \nincreasing access to college and boosting not only enrollment but the \neconomic output of our citizenry.\n  Again, I thank Senator Alexander and Senator Bennet for their work \nand leadership. I am pleased to be with them in this effort, and I look \nforward to continuing the conversation this year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The Senator from New Jersey is known in his State and \nacross the country as a pioneer in education, putting children first.\n  Having his support and advice on this bill will be a great advantage \nin helping it go from the Senate floor through the House to the \nPresident's desk and into law.\n  In 2013 the Congress and President Obama made significant steps \nforward in improving the student loan program--a $100 billion per year \nFederal program to help students go to college. That law created a \nmarket-based, market-pricing system, and it had the effect in that year \nof reducing the rate for undergraduates, cutting it about in half.\n  The two Senators who led that were the Senator from North Carolina, \nMr. Burr, and the Senator from Maine, Mr. King. Senator Burr and \nSenator King have continued to work on student loans, making it easier \nfor students to go to college, easier for them to pay their loans, and \neasier for them to pay them back.\n  We are proud to have them as cosponsors, but they have their own \nlegislation on student loan repayments, which I am pleased to cosponsor \nand which will be a top priority in the Senate HELP Committee as soon \nas we finish fixing No Child Left Behind.\n  I now yield in this colloquy to Senator Burr.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. I thank Senator Alexander and Senator Bennet, and I thank \nthem for what they propose in the FAST Act.\n  As a parent who went through two kids going to college, when I was \npresented that form, I realized I wasn't capable of doing it.\n  I remember a story still today of a dear colleague of mine in the \nHouse of Representatives--many know Sonny Bono. We asked Sonny one day: \nWhy did you come to Congress? How did you get into politics?\n  He said: Well, I became mayor of a city for one reason--because I \nopened a restaurant. When I went to get a sign permit, they gave me 50 \npages to fill out. I didn't graduate from high school, but I figured \nout it was easier for me to run for mayor, win, and make the sign \npermit 1 page than it was for me to fill out 50 pages.\n  That is how he got his start in politics.\n  I might say, as a parent, to be able to--on a post card--apply and \nknow whether I was eligible for my children's student aid would be a \ntremendous thing for all parents.\n  Senator King and I are on the floor to talk specifically about the \nRepay Act.\n  As we have looked at student loans and as the government has become \nthe primary loan component for student loans, what we have seen is that \nthe consolidation of one's loans has dramatically increased in an \nincoherent way. Now, some might say that is exactly what government \ndoes. We say we are going to fix a problem, and we fix it in a way that \nyou don't understand it; it is way too cumbersome.\n  What we have tried to do is we have made an effort to provide more \navenues for or options for children to choose or parents to choose how \nto pay back student loans. What we have done is we have made it as \ncomplicated as the form that Senator Bennet showed, which determines \neligibility.\n  Currently, the Federal Government offers 12 repayment options for \nstudents. Among these 12 options, students are offered a series of \nterms and\n\n[[Page S64]]\n\nconditions that often overlap amongst several other programs with very \nsimilar sounding names and stated benefits. The problem gets worse \nannually.\n  The administration continues to do new regulations every time we see \na problem, and those regulations then overlap with existing regulations \non student loans to where individuals don't know exactly what their \noptions are--what Senator King and I want to do.\n  We will introduce, hopefully later today, the Repay Act. It provides \ntwo options that kids choose from: a fixed-rate option for repayment \nand an income-based option for repayment.\n  We also realize that under the income-based options that are out \nthere today an individual who is married could file as married--filing \nan individual tax form--and their household income isn't considered for \nthe amount they are going to repay on a monthly basis. That is not how \nwe designed it.\n  We designed it so what their income capability was, their repayment \nwould reflect it. In other words, we have people who are gaming the \nsystem today because their one spouse makes a lot of money and one \nspouse doesn't make much, and they pay a minimal amount of monthly \nstudent loan repayments. When they do that, they cheat the other \nstudents behind them because they take money out of the system that can \nbe used for those individuals who desperately need it.\n  The Repay Act streamlines a multitude of loan programs and creates a \nfixed-base and income-based repayment. It does it by consolidating all \nincome-based repayment programs into one repayment program that caps \nborrowing at $57,500 for 20 years and limits to 25 years the repayment \nperiod for loans over $57,500, while ensuring the monthly payments rise \nat a reasonable rate based upon that annual income level--again, the \nhousehold income level.\n  The benefit for students is they will up front have the knowledge \nthey need of what they will expect to pay based upon the amount they \nborrow.\n  We believe this will drive smarter borrowing decisions and will lead \nstudents to limit the amount of debt they take prior to going to \nschool. Behavioral economists argue that when an individual's options \nare less complex and straightforward, individuals are more likely to \nmake rational decisions.\n  Senator King and I believe the changes included in the Repay Act will \npromote those rational decisions that will ultimately lead to smarter \nborrowing that leads to repayment and ultimately healthier financial \nsituations for our Nation's graduates.\n  Why are we here? It is because only 80 percent of our student loans \nare being repaid. That means 20 percent is in default.\n  What we want to do is we want to see kids get a great education. We \nwant to see the ability for that to be paid for, and we want that money \nto be repaid based upon their success in the marketplace. I believe \nthis act will put us on that road to do it.\n  Now, I don't want to pretend, and I don't think Senator King will \npretend, this isn't something that we crafted and created. This is the \nresult of ideas that were put forward by the National Association of \nStudent Financial Aid Administrators, the Lumina Foundation for \nEducation, the Education Finance Council, the American Council on \nEducation, the Young Invincibles, the Institute for College Access and \nSuccess, the New America Foundation, and many other groups.\n  This is truly Congress, the Senate at its best, reaching out to \norganizations that do this day in and day out, just as I think the \nchairman did on the application-card student aid form.\n  We have tried to search the best ideas. From that we have gleaned \nthem and put them into the Repay Act. We will introduce this bill. I \nthank the chairman. It does complement very much the FAST Act.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator King, for his help on the introduction \nof this bill.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from North Carolina. No one was \nmore instrumental in the work in 2013 that reformed student loans to \nreduce the interest rate for undergraduates by nearly half that year.\n  In his State of North Carolina there are many of the best \nuniversities and 2-year colleges in the country, and I know education \nhas been and is foremost for him.\n  I look forward to working with him, the members of our committee and \nevery Senator on the floor, as we go through the process with a full \nand honest debate on important issues using an open amendment process. \nThen I hope we are able to work with President Obama again this year in \nthe same way we were in 2013 to achieve a result.\n  A forceful advocate for that result in 2013 was the Senator of Maine \nwho has the advantage of having been a Governor, Senator King, and we \nwill let him have the final say in this colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. KING. Economic development and jobs is what unites us in this \nbody. That is what we all want. That is what everyone here is striving \nto achieve--jobs and opportunity for the people of this country.\n  There are many factors that contribute to that, and we can discuss \nand debate all of them this year. I suspect that we will. There is \ninfrastructure, tax policy, smart regulation, and regulatory reform. \nBut the one about which there is very little dispute is education.\n  The single greatest job creation and economic development act in the \nhistory of the United States was the GI bill, subsequent to World War \nII, which opened the doors of college and higher education, to millions \nof Americans and literally built the middle class in this country. \nEducation is what it is all about and education is even more important \nnow than it was then.\n  There was a time in this country when you could graduate from high \nschool and get a pretty good job in a mill, make good money, have two \ncars in the garage, and lead a successful life. That is much more \ndifficult today. Even those jobs in those mills require more education.\n  In my State of Maine we did a survey a few years ago that showed 70 \npercent of the jobs had people touching a computer every day. That is \nwhat takes an education, and to get an education takes access.\n  I will share one rather chilling statistic in terms of the \ncompetitive nature of the 21st century. We are engaged in competition. \nWe are engaged in competition with the entire world and they want our \njobs.\n  A little statistic is the top 8 percent of high school graduates in \nChina are equal in number to all the high school graduates in the \nUnited States. Think about that for a minute--the top 8 percent in \nChina are equal in number to all the high school graduates of the \nUnited States.\n  We are going to have to work to compete, and the only way we are \ngoing to be able to do that is if we work smart, and the only way we \nare going to be able to work smart is with education and expanded \nopportunity and access to education. Higher education in the 21st \ncentury, I would submit, is more important than ever.\n  There has been attention to this over the years by State governments, \nlocal governments, by parents, by students, and by the Federal \nGovernment, going back to the midst of the Civil War, when one of the \ngreat education bills of all time was passed, the land grant college \nsystem in 1864. Support for research at our great universities has been \na Federal effort.\n  Student loans have been a part of what we have tried to contribute to \nthis system for many years. Then, of course, we have Pell grants, which \nhave enabled millions of students to find opportunity in higher \neducation. But, ironically, the very programs that are designed to \nincrease access to higher education have, themselves, become \ninaccessible.\n  Senator Alexander and Senator Bennet made a dramatic showing today \nwith these ridiculous forms. When you read the forms the conclusion is: \nI guess my kid isn't going to go to college.\n  We have created a system where you need an accountant, a lawyer at \nyour shoulder in order to fill out a form for financial aid, and the \npeople who need it the most are the least likely to have the resources \nto bring those experts to bear on the process. Programs designed to \npromote access have themselves become inaccessible.\n\n[[Page S65]]\n\n  So that is what today is all about. That is what our discussion is \nall about. It is about accessibility and simplification. Senators \nAlexander and Bennet and Booker have brilliantly articulated the power \nof the idea behind the FAST Act: reduce the questions to just a few \nsimple questions to get the necessary information. You don't need 80 \npages of instructions to answer two questions. It will open the doors \nto literally millions of students whom we need. This isn't nice to \nhave; this is need to have. This is an economic security and a national \nsecurity question. We need these people. The current form is \ndiscouraging the very people we want: those who may or may not take the \nplunge into higher education. The simple fact is you shouldn't need an \naccountant to figure out whether you can get financial aid to go to \ncollege.\n  The complementary bill Senator Burr and I are introducing today, \nalong with Senator Rubio and Senator Warner, is called the Repay Act. \nThe bill Senator Alexander is speaking to is about accessibility and \nsimplification on the front end. Our bill is accessibility and \nsimplification on the back end, dealing with the issue of repayment. It \nbasically reduces eight current options--and I have a chart that would \nmake Rube Goldberg blush in terms of the complexity of the current \noptions--to two. One is a 10-year fixed repayment plan, which certain \nstudents can select if it makes sense for them, and the other is a \nvariable income-driven plan.\n  As Senator Burr pointed out, the ideas for this bill came from across \nthe spectrum--from students, financial aid offices, financial aid \nadministrators, Republicans, Democrats, and President Obama in his most \nrecent budget.\n  By the way, one of the groups Senator Burr mentioned is the Young \nInvincibles. I would like to be a Young Invincible. I would like to see \nwhere I can join that group because sometimes I don't exactly feel that \nway. But this is an idea I think is invincible because it just makes so \nmuch common sense.\n  Borrowers can switch between the fixed payment and the variable \npayment depending upon their circumstances, but they never pay more \nthan 15 percent of their disposable income.\n  I think another important provision is if a borrower is totally and \npermanently disabled and the loan is forgiven, they do not have to pay \ntax on the loan that is forgiven. Under current law, they have to pay \nan income tax on the phantom income of the loan that is forgiven.\n  I particularly thank Senators Warner and Rubio for joining us on this \nbill. They had their own bill on this repayment structure last year, \nand they have generously decided to join forces with us on this bill, \nand I believe that will add substantial weight to our work. They have \nalready made contributions to the drafting of the bill, and I think \nthat will help us considerably as we move forward with this \nlegislation.\n  Quite often around here we talk about things we can't do--we can't \ndo--problems we can't fix. This is something we can do. This is a human \nproblem of our making by layering programs over one another and having \nthe bureaucratic rules build over the years to the point where, as I \nsaid, it has created an accessibility problem for the very program \ndesigned to give access.\n  These are important bills. They are not necessarily the bills that \nare going to get the headlines or cause all the fights and the \nfriction, but these are the quiet kinds of changes that will change our \ncountry. They will provide opportunity for our students, for our \nfamilies, and for our country. I am proud to join Senator Alexander, \nthe chair of the HELP Committee, and Senator Burr particularly, who has \nworked so hard on this bill. I think we have a combination of bills \nthat will make a difference in people's lives and in the future of this \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, as the colloquy is concluding, I want \nto thank the Senators from Maine and New Jersey for their leadership \nand the Senator from North Carolina. I can assure them the King-Burr \nbill, with the support of Senator Rubio and Senator Warner, will be \ncombined with our bill and be front and center on the agenda of the \nHELP Committee as early as we can this year. As far as I am concerned, \nit is the next priority after we fix No Child Left Behind. I am hopeful \nwe can bring it to the floor by the spring, give the full Senate a \nchance to consider it, combine it with action of the House and work \nwith the President, just as we did in 2013.\n  I am going to turn to Senator Bennet for just a minute to let him \nhave a concluding word, but I wanted to say this. As I mentioned, \nPresident Obama is going to Tennessee on Friday. He is going to \ncelebrate an initiative Tennessee has taken by itself to say to all \nhigh school graduates: Two years of community college education is \ntuition free. Of course, that is based upon the Pell grant. The State \njust makes up the difference, which isn't that much.\n  I am going to have an opportunity to say to the President: Mr. \nPresident, the one thing the Federal Government can do to make it \neasier for more Tennesseans to take advantage of Tennessee Promise is \nto get rid of the FAFSA. Because the President of Southwest Tennessee \nCommunity College in Memphis says 1,500 students a semester are not \nenrolling in community college, who ought to be going, just because \nthey and their families are intimidated by this form or can't fill it \nout.\n  There is no excuse for that, and we are going to fix that. Maybe the \nsolution is three questions, maybe it is four questions, but surely it \nis not 108 questions, and 70 or 80 pages of instructions, wasting the \ntime of administrators, guidance counselors, parents, accountants, \nstudents, and discouraging Americans from taking advantage of \neducation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a one-page \nsummary of the FAST Act.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Financial Aid Simplification and Transparency (FAST) Act\n\n       A Bill introduced by Senators Alexander and Bennet to \n     simplify the federal financial aid programs and application \n     process.\n       What the Bill Does:\n       Eliminates the Free Application for Financial Student Aid, \n     or FAFSA, by reducing the 10-page form to a postcard that \n     would ask just two questions: What is your family size? And, \n     what was your household income two years ago?\n       Tells families early in the process what the federal \n     government will provide them in a grant and loan by using \n     earlier tax data and creating a look-up table to allow \n     students in their junior year of high school to see how much \n     in federal aid they are eligible for as they start to look at \n     colleges.\n       Streamlines the federal grant and loan programs by \n     combining two federal grant programs into one Pell grant \n     program and reducing the six different federal loan programs \n     into three: one undergraduate loan program, one graduate loan \n     program, and one parent loan program, resulting in more \n     access for more students.\n       Enable students to use Pell grants in a manner that works \n     for them by restoring year-round Pell grant availability and \n     providing flexibility so students can study at their own \n     pace. Both provisions would enable them to complete college \n     sooner.\n       Discourages over-borrowing by limiting the amount a student \n     is able to borrow based on enrollment. For example, a part-\n     time student would be able to take out a part time loan only.\n       Simplifies repayment options by streamlining complicated \n     repayment programs and creates two simple plans, an income \n     based plan and a 10-year repayment plan.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Presiding Officer for the time, I thank my \nfellow Senators, and I yield for the final words of the Senator from \nColorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I again say thank you to the chairman of \nthe HELP Committee for all his leadership and his work dealing with \nthis form. We have been after this for about 1 year.\n  This might be a quiet bill, as Senator King said earlier, but in my \ntravels around the State I can't find anybody who is unhappy with this \nlegislation except for the people who have already filled out the form, \nwho are asking: Where were you 5 years ago when I was having to do this \nfor my students or where were you when I was having to fill this out \nfor my college education?\n  It makes absolutely no sense. I am sure many of these questions are \nwell intentioned, but what we have learned in the hearings we have had, \nin the testimony, is they are not necessary. If\n\n[[Page S66]]\n\nthey are not necessary, we shouldn't be asking them. Our students would \nbe a lot better off spending their time figuring out what college they \nwant to attend, figuring out what course of study they want to \nundertake than spending their time with this bureaucratic nightmare.\n  I am enormously optimistic that we are going to get this passed with \nthe chairman's leadership, and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on that. I would like to thank the Senator from New Jersey \nagain for signing on as one of the original cosponsors.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/07/senate-section/article/S66-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S66]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 21--MAKING MAJORITY PARTY APPOINTMENTS FOR THE 114TH \n                                CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.
