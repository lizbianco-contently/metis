Madam President, I was encouraged this morning to hear that \nPresident Obama is aggressively responding to the Zika virus. Anyone \nwho has heard the news about this terrible mosquito bite over the last \nseveral weeks has heard about the spread of Zika. This virus is \nprimarily spread by mosquitoes in Central America, South America, the \nCaribbean, and the Pacific islands.\n  Zika has been linked to birth defects in children, as well as other \nhealth problems. To date, there have been no confirmed cases of \nAmericans getting Zika from mosquitoes in the continental United \nStates, but we must not lower our guard. Instead, we must take action.\n  The President has taken action, and I appreciate that very much. That \nis why last week the entire Senate Democratic caucus sent a letter to \nPresident Obama urging quick action responding to the Zika virus. To \nhis credit, that is exactly what President Obama has done. Today the \nPresident announced that he is asking Congress for $1.8 billion to \ncombat the outbreak. This funding will, among other things, further \nresearch of the virus and a potential vaccine; improve mosquito control \nmethods here at home; create rapid-response teams in the United States; \nenhance treatment for those who are infected; help deploy prevention \nand education strategies to key populations, including pregnant women \nand their partners; support international aid activities in affected \nareas; and train health care workers in affected countries.\n  It is critical that we approve the funds now, immediately, and give \nour government the resources it needs to fight the virus. We also need \nto make sure our Nation's response to the virus includes increasing \naccess to contraceptives for women in Zika-affected regions--for those \nwho choose to use them.\n  We in the Congress must follow President Obama's direction and \naggressively combat Zika. So I call on my colleagues to support this \nimportant funding.\n  I have been called to the White House tomorrow afternoon at the same \ntime the Republican leader has called a briefing on the Zika virus. I \nam going to send staff to that meeting. I can't be at the White House \nand that briefing at the same time, but I will get a thorough, detailed \naccount of what takes place at that briefing. I appreciate Senator \nMcConnell arranging that meeting, and I apologize for not being able to \nbe there.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/08/senate-section/article/S693-6", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S693-S694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, last week marked the end of an open \nenrollment for the health exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act. \nThe numbers are in, and once again millions of Americans signed up for \nquality health care. Normally--it is normal now, and each year it keeps \ngoing up--nationally almost 13 million Americans selected their plans \nthrough health insurance marketplaces. In Nevada, almost 90,000 people \nenrolled in Nevada's health exchange. That represents a 20-percent \nincrease over 2015 enrollment numbers.\n  These numbers are further evidence that the Affordable Care Act--\nObamaCare--is working. The law is helping Americans get access to \nquality health care, many for the first time in their entire lives. \nThat is why it is particularly frustrating to watch Republicans \ncontinue banging their heads when it comes to ObamaCare. Last Tuesday--\nGroundhog Day, fittingly--House Republicans voted for the 63rd time to \nrepeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act. That is 63 times House \nRepublicans have ignored all the evidence that proves the Affordable \nCare Act is helping their constituents.\n  It is not just House Republicans; it seems as if every day my friend \nthe Republican leader comes to the floor and rails against ObamaCare. \nHe has led Senate Republicans in voting to repeal or defund the \nAffordable Care Act 17 different times. Yet more than 10 percent of the \nRepublican leader's own constituents are benefiting from the\n\n[[Page S694]]\n\nAffordable Care Act. Madam President, 500,000 Kentucky residents use \nObamaCare--half a million people.\n  Last week an Associated Press article highlighted the fact that \nKentucky has seen the largest drop in the percentage of its uninsured. \nI will read from an AP story:\n\n       Kentucky and Arkansas had the largest drops in the \n     percentage of people without health insurance in the country, \n     according to the Gallup-Healthways survey. In 2013, more than \n     20 percent of Kentuckians did not have health insurance. By \n     the end of 2015, after the State expanded its Medicaid \n     program and created a health-insurance exchange, that figure \n     was down to 7.5 percent.\n\n  There it is in black and white. In 2013, 20 percent of Kentuckians \ndidn't have health insurance, and now it is down to 7.5 percent. That \nis a remarkably strong decrease of the uninsured. If my friend the \nRepublican leader had his way and repealed ObamaCare, all progress in \nKentucky would be gone.\n  Sadly, Kentucky's tea party Governor is following in Senator \nMcConnell's footsteps. Gov. Matt Bevin wants to tear apart his State's \nhealth exchange, regardless of the impact on his constituents. I will \nread again from the AP article:\n\n       Bevin, a Republican, has already given the order to \n     dismantle Kynect, Kentucky's state-based exchange. And he \n     plans to repeal Kentucky's Medicaid expansion and replace it \n     with something else that [would] mean fewer people would be \n     eligible and the ones who stay eligible would have to pay a \n     small premium. Bevin needs approval from the federal \n     government to do that. If he does not get it, Bevin has said \n     he would repeal the expansion entirely.\n\n  It is time for Republicans to accept the fact that ObamaCare is here \nto stay. It is not going anyplace. Once and for all, it has moved past \nrepeal. Start making the Affordable Care Act work even better for the \nAmerican people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/08/senate-section/article/S694-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I appreciate her team working with us to schedule that briefing \nfor tomorrow. Here are the two areas in which we want to get a better \nunderstanding at the briefing:\n  No. 1, what preparations are being made to protect Americans?\n  No. 2, what are the administration's funding priorities given limited \nFederal resources?\n  Concern about the Zika virus is growing in our country, and \nprotecting constituents, especially children, from a communicable \ndisease is a high priority for all of us. I am looking forward to \nhearing more tomorrow about both the administration's proposed response \nand its priorities for combatting this disease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/08/senate-section/article/S694-3", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ENERGY POLICY MODERNIZATION BILL\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, the legislation currently before us--\nthe Energy Policy Modernization Act--is the product of a year's worth \nof constructive and collaborative work. In the Energy Committee, it \npassed overwhelmingly with the support of both parties. Here on the \nfloor, it has been subject to an open amendment process, with input \nfrom both sides. More than 30 amendments from both Democrats and \nRepublicans have already been adopted. The Senator from Alaska recently \nsought consent to continue that progress by getting several more \namendments pending. It is unclear why any colleague would object to her \neffort or why they would effectively block consideration of their own \namendments, but that is what happened. It is disappointing for our \ncountry.\n  We are hoping our friends will reconsider. Remember, the Energy \nPolicy Modernization Act is broad bipartisan legislation designed to \nhelp Americans produce more energy, pay less for energy, and save \nenergy, all while helping strengthen our long-term national security. \nWe should pass it.\n  I am asking colleagues to take yes for an answer and allow the open \namendment process to continue so that we can pass it, which is so \nimportant to helping our country prepare for the energy demands of \ntoday and the energy opportunities of tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/08/senate-section/article/S694-4", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, hurricanes can be deadly. We are \naccustomed to them in Florida. They are part of our lifestyle. We know \nenough about hurricanes and the ferociousness and strength of Mother \nNature to know that when a hurricane starts bearing down, you better be \nprepared, and that is especially so with regard to boats. Hurricanes \ncause giant-sized waves and strong winds that make it impossible to \nnavigate a boat. So when the forecast calls for a hurricane, boats \nought to get out of the way.\n  Sadly, last year the El Faro, a cargo vessel that sailed from \nJacksonville to Puerto Rico and back, along with its sister ship, \nsailed right into a hurricane off the Bahamas. As a result, the last \ncall to shore, although the captain's voice was calm, was to report \nthat they had lost power and were therefore listing, which meant that \nsomething had been breached and water was coming into the ship. That \nwas the last we heard from the captain. We now know that that ship is 5 \nmiles below the surface of the Atlantic, on the eastern side of the \nBahama Islands. Thirty-three people lost their lives, most of whom were \nfrom the Jacksonville, FL, area. The National Transportation Safety \nBoard is conducting an investigation, and the question is whether or \nnot they are going to put down another U.S. Navy submersible so they \ncan continue their search for the recorder that would give them the \ncomplete data from the ship.\n  I am bringing this up again because the very same thing almost \nhappened yesterday, only this time a 4,000-passenger cruise ship, \nsailing from the New York area to Port Canaveral, FL, and then on to \nother destinations in the Caribbean, sailed right into a hurricane that \nhad winds topping 100 miles per hour.\n  I wish I had a blowup of the image of these hurricanes to show the \nSenate. Yesterday's storm was right off the coast of North and South \nCarolina. When these two images are compared side by side, we can see \nhow yesterday's storm is similar to Hurricane Isabel. They look \nmenacingly similar. The thing about yesterday's storm is that it was \nforecasted for days. So why in the world would a cruise ship with \nthousands of passengers on it go sailing right into it?\n  Some of the passengers have made comments, including Robert Huschka, \nexecutive editor of the Detroit Free Press, who was a passenger on the \ncruise. He said: ``I am not going to lie. It was truly terrifying.''\n  Passengers talked about how the water was coming into the upper \ndecks. The pictures that were taken by the passengers on the ship speak \nfor themselves. I am sure there was a courageous crew on board, but the \nquestion is: Why, after what happened to the El Faro last year, did it \nsail into the storm? Even if they were surprised by the change of the \ndirection of the storm, which is what happened with the hurricane last \nyear, why in the world would a ship go anywhere close to where the \nhurricane could be, particularly as the storm starts to cross the warm \nwaters of the Gulf Stream,\n\n[[Page S695]]\n\nand, therefore, gets all the more fuel for the counterclockwise \nrotation of the winds from the warm water?\n  I want the National Transportation Safety Board, over which the \nSenate Commerce Committee has some jurisdiction--of which I have the \nprivilege of being the ranking member--to come up with a quick report.\n  Now, thank goodness, that so far only four passengers were reported \ninjured and no one was killed. That ship is now returning to port back \nin the New York area. Thank goodness there was not much damage, and \nthat it is seaworthy. But the question is, When there is a storm \nbrewing, why are mistakes made just like what happened to the El Faro? \nBefore it left the Port of Jacksonville, they knew that a hurricane was \ncoming.\n  We need to know what happened in this case as well so we can prevent \nthese kinds of accidents that could be so tragic in the future.\n  The Senate Commerce Committee has oversight of the National \nTransportation Safety Board, and I want them to come up with answers \nvery quickly and make an admonition to Americans that when a storm is \nbrewing, you don't go out of port.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats).

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Tribute to Richard Anderson\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, on Friday of last week as I was getting \nready to leave to go home to the State of Georgia, the United States of \nAmerica, and the aviation industry received notice that Richard \nAnderson, CEO of Delta Airlines, will retire after a career of over 25 \nyears in the aviation industry, but in particular a great career at \nDelta Airlines over the last decade. I rise to memorialize on the floor \nof the Senate how much my State and the aviation industry owes to \nRichard Anderson.\n  Richard took over Delta at a very critical time. In fact, Delta was \nin desperate straits. Because of his work at Delta, he revitalized the \nculture of the company, he revitalized the aviation industry in \nGeorgia, and he made it a market for all of us to be proud of. In fact, \nin 1 year, 2 years ago, Delta was one of the 50 most admired companies \nin the United States of America and led the world in terms of aviation \nas stated by Aviation Magazine, but most importantly Richard Anderson \ncame to Washington, DC, when all the aviation industry was in trouble. \nHe was then with Northwest. Delta was having difficulties. He worked \nwith the U.S. Senate, worked with the Finance Committee, worked with \nme, Mike Enzi, and others to reform the pension performance act of \n2005, and change the way pensions were calculated in order to save the \npensions of Delta Airlines and many other airlines in the United States \nof America. His hands-on effort to revitalize that company led to the \nmost prosperous year in its history in 2016, and the most prosperous \ndecade it had in the last 10 years.\n  So as he announces he is leaving Delta Airlines and the aviation \nindustry for other things to do, I want to, on the floor of the Senate, \ncommend him for all he has done to make Delta Airlines in the State of \nGeorgia great, all he has done for the aviation industry, and all he \nhas done for the economy of the greatest country on the face of this \nEarth--the United States of America.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on the \nnomination of Judge Ebinger from Iowa. I am very pleased to be here to \nsupport her and to urge all my colleagues to also support her \nnomination.\n  I am very proud of the work my colleague Senator Ernst and I have \ndone to fill the vacancies in Iowa's district courts by putting forward \ntwo exceptionally talented and qualified nominees, Judges Ebinger and \nStrand. I said this in committee but, for the benefit of all Members of \nthe Senate, the Iowa nominees are two of the best judicial candidates \nthe President has nominated during his Presidency.\n  To fill the vacancies in Iowa, I set up a Judicial Selection \nCommission and invited all interested Iowa lawyers to apply. The \napplicants were vetted by highly qualified members of the Iowa legal \ncommunity. After spending hundreds of hours reviewing the applications, \nthe Commission interviewed all 39 applicants. Eleven candidates of the \nthirty-nine were then selected for a lengthy second round of \ninterviews. At the end of the process, the Commission sent their \nrecommendations to me. In consultation with my fellow Iowa Senator, I \nwas proud to recommend Judges Strand and Ebinger to the White House. \nJudges Strand and Ebinger have the highest credentials and character \nand will serve the State of Iowa with honor and with distinction.\n  I would like to say a little bit more about Judge Ebinger because she \nis the one of the two we are voting on today. Judge Ebinger received \nher undergraduate degree in 1997 from Georgetown University School of \nForeign Service and her law degree from Yale Law School in 2004. She \nthen served as a special assistant U.S. attorney in the U.S. Attorney's \nOffice for the Northern District of Iowa in Cedar Rapids. There, she \nprosecuted criminal cases involving narcotics, immigration, firearms \noffenses, and violent crimes. She then clerked for Judge Michael Melloy \non the Eighth Circuit for 2 years, also in Cedar Rapids, IA.\n  Following her clerkship, she moved to the U.S. Attorney's Office for \nthe Southern District of Iowa as an assistant U.S. attorney. During \nthis time, her practice shifted primarily to white-collar crime. She \nalso handled intake for all child support enforcement cases and sex \noffender registry violations.\n  Judge Ebinger received a number of awards for her work with the U.S. \nAttorney's Office. In 2012, she was appointed to serve as a district \njudge in Iowa State court and was retained as a district judge in the \n2014 election. As a State court judge, she presided over a court of \ngeneral jurisdiction, handling civil law and equity, criminal, and \nfamily court proceedings. She has presided over 40 cases that have gone \nto verdict or trial.\n  Judge Ebinger is a highly qualified, well-respected judge already, \nand I urge my colleagues to support her nomination today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we will vote on the nomination of \nRebecca Ebinger to fill a judicial vacancy in the Federal district \ncourt in the southern district of Iowa.\n  Ms. Ebinger is a highly qualified nominee who has devoted her legal \ncareer to public service. Since 2012, she has served as a district \njudge in Iowa State court. Prior to joining the bench, Judge Ebinger \nserved as a prosecutor at the Federal and State levels in Iowa, \nincluding in the U.S. attorney's offices for the southern and northern \ndistricts of Iowa. During her tenure as a Federal prosecutor, she was \nthe lead attorney on cases involving violence against women. Judge \nEbinger has the strong support of her home State Senators, Chairman \nGrassley of the Judiciary Committee and Senator Ernst.\n\n[[Page S696]]\n\n  With her qualifications, I can understand why Chairman Grassley \nrecommended her to the President for this nomination. What I cannot \nunderstand is why moneyed Washington interest groups are calling on \nRepublican Senators to oppose the confirmation of any judicial nominee, \nregardless of a nominee's merit or qualifications. Judicial nominees \nlike Judge Ebinger have worked hard to build admirable legal careers \nthat have put them at the top of their profession. When judicial \nnominees submit themselves to the nominations process, they do so \nexpecting and deserving to be considered by Senators exercising their \nown independent judgement.\n  Judicial nominees not only deserve our independent and considered \njudgement, it is our constitutional obligation as Senators to provide \nit. The duty to provide advice and consent on the President's nominees \nis our own and cannot be abdicated to Washington political action \ncommittees. This is especially true when such political action \ncommittees are advocating that we turn our backs on the American people \nby completely shutting down the judicial confirmation process.\n  Too many Americans who have sought justice in our Federal courts \nsince last year have instead found delays and empty courtrooms because \nof Senate Republicans' obstruction on judicial nominees. Over the \ncourse of last year, Senate Republicans allowed confirmation votes on \njust 11 judicial nominees--and judicial vacancies soared across the \ncountry. When Senate Republicans took over the majority in January of \nlast year, there were 43 judicial vacancies. Since then, vacancies have \ndramatically increased to 77--an increase of more than 75 percent. \nFurthermore, the number of judicial vacancies deemed to be \n``emergencies'' by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts because \ncaseloads in those courts are unmanageably high has nearly tripled \nunder Republican Senate leadership--from 12 when Republicans took over \nlast year to 32 today. Refusing to confirm any judicial nominees for \nthe rest of this year would make the high number of vacancies in our \nFederal judiciary even worse.\n  In addition to the vote on Judge Ebinger's confirmation today, we \nhave agreed to vote this week on another Iowa district court judge. \nWhen we return from the Presidents' Day recess, I hope Republicans will \ncontinue confirming judicial nominees with bipartisan support, as \nDemocrats did when we held the majority. In 2008, when I was chairman \nof the committee with a Republican President, we worked to confirm \njudicial nominees as late as September of the Presidential election \nyear. In fact, Senate Democrats helped confirm all 10 of President \nBush's district court nominees pending on the Senate floor in a single \nday by unanimous consent on September 26, 2008. This was similarly true \nin 2004, when I was ranking member of the committee with a Republican \nPresident, and we worked to confirm nominees as late as September of \nthe Presidential election year.\n  There are 19 judicial nominees awaiting confirmation on the Senate \nfloor. The next judicial nominee pending after we return from the \nPresident's Day recess will be Waverly Crenshaw, an exceptional \nAfrican-American district court nominee from Tennessee who has the \nsupport of his Republican home State Senators, Senators Alexander and \nCorker. I hope the Senators from Tennessee will be able to convince \ntheir majority leader to schedule the Tennessee nominee's vote to occur \nthis month. This is an emergency judicial vacancy in their State, so it \nis clear that this position is sorely needed for Tennesseans to receive \nswift justice in the middle district of Tennessee.\n  I urge my fellow Senators to vote to confirm Judge Ebinger and look \nforward to working with my fellow Senators to ensure timely \nconfirmation of the other judicial nominees pending before the Senate.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield back time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today for the fifth time to ask \nunanimous consent for a vote for the Ambassadors to Norway and Sweden. \nSenator Cruz has been objecting to this. I appreciate the bipartisan \nsupport for these nominees. They made it through the committees without \nany objections.\n  These are the 11th and 12th biggest investors in the United States of \nAmerica. They are our allies. They are our allies in our fight against \nRussian aggression. Norway shares a border with Russia. Yet every major \nEuropean\n\n[[Page S697]]\n\ncountry has an ambassador except Norway and Sweden.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session \nto consider the nomination of Samuel D. Heins, Calendar No. 263; that \nthe Senate proceed to vote without intervening action or debate on the \nnomination; that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Is there objection?\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on behalf of the junior Senator from \nTexas, Mr. Cruz, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination that \nis to the country of Sweden: Azita Raji, Calendar No. 148; that the \nSenate proceed to vote without intervening action or debate on the \nnomination; that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on behalf of the junior Senator from \nTexas, Mr. Cruz, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, as I said, this has been a bipartisan \neffort to get these two nominees confirmed. There is no one holding up \nthe vote on these nominations except for Senator Cruz. We asked him to \nremove these holds. He has not voiced any concerns about these \nindividual nominees. He has voiced concerns about unrelated foreign \npolicy issues. There have been other holds in the past, but everyone \nhas lifted their hold. I note that even Senator Cotton from Arkansas \nhas said that there are no issues with the qualifications of these \nnominees and that these nominees should proceed to a vote.\n  As I said, this is the fifth time I have come to the floor. I have \nalso been joined by Senator Cardin, Senator Shaheen, and Senator \nFranken. This is something that has to get done.\n  Listen to these numbers: Sam Heins has been waiting for 293 days to \nbe confirmed as the U.S. ambassador to Norway. Azita Raji has been \nwaiting 474 days to be confirmed as the first female U.S. Ambassador to \nSweden. Both of these nominees were voted out of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee without controversy and with significant bipartisan \nsupport. Not a single Senator has questioned the qualifications of Sam \nHeins or Azita Raji. That is because they are both qualified to take \nthese jobs.\n  We have an ambassador in France. We have an ambassador in England. We \nhave an ambassador in Italy. We have an ambassador in Germany. We have \nan ambassador to nearly every European nation but not these two \nScandinavian countries.\n  More than 1,200 refugees seek asylum in Sweden every single day. I \ncannot tell my colleagues how many times I have heard people on both \nsides of the aisle talk about how during this refugee crisis we need a \nstrong and unified Europe, and we need to be their allies, and they \nneed to be our allies. While we may have disagreements on how to solve \nall of the refugee crises, we have to at least give support to our \nallies who are taking in these refugees.\n  Sweden accepts more refugees per capita than any other country in the \nEuropean Union. Norway expects to take in as many as 25,000 refugees \nthis year. It has already provided more than $6 million to Greece to \nhelp respond to the influx of refugees seeking a way to enter Europe. \nAll of us on both sides of the aisle have talked about this. Yet, right \nnow, no Ambassadors are in those two critical countries.\n  I would note they have Ambassadors from China in those countries. \nThey have Ambassadors from Russia. They have Ambassadors. So the people \nof their countries who love the United States, who respect the United \nStates, who travel to the United States, they want to know: How come \nevery major nation has an ambassador to our country but not the United \nStates of America?\n  We also understand the important economic contributions Sweden and \nNorway make to our country. These diplomatic relations are 200 years \nold. That is why we have widespread support for these nominees. Yet one \nSenator--how can one Senator stand in the way of a vote affecting \nrelations that are 200 years old?\n  Our economic partnership with these countries is enormous. Sweden \nsupports over 330,700 American jobs across 50 States. In the case of \nNorway, our trade partnership is $16 billion--$7 billion in exports, $9 \nbillion in imports. Leaving these countries without a U.S. Ambassador \nis a slap in the face to their governments, their people, and all of \nthe American workers who are supported by Swedish and Norwegian \ninvestment in the United States. That is happening today.\n  In addition to Sam Heins and Azita Raji, there are other nominees who \nare vital in our fight against terrorism; however, I am going to focus \ntoday on these two nominees.\n  We have two countries, Norway and Sweden, that are members of NATO, \nthat have joined us in the fight against Islamic extremists, that have \njoined us in the fight against ISIS. This is no way to treat them.\n  I would also add, in kind of a combination of our national security \ninterests and economic interests, that Norway has now signed to \npurchase 252 fighter planes--22 just recently--from Lockheed Martin. \nThose fighter planes are made in America. The country of Norway could \nhave decided to buy those fighter planes from any nation in the world. \nThey could have bought those fighter planes from Europe. Where did they \nbuy those fighter planes from? They brought them from the United \nStates, from Lockheed Martin, and that company is located in Texas. \nThose fighter planes are made in Fort Worth, TX, Senator Cruz's home \nState.\n  So what do we say to Norway when they invest? We can do the math--\nnearly $200 million a plane, 22 planes. So they have strong national \nsecurity, as we see Russian aggression and Islamic extremism and as \nthey join with us in fights across the world. What do we say? You are \nnot worthy of an ambassador. Because one Senator--the Senator from the \nState where those fighter planes are made, from Fort Worth, TX--has \ndecided to hold this up.\n  What are we doing when we say to a major company in the United States \nthat got a major deal with a foreign government that that government is \nnot worthy of having an ambassador? What kind of encouragement do we \ngive when we don't even let them have an ambassador?\n  This is one of many examples of what is going on and why the people \nare so angry. We have heard from the Foreign Minister. We have seen \ncomments from people of Norwegian descent and Swedish descent who do \nnot understand how this could be going on right now, given everything \nEurope is confronting.\n  It is my hope that we will be able to work these things out. We have \nbeen given various reasons from letters that have been written, to \nstreets in front of embassies, for this hold. But we are hopeful that \nsomehow we are going to be able to work this out. This is because of \none Senator who is not even here in this Chamber day after day after \nday when I return to put these names in for Ambassador.\n  We are not stopping. Senator Shaheen and I are going to come to this \nfloor every single day and make the case for these countries. I am \nhopeful we will be able to resolve this.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a \ncolloquy with the junior Senator from Montana for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/08/senate-section/article/S697-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S697-S700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW\n\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a very \nimportant issue for our Nation's judicial system and two bills that I \nand my colleague from Montana have introduced. The bills' primary focus \nis what all of us in the Senate want, and that is equal justice under \nthe law.\n\n[[Page S698]]\n\n  One of the bills would split the dysfunctional and unwieldy U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The other bill would form a \ncommission to evaluate the court and make recommendations based on its \nfindings.\n  Like a lot of us here, when I am in Washington I like to get out and \ntry to get a run in in the morning and look at the beautiful monuments, \nmemorials. Oftentimes I run past the U.S. Supreme Court, and I often \nlook at the inscription etched on the beautiful Court there that says \nsimply ``Equal justice under law.'' I think of Supreme Court Justice \nLewis Powell's famous quote restated:\n\n       Equal justice under the law is not merely a caption on the \n     facade of the Supreme Court building, it is perhaps the most \n     inspiring ideal of our society. It is one of the ends for \n     which our entire legal system exists. . . .\n\n  I also think of the thousands of lawyers and judges and clerks, past \nand present, who have lived their lives attempting to fulfill its \nimportant ideal and how our democratic system of government is \ndependent on striving for this ideal.\n  We should do everything in this body to make sure that simple \nconcept--equal justice under the law--is a reality for all Americans. \nAll Americans should feel assured that when we seek justice, the \nburdens we encounter, the time we encounter to achieve justice won't be \nsmaller or greater depending on the part of the country in which we \nlive.\n  Unfortunately, that is not the case. Unfortunately, if you are a \ncitizen of the United States and you live in one of the States over \nwhich the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has jurisdiction \nover your legal issues in the administration of justice, one in five \nAmericans do not get equal justice under the law. What our bills are \nfocused on doing is righting that wrong because the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit is simply too large, its scope is too \nwide, and it has long passed its ability to provide equal justice and \nto contribute as a functional court system in the U.S. court of appeals \nFederal court system in our country.\n  This is no surprise. We have known this for decades. Dividing the \nNinth Circuit is not a new idea. In fact, not doing it is radical. If \nyou look at the history of the United States, when Federal courts of \nappeals have grown in terms of population, what has happened every time \nfor decades, for well over 100 years, is that when the court grows too \nbig and the administration of justice grinds to a halt, the court is \nsplit so that you have that justice. That is the usual course of \nAmerican history. What is not usual is the refusal to do this.\n  To give a few examples, in 1973 a congressionally chartered \nCommission recommended to this body that for the administration of \njustice for American citizens, the Ninth Circuit should be split. It \nactually recommended that the Fifth and Ninth Circuit should be split. \nThe Fifth Circuit was eventually split, but according to the \nCommission, the Ninth Circuit, which it said had serious difficulties \nwith backlog, delay, and justice for Americans, was not split, and it \nhas only gotten worse.\n  To give a few facts, there are 65 million people living within the \nboundaries of the Ninth Circuit. That represents 20 percent of the \ntotal population of the United States--one in five Americans. That is \nalmost two times as many people as there are in the next biggest \ncircuit in the U.S. court of appeals system, and it is almost three \ntimes the average population of all the other circuits combined. It is \nnot only just the size of the court.\n  The caseload is what is inhibiting justice for Americans in the Ninth \nCircuit. At the end of a 12-month period last year, the Ninth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals had almost 14,000 pending appeals; the next largest \ncourt of appeals had about 4,700. Justice delayed is justice denied.\n  In previous hearings in the Senate, we found that it takes, on \naverage, for the Ninth Circuit, almost 40 percent longer to dispose of \nan appeal than in any other circuit in the country. This is simply a \nfunction of a court that is too big and too unwieldy. Because of the \nsize and inefficiency of the court, the court has started to come up \nwith creative shortcuts--questionable procedural shortcuts which I \nbelieve are shortchanging justice for tens of thousands of Americans \nevery year in this court of appeals.\n  Let me give you a few examples. Every court in the U.S. Federal \nsystem, in order to have uniformity of law, when they have difficult \nissues, they meet as a court in what they call an en banc meeting. This \nprovides uniformity in all the courts. There is only one court that \ndoesn't do that. Because it has 29 judges--much more than any other \ncourt--the Ninth Circuit does not meet as a whole court; therefore, \nlimiting its ability to address intracircuit conflicts, with no \nuniformity in the law in the Ninth Circuit, and it is seen again and \nagain and again. Further, and perhaps most alarming--again because of \nits size--the Ninth Circuit is the only court of Federal appeals where \na nonelected, nonappointed, nonarticle II judge called an appellate \ncommissioner rules on matters by the thousands that should be handled \nby article III life-tenured judges--not an appellate commissioner who \nis none of those things.\n  In a 2005 congressional hearing, one of the Ninth Circuit judges \ntestified ``that the appellate commissioner resolved 4,600 motions that \nwould otherwise have been heard by judges.'' This is fast-food justice \nfor one in five Americans who are part of the Ninth Circuit.\n  This Senator plans to come down to the floor over the next several \nweeks and speak to my experience on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. \nI had the opportunity--the honor--to be a judicial law clerk for one of \nthe most esteemed judges, Judge Kleinfeld of Fairbanks, AK, many years \nago, but I did see firsthand how the unwieldy size of this court of \nappeals limits justice, not just for Alaskans but for any citizen who \nis under the jurisdiction of this court.\n  Chief Justice Warren Burger warned in 1970 that ``a sense of \nconfidence in the courts is essential to maintain the fabric of ordered \nliberty for a free people.'' He cautioned that inefficiency and delay \nin our courts of appeals could destroy that confidence. Unfortunately, \nas it is currently constituted, the Ninth Circuit is inefficient, it \ndelays, and therefore denies justice for millions of Americans, and we \ncannot allow the confidence in our system of justice to be undermined \nby continuing a court of appeals that is so large and so unwieldy. That \nis why the Senator from Montana and I intend with our bills to bring \nequal justice for all Americans.\n  I turn to my colleague from Montana for his views on this very \nimportant issue.\n  Mr. DAINES. I thank the junior Senator from Alaska, and I appreciate \nhim joining me in this most important effort and also for the \nleadership he has demonstrated on this issue. As the junior Senator \nfrom Alaska knows, the Ninth Circuit Court is broken. It is \noverburdened and is unable to provide quality service and expeditious \njustice for the Americans it is supposed to serve.\n  When we offer the Pledge of Allegiance, we close with ``and justice \nfor all.'' As I frequently tell my staff, we in public service are \nultimately in the customer service business. As U.S. Senators, our No. \n1 job is to represent and to serve the people in our States. Our courts \nshould reflect the same serving mentality as they uphold their \nresponsibility to justice, but when our courts are overburdened and \noverworked, it is the American people who are left underserved and \nwaiting far too long for justice. Unfortunately, under the current \nstructure, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is unable to provide \nAmericans in the West the service they deserve.\n  Take a look at this chart behind me. At 64.4 million people served, \nthe current Ninth Circuit is the largest circuit by population as well \nas the largest land area. As the junior Senator from Alaska will \nsometimes remind us, if they divide Alaska in two, Texas is the third \nlargest State in the Nation. It is not just about the geographical size \nof the West. Look at the number of people who are served in the Ninth \nCircuit. It includes Montana, Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, \nNevada, Arizona, California, and Hawaii, not to mention several U.S. \nterritories, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands. That alone amounts \nto 20 percent of the Nation's population.\n  Let's put this in context. That is 85 percent larger than the next \nlargest\n\n[[Page S699]]\n\ncircuit which serves just 34.8 million people, and this chart \nillustrates that well. Needless to say, the Ninth Circuit's caseload is \nsignificantly greater than any other circuit, and that means backlogs \nand that means delays. Not only is it larger, it is disproportionately \nlarger. On average, the Ninth Circuit has had more than 32 percent of \nall cases pending nationally. As the junior Senator from Alaska \nmentioned, it currently has over 14,000 cases pending. As you can see \nin this next chart behind me, that is three times more than the next \nclosest circuit, the Fifth Circuit, which has around 4,700 cases \npending. Processing all these cases takes time; in fact, on the \naverage, over the last 5 years, nearly 15 months from appeal to \ndetermination.\n  It is time to take a serious look at how our court system can better \nserve the American people, and that is why Senator Sullivan and I have \nintroduced two separate bills to address these challenges. Our bills \nwould bring much needed reform, not just to the Ninth Circuit but also \nto the entire Federal circuit courts of appeals system. The Circuit \nCourt of Appeals Restructuring and Modernization Act would split the \nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals into two circuits, providing a more \nmanageable balance of population and geography for both circuits so \nwestern Americans can be better served by our courts.\n  The Federal Courts of Appeals Modernization Act would establish a \ncommission to study the Federal circuit courts of appeals system and \nidentify changes needed to promote an expeditious and effective \ndisposition of the Ninth Circuit caseload. Keep this in mind. When we \nsplit the circuits into a new Ninth and the Twelfth Circuits, the Ninth \nCircuit would still have a larger caseload than any other circuit. In \nthe new Ninth Circuit's jurisdiction, there would be 40.8 million \npeople. It would continue to maintain its status as first in \npopulation. In the Twelfth Circuit's jurisdiction, this new circuit we \nwould establish, there would be 24.3 million people, which makes it the \nseventh largest in population among the circuits. It is just a little \nbit below the average. Those numbers alone should make it clear reforms \nare needed.\n  It is worth remembering that the challenges facing the Ninth Circuit \nhave been longstanding, and the efforts to find solutions are \nbipartisan. In fact, two prior Commissions--one in 1973 and the other \nin 1988, which, by the way, was championed by California Senator Dianne \nFeinstein--both determined that the Ninth Circuit had an overly \nburdensome size and scope and suggested that changes be made with the \nstructure of the Federal courts of appeals.\n  It is time to move forward with concrete solutions to address this \nproblem. The bills introduced by the junior Senator from Alaska and I \nwill do so.\n  I was trained as an engineer. As an engineer, one identifies a \nproblem and most importantly finds a solution. We have a capacity \nconstraint which can be alleviated. In thinking about our communities, \nas our communities grow, we need to add more schools, add more \nteachers, and add more police officers.\n  We need to ensure that all Americans have access to the justice they \ndeserve. It is time to split the Ninth Circuit.\n  I want to thank the junior Senator from Alaska for championing this \nimportant issue, and I look forward to working with him to find a \nresolution.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. I thank my colleague from Montana and for his point in \nparticular. The charts make a very compelling case, but I think his \npoint in particular about constraints--when things get too large, they \nbecome an organization that cannot function.\n  I think when you look at the debate that has occurred previously \nabout the Ninth Circuit, somehow we have gotten to the point where it \nis some kind of radical idea to split the Ninth Circuit. But if you \nlook at the history of our country, the radical idea is actually not \nsplitting the Ninth Circuit. The outlier position is not to take a \ncourt either that has this many cases pending or that controls this \nmuch of the population and not do something about it.\n  The history of this body, starting with the Judiciary Act of 1789 \nthat created three circuit courts: Eastern, Middle, and Southern--only \na few years later, Congress acted again--in 1802, a mere 13 years \nlater--and Congress doubled the number of circuit courts to six. What \nwe have seen throughout our history is when this kind of situation \nexists where one court has an enormously oversized population, \nCongress--as my colleague from Montana mentioned--acts in a bipartisan \nmanner, and they act for the sole reason to make sure all Americans are \ngetting effective administration of justice.\n  When your citizens wait longer than any other Americans and have \ndelays more than any other Americans and when your court that you are \nsubject to the jurisdiction of starts to create procedural shortcuts, \nnot a lot of which are known--and we are going to talk about some of \nthose over the next several weeks--and no other court does that, you \nstart to see that one in five Americans is burdened by this and \nburdened by the lack of what the Supreme Court says: ``Equal Justice \nUnder Law.''\n  I again thank my colleague from Montana. I know he has some views on \nwhat would happen again if this doesn't happen in his State or in my \nState. But this isn't just about the West; this is about all Americans. \nWe all deserve the same justice.\n  Just by looking at these two posters, cases pending, as I talked \nabout earlier, and the time it takes to get appeals completed and the \nenormous population of just one circuit, what is clear to me is that \nthe Congress needs to act.\n  I am honored to be working with my good friend from Montana where we \nare offering Congress a variety of different ways to approach this--a \ncommission, a bill to split the circuit.\n  But I want to emphasize that this is not a radical idea; the radical \nidea that is out of step with American history is to not do something \nabout this.\n  Every time in America's history since the Judiciary Act of 1789 when \nthis type of situation has occurred, Congress has acted, and they acted \nbecause they knew equal justice under the law was at stake.\n  Mr. DAINES. I remember as we were raising our four children, \nsometimes it would be late at night with a sick child, and I would turn \non ``Sesame Street'' with the child. I remember there was that ``One of \nThese Things (Is Not Like the Others)'' song. As I look at that chart, \nthis could be a ``Sesame Street'' illustration. One of these circuits \nis not like the others. It is such a stark contrast to what we see with \nthe Ninth Circuit.\n  With the disproportionate number of cases that are pending in the \nNinth Circuit, this is not that complicated of a problem in terms of \ntrying to identify where the problem lies. It is simply a factor of \nconstraints, and it starts with the population chart my colleague from \nAlaska has, but then it results in a disproportionate share of cases \ncoming out of that population. That is why something must be done.\n  These two prior Commissions that have studied this before, the one in \n1973--which, by the way, in 1973, I was 11 years old. I was about \n``Sesame Street'' age then. At that point they said the Ninth Circuit \nhad an overly burdensome size in 1973. Yet again in 1998, I am grateful \nthat California Senator Dianne Feinstein was championing that \nCommission. She looked at this same issue 18 years ago and determined \nthat the Ninth Circuit was overly burdened and suggested changes be \nmade to the structure of the Federal courts of appeal.\n  So I look forward to working with my colleague from Alaska as we have \nidentified this problem and now move forward to a solution. If there is \nsomething we hear over and over again from the American people, it is \nthis: You are not solving the problems facing this country.\n  We have a problem. We have a solution. I look forward to vigorous \ndiscussions and continuing to get more information, and I look forward \nto the alternatives. We think this is the best solution--to split the \nNinth, add the Twelfth Circuit. Even after that is done--you take the \nNinth and create the new Twelfth Circuit--the Ninth Circuit will still \nbe the largest circuit by population in the United States.\n  I again thank the junior Senator from Alaska for taking the lead in \nthis effort and look forward to continuing this discussion.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. I appreciate my colleague's efforts as well. We will \ncontinue to be focused on this.\n\n[[Page S700]]\n\n  I will end by mentioning--my colleague mentioned the Sesame Street \nadage ``One of these things is not like the other.'' But one other area \nwhere this is the case, as I mentioned before, is in the en banc \nprocedures. That is when the courts of appeal--every one of them in the \ncountry with the exception of one--when they have difficult issues, \nthey sit together. All the active judges sit together. This provides \nuniformity and predictability in these courts. But one of these courts \nis not like the others. The Ninth Circuit cannot do this. It is too \nbig. So they have developed what is called a limited en banc review, \nwhich by definition is incorrect and an oxymoron because ``en banc'' \nmeans the whole court. So that is why you have so many opinions in this \ncourt that are not uniform, that are problematic, and that undermine \nthe administration of justice for the one in five Americans who is \nsubject to this court's jurisdiction.\n  I look forward to working on this with my good friend the Senator \nfrom Montana and Members on both sides of the aisle. This should be a \nbipartisan issue for every Member of this body who wants to make sure \ntheir citizens have equal justice under the law.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/08/senate-section/article/S700-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUDGETARY REVISIONS\n\n  Mr. ENZI.

JARVIS\n\n Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Forrest R. \n``Dick'' Jarvis, a beloved native of north central West Virginia who \npassed away on January 27, 2016.\n  Dick was a remarkable community leader, veteran, family man, and \nfriend; and he left a tremendous legacy throughout my home State. Put \nsimply, Dick stood out among others. He was the epitome of what West \nVirginians are all about, with his hospitable nature and unwavering \ncommitment to helping those in need.\n  Upon graduating from Rivesville High School in 1948, Dick enlisted in\n\n[[Page S701]]\n\nthe U.S. Navy, where he reported aboard the Destroyer USS Brownson DD \n868 during the Korean war. His selfless service to our State and Nation \nis truly admirable and will never be forgotten.\n  Once discharged, he returned to West Virginia and entered the \ninsurance business, where he retired as a sales manager after more than \n25 years of service.\n  Dick was an outstanding community leader and was also a member of \nnumerous organizations. He was president of the Morgantown Life \nUnderwriters Association and the West Virginia Association of Life \nUnderwriters and was a Life Underwriter Training Council Fellow. He was \nactive in the Democratic Party of Monongalia County and served two \nterms as county Democratic chairman. He served five terms on Star City \nCouncil and was president of the Monongalia County Volunteer Fire \nCompanies Association for 10 years.\n  Among his many accomplishments, Dick was instrumental in starting the \nMECCA 911 emergency dispatch center in Monongalia County and served as \nchairman of the policy board for more than 8 years. He was a lifetime \nmember of the Star City Volunteer Fire Department, the VFW Post 548, \nthe USS Brownson DD 868 Association, and the Tin Can Sailors \nAssociation.\n  It is a very special individual who can sacrifice so much for our \nNation, only to return home and continue the tradition of giving back \nto our communities. Dick led by example and treated his neighbors as \nfriends and his friends as family. He instilled this same loyal \ncommunity service mindset throughout his family. He leaves behind his \nloving wife, Willa; his daughter Rebecca and her husband Reverend Mark \nCombs; his grandsons, Matthew and Alexander; and his dear brother \nRobert.\n  Dick was a beloved family man, friend, and inspiration to the Star \nCity community. His glowing smile and positive attitude were contagious \nand will live on in the memories and hearts of all those who had the \nprivilege of knowing him. Dick's service was greatly appreciated and \nwill certainly never be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/08/senate-section/article/S701-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO STEVE PRINGLE\n\n Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, agriculture is the backbone of our \ncountry. It is a significant economic driver, and perhaps more \nimportantly, it offers our citizens a way of life that is unique in \ntoday's world. Within agriculture, I often encounter thoughtful, \ncommitted men and women who work every day to raise their families, run \ntheir businesses, serve their neighbors, and provide a better future \nfor the next generation.\n  Those qualities are found in Steve Pringle, who has served on behalf \nof Texas Farm Bureau for over 25 years. Under Steve's leadership, the \norganization has influenced agricultural policy, promoted rural values, \nand worked to show an increasingly urban populace how food is produced.\n  I met Steve many years ago, and over those years, we grew to be \nfriends. As agricultural issues repeatedly came to the forefront of \ndebate in Washington--from trade and energy, to the economy, \noverregulation, and the farm bill--he was always someone whom I could \ncount on to give me trustworthy advice and counsel.\n  Steve is a veteran, a husband, and a father. His long and \ndistinguished career includes stints at the House Agriculture \nCommittee, Texas A University, and the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture. For over a quarter century however, Steve has been the \nface of Texas Farm Bureau. Steve's passion for improving the lives of \nfarmers and ranchers and advocating for the future of rural America has \nalways impressed me.\n  Steve Pringle embodies many traits we can all admire, including a \ndeep gratitude for the hard-working families who provide the food, \nfuel, and fiber Americans rely on. Texas farmers and ranchers found in \nSteve Pringle a true public servant who worked hard to make certain \ntheir voices were heard on Capitol Hill. These traits have earned Steve \nthe respect of his peers in Texas, in my home State of Kansas, and from \nacross the country.\n  Steve, we are grateful for your service and wish you and your wife, \nLinda, well in the next chapter of your life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/08/senate-section/article/S701-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 766.

A bill to encourage and facilitate international \nparticipation in the performing arts and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, Senator Hatch and I are \nreintroducing the Arts Require Timely Service Act or ARTS Act. This \nbipartisan measure would assist nonprofit arts organizations in \nobtaining visas for visiting foreign artists. For many renowned artists \nabroad hoping to share their talent with American audiences, our visa \nsystem is often inconsistent and unreliable. Although current law \nestablishes a specific processing period for artist visas, petitioners \nregularly confront prolonged and uncertain wait times. This delay and \nuncertainty carries great costs for the nonprofit organizations that \nseek to bring foreign artists to American audiences.\n  While expedited visa processing is available, many of these \norganizations are unable to afford those fees, and the resulting delays \nin regular processing lead to interruptions and cancellations in \nperformance schedules. Ultimately, the inefficiencies in obtaining \nforeign artist visas stifle the promotion of international cultural \nexchange and impede the mission of great American cultural \ninstitutions.\n  The ARTS Act addresses these challenges by requiring the Secretary of \nHomeland Security to provide expedited processing services, without a \nfee, if an O- or P- artist visa is not adjudicated within a 14-day time \nframe, and the petition is filed by or on behalf of a nonprofit \norganization. The legislation ensures that nonprofit arts organizations \ndo not have to choose between making adjustments to their programming \nand incurring additional unexpected costs. We should be encouraging \ninternational participation in the performing arts, not thwarting it. \nThat is why more than 80 national organizations consisting of \nmusicians, orchestras, museums, performing artists, and local arts \norganizations such as the Vermont Symphony Orchestra, support the ARTS \nAct.\n  I have long been a supporter of the arts and am proud of the great \ncontributions the arts community has made in my home state of Vermont. \nOrganizations such as the Vermont Symphony Orchestra, Vermont \nPerformance Lab, and Burlington City Arts enrich our State's dynamic \nculture, are integral to our economy, and ensure that all communities \nbenefit from the remarkable power of the arts. The ARTS Act \nacknowledges the\n\n[[Page S704]]\n\nunique challenges that nonprofit arts organizations confront with our \nvisa system and would assist them in their effort to bring \ninternational arts and culture to our communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/08/senate-section/article/S704-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S704]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 365--DESIGNATING FEBRUARY 2016 AS ``AMERICAN HEART \n       MONTH'' AND FEBRUARY 5, 2016, AS ``NATIONAL WEAR RED DAY''\n\n  Ms. HIRONO (for herself, Ms. Baldwin, Mrs. Feinstein, Ms. Heitkamp, \nMs. Warren, Ms. Klobuchar, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Murkowski, Mrs. Capito, Ms. \nAyotte, Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Fischer, Mrs. Shaheen, Ms. \nStabenow, Ms. Collins, Mr. Durbin, and Ms. Mikulski) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S. Res. 365\n\n       Whereas heart disease affects men, women, and children of \n     every age and race in the United States;\n       Whereas, between 2003 and 2013, the death rate from heart \n     disease fell nearly 40 percent, but heart disease continues \n     to be the leading cause of death in the United States, taking \n     the lives of approximately 370,000 individuals in the United \n     States and accounting for 1 in 7 deaths nationwide;\n       Whereas congenital heart defects are the most common birth \n     defect in the United States, as well as the leading killer of \n     infants with birth defects;\n       Whereas, every year, an estimated 750,000 individuals in \n     the United States have a heart attack, of which an estimated \n     116,000 individuals die;\n       Whereas cardiovascular disease and stroke account for \n     $316,000,000,000 in health care expenditures and lost \n     productivity annually;\n       Whereas cardiovascular disease and stroke will account for \n     $1,393,000,000,000 in health care expenditures and lost \n     productivity annually by 2030;\n       Whereas individuals in the United States have made great \n     progress in reducing the death rate for coronary heart \n     disease, but this progress has been more modest with respect \n     to the death rate for coronary heart disease for women and \n     minorities;\n       Whereas many people do not recognize that heart disease is \n     the number 1 killer of women in the United States, taking the \n     lives of 287,220 women in 2012;\n       Whereas nearly \\2/3\\ of women who unexpectedly die of heart \n     disease have no previous symptoms of disease;\n       Whereas nearly \\1/2\\ of all African-American adults have \n     some form of cardiovascular disease, including 48 percent of \n     African-American women and 46 percent of African-American \n     men;\n       Whereas many minority women, including African-American, \n     Hispanic, Asian-American, and Native-American women and women \n     from indigenous populations, have a greater prevalence of \n     risk factors or are at a higher risk of death from heart \n     disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases, but such \n     women are less likely to know of the risk;\n       Whereas, between 1965 and 2016, treatment of cardiovascular \n     disease for women has largely been based on medical research \n     on men;\n       Whereas, due to the differences in heart disease between \n     males and females, more research and data on the effects of \n     heart disease treatments for women is vital;\n       Whereas extensive clinical and statistical studies have \n     identified major and contributing factors that increase the \n     risk of heart disease, including high blood pressure, high \n     blood cholesterol, smoking tobacco products, exposure to \n     tobacco smoke, physical inactivity, obesity, and diabetes \n     mellitus;\n       Whereas an individual can greatly reduce the risk of \n     cardiovascular disease through lifestyle modification coupled \n     with medical treatment when necessary;\n       Whereas greater awareness and early detection of risk \n     factors of heart disease can improve and save the lives of \n     thousands of individuals in the United States each year;\n       Whereas under the Joint Resolution entitled ``Joint \n     Resolution to provide for the designation of the month of \n     February in each year as `American Heart Month' '', approved \n     December 30, 1963 (36 U.S.C. 101), Congress requested that \n     the President issue an annual proclamation designating \n     February as ``American Heart Month'';\n       Whereas the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of \n     the National Institutes of Health, the American Heart \n     Association, and many other organizations celebrate \n     ``National Wear Red Day'' during February by ``going red'' to \n     increase awareness about heart disease as the leading killer \n     of women;

Mr. REID (for Mrs. Shaheen) submitted an amendment intended \nto be proposed to amendment SA 2953 proposed by Ms. Murkowski to the \nbill S. 2012, to provide for the modernization of the energy policy of \nthe United States, and for other purposes; which was ordered to lie on \nthe table; as follows:\n\n       At the end of title II, add the following:\n\n         Subtitle F--Heat Efficiency Through Applied Technology\n\n     SEC. 2501. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Heat Efficiency through \n     Applied Technology Act'' or the ``HEAT Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2502. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) combined heat and power technology, also known as \n     cogeneration, is a technology that efficiently produces \n     electricity and thermal energy at the point of use of the \n     technology;\n       (2) by combining the provision of both electricity and \n     thermal energy in a single step, combined heat and power \n     technology makes significantly more-efficient use of fuel, as \n     compared to separate generation of heat and power, which has \n     significant economic and environmental advantages;\n       (3) waste heat to power is a technology that captures heat \n     discarded by an existing industrial process and uses that \n     heat to generate power with no additional fuel and no \n     incremental emissions, reducing the need for electricity from \n     other sources and the grid, and any associated emissions;\n       (4) waste heat or waste heat to power is considered \n     renewable energy in 17 States;\n       (5)(A) a 2012 joint report by the Department of Energy and \n     the Environmental Protection Agency estimated that by \n     achieving the national goal outlined in Executive Order 13624 \n     (77 Fed. Reg. 54779) (September 5, 2012) of deploying 40 \n     gigawatts of new combined heat and power technology by 2020, \n     the United States would increase the total combined heat and \n     power capacity of the United States by 50 percent in less \n     than a decade; and\n       (B) additional efficiency would--\n       (i) save 1,000,000,000,000,000 BTUs of energy; and\n       (ii) reduce emissions by 150,000,000 metric tons of carbon \n     dioxide annually, a quantity equivalent to the emissions from \n     more than 25,000,000 cars;\n       (6) a 2012 report by the Environmental Protection Agency \n     estimated the amount of waste heat available at a temperature \n     high enough for power generation from industrial and \n     nonindustrial applications represents an additional 10 \n     gigawatts of electric generating capacity on a national \n     basis;\n       (7) distributed energy generation, including through \n     combined heat and power technology and waste heat to power \n     technology, has ancillary benefits, such as--\n       (A) removing load from the electricity distribution grid; \n     and\n       (B) improving the overall reliability of the electricity \n     distribution system; and\n       (8)(A) a number of regulatory barriers impede broad \n     deployment of combined heat and power technology and waste \n     heat to power technology; and\n       (B) a 2008 study by Oak Ridge National Laboratory \n     identified interconnection issues, regulated fees and \n     tariffs, and environmental permitting as areas that could be \n     streamlined with respect to the provision of combined heat \n     and power technology and waste heat to power technology.\n\n     SEC. 2503.
