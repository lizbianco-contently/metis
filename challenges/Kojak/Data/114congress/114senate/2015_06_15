Mr. President, the Statue of Liberty stands as a universal \nsymbol of hope and freedom. Engraved within its pedestal are the words \nof Emma Lazarus, a call etched for the world to see.\n\n       Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning \n     to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. \n     Send these, the homeless, the tempest-tost to me. I lift my \n     lamp beside the golden door!\n\n  For countless generations, our fathers and grandfathers, mothers and \ngrandmothers, have braved oceans, deserts, and rivers to answer that \ncall. As a result, the United States has been empowered by the \ncontributions of immigrants from around the world--immigrants who came \nin pursuit of the American dream and have pursued this dream through \nstrong family values, hard work, and love of country.\n  My wife's father, my father-in-law, emigrated here from Russia. My \ngrandmother came from England. My family, like so many American \nfamilies, has its immigrant stories to tell.\n  This month is Immigrant Heritage Month. As we celebrate our shared \nimmigrant heritage, we must work to ensure that America welcomes future \ngenerations of immigrants with the dignity and respect we wish for our \nown families.\n  The United States has become the greatest Nation on Earth because of \nthe hard work, dedication, and diversity immigrants brought to these \nshores. Our strength lies in our ability to embrace the richness \nimmigrants bring to the American story. Just look at some of our \nNation's most successful companies: Google, Yahoo, General Electric, \nIBM. These are all modern companies, but over the centuries, we have \nhad life stories, where just like Google, Yahoo, General Electric, and \nIBM, all these American companies were founded by immigrants or the \nchildren of immigrants.\n  I have seen personally the contributions of immigrants and the \npositive impact that a diversity of backgrounds has on shaping public \npolicy. My staff represents generations of immigrants brought to this \ncountry. One staff member was born in the Philippines and emigrated \nwith her mother to Las Vegas. Another left Nicaragua in the 1980s in \nthe midst of a brutal civil war and settled in Carson City. Others came \nfrom Mexico, El Salvador, and Poland. Much like our Nation, my office \nis all the better because it reflects the diverse backgrounds, \ncommunities, and perspectives of those who have immigrated to Nevada.\n  Nevada has a particularly vibrant international community. Las Vegas \nis home to large Latino, Asian, Pacific Islander, and Armenian \ncommunities. Northern Nevada has the same, but in addition to that, it \nis the home to proud descendants of immigrants from the Basque Country.\n  Without the contributions made by generations of proud immigrants, \nNevada would not be the State that it is today. Immigrants have been \nleaders. They protect our Nation, and they have taught our children. \nThe immigrants who heeded the call engraved on the Statue of Liberty \nhave altered this country for the better. We are and will always be a \nNation of immigrants.\n  I have devoted years of legislative effort to fixing our broken \nimmigration system. In 2010 after Republicans blocked the DREAM Act, it \nbecame clear to me and to other Senators that Republicans were not \ngoing to cooperate. So we urged the President to take administrative \naction as the Republicans continued to block legislative efforts.\n  Three years ago today, the President announced that young people who \ndo not present a risk to national security would become eligible for \nrelief from deportation through the Deferred Action for Childhood \nArrivals Program. As a result of this action, over 660,000 DREAMers \nhave been approved, including almost 12,000 Nevadans. These individuals \nno longer live in fear of deportation. They can now contribute more \nfully to our country, as college students, teachers, small business \nowners, and artisans. These individuals were brought here as young \nchildren. Most do not remember the countries in\n\n[[Page S4120]]\n\nwhich they were born. When they pledge allegiance it is to the United \nStates. They love this country and are Americans in all but paperwork. \nThese young people can now become teachers, own businesses, and further \ncontribute to the American economy. They can secure a better future for \nthemselves, their families, and our country. The program is a temporary \nsolution for a broken immigration system.\n  Comprehensive immigration reform is the best way to repair our \nimmigration system and preserve the integrity of the American dream. In \nthe Senate we passed a bill almost 2 years ago for comprehensive \nimmigration reform, but House Republicans refused even to allow a vote \non that legislation. Had they allowed a vote on the legislation, it \nwould have passed by a big margin because virtually every Democrat \nwould have voted for it and a number of Republicans would have voted \nfor it. But the Speaker decided no, they wouldn't allow a vote on it, \nand they haven't. But because the Republicans would not pass \nimmigration reform, President Obama acted again within his legal \nauthority to create a new program for the parents of U.S. citizens and \ngreen card holders that would in effect take care of the parents of \nthese DREAMers. Those programs would be in effect now if it were not \nfor a politically motivated lawsuit filed by a Republican challenging \nthe program.\n  The Republicans say it is about the President, but they really are \nattacking and separating American families. In the Senate, Republicans \nhave tried repeatedly to stop President Obama's efforts.\n  The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program has transformed \nthe lives of hundreds of thousands of young people over the past 3 \nyears. Shutting down this program would cause the deportation of young \nmen and women to countries they don't know.\n  We, with the President, will do everything in our power to protect \nand defend this program and to fight the baseless lawsuit that is \npreventing over 5 million additional people for the American dream. The \nSupreme Court has been clear that Presidents have the authority for \nFederal immigration enforcement priorities. I am confident that the \nPresident's actions will ultimately be upheld, and I will continue to \nfight to protect those programs and keep families together.\n  I look forward to the day when programs such as DACA are replaced \nwith permanent comprehensive immigration reform, which is so vitally \nimportant.\n  Before closing, on the floor today is the assistant Democratic \nleader. He has been on this floor articulating the importance of these \nDREAMers and what they do for our country, and what initially was their \npotential for our country. Now of course it has already been proven \nthat their potential was even underscored. They have done so much more \nthan we even anticipated they could do. I appreciate very much my \nfriend, the senior Senator from Illinois, for his advocacy of this \nprogram and his tireless efforts for justice in America.\n  So I hope that we will live up to the words on the Statue of Liberty, \nat the lamp beside the golden door, which is beckoning to people from \nother shores.\n  Mr. President, will you announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/15/senate-section/article/S4120-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to thank the Democratic leader for \nhis kind words.\n  Today is the third anniversary of DACA.\n  It was 15 years ago when I received a call to my Senate office in \nChicago. A Korean-American woman who worked at a drycleaners in the \ncity of Chicago had a question for me. It turned out that her daughter, \nTereza Lee, had been offered an opportunity to go to school at one of \nthe best music schools in America, but she had problems filling out her \napplication.\n  The whole story is that this family had come through Brazil from \nKorea to the United States years before. The family, including Tereza, \nwho was then 2 years old, came in on a tourist visa. The idea behind \ntheir arrival in America was that her father was going to open a \nchurch. He would be a minister with his own congregation. It was a \ndream that was never realized. The family struggled. They were very \npoor. Tereza's mother went to work at a drycleaners. Her father didn't \nwork much. He had health problems.\n  Luckily, Tereza, this young girl, when she was about 10 or 12 years \nold, was enrolled in a music program in Chicago called the Merit Music \nProgram. The Merit Music Program offers to children from poor families \nmusical instruction and instruments. They introduced Tereza to the \npiano, and an amazing thing happened. She turned out to be an \nincredible musician. So she was finishing high school and was offered \nan opportunity to go to school in New York to a music school--the \nManhattan School of Music.\n  She had other offers, too, but when she went to fill out the \napplication and they asked her to put in her citizenship and \nnationality, she asked her dad and mom: What am I supposed to put \nthere? They said: We didn't file any papers for you. You are \ntechnically undocumented in America. Your sister and brother were born \nhere and are legal citizens. We have become legal in America, but as \nfor you, we are not sure. So what should we do? Let's call Durbin's \noffice.\n  They called my Senate office and the law is very clear. If you were \nbrought to the United States undocumented and lived your entire life \nhere and wanted to stay here, the law said you had to leave the United \nStates for 10 years and then apply to come back.\n  They asked me if there was anything else under the law, and I said \nno, that was it. It is because of that that I introduced the DREAM Act \n15 years ago. This DREAM Act said that young people under circumstances \nlike Tereza's, who were brought to the United States at a very young \nage, were raised in this country, were finishing school, and who had no \ncriminal record, would be given a chance--a chance to become legal in \nAmerica, the DREAM Act.\n  Well, that DREAM Act has been a dream for 15 years. It is not a law. \nBut, fortunately for me, when I served in the Senate, at one point I \nhad a colleague named Barack Obama, who was my fellow Senator and \ncosponsor of the DREAM Act in his day. When he became President and it \nbecame clear we were not going to pass comprehensive immigration reform \nor make the DREAM Act the law of the land, this President said: I will \ngive to these young people who would qualify for the DREAM Act \ntemporary status so they can stay in America on a temporary basis \nwithout fear of deportation. That is what the President did 3 years ago \nwith DACA, deferred action for childhood arrivals.\n  As the Democratic leader reported, 660,000 young people have signed \nup, paid a hefty filing fee, had a criminal background check, and \nsubmitted their names to the government. It was a leap of faith for \nthese young people to do this because if you grew up undocumented in \nAmerica, you were told at a very early age by your parents: For \ngoodness' sakes, keep your head down; don't ever get arrested; don't \ntry to drive a car. Not only could you get deported, our whole family \ncould get deported.\n  Well, these young people wanted to be heard, and they stepped up and \nthey signed up for the President's program.\n  It has been an incredible story. Five years ago, in April 2010, I \njoined with my former colleague Richard Lugar in writing a letter to \nPresident Obama asking him to establish this program. Later that year, \nSenator Reid, who just spoke, brought the DREAM Act to the Senate \nfloor. The Senate Gallery was filled with young people, undocumented \npeople, who came for that bill to be considered wearing caps and gowns. \nThey wanted to make it clear they were not looking for a free ride in \nAmerica. They were looking for a chance. But despite the fact that 55\n\n[[Page S4121]]\n\nSenators out of 100 voted for it, we did not get the magic number--60--\nand the DREAM Act did not become law.\n  Senator Reid joined me, with 22 other Democratic Senators, asking \nPresident Obama to create this DACA Program so these children could \nsign up. The President did. It is an amazing success. What has happened \nto these DREAMers when they are given a chance to have a future in \nAmerica, when they are not afraid of the knock on the door and being \ndeported? Well, what has happened? Amazing things have happened. They \nare beginning to contribute to America as engineers, teachers, small \nbusiness owners, and more.\n  I know this policy of the President to give these young people a \nchance to be part of America absolutely infuriates most of my \nRepublican colleagues. They cannot stand the thought that the President \nby Executive order would give these young people a chance. In fact, the \nHouse of Representatives on several occasions has tried to reverse this \nand take away this recognition that these young people can stay here on \na temporary basis without being deported.\n  Last fall, the President extended the program in what is known as \nDAPA--deferred action for parental accountability--for those who have \nbeen here for a long period of time and would also be given temporary \nstatus, registered with the government, and be able to work in our \ncountry.\n  Today, the Center for American Progress released a new report on the \nimpact on the economy of the United States of these people eligible for \nDACA, the young people, and DAPA, their parents. Over the next 10 \nyears, in my home State of Illinois, these two Presidential policies \nwill increase my State's gross domestic product by almost $15 billion, \nand it will increase the overall earnings of the people living in my \nState.\n  How is that possible? How is it possible to take these undocumented \npeople and turn them into a positive for the economy? Well, I will tell \nyou, that is what happens when they are on the books and working and \npaying their taxes, as they want to be, as they should be.\n  Senator John McCain of Arizona was just on the floor. He was one of \nfour Republican Senators--it took some courage--who stepped up and \nworked with four of us on the Democratic side to write a comprehensive \nimmigration bill. We believe that our immigration system is broken in \nAmerica, and we want to fix it. We met together for months working on \nthat bill. One of the good reports that came out of the bill was that a \ncomprehensive immigration system where people register, submit \nthemselves to a background check, and pay their taxes has a positive \nimpact on the economy of the United States.\n  Unfortunately, the expansion of these two programs has been blocked \nby a lawsuit in Texas filed against the President. Earlier this month, \nRepublicans in the House of Representatives voted to block the \nadministration from any money to defend this lawsuit. That amendment \nwas offered by a Republican Congressman from Iowa named Steve King, who \nhas falsely claimed that DREAMers are actually drug dealers with \n``calves the size of cantaloupes''--a direct quote from Congressman \nKing--because they are carrying drugs across our border. That is a \ncruel game Congressman King is playing with the lives of these young \npeople. And now they want to fix the game by blocking the Obama \nadministration from defending the lawsuit. Clearly, the proponents of \nthis lawsuit and their destructive efforts will ultimately fail. But \nthe Supreme Court has been clear--the President has the power to make \nthese policies.\n\n  It is so troubling that so many on the other side of the aisle are \ndetermined to block immigration in America.\n  I have come to the floor many times to tell the stories of these \nDREAMers, and I would like to tell one of those stories today on the \nthird anniversary of this DACA Program.\n  As shown in picture, this is Denisse Rojas. In 1990, when she was \njust a little infant, her parents carried her across the southwest \nborder with the hope of giving her and her siblings a better life. \nDenisse and her family settled in Fremont, CA. Denisse said: ``In grade \nschool, I recall feeling different from my peers. . . . my skin color \nwas darker, my English was stilted, I was poor, and I was \nundocumented.''\n  Denisse remembers her dad in a restaurant uniform studying late at \nnight so he could pass the GED test. And her mother attended community \ncollege part time for 7 years to earn a nursing degree. It was this \nperseverance that inspired Denisse to try harder.\n  In high school she was an excellent student and athlete. She \ngraduated with a 4.3 grade point average, and she received the U.S. \nArmy Reserve National Scholar Athlete Award.\n  Denisse was accepted to the University of California, Berkeley--one \nof the best colleges in the country--but because of her undocumented \nstatus, she did not qualify for any financial aid or government help. \nDenisse worked 30 hours a week while attending school full time, and \nshe commuted an hour each way to and from school every day so she could \nlive in affordable housing.\n  At Berkeley, Denisse Rojas majored in integrative biology and \nsociology. Because she was such a good student, she was selected to \nwork in the genetics lab. Her research was published in the journal \nScience.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes. I know the Senator \nis anxious, but if I could have 2 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator allow me to propound a unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Of course.\n  I am sorry, the staff said we have one more thing to check. If you \nwill give me 2 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Please proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I would have gladly yielded to my friend from Arizona but a higher \norder prevails.\n  As a senior at Berkeley, Denisse cofounded Pre-Health Dreamers, a \nnational organization of undocumented students who want to become \nhealth care professionals.\n  She volunteers at the San Francisco General Hospital Community to \nClinic Linkage Program, where she helps patients who are seeking \naffordable housing, healthy food, and employment.\n  In 2012, when President Obama established DACA--its third anniversary \ntoday--her life changed. As a DACA recipient, Denisse's dreams finally \nseemed within reach.\n  In this picture I have in the Chamber, Denisse is holding her letter \nof acceptance to Mount Sinai Medical School in New York. She will be in \nclasses this fall. She wrote me a letter. She said:\n  I have pledged allegiance to this nation's values since my first day \nof school; I consider the United States my home. Furthermore, serving \nothers has instilled in me the notion that everyone deserves the \nopportunity for prosperity. I thus aim to dedicate my life to serving \nothers as a physician and continuing to be a voice for immigrants.\n  Would America be a better country if she were deported? Would we be \nbetter as a nation if Denisse Rojas was told: Leave. We don't need you. \nWe don't want you. The fact that you have spent your entire life here \nmeans nothing. The fact that you are an exceptional student means \nnothing. Leave.\n  It sounds like a harsh point of view, but it is shared by many in \nCongress.\n  This last weekend, I took my two little grandkids--my wife and I \ndid--out to the Statue of Liberty on Ellis Island. I took a look at \nthat statue and was reminded that we are a nation of immigrants. I was \nblessed that my mother came to this country as an immigrant, and I \nstand on the Senate floor trying to do my best to make it a better \ncountry.\n  There are people like Denisse Rojas who want to make this a better \nAmerica. DACA has given them that chance. Today, we celebrate the third \nanniversary of this Executive order, but more importantly, we celebrate \nwho we are--a nation of immigrants always striving to make life better \nfor the next generation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and thank my colleague from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/15/senate-section/article/S4121-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4121-S4122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          EXPRESSING APPRECIATION TO THE SENATOR FROM ILLINOIS\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, as we continue to fight against ISIS and \ntheir radical allies, I rise to urge my colleagues to support the \nErnst-Boxer amendment, which provides authority for direct assistance \nto a critical partner in that fight: the Iraqi Kurds.\n  Defeating ISIS is critical to maintaining an inclusive and unified \nIraq, and the Iraqi Kurds are the key to that goal and helping to \nimprove the humanitarian crisis in the region through their support and \nprotection of over 1.6 million displaced persons from Iraq and Syria.\n  This bipartisan amendment, also cosponsored by Senators Graham, \nTillis, Rubio, and Gardner, provides temporary authority for the \nPresident, in consultation with the Iraqi Government--and I say, again, \nin consultation with the Iraqi Government--to provide weapons directly \nto Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga forces in the fight against ISIS should the \nadministration choose to do so.\n  Currently, by law, the United States must provide support to the \nIraqi Kurds through the Iraqi central government in Baghdad, which has \noften not been timely or adequate in the past. These delays have had a \nnegative impact on the Kurds' ability to defend Iraqi territory and \nprovide security for those who have sought refuge in Iraqi Kurdistan. \nThe President's recent decision to expedite arms to the Kurds as a way \nto improve the counter-ISIS effort, I believe, speaks for itself.\n  Additionally, last year, Secretary of State John Kerry said to the \nHouse Foreign Affairs Committee:\n\n       You said the administration is responsible for sending all \n     these weapons through Baghdad. No, we're not. You are. We're \n     adhering to U.S. law passed by Congress.\n\n  Secretary Kerry continued:\n\n       We have to send it to the [Iraqi] government because that's \n     U.S. law. If you want to change it, fix it, we invite you.\n\n  Well, this amendment does just that, and it does so in a bipartisan, \nbicameral fashion. It builds upon a similar bill in the House led by \nForeign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce and Ranking Member Engel. \nThis bill and my amendment are quite different than the House NDAA \nlanguage.\n  My amendment provides a 3-year authorization to reduce delays and \ninefficiencies in arming Peshmerga forces to fight ISIS while ensuring \nthe Iraqi Government is an integral part of the process. The amendment \ncontinues to promote a unified Iraq and enhances the ability to fight \nour common enemy--an enemy that ultimately seeks to bring their terror \nto our shores.\n  Furthermore, the amendment preserves the President's ability to \nnotify the Iraqi Government before weapons, equipment, defense services \nor related training is provided to Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga forces. It \nensures this emergency authorization does not construct a precedent of \nproviding direct support to organizations other than a country or an \ninternational organization. Most important to remember, it does not \nrequire the President to act. It provides him the authorization to do \nso if he feels the situation warrants it.\n  Beginning in the first gulf war, the Iraqi Kurds and their Peshmerga \nsecurity forces have played a vital role in supporting U.S. interests \nand fostering a free Iraq, despite limited means of doing so. Last \nweek, they not only held their ground but made some gains against ISIS \nin the Kirkuk Province. There are far too few positive news stories out \nof Iraq recently, but when there are some, it is often the Kurds who \nare making that progress.\n  ISIS is deadly and determined, and Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga forces--\nour critical partner in the fight against ISIS--need U.S. weapons as \nquickly as possible. We simply cannot afford future delays at this \ncritical moment in the battle. I urge my colleagues to join us in \nsupporting this much needed bipartisan legislation to arm the Iraqi \nKurds in the fight against ISIS.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/15/senate-section/article/S4122-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4122-S4123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AMERICA'S SPACE PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I wish to address the issue of America's \nspace program.\n  Some very disturbing news has come out over the course of the \nAppropriations Committee's deliberations on the House-passed Commerce-\nState-Justice appropriations bill, which, it is my understanding, has \npassed the House. It includes the funding for NASA. What is disturbing \nabout it is that at a time when we are recognizing that Vladimir Putin \nis increasingly trying to thwart the interests of the United States \nwith his aggressiveness and invasion of Ukraine, his threats to the \nBaltic States, his invasion of that part of Ukraine known as Crimea, \nand the various other semi-threats he has made to us, it would \ncertainly seem to be in the interests of the United States that where \nwe have a joint shared and mutually agreed-to space program which goes \nall the way back to 1975 when in the middle of the Cold War an American \nspacecraft rendezvoused and docked with a Russian spacecraft, Soyuz--\nand the Apollo-Soyuz mission made extraordinary political as well as \nscientific history for those two crews, led by Gen. Tom Stafford on the \nAmerican side and General Alexei Leonov on the Soviet side. After they \ndocked, those two crews lived together in space for 9 days in the \nmiddle of the Cold War, 1975. That set us on the course--with the \nSoviet Union still in existence--of starting to cooperate. We actually \nhad an American space shuttle rendezvous and dock with the first \nRussian space station, MIR. From there, we went on to build the \nInternational Space Station with the Russians as well as a dozen other \nnations as our partners. This space station, on orbit 250 to 325 miles \nhigh, is 120 yards long. In other words, if you sat at the 50-yard line \nin a football stadium, you would look from one goalpost to the other \ngoalpost and that is how big this is, the International Space Station. \nThere are six human beings up there. There is an international crew. \nThere are Russians, there are Americans, and from time to time there \nare Italians, Germans, French, Japanese--a whole host of nations that \nare our partners.\n  So it has been that as we built this space station, the Russians \nwould launch on their Soyuz spacecraft, to and from the International \nSpace Station, supply and human supply, and the Americans, who had the \ncapacity of 45,000 pounds on the space shuttle,\n\n[[Page S4123]]\n\nwould take up the component parts of the space shuttle and assemble \nthem in orbit. We continued that over the better part of a decade and a \nhalf, until the space station was complete.\n  In the interim, we lost 14 souls and 2 space shuttles, the last one \nof which was Columbia in the winter of 2003. The investigation board, \nled by Navy Admiral Gehman, said: As soon as you get the space station \nassembled--it was necessary to fly the space shuttle to take up the \ncomponent parts--you shut it down and you replace the space shuttle \nwith a safer rocket.\n  I won't take the time right now to explain the engineering and design \nof the space shuttle versus the future rocket, but for this discussion, \nsuffice it to say that when you put the crew in a capsule at the top of \nthe rocket, they have the capability to escape, saving the crew, even \nif there is an explosion of the rocket on the pad because the capsule \ncan separate with the escape rockets and land some distance away via \nparachutes.\n  By the way, one of those rockets under development right now just had \nits pad-abort test--SpaceX--and it was very successful.\n  I am giving all this background to get to what was almost a dagger in \nthe heart coming out of the Appropriations Committee in both the House \nand the Senate, and that is, they have funded NASA fairly well given \nthe fact that they are trying to cut in order to satisfy this tea \nparty-inspired sequester, which is this cut across the board, but in \ndoing so, what they have done is cut the development funds for the \nhumans riding on American rockets to get to and from our International \nSpace Station, the essence of which is that if those funding cuts the \ncommittee has done are sustained, it will delay us from putting \nAmericans on American rockets going to and from the space station \nuntil, instead of 2017, very likely 2019.\n  Ask almost any American whether they want a successful American space \nprogram, and they will clearly tell you yes, and that means Americans \non American rockets. We have those rockets. They are sending cargo to \nand from. But we have to go in and do the designs of the redundancies \nand the escape systems on these commercial rockets, the two companies \nof which in competition are Boeing and SpaceX.\n  Now let me get back to Vladimir Putin. Do we think it is a matter of \nwise public policy that we would continue our dependence on Vladimir \nPutin on our ability to get to our own International Space Station by \nhaving to ride and pay what he now charges--$75 million a ride per U.S. \nastronaut? Do we think that is wise public policy given this President \nof the Russian Federation who is so predictable? I don't think so.\n  So what the House did--the President's request for this next round of \ncompetition--and they have come a long way. They are ready to go. I \njust said that one of the competitors, SpaceX, just did a pad-abort \ntest by showing that the capsule could separate from the rocket and \nsafely land 3,600 feet away in a splashdown with the parachutes.\n  It is not wise public policy to cut funding so this development of \nsafe human space travel on these commercial rockets of Boeing and \nSpaceX--it is not good public policy, it is not in the interests of \nU.S. public policy that we would stay tied to Vladimir Putin in order \nto get to and from our own space station with astronauts.\n  It is just a small amount of money. The President requested for this \nnext year of competition $1.24 billion to put in the redundancies and \nthe escape systems and have them tested. It is a critical year. It is \n2015. It is the middle of 2015. We are going to start flying U.S. \nastronauts 2 years from now, in 2017. But when you start cutting that \nfunding from the President's request to $900 million, as the Senate \nAppropriations Committee just did last week, or to $1 billion, which \nthe House has just done in the passage of their appropriations bill--\nwhen you do that, that is going to stretch out the development that it \nis very likely we can't send our own astronauts to our own space \nstation on our own rockets. We will have to keep paying Vladimir Putin \n$75 million every time we go to ride on the Soyuz to go to our own \nspace station. Now, you figure it out. How many rides is that over an \nadditional 2 years? That is probably $300 million right there. That is \nonly four rides, assuming he is going to be charging us in 2018 and \n2019 the same price he is charging now. He could jack that up.\n  I think it was a sad day in the Senate Appropriations Committee when \nthe committee turned down, by a very narrow vote of 14 to 12, Senator \nMikulski's amendment to restore the cut from $900 million to $1.24 \nbillion. Sooner or later, that appropriations bill is going to come out \nhere. It has a lot of other problems, as every appropriations bill \ndoes, as the Senate is finding out on this Defense authorization bill \nright now--all the funny money that is baked into it because of this \nso-called sequester. But when it comes out here, I am going to ask the \nSenators: Do you think it is wise policy that we continue our reliance \non Vladimir Putin?\n  As we have been doing the Defense bill, John McCain, our chairman, \nhas been on a rampage against giving money to Vladimir Putin by virtue \nof us buying the Russian engine, which is a very good engine and which \nbecame an engine for American rockets, after the collapse of the Soviet \nUnion, as a way of keeping their Russian--formerly Soviet--scientists \nengaged in an aerospace industry so they did not get secreted off to \nbecome scientists for rogue nations such as North Korea or Iran. But \nSenator McCain has pointed out--rightly this Senator believes--that you \nwant to reduce your reliance on those Russian engines called the RD-180 \nthat are the main engines for the Atlas V, one of the absolute prime \nhorses in the stable for our assured access to space. If we are going \nto lessen our dependence on the Russian engine, why wouldn't we lessen \nour dependence on Russian spacecraft being the only means by which we \nwould get to orbit to our own International Space Station? The logic is \ntoo compelling. Yet it is this ideological furor that has lapsed over \ninto partisanship that has so gripped these Halls of Congress into \nmaking irrational decisions.\n  We can correct this decision when that appropriations bill comes to \nthe floor of the Senate. I hope we will. I hope folks such as Senator \nMcCain--one of this country's two heroes who is taking this on in the \ndefense committee--are going to help us out here on the floor by taking \nthis on in the Appropriations Committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Madam President, the National Defense Authorization \nAct is one of the most important pieces of legislation Congress \nconsiders each and every year. That is why the new majority has made it \none of our top priorities. It is why we have reversed the worrying \ntrend of recent years, when we had seen such an important bill crammed \nin at the very last minute with little time for debate or for \namendment.\n  This year's Defense bill has undergone weeks of thorough and serious \nconsideration under the regular order, both in committee and here on \nthe floor. This year's Defense bill has been open to a vigorous and \nbipartisan amendment process, with amendments from both sides having \nbeen adopted already.\n\n[[Page S4124]]\n\n  It is a reform bill that aims to transform bureaucratic waste into \ncrucial investments for the men and women who give everything--\neverything--to protect us. It contains important quality-of-life \nprograms for these servicemembers and for their families. It holds the \npromise of compassion for wounded warriors, and it extends a hand of \nunderstanding to heroes who struggle with mental health challenges. It \nalso authorizes the pay raises our troops have surely earned.\n  It is a bill that contains input from both sides, and it is a bill \nthat reflects priorities from both sides. That is why it sailed out of \ncommittee with huge bipartisan support, 22 to 4. That is why the House \nof Representatives passed a similar version with support from both \nparties.\n  That is why one would think it would be headed towards strong \nbipartisan passage here in the Senate as well. But some Democratic \nleaders now want to hold pay raises and important medical programs for \nour troops hostage as leverage for unrelated partisan gains.\n  It is all part of the filibuster summer they promised us. Democratic \nleaders have been quite open in detailing their strategy, which \nbasically boils down to this: Deny our troops the benefits they have \nearned and even shut down the government if they can't extract more \ntaxpayer dollars for bureaucracies such as the IRS.\n  The American people don't want any part of this senseless filibuster \nsummer vacation. But Democratic leaders already packed up their dusty \nWinnebago and--with ``Bigger IRS or bust'' scrawled on the back--are \nnow barreling toward our troops and their families in a dangerous game \nof chicken.\n  I am asking these leaders to please stop--please stop. This isn't \nsome game. Please think about what you are doing.\n  We live in exceedingly dangerous times. We are faced with the most \n``diverse and complex array of crises'' in the postwar era, and that is \nHenry Kissinger saying that. Nearly every week seems to bring another \nnew example of ISIL's brutality.\n  This is certainly not a moment to use our military as leverage in \norder to secure a few more bucks--a few more bucks--for bloated \nbureaucracies such as the IRS.\n  All of this must make some of our Democratic colleagues uneasy. Some \nof them must be cringing at this strategy.\n  I am asking every Democrat who is serious about supporting our troops \nand our national security to stand with the American people in \nrejecting these partisan games. Our all-volunteer force should be \nfocused on training in combat and preparing for conflict, not worrying \nabout the partisan delay of important policy authorizations. We all \nknow how vital our troops are to both our country and our own local \ncommunities. I have come to the floor recently to talk about what the \nmen and women of our military mean to Kentucky.\n  I noted how, at Fort Campbell, more than 30,000 Army personnel \ntrained for important missions around the world, from repeated \ndeployments to Afghanistan to providing humanitarian support in places \nsuch as Africa. I noted how the base enriches the surrounding region \nwith an economic impact of $5 billion each year. I noted how Fort Knox \nhouses many different military commands in both a truly impressive \narray of training grounds and training facilities. I noted how the base \nmakes an economic impact of more than $2 billion in Hardin County and \nthe surrounding community.\n  So today I wish to speak a little bit about Blue Grass Army Depot. \nThe depot, located in Richmond, is integral to both the Army and our \nnational security as a facilitation site for the storage, renovation, \nand disposal of conventional munitions. It also serves as a reminder of \nthe many important tasks undertaken by the Department of Defense--and \none more reason Kentuckians don't want to see the Department distracted \nor disrupted by partisan games here in Washington, because, after \nhaving personally implored the Department of Defense for several \ndecades to meet our national commitment, the Department is now close to \ncompleting construction of a state-of-the-art chemical demilitarization \nfacility at the depot. That would allow for the proper disposal of \ndangerous chemical weapons that are stored there.\n  This is important for our country, and it is critical to the health \nand safety of my constituents in central Kentucky.\n  But it has also become a good jobs story for the region too. There \nare more than 1,400 jobs at the Blue Grass Army Depot, and hiring will \ncontinue when operations at the new facility begin.\n  Kentuckians know that passing the Defense bill before us would \nauthorize a new Special Forces facility at Fort Campbell. Kentuckians \nknow it would authorize construction projects and an important new \nmedical clinic at Fort Knox.\n  Kentuckians also know it would help the Department of Defense from \nbecoming unnecessarily distracted or disrupted as it continues carrying \nout critical tasks such as the kind we see at the Blue Grass Army \nDepot, disposing of these dangerous chemical weapons.\n  I am asking every Senator to remember all the ways our troops and our \nmilitary enrich our States and local communities. I am asking every \nSenator to consider the serious times we live in, too. And I am asking \nevery Senator to keep those things in mind when casting votes on the \nDefense bill.\n  We may be Republicans, we may be Democrats, but in the end we should \nall be able to come together to support the people who support us. \nLet's stand together in rejecting partisan games in favor of a \nbipartisan bill that contains good ideas from both parties and gives \nPresident Obama the exact funding level he asked for. This bill gives \nPresident Obama the exact funding level he asked for. Let's worry less \nabout the demands of one party's political base and more about \nsupporting the brave men and women who live on the base.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/15/senate-section/article/S4124-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4124-S4125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            CHILD ABUSE REPORTING LOOPHOLE ON MILITARY BASES\n\n  Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, I rise today to enable my colleagues to \nbecome aware of the tragic circumstances that led to the untimely death \nof 5-year-old Talia Williams and an amendment I have submitted that \nseeks to close the loophole that allowed Talia to slip through our \nchild abuse safety net.\n  In 2005, Talia Williams moved to Hawaii to live with her father, \nNaeem Williams, and his wife, Talia's stepmother, Delilah Williams. Mr. \nWilliams was in the military, stationed at Schofield Barracks. Mr. \nWilliams' defense attorney argued that Mr. Williams was ill-equipped to \ncare for his daughter. That may be true, but what we know for a fact is \nthat Talia Williams suffered 7 months of near constant abuse at the \nhands of her father and stepmother. This torture ended on July 16, \n2005, when Mr. Williams hit Talia so hard it left his fist imprinted on \nher chest and killed her. Mr. Williams was convicted of murdering his \ndaughter last year, and he was sentenced to life without the \npossibility of parole. Her stepmother, Delilah Williams, was given a \nreduced sentence of 20 years in prison for providing testimony against \nher husband.\n  Tarshia Williams, Talia's mother, sued the military in 2010 for the \ndeath of her daughter. Her case was settled earlier this year, with the \nDepartment of Defense agreeing to a $2 million settlement for not doing \nenough to save Talia Williams.\n  In the course of those two proceedings, it became clear that Talia \nWilliams could have been saved if one thing occurred--reporting the \nabuse to Hawaii's Child Welfare Services branch or CPS. Through a \nmemorandum of understanding--MOU--with the State of Hawaii, the \nDepartment of Defense established a system in which Hawaii's Child \nWelfare Services would be ``the agency primarily responsible for \nintake, investigation, and the provision of protective services as \ndeemed necessary to abused children within the State of Hawaii,'' \nincluding the children of military families both on and off base.\n  Under statute and reiterated in the MOU, only Hawaii's State agencies\n\n[[Page S4125]]\n\nhave the authority--not the military--to take emergency custody and \norder foster care placement for children without the consent of a \nparent. But this could only happen if officials in Hawaii knew about \nthe abuse.\n  In Talia's case, a number of people were aware of her maltreatment. \nYet no report was received by the report point of contact, who was the \nperson on base mandated to report to Hawaii's Child Protective \nServices. The court in Tarshia Williams' civil suit found that military \nlaw enforcement, the doctors who treated Talia, and at least one or two \nfamily counselors had reason to suspect that violence was occurring in \nthe Williams home. At least one person on base directly reported to the \nfamily advocacy program her concerns for Talia's well-being. No action \nwas taken. Talia remained in the home while time and again law \nenforcement personnel and others were called to investigate or received \nreports of abuse. Not enough was done to remove her from her home. This \nlack of action was and is unacceptable. No one followed up on Talia's \ncase to the degree we all should expect. Information about the abuse \nshe lived through never reached the Army provost, who, under the MOU \nwith the State of Hawaii, was the single person required to alert Child \nWelfare Services. And Talia died.\n  This loophole, which puts us in a position of hoping and trusting \nthat information of abuse makes it to the reporting point of contact, \nmust be addressed. My amendment would fix this problem by establishing \na legal requirement that any federally mandated reporter with credible \nevidence or suspicion of child abuse notify both the DOD's Family \nAdvocacy Program and the appropriate State's child welfare department. \nThis amendment would eliminate the bottleneck of having only one \nreporting point of contact. Instead, mandatory reporters--which include \nteachers, doctors, law enforcement, and others--must directly report \nsuch evidence or suspicion both up the chain of command and also over \nto the appropriate State authorities. I am hopeful that by requiring \nsuch dual reporting, no military-connected children will remain in \nabusive homes because information never made it to the right person.\n  There were many mistakes made in Talia's case. Some of those mistakes \nare of the type that no law might rectify--a reluctance of people to \nget involved in the affairs of others, the reluctance to implicate \nabuse, perhaps fear of repercussions or out of respect for a member's \nservice and personal affability. However, in a case such as Talia's, \nmore should have been done and could have been done if only the right \npeople were made aware of the situation.\n  I hope we do not continue to ignore this one glaring reporting \nloophole, leaving in place a hole in our safety net wide enough to miss \nthe torture and untimely death of a child like Talia.\n  I recognize that time on the Defense authorization is short. I am \nsure the Department of Defense shares my concerns on this issue. I look \nforward to working with the Department and my colleagues to close this \nreporting loophole.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/15/senate-section/article/S4125-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4125-S4126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    3RD ANNIVERSARY OF DACA PROGRAM\n\n  Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, I would like to take a few minutes to \nshift gears to another issue of great importance. This issue is more \nhopeful. On June 15, 2012, President Obama enacted DACA--or Deferred \nAction for Childhood Arrivals--granting deferred action to DREAMers all \nacross the country. Three years later, almost 700,000 hard-working \nyoung people are proof that deferred action works.\n  DACA has changed the lives of countless students who were brought to \nour country as undocumented children through no fault of their own. The \nPresident's action has been truly transformative for many young people \nin Hawaii. Let me tell you about three such young people.\n  Gabriela emigrated from Brazil with her family at the age of 15. \nDespite a 3.8 GPA in high school, she found herself unable to go to \ncollege because she lacked required documentation. After receiving \nDACA, Gabriela enrolled in a community college, paying instate tuition, \nand is receiving her associate's degree in the spring of 2015 and \ntransferring to the University of Hawaii to earn her bachelor's degree. \nReceiving DACA was a life-changing moment for Gabriela because it \nenabled her to do everyday things that she was never able to do before, \nsuch as getting a driver's license, opening a bank account, renting her \nown apartment. It also enabled her to get an education, start a career, \nand live up to her full potential.\n  Sam was born in Tonga and brought to Hawaii when he was only 4 years \nold. His parents petitioned for residency for the whole family. But as \na result of a slow and ineffective immigration system, Sam was over 18 \nyears old by the time their petition became current. As a result, 18-\nyear-old Sam was put into deportation proceedings and came very close \nto being torn away from his family and deported to a country he no \nlonger remembered. Thankfully, the President announced the DACA Program \nand Sam was granted a stay of deportation and allowed to remain with \nhis family. Today, Sam works as a music director at his church and is \ncurrently saving money to return to school and seek his dream of higher \neducation.\n  Shingai is a DREAMer from Zimbabwe, who immigrated to the United \nStates when he was 12. He did not find out he was undocumented until he \ngraduated from high school and decided to apply for college. Shingai \nwas a star football athlete and won a full football scholarship to go \nto college. Unfortunately, with stardom came immediate attention. Due \nto his undocumented status, he was forced to quit his dream and protect \nhimself and his family from the public eye. Shingai knew the importance \nof education, so he pursued his degree a few classes at a time. This \nsemester, he is finally set to graduate and earn a bachelor's in \npolitical science from Hawaii Pacific University. Receiving DACA has \nenabled Shingai to come out of the shadows and share his story in order \nto raise awareness and empower immigrant youth in Hawaii.\n  These DREAMers no longer have the fear of deportation and family \nseparation hanging over their heads each and every day. DACA recipients \nare now free to live their lives, to seek an education and work as \nteachers, engineers, enter our armed services, become business owners.\n  DACA is life-changing for these young people, but it also has helped \nall Americans.\n  Forty-nine percent of DREAMers who were granted DACA were able to \nopen their first bank account, 33 percent were able to obtain a credit \ncard, 60 percent have been able to gain new jobs, contributing to our \ntax base and our economy. Experts estimate that all deferred action \nrecipients will add $230 billion to our gross domestic product in the \nnext decade. Quite simply, DACA works.\n  The American public stands with our DREAMers and immigrant families \nand smart policies like DACA. Over 70 percent of Americans reject the \nmass deportation approach favored by some and instead support the \nPresident's Executive action. However, DACA is only a temporary \nsolution to address one part of our broken immigration system. It is \nnot a substitute for comprehensive immigration reform.\n  It has been roughly 2 years since the Senate passed an immigration \nreform bill with strong bipartisan support. After House Republicans \nrefused to act on comprehensive immigration reform, President Obama \nbuilt on the success of DACA to use his well-established Executive \nauthority to expand the DACA Program and create a new program for the \nparents of children born as U.S. citizens. I strongly support the \nPresident's action.\n  Both of these programs could be up and running, helping families and \nindividuals, millions of them, but for a lawsuit filed by some \nRepublican Governors opposed to immigration reform. We must continue \nfighting to provide relief for millions of parents who should be \nsigning up for DAPA right now, paying their fees and applying for work \npermits, additional young people who qualify for DACA as well as \nmillions of other hard-working families facing deportation every single \nday in our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S4126]]\n\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS.

Madam President, this is week 14 of ``Waste of the Week.'' \nI have been coming to the floor for 14 weeks while the Senate has been \nin session this year to talk about yet another waste which, if we can \ncorrect, can save the taxpayers a lot of money. In this case, we are \ntalking about several billion dollars that have been determined by the \ninspector general of the Social Security Administration to have been \nspent improperly, accidently--by whatever reason--money that belongs to \nthe taxpayers and falls under the category of waste.\n  It is waste, and I give this inspector general and his staff great \ncredit for doing something very creative and interesting. Actually, \nthis is their job, delving into how an agency handles its business and, \nmore importantly, how it handles the taxpayers' money. Whether you are \nlooking at big business or big government, you find examples of cost \ncutting that can save the company and, in this case, save the taxpayer, \na very significant amount of money.\n  The inspector general decided to take a random sample of over 1,500 \nbeneficiaries of the Social Security disability fund, and 44.5 percent \nof them received an overpayment at some point during the 10-year period \nthat he studied. And based on this sample, the Social Security \ninspector general estimated that overpayments totaled about $16.8 \nbillion over a period of time from October 2003 to February 2014, \ncovering nearly 4 million beneficiaries. Now, that is a lot of people, \nbut in this digital age, there are ways in which we can ensure that \ncorrect payments are made to the right people and that we don't end up \noverspending money that comes from hard-earned taxpayer dollars.\n\n  Now, there is some good news to this story because the Social \nSecurity Administration, following up on this study, determined to go \nthrough its records and try to recover some of this money that had been \noverpaid. They were successful in recovering nearly half of the $16.8 \nbillion. They recovered $8.1 billion of overpayments during this period \nof time, and I commend them for their effort in doing that. But while \nwe celebrate the good news, we also need to dig in and determine how we \nmake sure this doesn't continue.\n  There is another $8.7 billion out there that needs to be recovered \nand, of course, the goal is to not only recover that money, if \npossible, but also to keep this from continuing in out-years. So let us \nput the steps in place that will give us the ability to stop this from \nhappening going forward.\n  Now, let me go back and give a little background, the history of how \nthis all came about and how this happened. Of those who improperly \nreceived benefits, the circumstances break down like this: Nearly 40 \npercent--actually 37.9 percent--of the overpayments happened when \nindividuals started working and made enough money by law to support \nthemselves and, therefore, no longer qualified for Social Security \ndisability benefits. Another 23 percent had their medical condition \nimproved to the point where they could go back to work.\n  Now, interestingly enough, I believe it was my very first ``Waste of \nthe Week'' that I pointed out that a very significant number of \nindividuals were receiving payments both from Social Security \ndisability and unemployment insurance. To receive unemployment \ninsurance, you have to prove you cannot work or you have been thrown \nout of work and can't get back. To receive Social Security disability \npayments, you have to prove you no longer are able to work and get \nback. Yet these people were receiving payments from both of those \nsources.\n  That was the very first ``Waste of the week,'' and we put up a chart \nindicating that we are hoping to reach our goal of $100 billion of \nwaste, fraud, and abuse, to show the example of money being sent to \nWashington. Some say: We can't cut a penny from any program. Well, \nevery business that has gone through this great recession--now going on \nfor the sixth year or so--has had to make sacrifices and they have had \nto cut costs. Families have had to cut costs. Businesses have had to \ncut costs. Only the Federal Government says we can't cut a penny; every \nprogram we have is valuable and has to be saved and, in fact, needs \nmore money to be efficient.\n  So let's start with those issues that have been determined, through \ninspections by independent agencies, and proven to have fraud and waste \nand see if we can add this up. As you can see, this gauge is growing \nevery week.\n  Returning to the breakdown of those who improperly received benefits: \nAnother 8.6 percent had multiple reasons they were no longer eligible \nfor the benefit, 7.5 percent were imprisoned and had fugitive status, \nwhich means they were no longer qualified for the disability benefits, \nbut 7.2 percent of those people continued to receive checks after they \nhad died. So you not only have people in prison and therefore no longer \neligible, but 7.2 percent of the people receiving benefits received \nthose after they died, and that totaled up to a very significant amount \nof money.\n  Again, we certainly have the technology and the capability to run the \ndeath records through the system to make sure checks are not continuing \nto be sent out to the last home address or whatever to deceased \nindividuals and then taken in and cashed perhaps by family or who knows \nwho.\n  There were 3.4 percent who weren't entitled to benefits in the first \nplace. It should be pretty easy to scratch those names and save some \nmoney. There were 1.8 percent who had their payment improperly \ncomputed--in other words, overpayment, a mistake made by the Social \nSecurity Administration--1.8 percent had financial resources exceeding \nthe limit which they were supposed to get, 1.7 percent had a change in \ntheir living arrangements--they moved abroad and no longer were \neligible--and 5 percent fell under another category of reasons.\n  The bottom line is an inspection was made, a study was conducted to \nsee how this came about, and we now have the information that money was \nreturned through legal process, but there is still $8.7 billion out \nthere we didn't get back. So we want to make sure measures are now put \nin place so this doesn't continue. We certainly don't want some Senator \non the floor 5 years or 10 years from now saying: Let me tell you about \nthe latest study of the Social Security inspector general, and when the \nformer Senator from Indiana came to the floor he announced there was \n$8.7 billion still out there and that we ought to make changes in the \nsystem so it wouldn't happen again. But guess what. It didn't get done, \nand now here I am back at it.\n  So let's do this now. Let's make these changes now so the American \npeople understand we are here not to extort them from the kind of \noverpayment that is taking place and using their taxpayer dollars to \nachieve that goal. We can fix this problem, but it is going to take \nsome work.\n  We need better cross-referencing for beneficiaries with other \ngovernment lists or private lists to help identify earned wages or \nother assets. We need information sharing that can save billions and \nmake a significant financial debt into these unfortunate overpayments.\n  Assuming the trend of the IG report continues, this change can be \nmade, and the missing $8.7 billion in overpayments can be recovered by \nthe Social Security Administration in future payments. We haven't \ncalculated what potentially we could save in out-years because, \nhopefully, we will be able to put measures in place, now that we have \nthis information, that will stop these overpayments from being made. \nBut we do know there is $8.7 billion out there of money that can be \nrecovered.\n  So we are adding today a big chunk of money, bringing us up nearly to \nthree-quarters of our goal of reaching $100 billion in savings from \nwaste, fraud, and abuse. We are only into week 14, and we have several \nmore weeks and months ahead of us. I am hoping we are going to have to \nput an extension onto this chart. We will see how high it goes. Because \nour goal is to save the taxpayer dollars that the Federal Government \nhas been proven to waste through waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S4127]]\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nominations en \nbloc, which the clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read the nominations of \nMatthew T. McGuire, of the District of Columbia, to be United States \nExecutive Director of the International Bank for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment for a term of two years; and Gentry O. Smith, of North \nCarolina, a Career Member of the Senior Foreign Service, Class of \nMinister-Counselor, to be Director of the Office of Foreign Missions, \nand to have the rank of Ambassador during his tenure of service.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 30 \nminutes of debate, equally divided in the usual form.\n  Mrs. ERNST. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, shortly our colleagues will have an \nopportunity to vote on two nominations that are being recommended by \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I see that Senator Corker is on \nthe floor, and I thank him for his help in bringing these two \nconfirmations to the floor of the Senate. Both of these individuals are \nwell qualified, and I urge our colleagues to support both nominations.\n  One is the nomination of Matthew McGuire to be United States Director \nof the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The other \nis the nomination of Gentry Smith to be Director of the Office of \nForeign Missions.\n  Mr. McGuire is the Assistant to the Secretary and Director of the \nOffice of Business Liaison at the Department of Commerce, where he \nleads engagement with the business community, works to strengthen the \ninternational economic position of the United States, and advocates for \nU.S. trade and investment. Prior to joining the U.S. Government, Mr. \nMcGuire worked as a senior executive in the financial services industry \nfor more than 8 years, but he also has been active with nonprofit and \ncivic organizations throughout his career, working on a range of public \npolicy issues across the country and around the world.\n  In a world where global health, environmental resources, and security \nchallenges far outstrip any one country's ability to respond, it is in \nour clear interest to have strong U.S. leadership in the World Bank--\nthe foremost international organization promoting economic development, \npoverty alleviation, and good governance around the world.\n  Prominent Members of the House of Representatives emphasized this \ncritical role of the World Bank in their May 15 letter supporting Mr. \nMcGuire's nomination. Representatives Meeks, Clay, Murphy, Sewell, \nMeng, Rangel, and others stated that Mr. McGuire's senior executive \nexperience in the financial services industry and leadership roles with \nnonprofit and civic organizations working on public policy issues \naround the world ``make him distinctly qualified for this position.'' \nMr. McGuire's highly relevant experience in his current position at the \nDepartment of Commerce, added to his extensive background working in \nboth for-profit and nonprofit sectors, make him an excellent choice to \nrepresent the United States at this institution that is so crucial for \nglobal stability. I am confident he will serve with distinction.\n  Gentry O. Smith is currently a Senior Advisor at the Bureau of \nDiplomatic Security. The Office of Foreign Missions assists and \nregulates services for foreign missions in the United States, \nnegotiates with foreign diplomatic representatives to improve operating \nconditions for U.S. diplomatic missions and personnel abroad, ensures \nthat U.S. diplomatic missions abroad receive equivalent treatment with \nrespect to benefits, privileges, and immunities accorded by the host \ncountries, and, as necessary, adjusts the benefits accorded to foreign \nmissions in the United States on the basis of the principle of \nreciprocity.\n  Mr. Smith has an exemplary record of serving his country for well \nover a quarter of a century, starting with his service as a Raleigh \npolice officer. Mr. Smith's thorough and highly relevant experience as \na Regional Security Officer for American Embassies in Egypt, Japan, and \nBurma, and his employment with the Bureau of Diplomatic Security as \nDirector of Physical Security Programs, Deputy Assistant Secretary for \nCountermeasures, and Senior Advisor gives him the expertise and \nfortitude to head the agency responsible for both improving the \noperating conditions for U.S. diplomatic missions and for adjusting the \nbenefits accorded to foreign missions if our missions abroad face \nmistreatment.\n  Mr. Smith is a proven leader with extensive management experience and \nskills, and I am confident he will be an excellent Director of the \nOffice of Foreign Missions.\n  Let me also point out that I know our committee has been very, very \nbusy. We have been able to successfully steer towards enactment the \nbill for congressional review of the Iranian nuclear agreement. We \nrecently were able to report out in a 19-to-0 vote State Department \nauthorization. I must say that not a day goes by that our committee is \nnot doing some work on behalf of the Senate and the American people.\n  But I need to point out that we need to pay more attention to getting \nthe President's nominees to the floor with recommendations from our \ncommittee. If we complete these two nominations tonight--and I assume \nthat we will--I believe that will make four nominees on which we have \ncompleted our work in confirmation that the President has sent to us. \nThere are nine other recommendations, five of which are career \nofficers, that have been reported out of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee and have yet to be brought to the floor. Five of those nine \nare career people, and yet we have had no action on the floor of the \nSenate. Of more concern, there are 35 nominees currently pending before \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Of these 35, only 4 have had \nhearings, and 22 of the 35 are career diplomats.\n  I understand we have had an extremely busy schedule within the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee. Senator Corker and I have talked about \nthis, and I know we will use our best efforts to get these nominations \nmoving forward. I just really wanted to report that because I think we \nneed to work--not only our committee but the leadership of the Senate--\nto make sure the President's nominees are timely considered and are \ntimely brought forward to the full Senate. I know Senator Corker has \nbeen a true advocate of that process and certainly worked very well in \nthe last Congress to make sure our committee acted in a timely way. I \nlook forward to working with Senator Corker in this Congress to advance \nthose nominees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I rise in support of these two \nnominations. I appreciate the distinguished ranking\n\n[[Page S4128]]\n\nmember, Senator Cardin, for reading out their bios. They are Foreign \nService officers and have been in government service for some time. I \napplaud their desire to serve at this level and certainly plan to \nsupport them here at our 5:30 vote and hope other Members of the Senate \nwill.\n  As to the point regarding nominations, I think our committee last \nyear couldn't have acted in a more speedy fashion in getting nominees \nout. I know we are starting a new Congress, and there is a little \nbacklog that takes place. But I can assure the Senator and others on \nthe committee and others in this body that I have no desire to hold up \nespecially Foreign Service officers who have committed their lives to \nthe Foreign Service and have handled themselves in such a professional \nmanner nor, actually, other nominees. So I do look forward to working \nwith Senator Cardin to clear some folks through. I know we have had \nconversations today regarding moving them across the Senate floor. I \nknow every time there is a recess, typically a large swath of people \nare actually moved out right before recess. Hopefully, that will be the \ncase as it relates to some of the Foreign Service nominations that are \nhere.\n  But I appreciate the Senator raising it. I appreciate the way he \nworks with me, and I look forward to things picking up speed now that \nthe backlog of the first-of-the-year beginning and some of the many \nactivities that have been under way have been completed. So I thank the \nSenator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, again, let me thank Senator Corker. It has \nbeen a real pleasure to work with him on the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee. He has put the interest of the Senate and our Nation as the \nprinciple guiding force and the appropriate role for the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee.\n  In that regard, there is an amendment pending that we will be voting \non tomorrow on the National Defense Authorization Act. It comes under \nthe jurisdiction of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Let me \ncomment on that, if I might. That is an amendment offered by Senator \nErnst, and her amendment would provide temporary authority to provide \narms directly to the Kurds, the Kurdish regional government's security \nforces, outside the process established with coordinating all U.S. \nweapons deliveries and training with the Government of Iraq and \nBaghdad. Not only is it the U.S. policy to ensure that all armed \ntransfers are coordinated and approved by the Government of Iraq, it is \nalso the law of our country.\n  I very much oppose this amendment, and I just want my colleagues to \nunderstand why I hope they will reject this amendment. I know it is \nwell intended, but it would undermine the authority of the central \ngovernment. What we are looking for, how we are going to ultimately be \nable to bring stability to Iraq, we need to have a central government \nthat represents all the communities of Iraq, that represents the Shias, \nrepresents the Sunnis, represents the Kurds. If the central government \ncannot be the coordinating entity, then we are going to have a void in \nthat country which only fuels the ability of organizations such as ISIS \nto be able to get recruits and resources for their terrorist \nactivities.\n  We are sending military advisers, funding, and arms to the Iraqis and \nleading a global coalition and working every day with the Iraqi leaders \nand communities at all levels because we have an interest in a stable, \nunified, and Federal Iraq. To achieve this goal, we must have the \nconfidence of all of the Iraqi leaders, and that is why it is important \nfor us to coordinate our strategy through a central government.\n  I want to make one other point absolutely clear. There is absolutely \nno evidence that the Baghdad government is delaying or denying arms to \nthe Kurds. To date, the United States and the anti-ISIL coalition has \nprovided over 47 million rounds of ammunition, thousands of artillery \npieces and rifles, 1,000 AT4 shoulder-fired, anti-armor systems, \nhundreds of vehicles, including Mine Resistant Ambush Protected \nvehicles, known as the MRAPs, and European missiles to counter vehicle-\nborne improvised explosive devices. They have been receiving arms.\n  We have received letters, both the Senate Armed Services Committee \nand the Foreign Relations Committee, from Secretary of State Kerry and \nSecretary of Defense Carter in opposition to the Ernst amendment.\n  If I might quote from Secretary Kerry, where he said:\n\n       Any language that calls for preferred treatment for one \n     region of Iraq strengthens voices that have been working \n     against the pragmatic reconciliation policies advocated by \n     Prime Minister Abadi. . . . It also reinforces Iran's \n     narrative that the United States seeks Iraq's partition and \n     that Iran is Iraq's only true and reliable partner. The \n     result, therefore, is the precise opposite of what may have \n     been intended: the language strengthens ISIL and other \n     extremists, weakens Iraqi voices committed to working with \n     the Coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL, \n     increased Iran's prominence, and erodes state authority at a \n     time when such authority is vitally needed to isolate and \n     defeat extremist actors.\n\n  What Secretary Kerry is saying is--it should be pretty obvious--that \nin order to diminish Iran's influence in Iraq, you need a central \ngovernment that has the confidence of the Sunni population and the \nKurdish population. If, on the other hand, we are talking about trying \nto divide the country, that we are going to deal differently with the \nKurdish defense and not through the central defense, then it feeds into \nthe point that the United States is not serious about developing a \nunified Iraqi authority. We must have that if we are going to be able \nto succeed in Iraq.\n  What Secretary Carter said, Secretary of Defense:\n\n       Directly arming the Kurds or other groups within Iraq is \n     inconsistent with the longstanding U.S. foreign policy of \n     working to maintain a stable, unified, Iraq. . . . \n     Legislative language of this type risks undermining the \n     Government of Iraq and undercutting ongoing coalition \n     military operations that are conducting in coordination with \n     the Government of Iraq to degrade, destroy, and ultimately \n     defeat ISIL.\n\n  Once again, we have our two top individuals both telling us this \nwould be counterproductive. I know my colleague is well intentioned \nwith her amendment, but the fact is that the only way we are going to \nsucceed in Iraq is if we can have a Government of Iraq that has the \nconfidence of all the communities and an Iraqi Government that believes \nthe United States is not picking sides among the ethnic communities in \nIraq and that Iraq does not have to rely on Iran for its security \nneeds.\n  That means this amendment could be counterproductive to those very \ngoals, our very goals in Iraq. When this amendment comes up for vote \ntomorrow, I urge my colleagues to vote against it.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I will be supporting the nominee who is \ngoing to be shortly voted on.\n\n\n                    3rd Anniversary of DACA Program\n\n  Mr. President, I take this opportunity to rise on the third \nanniversary of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program for \nall of the young men and women it has helped--young men and women who \ncame to this country as young children through no choice of their own. \nTheir parents made that decision for them. The only country they have \never known is that of the United States. The only flag they pledge \nallegiance to is the American flag. The only national anthem they know \nis ``The Star-Spangled Banner.'' And because of the Deferred Action for \nChildhood Arrivals Program, they have had temporary deportation relief \nand work authorizations so they could achieve their full potential as \nyoung Americans.\n  I celebrate what we call this program, DACA, Deferred Action for \nChildhood Arrivals Program, with great pride because I pushed very hard \nto make it a reality. I spoke to the President many times about \ngranting long overdue administrative relief to DREAMers, who are \nAmericans in every way except for a piece of paper.\n\n[[Page S4129]]\n\nAnd 3 years ago with the tireless advocacy of DREAMers, the immigrant \ncommunity, community leaders in cities and towns across America, and \nwith the help of countless Members of Congress, the President took \naction and changed the lives of millions of young men and women living \nin this country, allowing them to fully contribute to the country they \ncall home.\n  Today, the dream is still very much alive. This Deferred Action for \nChildhood Arrivals Program has harnessed the talent of hundreds of \nthousands of young Americans in immeasurable ways since its successful \ninception, and it is a success because of the bold Executive actions \ntaken in June of 2012.\n  In an immigration system that is as flawed as ours, the Deferred \nAction for Childhood Arrivals Program has been a beacon of hope, one \nstep toward a more fair and just reality for immigrants in our great \ncountry. The numbers tell the story.\n  The action gave 700,000 young immigrants a chance at a better life. \nIt has strengthened our economy and has generated roughly $422 million \nin application fees over the last 3 years. It has allowed young \nAmericans to open bank accounts, get a driver's license, get a new job, \nprepare for the future with a growing sense of stability, economic \nsecurity, and financial solvency.\n  This program has been a model of success, shaped by the courageous \nindividuals who have decided to come forward, register with the \ngovernment, pass a criminal background check, work hard, and take \nadvantage of the opportunities the deferred action program provides.\n  In my home State of New Jersey alone, more than 25,000 young people \nhave been granted the peace of mind that comes with temporary \nprotection from deportation and the ability to work. We are talking \nabout young people who attend our schools, serve our communities, \npeople who dream just like all children dream of becoming doctors or \nteachers, artists, and entrepreneurs with a full stake in America.\n  We are talking about people like Deyanira Aldana, who graduated from \nEssex County College just this past May. She came to the United States \nwhen she was 4 years old. She now works and lives in New Jersey with \nher mom and dad and older brother and sister who are also DACA \nrecipients. She plans on becoming a substitute teacher and is grateful \nto the doors the deferred action program has opened to her.\n  Deyanira, like other new Americans and future Americans, is part of \nthe rich fabric that forms New Jersey's and America's histories and \ndestiny. Her family represents who we are as a nation. They embody the \nspirit of American life, which has always been shaped by the hopes, \ndreams, and courage of those who have made it to this country and \ncalled it their home.\n  It is appropriate that these deferred action beneficiaries--the \nchildren of immigrants we refer to as DREAMers--have the chance to \nfully contribute their talents and live the American dream because of \nthe deferred action program. In the absence of comprehensive \nimmigration reform, DACA allows them to live with dignity and fulfill \ntheir full potential. Because of the Deferred Action for Childhood \nArrivals Program, hundreds of thousands of DREAMers no longer have the \nfear of deportation and family separation hanging over their heads and \nnow are our newest college students, teachers, and small business \nowners. If we look closely at who those individuals are, we see that \nthis program is about families like Deyanira's. By removing the fear of \ndeportation, of being unnecessarily torn from your loved ones at a \nmoment's notice, more families can now live in peace, with dignity, and \nwith real hopes of building a stronger future together.\n  Three years later, we see how our Nation's dreams and aspirations are \nmore attainable when DREAMers can achieve their full potential. The \nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program is living proof that all \nof America benefits when an undocumented individual steps out of the \nshadows and is able to fully contribute to the economy through their \ningenuity, skills, and hard work.\n  We need to build upon programs like DACA, not turn our backs on \nextending opportunities to those who are willing to work hard for them. \nIt is long past time for us to replace the lingering anxiety and fear \nin immigrant communities with smart policies that make good on \nAmerica's promise to provide opportunity and freedom for all.\n  For many, the dream began with the Deferred Action for Childhood \nArrivals Program. For others, that dream is still delayed. I look \nforward to the day the President's more recent Executive actions \nannouncing the Deferred Action for Parental Accountability Program and \nexpanded DACA are implemented.\n  Despite the obstructionism of some, I am confident justice will \nultimately prevail, and the President's actions will be upheld by our \ncourts. I will continue to fight not just for the DACA recipients but \nfor their parents, other DREAMers, and for every immigrant family. I \nwill continue to fight for comprehensive immigration reform that will \nfix our Nation's broken immigration system once and for all, not just \nbecause it makes good economic sense but because it is the right thing \nto do.\n  I am not alone. Seventy-two percent of Americans believe undocumented \nimmigrants who currently live in the United States should have a path \ntoward permanent residency and ultimately to legal citizenship. \nAmericans continue to overwhelmingly support fixing our broken system, \nand the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program's success should \nfurther encourage Congress to move forward, fortified by the conviction \nthat comprehensive immigration reform is a fight worth fighting for.\n  Let me close by saying, in the meantime, I join my colleagues in \ncommemorating DACA's anniversary as a day that marks 3 years of smart \nand successful policy, as a step in the right direction, and as a \nfoundation upon which we can continue to build. It is an opportunity \nfor the American dream to be realized by some of the youngest and best \nand brightest whom we have in the Nation. Many of these young men and \nwomen--I have met them--are valedictorians, salutatorians, and we need \nto use their intellect, energy, and creative talents to build a better \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Eight hundred years ago on this very day, at the field \nof Runnymede alongside the River Thames in England, King John granted \nthe document that came to be known as the Magna Carta--in our language, \nthe Great Charter. This was the result of negotiations between King \nJohn and rebellious barons who objected to what they saw as violations \nof their customary privileges. By affixing his Great Seal to the \ndocument 800 years ago today, the King accepted limits on his power to \nimpose his will on his subjects.\n  It was a momentous occasion, as evidenced by the fact that four \noriginal copies of the Magna Carta remain carefully preserved, but its \nsignificance has grown over time. It is true that the original Magna \nCarta was only in effect for a couple months before King John then at \nthat time got the Pope to annul it. Subsequent Kings voluntarily \nreissued the charter as a way of gaining the support of the barons, and \nportions still retain legal force in England today.\n  While many of the specific provisions in the Magna Carta dealt with \nvery medieval concerns, such as how heirs and widows of deceased barons \nshould be treated, a couple clauses resonate very strongly to this very \nday.\n\n       No free man shall be seized or imprisoned or stripped of \n     his rights or possessions, or outlawed or exiled, or deprived \n     of his standing in any other way, nor will we proceed with \n     force against him, or send others to do so, except by the \n     lawful judgment of his equals or by the law of the land.\n       To no one will we sell, to no one deny or delay justice or \n     rightful justice.\n\n  In these clauses, you can see the specific right of habeas corpus \nthat was included in the U.S. Constitution as well as a right to speedy \ntrial by jury in the Sixth Amendment. You can also see a reference to \nproperty rights. Moreover, what comes through is the overarching theme \nof the Magna Carta--something very basic to U.S. governance--the rule \nof law or what John Adams called ``a government of laws, and not of \nmen.''\n  In the 17th century, the Magna Carta was increasingly cited to \ncriticize the King's exercise of arbitrary power in the tug-of-war for \nsupremacy between the English Crown and the Parliament. It became a \npotent symbol of an inviolable liberties of Englishmen.\n  For instance, when William Penn was put on trial in England for \npracticing his Quaker faith, he used the Magna Carta in his defense. He \nlater wrote a commentary on the Magna Carta for a work printed in \nPhiladelphia called ``The Excellent Privilege of Liberty and Property \nBeing the Birth-Right of the Free-born Subjects of England,'' which \ncontained the first edition of the Magna Carta printed in the New \nWorld. In this work, William Penn explained the significance of the \nEnglish tradition where the ruler is bound by the law, in contrast to \ncountries such as France, where the King was actually the law.\n  He wrote, again quoting William Penn:\n\n       In England the Law is both the measure and the bound of \n     every Subject's duty and allegiance, each man having a Fixed \n     Fundamental right born with him, as to freedom of his person \n     and property in his estate, which he cannot be deprived of, \n     but either by his consent, or some crime, for which the law \n     has imposed such a penalty for forfeiture.\n\n  It is in this environment that the English philosopher John Locke \ndeveloped his theory of natural rights, which was so influential in the \ndrafting of the Declaration of Independence. The natural rights \nphilosophy went a step further than the ancient rights of Englishmen, \npositing that the rights are God-given and self-evident and that the \nvery purpose of government is to secure those rights.\n  However, you can clearly trace the lineage of the notion of limited \ngovernment and consent of the governed to the Magna Carta. In fact, the \noriginal version of the Magna Carta contained a clause limiting the \nability of the King to levy certain taxes on the barons without first \nconsulting them. I think you can clearly see that this is an early \nversion of what we say: No taxation without representation.\n  While that provision did not last, the custom of needing consent for \ntaxation eventually led to the evolution of the parliamentary system \nand representative government. Still, it is important to note that \nrepresentative government grew out of even more fundamental principles, \nsuch as the rule of law, limited government, and the notion that \ncitizens retain rights that the government may not in any way violate.\n  Our Founding Fathers thought that representative government was the \nbest way to guard against tyranny and preserve the rights of citizens. \nBut that is not sufficient, because without a strong tradition of \nrespect for the rule of law, even duly-elected governments can descend \ninto tyranny. Now, remember the history of Germany pre-World War II. \nHitler came to power as a result of a democratic process and then \nproceeded to act in the very definition of tyranny.\n  In more recent times, Vladimir Putin was elected President of Russia \nand then stifled opposition and consolidated power to himself, \nessentially putting himself above the law. When Sergei Magnitsky stood \nup for the rule of law in Russia and exposed corruption at the highest \nlevels in that country, he was imprisoned in appalling conditions, \nwhere he died a slow, agonizing death.\n  By contrast, the 800-year old Anglo-American tradition of the rule of \nlaw acts as a crucial safeguard to our liberty--not only that, but it \nis also an essential foundation for prosperity. An organization called \nWorld Justice Project has ranked countries based on various factors \nthat indicate how a strong the rule of law is in that particular \ncountry. The countries at the top tend to not only be ones we recognize \nas very free but also tend to be much more prosperous than countries \nranked at the bottom of the rule of law index.\n  Now, maybe to us in America that makes common sense. I think it is \ncommon sense. You are less likely, then, to work hard to generate \nwealth or invest in a business if you cannot be sure that the law will \nprotect what you worked for. Still, we should not take this 800-year-\nold document and tradition for granted. It will continue to preserve \nour liberty and provide for our prosperity only so long as it retains \nthe reverence it has built up over the generations.\n\n[[Page S4131]]\n\n  Human nature being what it is, there is still always a temptation for \nthose in power to think they are above the law. For instance, in the \nfamous Frost interviews after he resigned the Presidency over the \nWatergate scandal, Richard Nixon was asked about the legal limits of \nwhat a President can do. Nixon answered: ``If the President does it, \nthat means it's not illegal.''\n  He could not have been more wrong from the standpoint of the U.S. \nConstitution and the fundamental principles on which it is founded, \ngoing all the way back to the Magna Carta. Still the danger does not \njust come from megalomaniacs and others who seek to use power for their \nown purposes. Those entrusted with power who would act outside the law, \neven when they think it is good for their people as they see it, end up \neroding the bulwark of liberty that is the rule of law. Ever since the \nProgressive Era, there has been a powerful school of thought that our \nsystem of divided and limited government is somehow inefficient, that \nwe should have evolved beyond the need for limits on governmental \npower, and that power concentrated in the right hands can be used to \nhelp people.\n  This is a temptation for every President and one I fear the current \nPresident is particularly susceptible to. In fact, modern Presidents \nhave tools at their disposal that go far beyond anything envisioned by \nthe Framers of the Constitution. The Constitution says that the role of \nthe President is not to write laws, but to ``take care that the laws be \nfaithfully executed.''\n  We now have a massive administrative state made up of departments and \nagencies to which Congress has delegated enormous power and that make \nregulations with the force of law. Moreover, these agencies have the \npower to enforce their own regulations and the primary role in \ninterpreting their regulation in individual cases. Thus, they exercise \nlegislative, executive, and judicial power all in the one.\n  But this concentration of power in executive branch agencies creates \na strong temptation for Presidents to use it to implement their agenda \nirrespective of Congress or the law of the land. I have been very \ncritical of President Obama for a number of actions that I think exceed \nhis legal authority, from using the Clean Water Act to try to regulate \nland use decisions in virtually every county in our country to forcing \nStates to adopt his preferred education policies in order to get \nfunding and waivers to granting a massive amnesty from our immigration \nlaws, which even he previously admitted he did not have the legal \nauthority to do.\n  I think these are bad policies. But even those who see these as \nshort-term policy victories should be very wary of the long-term \nconsequences of anything that erodes our tradition of respect for the \nrule of law.\n  Now, as I finish, it took 800 years to build up, and once it is \neroded it will not be easy to restore. It is vital that Presidents \nexercise restraint out of respect for the rule of law.\n  Congress should also work to reclaim much of the power it has \ndelegated to the executive branch in order to reduce the temptation and \nthe opportunity for abuse of executive power. It is not just up to \nelected officials. Our ancient tradition of the rule of law draws its \nauthority from the fact that generations have demanded that their \nleaders adhere to the rule of law. As such, this 800th anniversary of \nthe Magna Carta is an occasion for Americans to remember our heritage \nand to rededicate ourselves to this bedrock of liberty, the rule of \nlaw.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/15/senate-section/article/S4131-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SUMMER FOOD SERVICE PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, for most children around the country the \nschool year has ended and the summer has begun. Some 700,000 children \nin Ohio, my home State, during the school year receive free or reduced-\nprice school lunches on an average day--some 700,000 children. Those \nchildren might not have access to a nutritious meal when school \ncafeterias close for the summer.\n  Summer break should not mean a break from good nutrition. That is \nwhere the Summer Food Service Program steps in. The U.S. Department of \nAgriculture works with State departments of education to ensure that \nevery child has sufficient, adequate, nutritious food to keep growing \nand learning after the final school bell rings. This year in Ohio there \nwill be 1,500 Summer Food Service Program sites across the State.\n  Last year these sites served almost 4 million meals. Last week, I \nspoke with Winnie Brewer, who runs these sites in Marion County, OH, in \na city about the size of Mansfield, near where I grew up.\n  According to Winnie, more than one in four kids in her county is food \ninsecure. She talked about one of their newest volunteers, who came to \nher in tears after watching a 6-year-old boy clean the shelves in an \nSFSP site--a feeding site--and then start digging through the trash. He \nwas just that hungry. That is why the work Winnie does and her \nvolunteers do is so important.\n  Right now, too many families don't know about this critical program. \nToo many families miss out on receiving its assistance once school lets \nout. Winnie reports that just 1 in 10 children who receive breakfast or \nlunch during the school year comes to summer feeding sites. That means \nthat in my State almost 700,000 children on any given school day will \nbe getting a free or reduced-price breakfast or lunch--700,000. But \nduring the summer months, only about 70,000 of those children get these \nmeals or snacks. We need to do all we can to raise public awareness of \nthese programs so that families know that the end of the school year \ndoes not mean an end to food services for their children.\n  In Marion, the city I mentioned where Winnie runs her program, she \nanticipates she will triple the number of meals she serves this year \ncompared to 5 years ago. That is because she and other community \npartners have committed to making this program a success. At approved \nschools, in churches, in summer camps, in synagogues, and in community \ncenters, pools, and recreation centers, volunteers and organizers are \nensuring that children have the healthy food they need to succeed.\n  Those sites often offer more than just healthy meals. They provide \nsummer enrichment activities for kids. We know that low-income children \nwhose parents typically have less education, in the months from school \nclosing in late May or early June until school returns in late August \nor early September, tend to fall back on their education. In districts \nsuch as that where the parents have less education, less ability or \nknow-how to read to the children, to take them on field trips that \nmight make their minds more active, we know those children start every \nfall having to catch up just to get back to where they were in the \nspring.\n  That is one of the beauties of the summer feeding program. So you are \nnot just giving these children nutritious meals, but you are also \ngiving these children library activities and sports activities and \nother kinds of organized activities at churches, at community centers, \nat schools, and at libraries that can matter. The sites in Marion \nCounty partner with the YMCA to offer exercise. They run a literacy \nprogram that provides free books to kids at feeding sites. Getting a \nnew book can turn a child on and get that child more excited about \nreading.\n  Earlier this month, I was in Youngstown--a city in northeast Ohio--to \nget the word out about the summer food and feeding program. I met with \nMark Samuel, who operates a site at the West Side Community Center and \na couple dozen other sites in Mahoning Valley. I also met with Retha \nAustin, who has children and grandchildren in the program, and now she \nis working a few hours a week as a paid worker to help get this program \nup and running.\n  Families need to know about these sites and the dedicated folks like \nMark, Winnie, and Retha who run them. Summer break shouldn't mean a \nbreak from good nutrition.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, tomorrow we will vote on a very \nimportant amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, the \nMilitary\n\n[[Page S4132]]\n\nJustice Improvement Act, introduced by my colleague and friend, the \njunior Senator from the State of New York. I have worked with her and \nhave been privileged to help craft this very important legislative \nmeasure, not because sexual assault is a uniquely military problem--in \nfact, just the contrary. Sexual assault afflicts our campuses and our \nworkplaces. The battle against sexual assault is hardly limited to the \nmilitary. But we have the opportunity to take a step that will set a \nmodel and send a message to other places where sexual assault is a \nproblem and where underreporting, because of lack of trust and \nconfidence in the prosecutorial system or the administrative apparatus, \nis a major reason that sexual assault continues. Without confidence, \ntrust, effective results, and protection of privacy and physical \nsafety, survivors will simply not come forward. If they do not come \nforward, there will be no discipline or prosecution. That is the \nfundamental reason why I believe the amendment we will address tomorrow \nis so important.\n  I have held roundtables on campus sexual assault all around the State \nof Connecticut--more than 12 or 13 of them--and have worked with a \nbipartisan group of Senators, including not only Senator Gillibrand, \nwho is the major sponsor of this amendment, but also Senator McCaskill, \nwho has been an extraordinary leader in this area having been a \nprosecutor herself, and Senator Heller as well as others on both sides \nof the aisle, to devise a solution to campus sexual assault--not just a \nsingle panacea but a set of measures that addresses one of the major \nobstacles to effective action against campus sexual assault, which is \nthe underreporting of this heinous, horrific crime. It is a crime \nwherever it occurs, whether in the military or on campus. That is why \nwe have to combat and conquer it, just as we do an enemy who preys on \nour men or women in uniform or on campuses or elsewhere.\n  We went through this debate last year. We reached a solution last \nyear, which we hoped would, in fact, be a solution. But the simple, \nplain fact is that this insidious, pernicious epidemic of sexual \nassault in the military continues unabated or at least unreduced by the \namount that we should regard as minimum for judging this supposed \nsolution a success.\n  The fact is that the Department of Defense's own research shows that \n52 unwanted sexual contacts occur every day on average across the \nmilitary. That is the same rate it was 5 years ago in 2010. The fact is \nthat in fiscal year 2014, the Department of Defense estimates 62 \npercent of servicewomen experienced retaliation for coming forward, the \nsame percentage as 2012. Servicemembers who report assault are 12 times \nmore likely to experience retaliation for reporting their cases than \nseeing the assailant convicted of a crime. Retaliation is more likely \nthan effective discipline or punishment against the perpetrator.\n  The amendment we have offered, the Military Justice Improvement Act, \nseeks to address this issue through explicit codification of punishment \nfor any person--any person--deciding to retaliate against anyone who \nreports this crime of sexual assault. Explicit punishment for \nretaliation will not only send a message, but it will deter what is in \ncivilian terms one of the most severe crimes, known as obstruction of \njustice.\n  The reason why retaliation or obstruction of justice is so insidious \nis it prevents the justice system from reaching a just result. It not \nonly deters victims and survivors from coming forward regardless of the \ncrime, it also permits perpetrators and criminals to go free and feel \nthey can again commit the crime of sexual assault or other crimes. But \nin the case of sexual assault, it is particularly pernicious because we \nknow also from statistics that this crime is recommitted. There is \nrecidivism at a higher rate than many others. A large proportion of \nsexual assaults is committed by a very tiny fraction of members of the \nmilitary.\n  What happens, in effect, on campuses or in the military is there are \nserial rapists, serial perpetrators of sexual assault. If they feel \nthey can do it without consequences, they will continue to commit this \ncrime.\n  We have learned from many survivors that the anxiety to come forward \nstems not only from the fear of retaliation but from the bias and \ninherent conflict of interest entrenched in the chain of command. The \nfact is that the Department of Defense estimates that 60 percent of \ncases involve a supervisor or a unit leader. Think of that number--60 \npercent of cases involving alleged sexual assault are committed by the \nsupervisor or the unit leader in the U.S. military.\n  The MJIA--the Military Justice Improvement Act--the amendment we will \noffer tomorrow and will vote on, will address this obstacle by amending \nthe Uniform Code of Military Justice to assign the decisionmaking power \nregarding sexual assault to an independent, trained prosecutor or, \nactually, a team of professional military prosecutors, while leaving \ndecisions to the chain of command regarding purely military crime.\n  I recognize there is an argument that good order and discipline \nrequire the chain of command to work as a source of discipline and \npunishment and justice. But where retaliation, bias, and conflicts of \ninterest are so prevalent and so inherent in the process, where the \nchain of command is making decisions about the perpetrator, who so \ncommonly is in that chain of command, these decisions should be made by \nindependent, trained, military prosecutors.\n  The type of crime involved here, sexual assault, is one that is very \ndifficult, excruciatingly daunting to prosecute simply because of the \nnature of this crime, the nature of the evidence, and the nature of the \ntestimony. So trained, professional military lawyers are in a better \nposition to make these decisions about whether to go forward--not just \ndecisions about what evidence to introduce but whether the evidence \njustifies the prosecution, whether proof can be presented that will do \njustice, not just reach a conviction.\n  Our amendment will entrust military lawyers with specialized training \nin prosecuting complex cases to make those prosecutorial decisions.\n  Removing the commanders from the prosecutorial process will also \nprotect the privacy of victims when reporting these crimes. Typically, \nthey involve some of the most intimate of details.\n  A trained, independent, military prosecutor and removing the \ncommander from those decisions will protect privacy and encourage \nreporting. I believe this step is a critical next step in this effort \nto improve the military justice system.\n  I have immense respect for colleagues who disagree with me. Some of \nthem are seasoned prosecutors, extraordinarily talented and dedicated \nlawyers, and we may differ on these issues.\n  Many of our allies, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Israel, \nGermany, Norway, and Australia, have already taken steps to remove \nsexual assault reporting and prosecution from the regular chain of \ncommand. Military leaders there report no particular change in their \nability to maintain good order or discipline. The facts are there to \njustify removing these decisions from the chain of command.\n  But I hope colleagues who disagree with me will continue this \neffort--I know they will--to improve our military justice system. We \ncan agree to disagree on this step. We should agree to move forward on \nother steps where we can reach consensus because we have in common much \nmore than we have in conflict--that the greatest, strongest military in \nthe history of the world should be rid of this heinous crime. That is \nour military. We owe it to the men and women who serve in uniform to \nhave a system of justice that matches their courage, strength, and \nskill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/15/senate-section/article/S4132-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4132-S4133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                BURUNDI\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to speak about the political crisis \nin Burundi, and to urge continued action by the administration and the \ninternational community to prevent violence and mass atrocities.\n\n[[Page S4133]]\n\nAs my colleagues may be aware, the country has a troubled history of \nviolence and instability. A 12-year civil war resulted in 300,000 \ndeaths. Though the past 10 years have been relatively stable, there \nhave been troubling reports of murders, harassment, and intimidation in \nrural areas carried out by the Imbonerakure, an armed youth group \nbelieved to be associated with the ruling party. According to the \nUnited Nations, U.N., over 90,000 refugees have fled Burundi since \nApril, concerned about potential violence in the runup to the July 15 \nPresidential election. Some of the refugees claim they fear being \ntargeted by government-allied militia. More than 27,000 refugees have \nfled to Rwanda, a country with its own troubled history of ethnic \nconflict.\n  President Pierre Nkurunziza's announcement on April 25 that he was \nrunning for a third term--a move which appears to violate the Burundian \nconstitution--has caused over 1 month of protests in the Burundian \ncapital, Bujumbura. The Burundian Red Cross has stated that at least 21 \npeople have died during the protests, most reportedly killed by police \nwho have fired live ammunition at protesters. Others have been killed \nby a series of grenade attacks by unknown parties and more than 500 \nhave been injured. On May 23, opposition leader Zedi Feruzi was killed \nby unidentified gunmen, and private radio and television stations have \nbeen raided, burned, and shut down. Social media websites used to \norganize protests have been blocked and prominent journalists and \nactivists have been arrested. While some of these individuals have \nsince been released, the crackdown on dissenting voices is disturbing. \nThere are also reports of smaller protests outside of the capital, \nwhich signals the potential for the violence to spread, should the \npolice respond in a similarly heavyhanded way. The situation is \nvolatile and analysts are increasingly concerned that the situation \ncould suddenly erupt into wide-scale killings resulting in hundreds of \ndeaths.\n  The Obama administration has been actively engaged in an effort to \navert mass atrocities in Burundi for more than a year. Various senior-\nlevel administration officials--including former U.S. Special Envoy for \nthe African Great Lakes Russ Feingold, Ambassador Samantha Power, \nAssistant Secretary Linda Thomas-Greenfield, Under Secretary Wendy \nSherman, Under Secretary Sarah Sewall, and even Secretary of State John \nKerry--have spoken with Burundian officials, regional leaders, and \nother international donors in an effort to dissuade President \nNkurunziza from running for office again.\n  In the wake of the protests, regional leaders are playing an active \nrole in trying to calm the situation. The countries of the East African \nCommunity, EAC, have sent Foreign Ministers to Bujumbura to discuss the \ncrisis with a range of stakeholders. The organization held two \nemergency meetings in May, one of which Assistant Secretary of State \nThomas-Greenfield attended. The African Union and the International \nConference of the Great Lakes have also convened to discuss the crisis.\n  I applaud ongoing administration and regional efforts. I am \nconcerned, however, that they may not be sufficient. The U.N. Special \nEnvoy for the Great Lakes, Said Djinnit, was dispatched to bring the \nparties together to find a negotiated solution, but he has stepped down \nafter being accused by opposition groups of being biased toward the \ngovernment's position. Despite the delay in the polls from June to \nJuly, conditions for a democratic contest do not exist. There is no \nspace for the opposition to campaign and the media cannot operate \nfreely. And even in the face of the international community's repeated \nvisits, calls, and messaging on the importance of putting the good of \nthe country before personal political ambitions, President Nkurunziza \nstill has refused to do the right thing and step aside as his party's \ncandidate.\n  I recommend that we take three additional steps. No. 1, urge U.N. \nSecretary General Ban Ki-moon and African Union, AU, Chairperson \nNkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to work with regional leaders to achieve a \ncommon approach to a political settlement for Burundi that includes \nPierre Nkurunziza stepping aside as his party's candidate. It should \nalso include a postponement of elections until a way forward is agreed \nto by the ruling party and the opposition that lays the groundwork for \na legitimate contest. The current delay in the polling date gets us \nnowhere if conditions for credible elections still are not in place. A \nshow of solidarity on these issues will powerfully signal the \ninternational community's commitment to a transparent, fair democratic \nprocess, and could serve to alleviate tension on the ground. President \nNkurunziza should be urged to hold police responsible for killing \nprotesters, ensure that media can operate freely, and allow for some \nmeans of verification that he is disarming the Imbonerakure and other \narmed militia as called for by the EAC and referenced by the African \nUnion.\n  No. 2, I urge President Obama to appoint a Great Lakes Special Envoy \nto replace Russ Feingold as soon as possible. Having a senior-level \nState Department official working fulltime toward a negotiated \nsettlement at this volatile time will greatly enhance the efforts that \nadministration officials are making to ensure peace.\n  Finally, I call upon the administration to refrain from beginning new \ntraining of, or making additional plans to provide military equipment \nto, the Burundian military at this juncture. While the military has not \nbeen accused of violence against civilians or abuses related to the \nprotests, I see no advantage in moving forward with additional programs \ngiven the volatile situation on the ground. We can resume assistance \nonce we are confident that the security situation is stable.\n  The situation in Burundi is troubling, but I do not believe it is \nhopeless. I stand ready to support the administration's efforts to \nprevent another tragedy from unfolding in the Great Lakes region of \nAfrica.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/15/senate-section/article/S4133-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  Under the order of the Senate of January 6, 2015, the Secretary of \nthe Senate, on June 12, 2015, during the adjournment of the Senate, \nreceived a message from the House of Representatives announcing that \nthe Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Thornberry) has signed the following \nenrolled bill:\n\n       S. 1568.

Mr. TESTER (for himself and Mr. Daines):\n  S. 1577. A bill to amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate \ncertain segments of East Rosebud Creek in Carbon County, Montana, as \ncomponents of the Wild and Scenic Rivers System; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today, along with Senator Daines, I \nintroduced the East Rosebud Creek Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. This \nlegislation will help ensure that one of my state's most striking \nwaterways is preserved for the use and enjoyment of future generations.\n  In south central Montana, East Rosebud Creek meanders through the \nAbsoraka-Beartooth Wilderness before pooling briefly at East Rosebud \nLake. From there, the creek continues to flow down through the Custer \nNational Forest and on, eventually, to the Yellowstone River.\n  My legislation would protect 20 of the most scenic miles of East \nRosebud Creek: those 13 miles above East Rosebud Lake and seven more on \nthe downstream side. Designating these sections of river will protect \nits water quality and the free-flowing nature of the river, and will \nhave no impact on private property.\n  Local ranchers, businesses, homeowners associations, conservation \ngroups, and everyday Montanans have recognized the need for a Wild and \nScenic Rivers designation and have voiced their support. In its current \nmanagement plan for Custer National Forest, the Forest Service also \nrecognizes the incredible scenic and recreational values of East \nRosebud Creek, and the river's potential for designation.\n  In short, this bipartisan legislation is a proposal that comes \ntailor-made from folks on the ground and will preserve a portion of \nMontana's outdoor heritage for our kids and grandkids.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/15/senate-section/article/S4140-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 201--DESIGNATING JUNE 19, 2015, AS ``JUNETEENTH \n INDEPENDENCE DAY'' IN RECOGNITION OF JUNE 19, 1865, THE DATE ON WHICH \n          SLAVERY LEGALLY CAME TO AN END IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Bennet, Mr. Booker, Mrs. \nBoxer, Mr. Brown, Mr. Burr, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Casey, Mr. Cochran, Mr. \nCruz, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Franken, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Heinrich, Ms. \nHirono, Mr. Kaine, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Lankford, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Lee, Mr. \nMarkey, Mr. Merkley, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Murphy, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \nNelson, Mr. Paul, Mr. Peters, Mr. Portman, Mr. Reid, Mr. Rubio, Mr. \nSchumer, Mr. Scott, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Toomey, Mr. Warner, Ms. Warren, \nMr. Whitehouse, and Mr. Wicker) submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 201\n\n       Whereas news of the end of slavery did not reach the \n     frontier areas of the United States, in particular the State \n     of Texas and the other Southwestern States, until months \n     after the conclusion of the Civil War, more than 2 \\1/2\\ \n     years after President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation \n     Proclamation on January 1, 1863;\n       Whereas, on June 19, 1865, Union soldiers, led by Major \n     General Gordon Granger, arrived in Galveston, Texas, with \n     news that the Civil War had ended and that the enslaved were \n     free;\n       Whereas African-Americans who had been slaves in the \n     Southwest celebrated June 19, commonly known as ``Juneteenth \n     Independence Day'', as inspiration and encouragement for \n     future generations;\n       Whereas African-Americans from the Southwest have continued \n     the tradition of observing ``Juneteenth Independence Day'' \n     for 150 years;\n       Whereas 43 States, the District of Columbia, and other \n     countries have designated ``Juneteenth Independence Day'' as \n     a special day of observance in recognition of the \n     emancipation of all slaves in the United States;\n       Whereas ``Juneteenth Independence Day'' celebrations have \n     been held to honor African-American freedom while encouraging \n     self-development and respect for all cultures;\n       Whereas the faith and strength of character demonstrated by \n     former slaves and the descendants of former slaves remain an \n     example for all people of the United States, regardless of \n     background, religion, or race;\n       Whereas slavery was not officially abolished until the \n     ratification of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States in December 1865;\n       Whereas Frederick Douglass, born in the State of Maryland \n     in 1818, escaped from slavery and became a leading writer, \n     orator, publisher, and one of the most influential advocates \n     in the United States for abolitionism and the equality of all \n     people;\n       Whereas Frederick Douglass was recognized for his \n     accomplishments with a statue that was unveiled during a \n     ceremony on June 19, 2013, in Emancipation Hall in the United \n     States Capitol;\n       Whereas 2015 marks the 50th anniversary of the passage of \n     the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10101 et seq.), \n     signed into law on August 6, 1965, a milestone in providing \n     equal protections for African-Americans, including former \n     slaves and the descendants of former slaves; and\n       Whereas, over the course of its history, the United States \n     has grown into a symbol of democracy and freedom around the \n     world: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates June 19, 2015, as ``Juneteenth Independence \n     Day'';\n       (2) recognizes the historical significance of ``Juneteenth \n     Independence Day'' to the United States;\n       (3) supports the continued nationwide celebration of \n     ``Juneteenth Independence Day'' to provide an opportunity for \n     the people of the United States to learn more about the past \n     and to better understand the experiences that have shaped the \n     United States; and\n       (4) recognizes that the observance of the end of slavery is \n     part of the history and heritage of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/15/senate-section/article/S4140-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4140-S4141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 202--DESIGNATING JUNE 15, 2015, AS ``WORLD ELDER \n                         ABUSE AWARENESS DAY''\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL (for himself, Ms. Collins, Ms. Ayotte, and Mr. Murphy) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

However, the United States has not \n     yet approved this agreement or provided the assistance called \n     for in the agreement.\n       (8) On July 1, 2013 the Secretary of the Interior, the \n     Secretary of State, and the Secretary Defense submitted to \n     the Senate proposed legislation to approve the agreement \n     described in paragraph (7) and included an analysis of the \n     budgetary impact of the proposed legislation.

Khan.\n       (4) According to the 2014 DoD report, ``North Korea also \n     provided Syria with nuclear reactor technology until 2007.''.\n       (5) On September 6, 2007, as part of ``Operation Orchard'', \n     the Israeli Air Force destroyed the suspected nuclear \n     facility in Syria.\n       (6) According to the 2014 DoD report, ``North Korea has \n     exported conventional and ballistic missile-related \n     equipment, components, materials, and technical assistance to \n     countries in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.''.\n       (7) On November 29, 1987, DPRK agents planted explosive \n     devices onboard Korean Air flight 858, which killed all 115 \n     passengers and crew on board.\n       (8) On March 26, 2010, the DPRK fired upon and sank the \n     South Korean warship Cheonan, killing 46 of her crew.\n       (9) On November 23, 2010, the DPRK shelled South Korea's \n     Yeonpyeong Island, killing 4 South Korean citizens.\n       (10) On February 7, 2014, the United Nations Commission of \n     Inquiry on human rights in DPRK (in this subsection referred \n     to as the ``Commission of Inquiry'') released a report \n     detailing the atrocious human rights record of the DPRK.\n       (11) Dr. Michael Kirby, Chair of the Commission of Inquiry, \n     stated on March 17, 2014, ``The Commission of Inquiry has \n     found systematic, widespread, and grave human rights \n     violations occurring in the Democratic People's Republic of \n     Korea. It has also found a disturbing array of crimes against \n     humanity. These crimes are committed against inmates of \n     political and other prison camps; against starving \n     populations; against religious believers; against persons who \n     try to flee the country--including those forcibly repatriated \n     by China.''.\n       (12) Dr. Michael Kirby also stated, ``These crimes arise \n     from policies established at the highest level of the State. \n     They have been committed, and continue to take place in the \n     Democratic People's Republic of Korea, because the policies, \n     institutions, and patterns of impunity that lie at their \n     heart remain in place. The gravity, scale, duration, and \n     nature of the unspeakable atrocities committed in the country \n     reveal a totalitarian State that does not have any parallel \n     in the contemporary world.''.\n       (13) The Commission of Inquiry also notes, ``Since 1950, \n     the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has engaged in the \n     systematic abduction, denial of repatriation, and subsequent \n     enforced disappearance of persons from other countries on a \n     large scale and as a matter of State policy. Well over \n     200,000 persons, including children, who were brought from \n     other countries to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea \n     may have become victims of enforced disappearance,'' and \n     states that the DPRK has failed to account or address this \n     injustice in any way.\n       (14) According to reports and analysis from organizations \n     such as the International Network for the Human Rights of \n     North Korean Overseas Labor, the Korea Policy Research \n     Center, NK Watch, the Asian Institute for Policy Studies, the \n     Center for International and Strategic Studies, and the \n     George W. Bush Institute, there may currently be as many as \n     100,000 North Korean overseas laborers in various nations \n     around the world.\n       (15) Such forced North Korean laborers are often subjected \n     to harsh working conditions under the direct supervision of \n     DPRK officials, and their salaries contribute to anywhere \n     from $150,000,000 to $230,000,000 a year to the DPRK state \n     coffers.\n       (16) According to the Director of National Intelligence's \n     2015 Worldwide Threat Assessment, ``North Korea's nuclear \n     weapons and missile programs pose a serious threat to the \n     United States and to the security environment in East \n     Asia.''.\n       (17) The Worldwide Threat Assessment states, ``North Korea \n     has also expanded the size and sophistication of its \n     ballistic missile forces, ranging from close-range ballistic \n     missiles to ICBMs, while continuing to conduct test launches. \n     In 2014, North Korea launched an unprecedented number of \n     ballistic missiles.''.\n       (18) On December 19, 2015, the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation declared that the DPRK was responsible for a \n     cyberattack on Sony Pictures conducted on November 24, 2014.\n       (19) From 1988 to 2008, the DPRK was designated by the \n     United States Government as a state sponsor of terrorism.\n       (20) The DPRK is currently in violation of United Nations \n     Security Council Resolutions 1695 (2006), 1718 (2006), 1874 \n     (2009), 2087 (2013), and 2094 (2013).\n       (21) The DPRK repeatedly violated agreements with the \n     United States and the other so-called Six-Party Talks \n     partners (the Republic of Korea, Japan, the Russian \n     Federation, and the People's Republic of China) designed to \n     halt its nuclear weapons program, while receiving significant \n     concessions, including fuel, oil, and food aid.\n\n[[Page S4154]]\n\n       (22) The Six-Party Talks have not been held since December \n     2008.\n       (23) On May 9, 2015, the DPRK claimed that it has test-\n     fired a ballistic missile from a submarine.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the DPRK represents a serious threat to the national \n     security of the United States and United States allies in \n     East Asia and to international peace and stability, and \n     grossly violates the human rights of its own people;\n       (2) the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the \n     Treasury should impose additional sanctions against the DPRK, \n     including targeting its financial assets around the world, \n     specific designations relating to human rights abuses, and a \n     redesignation of the DPRK as a state sponsor of terror; and\n       (3) the President should not resume the negotiations with \n     the DPRK, either bilaterally or as part of the Six-Party \n     Talks, without strict preconditions, including that the \n     DPRK--\n       (A) adhere to its denuclearization commitments outlined in \n     the 2005 Joint Statement of the Six-Party Talks;\n       (B) commit to halting its ballistic missile programs and \n     its proliferation activities;\n       (C) cease military provocations; and\n       (D) measurably and significantly improve its human rights \n     record.\n\n    TITLE II--ORGANIZATION AND PERSONNEL OF THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE\n\n                   Subtitle A--Organizational Matters\n\n     SEC. 5201.
