Mr. President, today we will continue our work on the \ntrade legislation, which is before us. I know Senators on both sides \nare eager to offer amendments. Yesterday was a good start. We voted on \na few amendments. We have a half dozen more pending, but we need to \nkeep the ball moving. So let me again encourage Members of both parties \nto offer those amendments that they may have. Let me again encourage \nMembers to work with the bill managers to get the amendments moving.\n  We want to process as many amendments as we can. We know we already \nlost a week to needless filibustering and delaying of this bill, which \nmeans one less week to have amendments considered. So we need \ncooperation from the leadership across the aisle to ensure we do not \nlose any more time.\n  Our friends on the other side seem quite eager to let everyone know \nhow uninterested they are in obstruction these days. You will not find \na happier guy than me if that turns out to be true. So we will see if \nthey demonstrate the spirit of cooperation they keep telling us about \nas we continue to debate trade.\n  Either way, Members on both sides who recognize the benefits of trade \nto their constituents are determined to pass important export and jobs \nlegislation this week. I hope to see it pass by the same kind of \noverwhelming, bipartisan margin we saw in the Finance Committee a few \nweeks ago, because voting to improve this bill is one way to prove you \ncare about the middle class. It is one way to prove you care about \nAmerican jobs and American workers.\n  One study tells us that knocking down unfair trade barriers in places \nsuch as Europe and the Pacific could boost our economy by as much as \n$173 billion and that it could support as many as 1.4 million \nadditional American jobs.\n  In Kentucky, the study says it could bring almost $3 billion in new \ninvestment and support more than 18,000 additional jobs. That is in my \nState alone. We know a lot in the Commonwealth about the benefits of \ntrade. More than half a million Kentucky jobs are already related to \ninternational trade. We know that those kinds of jobs typically pay \nmore than other jobs.\n  Kentuckians also know that a lot of rhetoric on the other side of \nthis issue does not always ``stand the test of fact and scrutiny,'' as \nPresident Obama put it.\n  The 7,000 workers at the Toyota plant in Georgetown, KY, might agree. \nFollowing a trade agreement we recently enacted with South Korea, they \nare now working hard to export Camrys--Camrys--made in Kentucky to \nKorean consumers. Given some of the overheated language surrounding \nthat U.S.-Korea trade agreement, you may be surprised to hear about \nthese automotive workers in my State who are building Camrys in \nKentucky and sending them to Korea. But the truth is that just about \nevery serious public official knows that eliminating the restrictions \nthat hurt American workers and American goods is good for our country.\n  It is something Republicans have long believed. It is an area where \nPresident Obama now agrees, as well. It is an area where many serious \nDemocrats also agree. So I hope we can join together to score a victory \nfor American workers. To get there, let's work now to offer amendments, \nto get them pending, and to engage in substantive debate rather than \nmore pointless delay for its own sake.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/19/senate-section/article/S3009-6", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 2 years ago the American people first became \naware that the National Security Agency was collecting private \ninformation about their phone calls. This is called the Snowden \nrevelation.\n\n[[Page S3010]]\n\n  Under the banner of national security, the National Security Agency \nwas mining information about home phone calls and how long they lasted. \nThey found out whom they were calling--and not only that. They found \nout whom the call was between. They also determined how long that call \nlasted.\n  NSA essentially was conducting a dragnet, without first attempting to \ndetermine whether that information was relevant to a national security \nproblem. NSA ran this program under the authorities granted to them by \nsection 215 of the PATRIOT Act, which expires on June 1 of this year. \nThe American people were outraged by these revelations and Congress \nrightly acted.\n  Last year, the House passed a bill by a vote of 303 to 121 to end the \nNSA's so-called bulk metadata collection program and reform and extend \nthe authority for this program.\n  I brought a similar bill to the floor authored by Senators Leahy and \nLee. There was a bipartisan group of Senators who joined them to call \nfor its passage. But sadly, the majority leader--at that time the \nminority leader--stood in the way of bipartisan reform. Instead of \npassing meaningful reform, he led a Republican filibuster of this bill. \nThat was one of a couple hundred that was led by my friend.\n  This year, Senators Leahy and Lee worked again with the Chairman and \nranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee on the USA FREEDOM Act, \nwhich ends the National Security Agency's bulk collection program and \nextends and reforms the authorities under section 215 of the PATRIOT \nAct.\n  There have been bipartisan and bicameral calls for the Senate to take \nup that legislation. Yet again, instead of committing to bringing up \nthis bipartisan bill, last month the senior Senator from Kentucky \nintroduced a bill that would extend the authorities for the National \nSecurity Agency's bulk collection program for 5\\1/2\\ years. Then the \nSecond Circuit, almost simultaneously--within 24 hours of that decision \nby the majority leader--found the bulk collection illegal.\n  In reaction to the court's decision, the House last week passed the \nUSA FREEDOM Act by a vote of 338 to 88. By a four-to-one margin, the \nHouse voted to end the National Security Agency's illegal bulk data \ncollection program and reform its practices.\n  But even in the face of that court's decision, the majority leader \nstood once again against bipartisan reform. Instead of heeding the \nRepublican-controlled House's calls for reform, the majority leader \nintroduced a bill that would extend the authorities for the National \nSecurity Agency's illegal program for 2 more months.\n  Congressman Goodlatte, the chair of the Judiciary Committee in the \nHouse, said they will not accept a short-term extension of the bill. \nThis morning, Leader McCarthy, the second ranking Republican in the \nHouse, said they will not accept any extension. That is exactly what \nthe Speaker, Congressman Boehner, said.\n  If we squander this opportunity to deliver sound reforms to this \nillegal program, we are handling our duties irresponsibly here in the \nSenate.\n  To stand in the way of reforming these practices is to ignore the \nvoice of the American people. Just yesterday, a new poll commissioned \nby the American Civil Liberties Union showed that 82 percent of \nAmericans are concerned that the Federal Government is collecting and \nstoring the personal information of Americans, and they do not like it.\n  If we are unable to reform these practices, we are ignoring the \nruling of the Second Circuit, which rejected the National Security \nAgency's bulk collection program, and we are not allowing the American \npeople's voice to be heard.\n  I think, most importantly, if the senior Senator from Kentucky does \nnot allow this commonsense reform simply with a vote on the Senate \nfloor about what happened in the House, they are ignoring the rare \nbipartisan support that we have.\n  Just last week, 190 House Republicans voted to end the National \nSecurity Agency's illegal program. There is bipartisan consensus in \nfavor of ending this program. Many of the Republican leader's own \ncolleagues have called for it as well.\n  Last week, Attorney General Loretta Lynch and James Clapper, Director \nof National Intelligence, wrote a letter to Senator Leahy, the ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee. Both the Attorney General and the \nDirector of National Intelligence voiced their support for the USA \nFREEDOM Act, saying:\n\n       Overall, the significant reforms contained in this \n     legislation will provide the public greater confidence in how \n     our intelligence activities are carried out and in the \n     oversight of those activities, while ensuring vital national \n     security authorities remain in place.\n\n  I agree with that statement. But sadly, the majority leader continues \nto stand in the way of bipartisan reform to end these illegal \npractices. As we face the June 1 expiration of these authorities, the \nmajority leader still offers no viable alternative.\n  We cannot allow this program to be extended. The majority leader \nshould listen to the American people because we cannot extend an \nillegal act. That is what the majority leader is asking us to do.\n  The majority leader should listen to the American people, consider \nthe action of his Republican colleagues, and respect the expertise of \nthe intelligence community.\n  The Senate should act now on the USA FREEDOM Act before it leaves for \nthe Memorial Day recess and restore the confidence of the American \npeople.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/19/senate-section/article/S3010-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOMINATIONS AND HIGHWAY BILL\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have heard so much about how great the \nRepublicans are doing here, about how well things are working now. We \nare doing no nominations--none. We are 5 months into this Congress, and \nwe basically approved virtually no one. It is interesting to say there \nare not many names on the calendar to bring up. Why? Because they are \nnot even holding hearings on all the nominations. We always hear about \nthe need for jobs--but not from my Republican colleagues. We hear from \nus. One of the prime examples of that is the highway bill. It is about \nto expire. What are we going to do? Nothing. There is no program to \nextend this bill. It has already been extended short term 33 times. \nThink about that. We used to do bills here for 5 years, 6 years so that \nthe directors of transportation and all of these States around the \ncountry could plan ahead.\n  We are being penny-wise and pound-foolish. We are having these short-\nterm extensions, which are very expensive, creating no jobs. For every \n$1 billion we spend on these highway programs, we create 47,500 jobs. \nMy Republican colleagues are ignoring this.\n  What is the business of the day, Mr. President?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/19/senate-section/article/S3010-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 14 years ago, I introduced a bill known as \nthe DREAM Act. My friend and colleague Senator Leahy was the chairman \nof the Senate Judiciary Committee, and for the last 14 years we have \ntried to pass this basic law, and here is what it says: If you were \nbrought to the United States as a child, and you were undocumented in \nAmerica, but you have lived here without committing any serious crime \nand finished high school, we will give you a chance. If you will agree \nto at least complete 2 years of college or enlist in America's \nmilitary, we will give you a path to citizenship.\n  I offered this legislation because so many young people--about 2\\1/2\\ \nmillion--living in this country were brought here when they were \ninfants, small children. They didn't have any voice in the matter, \ntheir parents decided. They came to the United States. They have lived \nhere as Americans.\n\n[[Page S3011]]\n\nThey stood in their classroom every single day and put their hand on \ntheir heart and pledged allegiance to that flag. That was their flag. \nWhat they didn't know or didn't understand was that they were \nundocumented. They don't have a country. The laws of the United States \nare very clear. If you are one of those people, you have to leave. You \nhave to leave for at least 10 years and then apply to come back in. I \ndidn't think that was fair.\n  I introduced the DREAM Act. In fact, I had the support of the senior \nSenator from Utah as my cosponsor when I first introduced it. We could \nnot pass it and make it the law of the land. So the day came when I \nappealed to the President of the United States, my former colleague \nfrom the Senate and the State of Illinois. He was a sponsor of the \nDREAM Act. I appealed to the President to give these young people a \nchance. He took his power as President and issued an Executive order, \nand that Executive order said that if these young people would come \nforward, pay a substantial fee for processing, show that they have no \nserious criminal record and can show they had come to the United States \nyears before, they would be given a chance to stay without fear of \ndeportation. It is called DACA.\n  Well, the President waited and challenged Congress to do something \nabout it--pass the DREAM Act, pass comprehensive immigration reform. \nEven though it passed in the Senate, with 68 votes on a bipartisan \nrollcall vote, the Republican House of Representatives refused to even \ncall the measure for a vote.\n  One year passed, 2 years have passed, and here we are--no action by \nthe Republican leadership in the House of Representatives or, for that \nmatter, in the Senate to move comprehensive immigration reform. The \nPresident said: I am going to step up with my power as President and do \nwhat I can to deal with this issue. He said: Let's have some standards. \nI will not allow anyone to step forward and ask for temporary status in \nthis country unless they have been here at least 5 years. If they step \nforward, they have to pay a filing fee for us to process their \napplication, and they have to submit themselves to a criminal and \nnational security background check. We don't want anybody in this \ncountry who is a danger to America. If they flunk that part of the \ntest, they are finished and deported. And then they have to put their \nnames on the books to pay their taxes in the United States of America \nwhile they are working. Under those circumstances, we will give them \nthe temporary renewable right to stay and work without fear of \ndeportation, and then several years later repeat it, submit an \napplication again. The President believes, and I share the belief, we \nwill be a safer nation if we do that.\n  There could be as many as 11 million undocumented people in this \ncountry who would qualify for what we call DAPA. They would have to pay \na fee, pay their taxes, go through this background check, and be \nsubject to renewal on a regular basis.\n  Well, today, May 19, 2015, was supposed to be the first day people \nwould be allowed to apply for this new program--this DAPA Program, but \nunfortunately it has been stopped cold. It has been stopped by the \nRepublican Party in the House and Senate and stopped by their efforts \nin court to stop this President. Oh, they have an alternative. They \nstated their alternative. Their alternative is for these people to \nleave the United States. Their candidate for President, Governor \nRomney, said as much when he ran last time. They have no alternative \nplan. They want these people--millions of them--to leave the United \nStates through voluntary deportation, as they call it.\n  Well, the sad reality is that is not going to happen, and obviously \nthe Republicans are not going to do anything to deal with our broken \nimmigration system. There are casualties with this decision. One of \nthem is Naomi Florentino. This attractive young woman was brought to \nthe United States from Mexico when she was 10 years old. She grew up in \nSmyrna, TN. She was an amazing student and active in her community.\n  In high school, she was a member of the National Honor Society, and \nshe received the Student of the Year Awards for algebra and art. She \nserved on the student council and played on the varsity soccer and \ntrack and field teams, where she was a shot-putter and discus thrower.\n  Naomi's dream is to become a robotics engineer. In high school, she \nwas a member of the robotics team, participated in NASA's Science, \nEngineering, Mathematics and Aerospace Academy, and she performed so \nwell she won the Next Generation Pioneer Award. Naomi graduated from \nhigh school with an honor's diploma, but Naomi's immigration status \nlimited her options. The college counselor refused to help. The college \ncounselor at her high school told her that since she was undocumented, \nshe was on her own.\n  She didn't quit. She took mechanical engineering courses at Lipscomb \nUniversity in Nashville. She then went on to community college. These \nundocumented kids cannot get help while they are going to school. They \ndo not qualify for the Pell grant or government loans. She was \ndetermined. She was not going to quit.\n  At the community college, where she will be graduating this spring, \nshe has an associate's degree in mechatronics technology, a field that \ncombines mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, \ntelecommunications engineering, control engineering, and computer \nengineering. This fall Naomi will begin to work on her bachelor's \ndegree in engineering at Middle Tennessee State University. Remember \nwhat I said. She is on her own. She gets no help from the government to \ndo this because she is undocumented.\n  In her spare time--if you can imagine she has any--she continues to \nbe very involved in her community. For 6 years, she was judge and \nmentor in engineering and robotics competitions. Since 2008, she has \nvolunteered as a college mentor with the YMCA Latino Achievers Program \nin Tennessee. Despite everything this young woman has achieved in her \nlife, her future is totally uncertain.\n  In 2012, President Obama said that under the DACA Program we are \ngoing to protect Naomi, and people just like her, from deportation. We \nwill not give her government assistance to go to school, but at least \nshe knows she will not be deported as long as she passes the test I \nmentioned earlier.\n  She is now part of the work-study program at Nissan North America's \nSmyrna, TN, plant. They want her. Wouldn't you? This is the largest \nautomotive manufacturing plant in the United States.\n  As a maintenance intern, she assists with troubleshooting on their \nmost sophisticated equipment--this young lady with 2 years of community \ncollege.\n  She wrote me a letter, and here is what she said about the DACA \nProgram:\n\n       DACA has meant the opportunity of a lifetime for my \n     academic and professional career. As a student at Smyrna High \n     School, driving past the Nissan plant motivated me to be a \n     better student--with hopes of, one day, being part of a \n     company that is highly-regarded in my community. However, \n     without proper work authorization, that goal seemed far-\n     fetched. Today, it is a reality for me. I have learned that, \n     given the opportunity, hard work, patience and perseverance \n     can pay off.\n\n  Naomi and 600,000 DREAMers like her have stepped forward under \nPresident Obama's program. They are not going to be given any kind of \naward. They will just be given a chance.\n  I don't understand the Republican point of view. The Republicans \nwould have us deport this young woman. Their attitude is: Send her back \nto Mexico. We don't need her.\n  She, unfortunately, came here because her parents decided to bring \nher here, and now she has to pay the price for her parents' decision. \nIs that what America is all about? Is that what our system of justice \nis all about?\n  Naomi will be an important part of our future, and thousands like her \ndeserve that chance. That is why today is a sad day. The President's \nefforts to extend this program and help others--parents of young \nDREAMers like this have been stopped cold by the courts and stopped \ncold by the Republican leadership.\n  President Abraham Lincoln once said, ``We cannot escape history,'' \nand history is very clear, we are a nation of immigrants. My mother was \nan immigrant to this country, and I stand here today as a Senator from \nthe great State of Illinois. I am very proud of\n\n[[Page S3012]]\n\nwhat she and her family did when she came to this country.\n  Let us reward those who are willing to come to America to work and \nmake it better. Let us give these young people a chance. Let us, once \nand for all, say this Nation of immigrants is proud of our heritage and \nprouder still of what immigrants can mean to our future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I just wish to praise the senior Senator \nfrom Illinois. He has been consistent on this issue since he came here. \nHe was one of the architects of a major overhaul of our immigration \nsystem a year and a half ago, which passed by a two-thirds majority, by \nRepublicans and Democrats alike.\n  We have gone such a long way toward solving this problem. The \nRepublican leadership in the House--even though the votes were there to \npass it in the House--refused to bring it up.\n  I am proud to align myself as a follower of the leadership of the \nSenator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, on this issue.\n  With the way we apply the laws now, I wonder whether my grandparents \nwould have been able to come to Vermont from Italy and see their \ngrandson become a U.S. Senator or would have seen their highly \ndecorated son serve in World War II. I wonder if my wife's parents \nwould have been able to come from Canada so she could be born in \nVermont.\n  Come on. We are a nation of immigrants. Let's welcome them. They can \noften make our country much stronger than it was before.\n  I applaud the Senator from Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/19/senate-section/article/S3012-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3012-S3013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            USA FREEDOM ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

We knew May 31 would arrive \nquickly in the new Congress.\n  I did not want our intelligence community to face a period of \nuncertainty leading up to the sunset, and I also didn't want the \nAmerican people to have billions of their phone records stocked away in \na government database any longer--especially as we have seen, in the \ncase of Edward Snowden, just how insecure that database can be.\n  That is why we spent months holding six public hearings in the \nJudiciary Committee and even more months negotiating a bipartisan bill, \nwhich got the support of the administration, the intelligence \ncommunity, privacy groups, and the technology industry. I think that is \nthe first time we have had all of them together.\n  Unfortunately, my attempts to avoid this last-minute chaos were \nblocked by the Republican leader last year. He said this was a matter \nthat could wait for the new Congress. He said the new Republican \nmajority would have a rigorous committee process for important issues.\n  Well, five months into the new Republican majority, and with the \ndeadline looming, the Republican leader has just now turned his \nattention to this issue.\n  The Republican-led Senate committees have not taken steps toward \nreauthorization or reform. Instead, the majority leader now proposes a \n60-day extension of a program that a Federal court of appeals just \nruled is unlawful. The court ruled unanimously that it is unlawful, and \nthey are saying, well, let's just extend the bulk collection program \nfor another 60 days.\n  The majority leader apparently wants to do this to allow one of his \ncommittee chairmen to develop a last-minute ``back-up plan.'' This is \nwhy we tried to pass legislation a year ago.\n  The House of Representatives is not going to pass a 60-day extension, \nnor should it. We should not extend this illegal program for one more \nday, and we do not need to do so. After all, we have a solution in \nhand. Why try to ignore reality and go on with something else?\n  We have a responsible solution. In fact, it is the only responsible \nsolution. Broad consensus has developed around the bipartisan USA \nFREEDOM Act of 2015.\n  The Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence wrote \na letter in support of the bill. The FBI Director told me he supports \nit. This past weekend, the former chairman and ranking member of the \nHouse Intelligence Committee advocated for passage of this legislation \nin an article in the Baltimore Sun.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these materials be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Baltimore Sun, May 15, 2015]\n\nIntelligence Reform Bill Is Important to Safeguarding Our Security and \n                                Privacy\n\n             (By C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger and Mike Rogers)\n\n       The USA Freedom Act will protect our security and privacy.\n       A recent Baltimore Sun editorial described legislation to \n     reform the government's collection of Americans' phone and \n     email data as a sign that ``bipartisan cooperation in \n     Congress is not completely dead'' (``Reining in the \n     surveillance state,'' May 5). We'd like to remind The Sun \n     that similar legislation to end the mass storage of this data \n     passed the House by an overwhelming bipartisan majority--it \n     garnered more than 300 votes, in fact--over a year ago.\n       In our role as leaders on the House Intelligence Committee, \n     we drafted and introduced last year's bill together with our \n     colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, Reps. Bob Goodlatte \n     and John Conyers. Our success provided the foundation for the \n     legislation that passed the House by an even larger margin on \n     Wednesday. The USA Freedom Act ends the bulk collection of \n     what we now know as ``metadata''--that big database up at the \n     National Security Agency that contains the phone numbers of \n     millions of Americans will go away. The government will now \n     have to seek court approval before petitioning private cell \n     phone companies for records. The court will have to approve \n     each application, except in emergencies, and major court \n     decisions will be made public.\n       We need this reform to keep our country safe. Section 215 \n     of the Patriot Act, which is the part that legalizes much of \n     NSA's critical work to protect us from terrorists, expires in \n     less than three weeks on June 1. If we do not reauthorize it \n     with the reforms demanded by the public, essential \n     capabilities to track legitimate terror suspects will expire, \n     too.\n       That couldn't happen at a worse time--we live in a \n     dangerous world. The threats posed by ISIS and other terror \n     groups are just the tip of the iceberg. We also need strong \n     defenses against increasingly aggressive cyber terrorists and \n     the ``lone wolf'' terrorists who are often American citizens, \n     for example.\n       This bill restores Americans' confidence that the \n     government is not snooping on its own citizens by improving \n     the necessary checks and balances essential to our Democracy. \n     We helped write it last year, we support it this year and we \n     hope Republicans and Democrats continue working together on \n     common sense reforms to protect our national security and our \n     civil liberties.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     May 11, 2015.\n     Senator Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Senator Mike S. Lee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Leahy and Lee: Thank you for your letter of \n     May 11, 2015, asking for the views of the Department of \n     Justice and the Intelligence Community on S. 1123, the USA \n     FREEDOM Act of 2015. We support this legislation.\n       This bill is the result of extensive discussion among the \n     Congress, the Administration, privacy and civil liberties \n     advocates, and industry representatives. We believe that it \n     is a reasonable compromise that preserves vital national \n     security authorities, enhances privacy and civil liberties \n     and codifies requirements for increased transparency. The \n     Intelligence Community believes that the bill preserves the \n     essential operational capabilities of the telephone metadata \n     program and enhances other intelligence capabilities needed \n     to protect our nation and its partners. In the absence of \n     legislation, important intelligence authorities will expire \n     on June 1. This legislation would extend these authorities, \n     as amended, until the end of 2019, providing our intelligence \n     professionals the certainty they need to continue the \n     critical work they undertake every day to protect the \n     American people.\n       The USA FREEDOM Act bans bulk collection under Section 215 \n     of the USA PATRIOT Act, FISA pen registers, and National \n     Security Letters, while providing a new mechanism to obtain \n     telephone metadata records to help identify potential \n     contacts of suspected terrorists inside the United States. \n     The Intelligence Community believes, based on the existing \n     practices of communications providers in retaining metadata, \n     that these provisions will retain the essential operational \n     capabilities of the existing bulk telephone metadata program \n     while eliminating bulk collection by the government.\n\n[[Page S3013]]\n\n       The bill also codifies requirements for additional \n     transparency by mandating certain public reporting by the \n     government, authorizing additional reporting by providers, \n     and establishing a statutory mechanism for declassification \n     and release of FISA Court opinions consistent with national \n     security. It establishes a process for appointment of an \n     amicus curiae to assist the FISA Court and FISA Court of \n     Review in appropriate matters. It provides reforms to \n     national security letters, requiring review of the need for \n     their secrecy. The bill also closes potential gaps in \n     collection authorities and increases the maximum criminal \n     penalty for materially supporting a foreign terrorist \n     organization.\n       Overall, the significant reforms contained in this \n     legislation will provide the public greater confidence in how \n     our intelligence activities are carried out and in the \n     oversight of those activities, while ensuring vital national \n     security authorities remain in place. You have our commitment \n     that we will notify Congress if we find that provisions of \n     this law significantly impair the Intelligence Community's \n     ability to protect national security. We urge the Congress to \n     pass this bill promptly.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Loretta E. Lynch,\n                                                 Attorney General.\n                                                 James R. Clapper,\n                                Director of National Intelligence.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. But even more importantly, last week the House of \nRepresentatives passed the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015 with an overwhelming \nvote of 338 to 88. At a time when the public says Congress is locked in \npartisan gridlock, look at this overwhelming vote of Republicans and \nDemocrats for the USA FREEDOM Act. Well, the Senate ought to do the \nsame thing the House did.\n  We can keep our country safe without a government database of \nbillions of Americans' phone records. I think about Richard Clarke, who \nis a former counterterrorism official. He spent six months examining \nthis program as a member of the President's Review Group. He concluded \nthe program has ``no benefit.'' We do not need it, and, more \nimportantly, Americans do not want it.\n  I fear that if Congress does not end this bulk collection program, it \nwill only open the door to the next dragnet surveillance program. Next \ntime it will not just be phone records. It might be location \ninformation or medical records or credit card records. That is why it \nis so important to stop it now.\n  Some will say Congress doesn't need to act because the Second Circuit \nhas already ruled that this program is illegal. I have read the court's \ndecision, I agree with it, and I hope this panel decision will \nultimately be upheld by the Supreme Court. But there are other pending \nlawsuits and it could be months or even years before we know how the \ncourts will ultimately rule on this issue.\n  In addition, the USA FREEDOM Act doesn't just end bulk collection \nunder section 215 and the other national security authorities; it also \ncontains other important reforms that cannot be won through legal \nchallenges, such as new transparency measures and a panel of experts \nfrom which the FISA Court can draw on for amicus support. So the courts \nmade it very clear Congress has to act.\n  Congress has spent years working on these issues, with numerous \nhearings. The Senate last year came up with basically the same bill the \nHouse has just overwhelmingly passed. We shouldn't be staying around \nhere talking about whether we are going to go over the brink. We are \ngoing to put our intelligence community under pressure.\n  The USA FREEDOM Act is a responsible solution that can pass both \nChambers today, including with a majority vote for it in this body \ntoday. Its enactment will ensure that these expiring provisions do not \nsunset. I urge Senators to support it.\n  Let us not play politics with the security of this country. Let us \ntalk about what really can be done, what has been done in a \nresponsible, bipartisan way in the other body, and let us step up and \ndo the same in the Senate. That is what I would urge, not this \nbrinkmanship which will actually bring about the end of all of these \nprovisions. Maybe some would like that. I think we have a better \nbalance here with the USA FREEDOM Act.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum, and ask unanimous consent that the \ntime be equally divided between the two parties.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/19/senate-section/article/S3013-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO SONNY DIXON\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON.

I know him as a \nfriend, I know him as a professional, and I know him as coastal \nGeorgia's best anchorman, period.\n  He was awarded the Edward R. Murrow Award and the Associated Press \naward for best anchor in Georgia. He has been recognized by everyone \nwho can do so for his professionalism, his knowledge, his skill, and \nhis talent.\n  It is a privilege for me to acknowledge today on the floor of the \nSenate his 18 years of service as an anchor, his 10 years of service in \nthe Georgia Legislature, and his lifetime of commitment to the greatest \nState of all, the State of Georgia, to the betterment of his community, \nto the betterment of Savannah, the first capital of the State.\n  So as we take this moment in time to pause, I want to congratulate \nSonny Dixon on a great career and a great recognition that is well \nearned.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/19/senate-section/article/S3013-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO ROY ROBERTS\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I would like to talk about Roy Roberts \nfrom Walton County, GA. It is not often that a Senator from Georgia \nrises to pay tribute to a Kentucky basketball player, but Roy Roberts \nplayed for the famous Adolf Rupp in the 1960s and was an All-SEC \nbasketball player for the University of Kentucky. He was a great player \nand made many all-star teams and received many awards, but he came back \nto Georgia to ranch and farm 1,000 acres, raise Hereford cows, and, \nwith his two brothers, make Walton County, GA, the centerpiece of our \nState.\n  He has annually participated in many things that involve politics and \npublic involvement in Walton County and has helped to lead Walton \nCounty to be one of the leading Republican counties in the State of \nGeorgia.\n  Most notable is the Roy Roberts annual barbecue, which takes place \nnext Tuesday in Walton County, GA, where over 1,000 Georgians and \nPresidential candidates from all over the country will come to meet at \nRoy Roberts' farm, enjoy a little barbecue, and enjoy the best of \ngrassroots politics.\n  Were it not for people like Roy Roberts, we wouldn't have the body \npolitic we have, we wouldn't have the democracy we have, and Georgia \nwould not be the great State it is.\n  I am pleased to rise today and commend to everyone the work of \ncitizen Roy Roberts, a great American, a great Georgian, and a pretty \ndoggone good basketball player for the University of Kentucky.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it was just a few weeks ago that the \nSenate took up and passed S. 178, the Justice for Victims of \nTrafficking Act. This bill took us a while to get through but \nultimately garnered unanimous support from this Chamber with a vote of \n99 to 0. I am happy to report that the House of Representatives will \ntake up and pass this bill later on today, and this vital legislation \nwill then head to the President for his signature.\n\n[[Page S3014]]\n\n  I thank my colleague and friend and fellow Texan, Representative Ted \nPoe of Houston, for serving as the chief House sponsor for this \nlegislation. I also express my gratitude to the House leadership team \nand Chairman Goodlatte of the House Judiciary Committee for their \nimportant work on this issue.\n  This legislation, as we said before, will provide victims of sexual \nexploitation, slavery, and human trafficking in the United States with \nan avenue to find healing and restoration. Most importantly, the \nvictims, who are often children, will have access to additional \nresources to ensure that they get the shelter and the services they \nneed. I am thankful that Members from both Chambers and from both sides \nof the aisle were able to recognize the urgency of the matter and get \nthe job done.\n  While this bill represents a step forward, there is more we need to \ndo and more we will do to continue to fight the scourge of human \ntrafficking. In the coming years, we will look back on this moment as a \ntime when our country finally began to get serious about this problem \nand heard the voices of the thousands of American victims in our own \nbackyard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/19/senate-section/article/S3014-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRADE PROMOTION AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this Chamber has now turned its \nconsideration to trade promotion authority, or TPA. I am a supporter of \nthis legislation because my State is the largest exporting State in the \ncountry, and I think our economy and the number of jobs that are \ncreated in Texas are reflective of our strong commitment to \ninternational trade.\n  We simply find the point inarguable that to open new markets to the \nproducts that our agricultural sectors grow, our ranchers raise, and \nour manufacturers make seems to be such an obvious thing to do. That is \nwhy I am a big supporter of this legislation.\n  It is not something that just helps businesses; it helps consumers, \ntoo. Reducing the protections for domestically produced goods helps \nconsumers most dramatically. It helps with their cost of living and \nhelps make their daily or weekly or monthly paycheck go a little bit \nfurther.\n  Earlier this week, the Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. exports \nto trade-pact countries were growing at a far higher rate than exports \nto nontrade-pact countries. So if we get this TPA passed and the United \nStates enters into one of these agreements under negotiation, such as \nthe Trans-Pacific Partnership, we could see American exports to the \nregion skyrocket. This region in particular involves 11 other countries \nand makes up about 40 percent of the world's economy, and, of course, \nit would be a ready-market for U.S. products, from beef to electronics.\n  The reason why trade promotion authority is so important is because \nit makes no sense--in fact, I think it is almost impossible--to \nnegotiate a trade deal with 535 Members of Congress. Congress gives the \nPresident the authority within very firm and clear directives on how \nthe President's U.S. trade administration should negotiate this. \nFrankly, I think this is one area where we have bipartisan agreement \nthat this is good. So why wouldn't we work together in the best \ninterests of the American people and our economy?\n  Trade doesn't just help businesses, as I have said; trade and TPA \nalso help the consumer by driving down prices they pay every day at the \ndrugstore, the grocery store, the hardware store--you name it. This \nlegislation is good for American exporters and good for American \nconsumers. Put simply, trade is good for America.\n  Let me reiterate that this bill is not filled with partisan rhetoric. \nIt is actually a very simple trade tool that will give Congress the \nauthority to examine any upcoming trade deal the President is trying to \ncut and make sure the American people get a fair shake.\n  I have heard several of our colleagues say they have gone down to a \nroom to look at what has so far been negotiated on the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership. That is a good thing, but the fact is that negotiations \naren't complete. That is not the whole deal; it is just a start.\n  Many of the provisions in the TPA are just commonsense proposals. For \nexample, if passed, TPA would give Congress the authority to access the \nfull text of the trade agreement. Of course, it is hard to get more \nstraightforward than that. It would also make sure there is greater \ntransparency and accountability in the negotiation process, with \nregular briefings by the administration to Congress and Members allowed \nto actually attend the negotiations.\n  In short, this trade legislation will provide Congress the needed \noversight of the trade negotiations and will act as a safeguard for \nAmerican interests to make sure our markets and our goods and services \nremain competitive in the global marketplace.\n  Finally, I would like to say that this is a reminder of how the \nSenate should function--as a deliberative body that votes regularly on \na bipartisan basis to do something important to help hard-working \nAmerican families. We vote.\n\n  I hope we will have a series of votes later this afternoon. I think \nhaving an open amendment process, as the majority leader has promised, \nis something that has been found to be a welcome development not just \nfor the majority but also for the minority, which I know wants to \nparticipate in the process and thus represent their constituents to the \nbest of their ability. Although some of my colleagues from across the \naisle do not support this legislation, I hope they don't block it and \nprevent those of us who are interested in passing a good trade \npromotion authority piece of legislation from working productively.\n  I would encourage all of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \noffer their amendments so that the Senate can debate them and vote on \nthem. That is our job as the elected representatives of the American \npeople.\n  I see TPA as a real opportunity to help American workers earn higher \nwages and send more American-made products around the world. I \nencourage our colleagues to support this bill and in doing so to lend \nsupport to the hard-working Americans who increasingly rely on trade to \nsupport their families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport the reauthorization of trade adjustment assistance, which is \nincluded in the bill we are now considering. I urge my colleagues to \noppose any attempt to curtail this vital program.\n  Trade adjustment assistance--better known as TAA--plays an essential \nrole in helping hard-working Americans who through no fault of their \nown lose their jobs as the result of what is often unfair foreign \ncompetition. TAA programs enable displaced workers to acquire the new \nskills, the new training necessary to prepare for jobs in other \nindustries.\n  I am proud to have authored the bipartisan legislation with Senator \nRon\n\n[[Page S3015]]\n\nWyden to reauthorize TAA that is included in the bill before us. Our \nlegislation forms the basis of the TAA provisions that are included in \nthis bill.\n  Maine workers have been hit particularly hard by mill closures and \nshuttered factories. In the last 15 years, Maine has lost 38 percent of \nits manufacturing jobs, nearly 31,000 jobs in total. While not all of \nthose job losses are due to increased and unfair foreign competition, \nthere is no doubt that workers in the manufacturing sector in Maine \nhave been harmed by the outsourcing of their good-paying jobs to \ncountries with much lower wages and environmental standards.\n  This last year was particularly difficult for workers in Maine's pulp \nand paper industry. In just the past year alone, the communities of \nLincoln, East Millinocket, and Bucksport have all experienced \ndevastating job losses due to the closures of paper mills. Those mills \nhave been the financial anchors of those small towns, providing good \njobs for generations of families. The second- and third-order economic \neffects on other businesses and their employees in those small \ncommunities are also significant.\n  In times of such great upheaval, laid-off employees need the time, \nthe support, and the resources to learn the skills that will enable \nthem to seek and secure new employment opportunities. These are skilled \nAmericans who are eager to get back to work and who, with the right \ntraining, support, and opportunity, can find new jobs in in-demand \nfields.\n  Just this spring, I visited the Eastern Maine Community College in \nBangor. I had the opportunity to talk with a group of students who are \nformer employees of the Verso paper mill in Bucksport, which closed \ndown last year completely unexpectedly. It was a huge and terrible \nsurprise to the workers and to the community and surrounding area. But \nbecause of trade adjustment assistance, these former workers with whom \nI talked are now enrolled in a fine-furniture making program and are \nlearning new skills for new jobs.\n  I was so impressed with their determination and their attitude. It is \nvery difficult, if you have not been in school for decades, to enroll \nin a whole new field of study, but that is exactly what these laid-off \nworkers were doing. Their determination to start new careers after \nyears of working at the mill in Bucksport was inspiring. Each of them \nwas enrolled thanks to the support provided by the Trade Adjustment \nAssistance Program. Without that program, they would not have had the \nfunding, the support, and the resources necessary to enable them to do \na midlife career change.\n  Similarly, last year in Lincoln, ME, I met a woman who had spent many \nyears working at the local tissue mill. This mill had a cycle of ups \nand downs over the years. When it was closed for a time years ago, this \nwoman was thrown out of work, but her story had a happy ending. Through \nTAA, she was able to learn new skills and find employment as a nursing \nhome administrator, where she has been happily employed for a decade. \nIt took a lot of courage for this woman who had been employed as a mill \nworker for many years to go into an entirely new career field, but she \ndid so. She encouraged her fellow workers to recognize that through the \nTrade Adjustment Assistance Program, they too could find new skills, \nretrain in an area completely different from the work they had been \ndoing, and have a happy ending.\n  Her story was inspiring. Because of TAA, for 10 years she has been \nproviding for her family and contributing to her community. What a \ngreat return on investment. It would not have been possible without \nTAA. There are many more success stories like this one.\n  I thank Secretary Perez for expediting the TAA assistance these \nworkers who are newly displaced have needed.\n  I would also note that since Maine is the State with the oldest \nmedian age in the Nation, this woman really picked a very good field in \nwhich to enroll. As a nursing home administrator, her skills are going \nto be in demand as we see the changing demographics not only of the \nState of Maine but of our Nation.\n  TAA programs have made a tremendous difference in the lives of those \nI have described, in the lives of those working in trade-affected \nindustries in Maine, such as pulp and paper manufacturing, textile, and \nshoe production.\n  In fiscal year 2013 alone, more than 700 Mainers have benefited from \nthe TAA programs, and more than 70 percent of the TAA participants in \nMaine have found employment within 3 months of completing their \nretraining programs made possible by TAA. Even more encouraging, of \nthese participants who found employment, more than 90 percent were \nstill employed in their new jobs 6 months later. Without TAA, it is \nvery unlikely that would have happened.\n  Assisting American workers who are negatively affected by \ninternational trade--particularly when they are competing with workers \nwith lower wages in countries with lower wages and lower environmental \nstandards or none at all--is vitally important and the right thing to \ndo.\n  In Maine, the effects of free-trade agreements have been decidedly \nmixed. While some past agreements have brought benefits to my State in \nthe form of lowered tariffs on Maine products such as potatoes, \nlobster, and wild blueberries, jobs in many other industries have \nsuffered terrible losses as a result of unfair foreign competition.\n  Our workers are the best in the world, and they can compete when \nthere is a level playing field, but oftentimes they are competing \nagainst industries in developing countries that are paying lower wages, \nthat don't have to comply with any kind of environmental standards, and \nthat are often subsidized by those governments--and that is not fair.\n  The least we can do is to reauthorize the trade adjustment programs \nwhich are successfully helping to retrain and reemploy American \nworkers. That is a commonsense way we can help workers recover from the \nblows inflicted by some unfair trade agreements, so these Americans can \nstart new jobs and new lives with fresh skills.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support the reauthorization of trade \nadjustment assistance and to oppose any amendments to end these vital \nprograms.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/19/senate-section/article/S3015-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as we resume consideration of our TPA bill, \nI want to delve a little deeper into the process of considering and \napproving trade agreements.\n  Throughout the debate surrounding this bill, I have heard the term \n``fast-track'' used quite a few times. There was, in fact, a time when \ntrade promotion authority was commonly referred to as ``fast-track.'' \nNow, only TPA opponents use that term.\n  They want the American people to believe that under TPA, trade \nagreements come to Congress and are passed in the blink of an eye. \nSometimes they use the term ``rubberstamp'' as if under TPA Congress \nwielding ultimate authority over a trade agreement--the power to reject \nit entirely--is a mere administrative act.\n  There is a reason the term ``fast-track'' isn't used anymore. It is \nbecause those who are being truly honest know the process is anything \nbut fast.\n  I think it would be helpful for me to walk through the entire process \nCongress must undertake before rendering a final judgment on a trade \nagreement, to show how thoroughly these agreements are vetted before \nthey ever receive a vote.\n  Before I do, though, I will note for my colleagues that this bill \nadds more transparency, notice, and consultation requirements than any \nTPA bill before it. This bill guarantees that Congress has all the \ninformation we need to render an informed up-or-down verdict on any \ntrade agreement negotiated using the procedures in this bill. \nCongress's oversight of any trade agreement starts even before the \nnegotiations on that agreement begin.\n  Under this bill, the President must not only notify Congress that he \nis considering entering into negotiations with our trading partners but \nalso what his objectives for those negotiations are. Specifically, this \nhas to happen 3 months before the President can start negotiating. That \nis 3 months for Congress to consult on and shape the negotiations \nbefore they even begin.\n  Congress's oversight continues as negotiations advance.\n  This bill requires the U.S. Trade Representative to continuously \nconsult with the Senate Finance Committee and any other Senate \ncommittee with jurisdiction over subject matter potentially affected by \na trade agreement. Moreover, the USTR, the U.S. Trade Representative, \nmust, upon request, meet with any Member of Congress to consult on the \nnegotiations, including providing classified negotiating text.\n  The bill also establishes panels to oversee the trade negotiations. \nThese panels, the Senate Advisory Group on Negotiations and the \ndesignated congressional advisers, consult with and advise the USTR on \nthe formulation of negotiating positions and strategies. Under the \nbill, members of these panels would be accredited advisers to trade \nnegotiating sessions involving the United States.\n  Congressional oversight intensifies as the negotiations near \nconclusion. At least 6 months before the President signs a trade \nagreement, he must submit a report to Congress detailing any potential \nchanges to U.S. trade remedy laws.\n  Then, 3 months before the President signs a trade agreement, he must \nnotify Congress that he intends to do so. At the same time, the \nPresident is required to submit details of the agreement to the U.S. \nInternational Trade Commission. The ITC is tasked with preparing an \nextensive report for Congress on the potential costs and benefits the \nagreement will have on the U.S. economy, specific economic sectors, and \nAmerican workers.\n  I want to focus on the next step required by this bill because it is \na new requirement never before included in TPA. Sixty days before the \nPresident can sign any trade agreement, he must publish the full text \nof the agreement on the USTR Web site so that the public can see it. \nThis ensures an unprecedented level of transparency for the American \npeople and gives our constituents the material and time they need to \ninform us of their views.\n  Only after the President has met these notification and consultation \nrequirements, only after he has provided the required trade reports, \nand only after he has made the agreement available to the American \npeople, may he finally sign the agreement.\n  The process this bill requires before an agreement is even signed is \nobviously quite complex, full of checks and balances, and provides \nunprecedented transparency for the American public.\n  However, once the President does sign the agreement, his obligations \ncontinue. Sixty days after signing the agreement, the President must \nprovide Congress a description of changes to U.S. law he considers \nnecessary. This step gives Congress time to begin considering what will \nbe included in the legislation to implement the trade agreement.\n  This is also the time when the Finance Committee holds open hearings \non the trade agreement in order to gather the views of the \nadministration and the public.\n  Following these hearings, one of the most important steps in this \nentire process occurs, the so-called informal markup. The informal \nmarkup is not always well understood, so I will take a minute to \ndescribe it.\n  The informal markup occurs before the President formally submits the \ntrade agreement to Congress. As with any markup of legislation, the \ncommittee reviews and discusses the agreement and implementing \nlegislation, has the opportunity to question witnesses about the \nagreement, and can amend the legislation.\n  In the event of amendments, the Senate can proceed to a mock \nconference with the House to unify the legislation. The practice of the \ninformal markup produces or provides Congress an opportunity to craft \nthe legislation implementing a trade agreement as it sees fit and to \ndirect the President on the final package to be formally submitted to \nCongress.\n  While the informal markup is well established in practice, this bill, \nfor the first time in the history of the TPA, specifies that Congress \nwill receive the materials it needs in time to conduct an informal \nmarkup. It requires that 30 days before the President formally submits \na trade agreement to Congress, he or she must submit the final legal \ntext of the agreement and a statement specifying any administrative \naction he will take to implement the agreement.\n  The bill therefore ensures that Congress will have all the materials \nit needs in time to conduct a thorough markup. Only at this point may \nthe President formally submit legislation implementing a trade \nagreement to Congress, and only at this point do the TPA procedures, \nfirst established in the Trade Act of 1974, kick in.\n  Once a bill implementing a trade agreement is formally submitted to \nCongress, a clock for consideration of that bill starts. This clock \ngives Congress 90 days in session to consider and roll out a bill. As \neveryone here knows, 90 legislative days takes a lot longer than 90 \ncalendar days. When I hear my colleagues talk about ``fast-track,'' I \nthink this is where they start the clock.\n  They are disregarding the years of oversight and consultations that \noccurred during trade negotiations. They are ignoring the many months \nof congressional consideration of trade legislation that occurs before \nthe President ever formally submits that legislation to Congress. They \nare discounting that by this point in the process, Congress has held \nhearings on the agreement, received views from the public, and \nextensively reviewed the agreement and the implementing legislation \nthrough an informal markup. Calling this part of the process fast-track \nis like skipping to the end of a book and saying the author did not \ndevelop a plot.\n\n  As I said, even here at the end of the process, the bill provides \nmore than 3 months for hearings, committee action, floor debate, and \nvotes. Sometimes I think that only a United States Senator could argue \nthat more than 3 months to formally consider legislation--legislation \nthat has already been thoroughly debated, vetted, and reviewed--is \nmaking decisions too fast.\n  When Congress votes on an implementing bill, it is only after years \nof oversight and months of formal review. So I have to ask, does this \nprocess seem fast to you? If TPA is not fast, then what does TPA do? \nPut simply, TPA guarantees a vote. TPA says to the world that when they \nsign an agreement with the United States, Congress promises to say yes \nor no to that agreement. Most importantly,\n\n[[Page S3017]]\n\nTPA guarantees that Congress will have the information in the time we \nneed to make that decision.\n  Without TPA, we are essentially telling the President to try to \nnegotiate the price of a house, and then after buying that home, we are \nasking to renegotiate with the sellers. This would be absurd and rob \nAmericans of financial opportunities, employment, and a fair world \nmarketplace they can only get from free-trade agreements.\n  Once again, I urge all my colleagues to support the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss two \namendments that are pending to the trade bill. I want to begin by \nthanking Chairman Hatch and Ranking Member Wyden, as well as Senators \nMcConnell and Reid, for working with me to make these amendments \npending.\n  I believe it is important that we have an amendment process as we \nconsider granting trade promotion authority to the President. Enacting \nthe bill before us will have major impacts on our Nation's economy for \nyears to come, and Senators should have an opportunity to improve the \nproduct reported by the Committee on Finance.\n  The trade promotion authority bill by its very nature demands that \nSenators be able to debate and vote on key trade issues. That is \nbecause the trade promotion authority bill creates a process by which \ntrade agreements are submitted to Congress for approval without the \nopportunity to change them on the House or Senate floor. So it is \ncritical that we utilize the opportunity we have now to set the rules \nof the road for future trade agreements and to enact important trade \nreforms.\n  Today, I would like to discuss two amendments I believe will \nstrengthen the trade package.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1227\n\n  As ranking member of the small business committee, it is my \nresponsibility to look at bills on the Senate floor and ask: How does \nthis affect small businesses? How will they benefit or be harmed? How \ncan we improve this bill so that small businesses have a seat at the \ntable?\n  I think that is especially important as we talk about trade. Trade \nhas become increasingly vital for small businesses that are looking to \ndiversify and grow. Yet, even though 95 percent of the world's \ncustomers live outside of the United States, less than 1 percent of our \nsmall- and medium-sized businesses are exporting to global markets. By \ncomparison, over 40 percent of large businesses sell their products \noverseas. As we consider this trade package, we must make sure small \nbusinesses have a seat at the table and the resources they need to sell \noverseas.\n  The amendment I filed incorporates bipartisan, commonsense measures \nthat will help small businesses take advantage of trade opportunities. \nIt reauthorizes the SBA's State Trade and Export Promotion Grant \nProgram. This program, known as STEP, was created as a pilot program to \nhelp States work with small businesses to succeed in the international \nmarketplace. In just a few years, STEP has been a great success. Since \n2011, it has supported over $900 million in U.S. small business \nexports, producing a return on investment of 15 to 1 for taxpayers.\n  It has helped small businesses such as Corfin Industries, located in \nSalem, NH. Before STEP, Corfin's international sales were just 2 \npercent. Now they are up to 12 percent. As a result, the company has \nadded 22 employees. That is the kind of job growth we will see in our \nsmall businesses when we make sure they are part of our trade agenda.\n  Reauthorizing the successful STEP Program is a commonsense way to \nmake sure our small businesses can benefit from trade, and it builds on \nbipartisan legislation that was first introduced by Senator Cantwell, \nwho was just on the floor, Senator Collins, and me.\n  The amendment also takes a number of steps to make it easier for \nsmall businesses to access export services provided by the Federal \nGovernment. It encourages those Federal agencies, such as the Small \nBusiness Administration and the Department of Commerce, to work hand in \nhand with State trade agencies that have on-the-ground knowledge of \nlocal needs.\n  Finally, the amendment makes sure we understand how trade agreements \nnegotiated under trade promotion authority will affect small \nbusinesses.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this small business amendment, and I \nhope we can reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank so that our small businesses can \naccess that funding and get into those international markets.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1226\n\n  The second amendment I would like to discuss is an amendment Senator \nMcCain, who is on the floor, and I have filed to repeal a harmful, job-\nkilling program--the USDA Catfish Inspection Program. This is something \nSenator McCain has been working on for years. I have joined him in \nrecent years to try to address the concerns I have heard from companies \nin New Hampshire that are going to be affected by that new USDA Catfish \nInspection Program.\n  Back in 2008, a provision was added to the farm bill that transferred \nthe inspection of catfish--only catfish--from the FDA, which inspects \nall foreign and domestic fish products, to the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture. It required USDA to set up a new, separate program to \ninspect catfish alone.\n  I think this is a wasteful, duplicative program that will hurt \nseafood-processing businesses across the country. There is no \nscientific or food safety benefit here. In fact, officials from FDA and \nUSDA have explicitly stated that catfish is a low-risk food. In nine \nseparate reports, the Government Accountability Office has recommended \neliminating this program.\n  Even worse, this program is actually a thinly disguised trade barrier \nagainst foreign catfish. We are facing an immediate 5- to 7-year ban on \nimported catfish as soon as the USDA program is up and running. As a \nresult, our trading partners are explicitly threatening retaliation. \nAnd since there is no scientific basis for this program, any WTO nation \nthat currently exports catfish to the United States could challenge it \nand secure WTO-sanctioned trade retaliation against a wide range of \nU.S. export industries, including beef, soy, poultry, pork, grain, \nfruit, or cotton. The program is becoming a major issue of concern in \nTrans-Pacific Partnership negotiations.\n  The only other time the Senate has voted on this issue was in 2012 \nwhen we voted to repeal it in a bipartisan voice vote. But since then, \nwe have been denied the opportunity to address this issue on the floor. \nI think it is very important that we have an opportunity to vote on \nthis amendment because the USDA is poised to begin its inspection of \ncatfish very soon. This may be our last chance to solve this problem \nbefore the program's harmful effects begin.\n  Again, we need an opportunity to vote on this amendment. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it and to repeal the duplicative USDA Catfish \nInspection Program.\n  I look forward to hearing what my colleague Senator McCain has to \nsay.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from New \nHampshire for her support and continuing efforts to get rid of this \nwasteful, pork barrel, outrageous program that has cost the taxpayers \ntens of millions of dollars and with regard to the catfish office \nalone, about $20 million to date. As the Senator from New Hampshire \npointed out, this could put the entire TPP--Trans-Pacific Partnership--\nAgreement in jeopardy. So this has a lot more to do with just catfish \nhere; it has a lot to do with our international relations and the \nprospects of concluding or not concluding one of the most important \ntrade agreements arguably of the 21st century, obviously.\n  I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senators Shaheen, Ayotte, \nIsakson, Kirk, Crapo, Risch, Casey, Reed, Peters, Wyden, Warner, \nCantwell, and McCaskill, in introducing this amendment, which has \nalready been made pending to the trade promotion authority act, which \nwould repeal a proposed Catfish Inspection Program at the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture. The amendment would end the waste of \ntaxpayer money pouring into the creation of a USDA catfish office, \nwhich is about $20 million to date. It would also save American farmers \nand livestock growers from potentially losing billions of dollars in \nlost market access to Asian nations.\n\n[[Page S3018]]\n\n  As the Senator from New Hampshire pointed out, I have been fighting \nthis catfish battle for a long time. I first tried to kill an old \ncatfish-labeling program in the 2002 farm bill. Later, during the \nSenate's debate on the 2012 farm bill, I offered a similar amendment to \nrepeal this new catfish program, which was adopted by voice vote. But \nwhen the Senate took up the 2014 farm bill after failing to pass it in \n2012, I was blocked from having a vote by the Democratic manager \ndespite her assurances that my amendment would receive a vote.\n  I note that my dear friend from Mississippi is here, and I know there \nmay be others who will want to preserve this $14 to $20 million waste \nof taxpayer dollars. All I want is a vote. All I am asking for is an \nup-or-down vote on whether we should continue to squander millions of \ntaxpayer dollars on a program that is not only duplicative but \nendangers the entire Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement we are \ndiscussing today.\n  American agriculture is the heart of our efforts to pass TPA, \nparticularly as negotiators move closer to completing the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership Agreement. TPA can put wind in the sails of the 12-nation \nTPP, which will promote hundreds of billions of dollars of American \nexports, including beef, pork, poultry, soy, wheat, vegetables, and \ndairy products. The TPP covers an area of the world that accounts for \nabout 40 percent of global GDP and one-third of all trade. The TPP will \nstrengthen our security relationships with countries such as Japan, \nMalaysia, Vietnam, and Australia, and provide a strategic counterweight \nto Chinese protectionist influence. So it is our responsibility to pass \na trade promotion authority that signals to Asian trading partners that \nwe are serious about free trade.\n  Free trade is good for America. I am a representative of a State that \nhas immeasurably benefited from the North American Free Trade \nAgreement.\n  By the way, many of the same interests and people who opposed that \nare opposing this now--i.e., primarily the labor unions.\n  Here, that means eliminating this catfish program, which is one of \nthe most brazen and reckless protectionist programs that I have \nencountered in my time in the Senate. The purpose of the USDA catfish \noffice is purportedly to make sure catfish is safe for human \nconsumption. I am all in favor of ensuring that American consumers \nenjoy wholesome catfish. The problem is that the Food and Drug \nAdministration already inspects all seafood, including catfish.\n  The true purpose of the catfish program is to create a trade barrier \nto protect a small handful of catfish farmers in two or three Southern \nStates. Let's be clear about what this is all about--protecting catfish \nfarmers in two or three Southern States. Yet, we are endangering the \nentire agreement here. That is not right, and it is not right for the \nAmerican people.\n  In classic farm bill politics, southern catfish farmers worked up \nsome specious talking points--which will probably be repeated here \ntoday--about how Americans need a whole new government agency to \ninspect catfish imports. As a result, USDA will soon hire and train \nroughly 95 catfish inspectors to work right alongside the FDA inspector \ndoppelgangers in seafood-processing plants across the Nation. Experts \nsay it could take as long as 5 to 7 years for foreign catfish exporters \nto duplicate USDA's new program, which would give southern catfish \nfarmers a lock on the American seafood market.\n  Growing government is not cheap. To date, the USDA has spent $20 \nmillion to set up the catfish office without inspecting a single \ncatfish. I am not making that up. Moving forward, the USDA estimates it \nwill spend around $14 million a year once the program is operational.\n  GAO has investigated this catfish office and warned Congress in nine \ndifferent reports--nine different reports to GAO, which is probably \nclearly the most trusted organization here--nine different reports. The \ncatfish office should be repealed. It is wasteful and duplicative. The \nFDA already inspects seafood. It fragments our food inspection system. \nNine different reports. One GAO report is simply titled \n``Responsibility for Inspecting Catfish Should Not Be Assigned to \nUSDA.'' The Government Accountability Office has repeatedly found that \ncatfish inspectors are a phony issue and warned that implementing the \nUSDA program might actually make food less safe for Americans by \nfragmenting seafood inspections across two Federal agencies.\n  Here are a few GAO excerpts.\n  GAO, May 2012:\n\n       USDA uses outdated and limited information as its \n     scientific basis for catfish inspection. The cost \n     effectiveness of the catfish inspection program is unclear \n     because USDA would oversee a small fraction of all seafood \n     imports while FDA, using its enhanced authorities, could \n     undertake oversight of all imported seafood.\n\n  GAO, February 2013:\n\n       Congress should consider repealing provisions of the Farm \n     Bill that assigned USDA responsibility for examining and \n     inspecting catfish.\n\n  GAO, April 2014:\n\n       We suggested that Congress consider repealing these \n     provisions of the 2008 Farm Bill. However, the 2014 Farm Bill \n     instead modified these provisions to require the Secretary of \n     Agriculture to enter into a memorandum of understanding with \n     the Commissioner of FDA that would ensure that inspection of \n     catfish conducted by the FSIS and FDA are not duplicative. We \n     maintain that such an MOU does not address the fundamental \n     problem, which is that FSIS's catfish program, if \n     implemented, would result in duplication of activities and an \n     inefficient use of taxpayer funds. Duplication would result \n     if facilities that process both catfish and other seafood \n     were inspected by both FSIS and FDA.\n\n  Even if my colleagues do not care about ballooning government \nspending and taxpayer waste, then consider the risk this catfish \nprogram presents to jobs and agriculture exports from their home States \nto an area of the world that accounts for 40 percent of the world's GDP \nand one-third of its trade.\n  Ten Asian-Pacific nations have sent letters to the Office of the U.S. \nTrade Representative warning that this USDA catfish office is hurting \nTPP negotiations. At least one nation--Vietnam--has threatened trade \nretaliation if the program comes online.\n  American trade experts are equally outraged. In a legal opinion \nwritten by the former chief judge at the World Trade Organization--the \nchief judge at the World Trade Organization said:\n\n       The United States would face a daunting challenge in \n     defending the catfish rule . . . there was, and still is, no \n     meaningful evidence that catfish--domestic or imported--posed \n     a significant health hazard when Congress acted in 2008 . . . \n     the complete lack of scientific evidence to justify the \n     catfish rule combines with substantial evidence of \n     protectionist intent.\n\n  He further notes that when it came to creating the USDA Catfish \nInspection Program in the dead of night using a farm bill conference \nreport--that is interesting, my colleagues; a farm bill conference \nreport was how this whole thing came about--``Congress shot first and \nasked questions later.''\n  This is perhaps Mr. Bacchus's most poignant warning:\n\n       If Congress continues to mandate the transfer of \n     jurisdiction over catfish, it will not only be inviting a WTO \n     challenge to the rule; it will be giving other nations an \n     opening to enact ``copycat legislation'' which will \n     disadvantage our exports. Moreover, if the United States \n     somehow prevails in defending the catfish measure in a WTO \n     case, it will truly be ``open season'' in the rest of the \n     world for new restrictions on U.S. agriculture exports of all \n     kinds.\n\n  Mr. Bacchus is not alone in his assessment. The Wall Street Journal \nhas covered this catfish debacle over the years. The Wall Street \nJournal has editorialized and reported on this many times.\n  This past weekend, the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal \npenned an editorial entitled ``Congress's Catfish Trade Scam.''\n  The Wall Street Journal, lead editorial, ``Congress's Catfish Trade \nScam.''\n  ``The U.S. slams a trade partner and raises prices for Americans.''\n  ``Senate Democrats dealt a blow to economic growth Tuesday by \nrefusing to advance . . . Japan, Vietnam,'' et cetera.\n\n       The problem dates to 2002, when Congress barred Vietnamese \n     exporters from marketing as ``catfish'' an Asian cousin known \n     as pangasius with similar taste, texture and whiskers. But \n     that failed to curb American enthusiasm for the cheaper \n     foreign creature, which is common in fish sticks and often \n     called ``basa'' or ``swai'' on menus. So in 2003 Washington \n     slapped tariffs on the Vietnamese fish, claiming they were \n     ``dumped'' into the U.S. market at unfairly low prices.\n       That didn't work either, so Mississippi Republican Thad \n     Cochran slipped a provision into the 2008 farm bill to \n     transfer regulatory\n\n[[Page S3019]]\n\n     responsibility over catfish, including pangasius, to the U.S. \n     Department of Agriculture from the Food and Drug \n     Administration. The pretext was public health, but pangasius \n     posed no risk, and the USDA regulates meat and poultry, not \n     fish. The real aim was to raise costs for Vietnamese \n     exporters and drive them from the U.S. market.\n       Thus was born one of Washington's most wasteful programs, \n     which the Government Accountability Office has criticized \n     nine times and estimated to have cost $30 million to start, \n     plus $14 million a year to operate--as opposed to the \n     $700,000 annual cost of the original inspection regime. This \n     is ``everything that's wrong about the food-safety system,'' \n     said former FDA food-safety czar David Acheson recently. \n     ``It's food politics. It's not public health.''\n       Pangasius imports continue for now as the USDA sets up its \n     expensive new office, with the fish passing cod and crab last \n     year to become America's sixth most-popular. (Shrimp is \n     first.) Meanwhile, Vietnam has threatened to respond to a ban \n     by demanding the right to retaliate against U.S. beef, \n     soybeans and other products as part of TPP negotiations and \n     suing the World Trade Organization, where it would probably \n     win.\n       Most Members of Congress understand the damage, but Mr. \n     Cochran has used his seniority to block repeal. The latest \n     effort at repeal, sponsored by John McCain and nine other \n     Republicans and Democrats, could get a vote when the Senate \n     reconsiders the trade-promotion bill, then would have to go \n     through the House. Ending catfish protectionism would be a \n     sign that at least some in Washington are serious about free \n     trade.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe aforementioned Wall Street Journal editorial.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 14, 2015]\n\n                     Congress's Catfish Trade Scam\n\n       Senate Democrats dealt a blow to economic growth Tuesday by \n     refusing to advance the trade-promotion bill needed to \n     complete the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact (TPP).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record an article dated June 27, 2014, entitled ``U.S. Catfish \nProgram Could Stymie Pacific Trade Pact, 10 Nations Say''; a letter by \nJim Bacchus dated May 14, 2015; a letter dated May 13, 2015, from the \nNational Taxpayers Union, Taxpayers for Common Sense, Taxpayers \nProtection Alliance, and Council for Citizens Against Government Waste, \nall of them urging Congress to repeal the catfish program in TPA; a \nletter dated May 14, 2015, from the National Restaurant Association; \nand a letter dated April 22, 2015, from the Vietnamese Ambassador to \nthe Senate Finance Committee.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 27, 2014]\n\n  U.S. Catfish Program Could Stymie Pacific Trade Pact, 10 Nations Say\n\n                             (By Ron Nixon)\n\n       Washington.--Ten Asian and Pacific nations have told the \n     Office of the United States Trade Representative that the \n     Agriculture Department's catfish inspection program violates \n     international law, and their objections could hamper Obama \n     administration efforts to reach a major Pacific trade \n     agreement by the end of next year.\n       They say that the inspection program is a trade barrier \n     erected under the guise of a food safety measure and that it \n     violates the United States' obligations under World Trade \n     Organization agreements. Among the countries protesting are \n     Vietnam and Malaysia, which are taking part in talks for the \n     trade agreement--known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership--and \n     have the ability to derail or hold up those negotiations.\n       The complaints are outlined in a May 28 letter signed by \n     diplomats from the 10 countries. The letter does not threaten \n     retaliation, but it emphasizes that the American catfish \n     program stood in the way of the trade talks.\n       Vietnam, a major catfish producer, has long complained \n     about the program, but it has never before won international \n     support for its fight. Several of the countries whose \n     representatives signed the letter--including the Philippines, \n     Myanmar, Thailand and Indonesia--do not have catfish \n     industries to protect and are not involved in the trans-\n     Pacific trade talks.\n       But the letter expresses the concern that the inspection \n     program could lead the Agriculture Department to expand its \n     ability to regulate seafood exports to the United States, \n     catfish or not.\n       ``Many of these countries are looking to see what happens \n     to Vietnam on the catfish issues, and what precedents it \n     might set for other trade deals in the region,'' said Jeffrey \n     J. Schott, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for \n     International Economics in Washington and the co-author of a \n     book on the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The United States and \n     11 countries on both sides of the Pacific--as well as \n     Australia, New Zealand and Brunei--are still negotiating the \n     trade pact, which has been repeatedly delayed over various \n     disputes.\n       The Vietnam Association of Seafood Exporters and Producers \n     recently hired James Bacchus, a former chairman of the World \n     Trade Organization's appeals panel, to prepare a possible \n     legal challenge to the catfish inspection program.\n       Mr. Bacchus said in an interview that only governments have \n     standing to bring a case before the trade organization, but \n     that the export group was working closely with Vietnamese \n     officials to monitor the catfish inspection program.\n       ``I'm confident that Vietnam would have a case before the \n     W.T.O. if they decided to bring one,'' said Mr. Bacchus, a \n     former United States House member from Florida who is now a \n     lawyer with Greenberg Traurig in Washington.\n       The inspection program was inserted into the 2008 farm bill \n     at the urging of catfish farmers, who have been hurt by \n     competition from both Vietnam and China and by the rising \n     cost of catfish feed. The domestic catfish industry has \n     shrunk by about 60 percent since its peak about a decade ago, \n     and in the past few years about 20 percent of American \n     catfish farming operations have closed.\n       The catfish industry and lawmakers led by Senator Thad \n     Cochran, Republican of Mississippi, fought for the new \n     office, saying it was needed to protect Americans from eating \n     fish raised in unsanitary conditions or contaminated with \n     drugs. The Food and Drug Administration has a similar \n     program, but it inspects less than 2 percent of food imports, \n     and advocates of the Agriculture Department program said that \n     was not good enough.\n       The Agriculture Department has traditionally inspected meat \n     and poultry, while the F.D.A. has been responsible for all \n     other foods, including seafood.\n       Agriculture Department inspections are more stringent than \n     those conducted by the F.D.A. The Agriculture Department also \n     requires nations that export beef, pork and poultry to the \n     United States to set up inspections that are equivalent to \n     the agency's program--an expensive and burdensome regulation \n     that Vietnam says is unnecessary for catfish. A Government \n     Accountability Office report in May 2012 called imported \n     catfish a low-risk food and said an Agriculture Department \n     inspection program would ``not enhance the safety of \n     catfish.''\n       The Agriculture Department said it had spent $20 million \n     since 2009 to set up its office, which has a staff of four, \n     although it has yet to inspect a single catfish. The \n     department said it expected to spend about $14 million a year \n     to run the program; the F.D.A., by comparison, spends about \n     $700,000 annually on its existing seafood inspection office.\n       Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and other \n     critics say the Agriculture Department program is a waste of \n     money, and Mr. McCain sponsored an amendment in the latest \n     farm bill that would have killed the program. But the measure \n     was never brought up for a vote. The Obama administration has \n     also called for eliminating the Agriculture Department \n     program.\n\n[[Page S3020]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                                     May 14, 2015.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Senate Majority Leader.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Senate Minority Leader.\n       Senators McConnell and Reid: As the Senate considers Trade \n     Promotion Authority, Trade Adjustment Assistance, and related \n     legislation, I wanted to make certain that you have the facts \n     about the USDA Catfish Inspection Program and its \n     implications for the United States in the world trading \n     system. In particular, I want to make sure you are aware that \n     the United States would face a daunting challenge in \n     defending the catfish rule.\n       As background, I am a former Member of Congress, from \n     Florida; a former international trade negotiator for the \n     United States; and the former Chairman of the Appellate \n     Body--the chief judge--for the World Trade Organization. In \n     nearly a decade of service to the Members of the WTO as one \n     of the seven founding judges on the highest global tribunal \n     for world trade, from 1995 through 2003, I judged many of the \n     most notable WTO trade disputes and wrote the legal opinions \n     in many of the WTO trade judgments on issues relating to \n     numerous aspects of both agricultural trade and food safety. \n     Currently, I chair the global practice of the Greenberg \n     Traurig law firm, for which I am writing in my capacity as \n     counsel to the National Fisheries Institute.\n       As you will recall, the 2008 and 2014 Farm Bills contained \n     language that would shift inspection of catfish from the Food \n     and Drug Administration (FDA) to the United States Department \n     of Agriculture's Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS). FDA \n     currently regulates all seafood, and FSIS regulates beef, \n     pork, and poultry. Supporters of the transfer of jurisdiction \n     have reassured Senators that the USDA program would not \n     create a problem for the United States under WTO rules \n     because imported catfish would be subject to the same \n     standards as American catfish.\n       This is not so. The legal test of whether a measure, as \n     written or as applied, is consistent with WTO obligations is \n     not whether it imposes the same standard on like domestic and \n     imported products. The legal test in the WTO is whether such \n     a measure, as written or as applied, denies an equal \n     competitive opportunity to the like imported products in the \n     domestic marketplace. The catfish measure promises to fail \n     this fundamental legal test under international law.\n       It is not my intent here to list the entire catalogue of \n     claims that would be likely to be brought against the United \n     States in a ease in WTO dispute settlement by Vietnam and \n     possibly by other affected Members of the WTO following \n     implementation of the catfish measure by the USDA. There will \n     be more than ample opportunity for doing so later in Geneva \n     if the catfish measure is not repealed.\n       Suffice it to say that, if the catfish measure is not \n     repealed, and if it is implemented by USDA as currently \n     contemplated, quite a few strong claims could very likely be \n     made in WTO dispute settlement by the affected trading \n     partners of the United States under both the General \n     Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (the GATT) and the Agreement \n     on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures \n     (the SPS Agreement), which are both part of the overall WTO \n     treaty.\n       Because WTO litigation is intensely fact-specific, and \n     requires painstaking and extensive development and analysis \n     of the measures being challenged, I am always reluctant to \n     express a definitive opinion about a potential WTO case. \n     Having judged so many WTO cases, I am less inclined than \n     others to predict their outcome. This case, however, stands \n     out for the egregiousness of its inconsistencies with WTO \n     obligations. Quite rightly, the Congressional Research \n     Service has quoted approvingly a Wall Street Journal opinion \n     article that described the treatment of Vietnamese catfish in \n     this measure as ``protectionism at its worst.''\n       Nothing good can result for the United States from applying \n     the catfish measure.\n       Continuing with the implementation of the catfish measure \n     would further complicate the efforts of US trade negotiators \n     to secute significant concessions from Vietnam and others on \n     other issues of considerable importance to US businesses and \n     workers in the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n       Losing a WTO case that challenged the catfish measure \n     would, if the United States chose not to comply with the WTO \n     ruling, give the complaining countries the right to retaliate \n     against American agricultural and other products bound for \n     their markets.\n       Perhaps worst of all for the United States would be winning \n     a WTO case that challenged the catfish measure.\n       The United States has a long and contentious history of \n     trying to overcome European and Asian trade barriers to our \n     agricultural and food products that are justified as ``food \n     safety'' measures but are in fact intended to block entirely \n     safe American food exports. For this reason, the United \n     States has long been the leading advocate for a strong SPS \n     agreement that ensures that food safety measures will be \n     based on real scientific evidence, including a serious risk \n     assessment.\n       If Congress continues to mandate the transfer of \n     jurisdiction over catfish, it will not only be inviting a WTO \n     challenge to the rule; it will be giving other nations an \n     opening to enact ``copycat legislation'' which will further \n     disadvantage our exports. Moreover, if the United States \n     somehow prevails in defending the catfish measure in a WTO \n     case, it will truly be ``open season'' in the rest of the \n     world for new restrictions on US agricultural exports of all \n     kinds.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    James Bacchus,\n     Chair, Global Practice.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     May 13, 2015.\n       Dear Senator McCain: The undersigned groups representing \n     millions of taxpayers and allied educational bodies write in \n     support of your efforts to repeal the duplicative catfish \n     inspection program at the United States Department of \n     Agriculture (USDA) in S. 995, the Bipartisan Congressional \n     Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015. The \n     undersigned groups have been vocal critics of the catfish \n     inspection program that has spent $20 million over four years \n     and not inspected a single fish. The Government \n     Accountability Office has nine times listed the program as \n     ``wasteful and duplicative;'' and it is one that the former \n     Chief Judge of the highest court of international trade says \n     will result in not just a trade war but also a lawsuit the \n     U.S. will lose. Right now the program is on track to spend \n     $15 million annually for the USDA to do a job the FDA is \n     already doing.\n       Specifically on the issue of trade, according to an April \n     24, 2012 bipartisan letter to Senate Agriculture, Nutrition & \n     Forestry Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), ``And beyond \n     the fiscal implications, the catfish program has caused \n     considerable concern among trade experts. According to them, \n     the program would create a discriminatory de facto ban on \n     exports from key trading partners and expose us to \n     retaliation. . . . We are aware that no scientific data that \n     catfish, imported or domestic, pose any greater food safety \n     risk than other farmed seafood--all of which will remain \n     under FDA regulation.''\n       Eliminating the duplicative USDA catfish inspection office \n     was agreed to by voice vote in the 2013 Senate farm bill \n     debate, yet inexplicably the Senate was never granted an \n     opportunity to debate the merits of including this program in \n     the 2014 farm bill. But now with Trade Promotion Authority, \n     there is an opportunity to finally implement the will of the \n     Senate and end the duplicative waste that the USDA catfish \n     inspection program has continued to foster. We support your \n     efforts to repeal the program restoring some measure of \n     fiscal discipline and we urge your colleagues in the Senate \n     to do the same.\n           Sincerely,\n       Council for Citizens Against Government Waste, National \n     Taxpayers Union, Taxpayers for Common Sense, Taxpayers \n     Protection Alliance.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              National Restaurant Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 14, 2015.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the National Restaurant \n     Association, I strongly urge you to support the bipartisan \n     McCain-Shaheen catfish amendment to the Senate's pending \n     trade related legislation. This amendment supports our \n     nation's businesses, farmers, customers and taxpayers by \n     removing funding for the duplicative U.S. Department of \n     Agriculture (USDA) catfish inspection program.\n       During the 2008 Farm Bill Conference, language was added to \n     transfer the responsibility for catfish inspections from the \n     Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to the USDA.\n       The USDA has already spent $20 million drafting regulations \n     and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) estimates that \n     the USDA will spend $170 million over the next decade \n     implementing the program. The GAO also found that \n     implementation of the USDA catfish program will cost American \n     taxpayers millions annually to provide a duplicative service \n     because the FDA currently inspects all seafood, including \n     catfish. Every U.S. facility that processes, handles, or \n     distributes catfish would now be subject to duplicative \n     regulation by both FDA and USDA.\n       As members of the foodservice industry, we are committed to \n     food safety. However, this new program would provide no \n     benefit. In fact, the USDA itself has stated that its Food \n     Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) would not provide additional \n     food safety protection. The Agency's cost-benefit analysis \n     also found no significant safety benefit in creating the \n     program.\n       Finally, implementation of this program could strongly \n     impact U.S. agricultural relations with key trading partners. \n     This program would create a potential trade barrier to \n     catfish imports and could violate the World Trade \n     Organization Sanitary and Phyto-Sanitary agreement. It could \n     also make U.S. agricultural exports susceptible to trade \n     retaliation.\n       For these reasons, we encourage you to help our nation's \n     businesses, farmers, customers and taxpayers by supporting \n     the bipartisan McCain-Shaheen amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n     Matt Walker,\n       Vice President, Government Affairs, National Restaurant \n     Association.\n     Laura Abshire,\n       Director of Sustainability & Government Affairs, National \n     Restaurant Association.\n\n[[Page S3021]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                                   The Ambassador,\n\n\n                                           Embassy of Vietnam,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 22, 2015.\n     Hon.

In fact, the USDA itself has stated that \n     its Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) would not provide \n     additional food safety protection.\n       Finally, implementation of this program could strongly \n     impact U.S. agricultural relations with key trading partners.\n\n  The Taxpayers Protection Alliance:\n\n       We support your efforts to repeal the program restoring \n     some measure of fiscal discipline and we urge your colleagues \n     in the Senate to do the same.\n\n  Mr. President, I understand that the parliamentary situation is that \nwe have a number of pending amendments and that probably it is very \nlikely that a cloture motion will be filed. That, of course, would then \nmean I would not be allowed to have this amendment.\n  If we do not allow this amendment, I have to say that we will be \nreally showing a degree of contempt and arrogance for the taxpayers of \nAmerica. I have watched this program and this incredible--I have seen \n$14 million wasted. I have seen an example of protectionism.\n  I was told in the last bill on agriculture that I would receive a \nvote on my amendment. All I am asking for is a straight up-or-down vote \nso we can save the taxpayers $14 million, $20 million, $30 million, $40 \nmillion on a program that is both wasteful and not needed.\n  I understand my colleagues from Mississippi and other Southern States \nwant to protect their catfish industry, which I have enjoyed many \nsamples of over the years. I do not understand the rationale for \ncontinuing--particularly under conditions of sequestration--any program \nthat costs the taxpayers unending millions of dollars per year.\n  I urge my colleagues to demand a vote. All I am asking for is an up-\nor-down vote on an amendment that is clearly relevant to the \nconsideration of this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I want to add my support to the amendment \nSenator McCain has just spoken to and my colleague from New Hampshire, \nSenator Shaheen.\n  Absolutely we should have a vote on eliminating this duplicative \ninspection of catfish, what the Wall Street Journal is calling one of \nWashington's most wasteful programs, calling it the catfish scam.\n  In fact, we had testimony before the small business committee the \nother day, and I asked the representative of the FDA whether we need \nduplicative inspections of catfish because right now the FDA is \ninspecting catfish for $700,000 a year, and this duplicative inspection \nof it is estimated to cost over $14 million a year. In fact, there was \nalready a study done by the National Fisheries Institute that the USDA \nhad spent more than $20 million to have a duplicative inspection \nregime. As Senator McCain mentioned, there are nine GAO reports about \nthe fact that we are wasting taxpayer dollars on a duplicative \ninspection regime that we should eliminate.\n  The fact that we cannot get a vote on the Senate floor on such a \nwasteful use of taxpayer dollars--this is why people get frustrated \nwith Washington when it is sitting right before us, and it is so \nobvious that we should not waste their money when we already have a \nperfectly good inspection regime that costs so much less versus this \nadded inspection regime, which in the end is going to hurt jobs across \nthis country, including jobs in New Hampshire, because it is going to \ncreate not only a duplicative program that wastes taxpayer dollars that \ncommon sense would tell us we should have a vote to eliminate, but it \nis also going to eliminate the opportunity for trade. The free-trade \nagreements that are currently being negotiated could mean over 8,200 \njobs in my State.\n\n  James Bacchus, the former chief judge on the highest international \ntribunal of world trade and former Member of Congress, said this \nprogram will result not just in a trade war but also a lawsuit, and the \nUnited States will lose. Not only will we lose taxpayer dollars by not \nhaving a vote on this program and wasting money, but we will also \ncreate an unnecessary trade barrier that could impede future trade \nagreements and American jobs that can be created.\n  I offer my support for this amendment, and I do believe we should \nhave a vote on this amendment. Why wouldn't we have a vote on a program \nthat has demonstrated--by nine GAO reports--it has wasted millions of \ndollars which could otherwise be used to pay down our debt or put to \ngood use in programs that are worthwhile. Yet here we are. We cannot \neven get a vote.\n  I share my colleague's concern. I thank Senator McCain and Senator \nShaheen for bringing this important amendment forward, and I hope we \nwill have a vote to eliminate the wasteful money going into the USDA \ninspection regime of catfish.\n  How many times do we need our catfish inspected? It is absurd and \ntime to end this waste and quit wasting taxpayer dollars.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds). The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I understand that Senator Wyden has \npriority recognition at this time. I have been informed he does not \nobject to me entering into the debate at this moment.\n  May I proceed on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. WICKER. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, there are a couple of objectives this McCain amendment \nwould accomplish. For one thing, it was in the 2008 farm bill. The \ncurrent move to change the inspection from the FDA to the Department of \nAgriculture is in the current farm bill, and it is about to take place, \nso it would revisit the last two farm bills. I do not think we should \nbe doing that in a trade promotion authority piece of legislation. \nAlso, it is absolutely not duplicative. It can be said on the floor of \nthe Senate 100 times, but the fact is that the USDA Catfish Inspection \nProgram is not duplicative. It transfers inspection from the FDA to the \nUSDA and the USDA has testified before Congress that when the program \nis operational, as it is about to be, the FDA program would be \neliminated.\n  Why move it from the FDA to the USDA? Here is the reason: There are a \nfew of us--under controlled situations--who grow most of the catfish \nthat is produced in the United States on farms, including the State of \nMississippi and the State of Arkansas.\n  My distinguished colleagues from Arkansas and Mississippi will speak \non this issue in a few moments, I hope.\n  This is about food safety for Americans in 50 States who deserve to \nknow that the fish they are eating--the product they are eating--is \nunadulterated.\n  Here are the facts: Under the current FDA program, only about 2 \npercent of the billions of pounds of imported catfish are inspected--\nonly about 2 percent. The other 98 percent of this large\n\n[[Page S3022]]\n\nquantity come in uninspected. Now, that gives me pause as a consumer. \nIt should give residents of all 50 States pause that 98 percent of the \ncatfish which comes into our country is not inspected.\n  Here is what we do know about the 2 percent we look at under the FDA \nprogram: An alarming volume of the catfish inspected by the FDA already \nfailed to meet standards. They failed to meet consumer safety \nstandards. Many overseas productions are simply not operated under the \nsanitary conditions that we insist upon in the United States with our \nfarm-raised catfish.\n  The FDA program does not ensure that trade partners have sufficient \nhealth standards nor does it inspect any overseas agriculture \noperations. They don't go over to Vietnam and look at the operations \nthere and see the safety standards that cause the health risks.\n  What kind of health risks are we talking about? We are talking about \ncancer. I have in my hand a page from a draft rule by the Department of \nAgriculture, dated February 10, 2009. This is a draft rule from the \nFood Safety and Inspection Service. It turns out--and the GAO has been \nmentioned here--that the GAO got OMB to ask the FSIS to rework this \nstatement and make it a little softer so we would not go so hard on \nimported Vietnamese catfish.\n  Here is what the Department of Agriculture report, which has now been \nburied, says as to whether or not the Agency used random or risk-based \nsamplings: Applying the Food Safety Inspection Service program to \nimported catfish yielded a reduction of approximately 175,000 lifetime \ncancers for Americans--I want that kind of reduction from carcinogens \ncoming into the United States--and 0.79 percent acute toxicities. Using \nrandom sampling in the Agency's program yielded a reduction of 91.8 \nmillion exposures to antimicrobials and 23.28 million heavy metal \nexposures. We are talking about carcinogens, we are talking about \nimproper antimicrobials that the USDA program would catch, and over 23 \nmillion exposures to heavy metals that we don't need in the United \nStates. Using risk-based sampling yielded a reduction of 95.1 million \nexposures to antimicrobials.\n  We are talking about a program that is not going to be duplicative \nbecause it is going to move--according to the last two farm bills--from \nthe FDA to the USDA. This excessive government waste we have heard \nabout will not exist, but we will have better safety for the consumers \nof the United States of America. That is why we do not need to revisit \nthis issue, and that is why the McCain amendment should be rejected. \nThat is why we should take every precaution we can to protect the \nAmerican consumer, whether in their home kitchens or restaurants.\n  I yield the floor. Perhaps other of my colleagues would like to \naddress this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Senate has made clear the authority \nof the U.S. Department of Agriculture for imported catfish inspections. \nIt has been debated and resolved in two previous farm bills; first, in \n2008 and again in 2014. The USDA catfish inspection is about protecting \nthe health and safety of American consumers. The 2008 and 2014 farm \nbills required catfish inspection responsibilities to be transferred \nfrom the Food and Drug Administration to the USDA Food Safety and \nInspection Service upon publication of final regulations.\n  The need for this regulatory clarification is clear: American \nconsumers could be exposed to dangerous chemicals and unapproved drugs \nin the imported catfish they eat. According to the Government \nAccountability Office, about half of the seafood imported into the \nUnited States comes from farm-raised fish. Fish grown in confined areas \nhave been shown to contain bacterial infections. The FDA's oversight \nprogram to ensure the safety of imported seafood from residues of \nunapproved drugs is limited, especially as compared with the practices \nof other developed countries.\n  According to the Department of Agriculture and other Federal \nagencies, the Food and Drug Administration inspects only 1 percent of \nall imported seafood products. This is just not acceptable. The U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, on the other hand, inspects 100 percent of \nfarm-raised meat products that enter the country, which illustrates why \nthe Department of Agriculture is the appropriate Agency for farm-raised \ncatfish inspections.\n  Following enactment of the catfish mandate in the 2008 farm bill, the \nDepartment of Agriculture conducted risk assessments on the dangers of \nexposure to foreign agriculture drugs and determined that moving \ncatfish inspections under the USDA inspection system would result in a \nreduction of 175,000 lifetime cancers, 95 million exposures to \nantimicrobials, and 23 million heavy metal exposures.\n  The Catfish Inspection Program will enhance consumer safety but will \nnot result in duplication activities by U.S. government agencies. Upon \nissuance of final regulations, catfish inspection responsibilities will \nbe transferred to and not shared with the Department of Agriculture.\n  In order to address perceived concerns regarding duplication, a \nprovision was included in the 2014 farm bill that required the FDA and \nUSDA to enter into a memorandum of understanding to establish clear \njurisdictional boundaries.\n  We consider that this is a time to resolve this issue and put this \nmatter to rest. International equivalence is a concept that originated \nwith the WTO and is regarded as a way to encourage the development of \ninternational food safety standards and will help this issue to be \nbalanced fairly among all Members and facilitate our trade with other \ncountries.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Portman-\nStabenow amendment.\n  First, I wish to say a word in support of the efforts by Senator \nCochran and Senator Wicker. I was a partner with Senator Cochran in the \n2014 farm bill. I support their position as it relates to the catfish \nprovision. Hopefully, we will be able to retain that provision.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1299\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nHirono as a cosponsor of amendment No. 1299.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a letter dated September 23, 2013, signed by 60 U.S. \nSenators, that calls on the administration to include strong and \nenforceable currency provisions in all future trade agreements.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 23, 2013.\n     Secretary Jack Lew,\n     Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC.\n     Ambassador Michael Froman,\n     Office of the United States Trade Representative, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Secretary Lew and Ambassador Froman: We agree with the \n     Administration's stated goal that the Trans-Pacific \n     Partnership (TPP) has ``high standards worthy of a 21st \n     century trade agreement.'' To achieve this, however, we think \n     it is necessary to address one of the 21st century's most \n     serious trade problems: foreign currency manipulation.\n       Currency is the medium through which trade occurs and \n     exchange rates determine its comparative value. It is as \n     important to trade outcomes as is the quality of the goods or \n     services traded. Currency manipulation can negate or greatly \n     reduce the benefits of a free trade agreement and may have a \n     devastating impact on American companies and workers.\n       A study by the Peterson Institute for International \n     Economics found that foreign currency manipulation has \n     already cost between one and five million American jobs. A \n     free trade agreement purporting to increase trade, but \n     failing to address foreign currency manipulation, could lead \n     to a permanent unfair trade relationship that further harms \n     the United States economy.\n       As the United States negotiates TPP and all future free \n     trade agreements, we ask that you include strong and \n     enforceable foreign currency manipulation disciplines to \n     ensure these agreements meet the ``high standards'' our \n     country, America's companies, and America's workers deserve.\n           Sincerely,\n       Lindsey Graham; Rob Portman; Debbie Stabenow; Ron Wyden; \n     Jeff Merkley; Christopher Murphy; John Boozman; Elizabeth \n     Warren; Al Franken; Jay Rockefeller; Barbara A.

Mr. President, before speaking specifically to our \namendment, I wish also to indicate that there are a number of very \nimportant amendments coming before us in this open debate process. I am \npleased we have a number of amendments pending that, hopefully, will be \noffered and voted on that relate to other very important topics.\n  One of those topics is an amendment currently pending offered by \nSenator Brown. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of that amendment. It \nwill clarify the process for new countries to join the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership and to ensure that additional countries, including China, \ncannot join the agreement without congressional approval. So I hope we \nwill get a vote on that amendment, which is certainly part of this \nwhole discussion on currency manipulation when we look at Asia, when we \nlook at Japan now, and when we look at China. This is an important \namendment.\n  I also wish to indicate that I have terrific respect for the chairman \nof the Finance Committee. I wish to address an amendment that I believe \nwill be offered as a side-by-side to the Portman-Stabenow amendment. I \nurge colleagues to reject what is essentially nothing more than a \nrewrite of pretty much the same weak language that exists in the \nunderlying bill. It changes some words around. It basically would not \nput us on record as 60 Members of the Senate to make sure we have \nenforceable currency provisions in this trade agreement moving forward.\n  At this point in time, when we look at currency manipulation, it is \nthe most significant 21st century trade barrier there is. To quote the \nvice president of international government affairs for Ford Motor \nCompany in the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       Currency manipulation is the mother of all trade barriers. \n     We can compete with any car manufacturer in the world, but we \n     can't compete with the Bank of Japan.\n\n  We want our businesses and we want our workers to have a level \nplaying field in a global economy. When we are giving instructions--\nwhen we are giving up the right to amend the Trans-Pacific Partnership \nthrough this fast-track process involving 40 percent of the global \neconomy--we have the right and obligation to make sure we have a \nnegotiating principle in there. We are not mandating exactly what it \nlooks like. We are just applying a negotiating principle that addresses \nthe No. 1 trade barrier right now to American businesses, which is \ncurrency manipulation. By some estimates, it has cost the United States \n5 million jobs. If we don't address it in this reasonable way, it will \ncost us millions more.\n  Our people, our workers, and our businesses are the best in the \nworld. We know that, but they have to have a level playing field. \nCurrency manipulation is cheating--plain and simple. A strong U.S. \ndollar against a weak foreign currency, particularly one that is \nartificially weak due to government manipulation, means that foreign \nproducts are cheaper here and U.S. products are more expensive there.\n  One U.S. automaker estimates the weak yen gives Japanese competitors \nan advantage of anywhere from $6,000 to $11,000 in the price of a car, \nnot because of anything they are doing other than cheating by \nmanipulating their currency. It is hard to compete with those kinds of \nnumbers: $6,000 to $11,000 difference in the price of an automobile. At \none point it was calculated that one of the Japanese company's entire \nprofit on a vehicle was coming from currency manipulation.\n  Frankly, this is not about competing between--the U.S. going into \nJapan--that has also been a red herring. It is about the United States \nand Japan competing against each other in a global economy for the \nbusiness of the developing countries. For instance, we are talking \nabout Brazil having 200 million people. We are competing for that \nbusiness. India has a population of 1.2 billion people. We are \ncompeting--Japan and the United States--for everything in between, \neverything else. That is what this is about, and it is about whether \nthey are going to continue to be able to cheat.\n  Also, it is not just the auto industry. It is other manufacturers, as \nwell. This is also about companies that are making washing machines or \nall kinds of equipment or refrigerators and all of the other products \nthat we make and create using good middle-class jobs here in America.\n  It also affects agriculture. Anything that impacts the distortions in \nthe economy affects agriculture and every other part of the economy.\n  So what we are asking for is something very simple and \nstraightforward--very simple--which is that just as we have negotiating \nobjectives in the TPA fast-track for the environment, for labor \nstandards, and for intellectual property rights, we should have a \nnegotiating objective that is enforceable regarding currency \nmanipulation. We are not suggesting what that would look like in a \ntrade agreement, any more than we are specifying exactly what the other \nprovisions would look like. We are saying it is important enough that \nif we are giving up our right to amend a trade agreement--we are giving \nfast-track authority--currency manipulation is the No. 1 trade \ndistortion, trade barrier right now in terms of the global marketplace, \nso we should make sure there is a negotiating principle there. We also \nsay that it is consistent with existing International Monetary Fund \ncommitments and it does not affect domestic monetary policy.\n  I have heard over and over that somehow what we do through the Fed is \nimpacted. That is not accurate. We are looking, in fact, at over 180 \ncountries that signed up under the International Monetary Fund, saying: \nWe won't manipulate our currency. Yet, even though that has happened--\nwe have seen, in fact, in the case of Japan, for the last 25 years, \nthey have manipulated their currency 376 times. We should say enough is \nenough.\n  Now, I also understand we are hearing from the administration. By the \nway, I am very supportive of their efforts, this current \nadministration's time on trade enforcement efforts. They have won a lot \nof excellent cases. I wish to commend them for that. I disagree with \nthem on this one position, because they are saying, first of all, that \nJapan is no longer manipulating their currency--the Bank of Japan. OK, \nfine. The administration says if we put a negotiating objective into \nfast-track authority, Japan will walk away. Why would they walk away if \nthey are not doing it anymore? Maybe they want to do it again right \nafter we sign the TPP. Maybe they will do it again, and it will be 377 \ntimes. If they aren't doing it anymore, why should they care? It makes \nno sense.\n  Either we can trust them and they are no longer manipulating their \ncurrency or we can't trust them and we need this provision. It can't be \nboth. Right now, what they are talking about makes no sense. Again, we \nare not talking about domestic policy; we are talking about direct \nintervention in foreign currency markets, and that if there is direct \nintervention in foreign currency markets, we would like to see \nmeaningful consequences that fit with the IMF definitions that \ncountries have all signed up for saying they will not manipulate their \ncurrency and that it should comply with WTO enforcement, as we do for \nevery other trade distorting policy, every other trade barrier.\n  This is actually very straightforward. I am very surprised that it \nhas not been accepted. Frankly, I would have gone further. In the \nFinance Committee I had an amendment I would love to do which says that \nTPP doesn't get fast-track authority unless it is clear that there are \nstrong, enforceable provisions on currency in the agreement. This \ndoesn't say that. This is a reasonable middle ground to say, for the \nfirst time, that currency manipulation is important, it is a \nnegotiating principle, and we leave flexibility in terms of how that is \ndesigned, just as we do with other provisions.\n  We have strong bipartisan support for this amendment. I wish to thank\n\n[[Page S3024]]\n\nSenators Brown and Warren, Senators Burr and Casey and Schumer, \nSenators Graham, Shaheen, Manchin, Klobuchar, Collins, Baldwin, Hirono, \nFranken, Menendez, and Heitkamp for understanding and supporting this \namendment. We have other support as well. I wish to thank Senator \nGraham. He made a comment, because we care deeply--we were so pleased \nto get the Schumer-Graham-Brown-Stabenow and others' efforts in the \nCustoms bill related to China and currency, which is so important and \nwhich we also need to get all the way to the President's desk. But we \nknow that if we don't put language in the negotiating document we give \nto the White House, then we are not really serious. Senator Graham \nsaid: This amendment is the real deal. That is firing with real \nbullets.\n  So if we are serious, if the 60 people who signed the letter are \nserious--and I hope and believe we are--then we need to make sure the \nnegotiating position we take is to ask--and to direct--the \nadministration to put this in the final negotiations on TPP.\n  We have, as I mentioned before, enforceable standards language on \nlabor and environment and intellectual property rights. This is not \ncomplicated. We need to make sure we are clear on currency \nmanipulation. The IMF has rules about what is and what is not direct \ncurrency manipulation. They are clear rules. There are 187 countries, \nin addition to Japan, that have already signed up saying they will \nabide by that definition. We just don't enforce it, and we have lost \nmillions of jobs. Again, Japan, after signing, has intervened--the Bank \nof Japan has intervened 376 times in the last 25 years. We are being \nasked to rely on a handshake and good-faith assurances that there won't \nbe 377 times. But we are being told if we even put language requiring a \nnegotiating principle into this document, that somehow Japan will walk \naway. This makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. We have a \nresponsibility, if we are giving up our rights to amend a document, to \namend a trade agreement. If we are giving up our rights to require a \nsupermajority vote in Congress, if we are doing that, we have a \nresponsibility to the people we represent to make sure we have given \nthe clearest possible negotiating objectives to the administration as \nto what we can expect to be in a trade agreement. That is what TPA is \nall about. If, in fact, currency manipulation is the mother of all \ntrade barriers, why in the world would we not make it clear that \ncurrency manipulation should be a clear negotiating objective for the \nUnited States of America?\n  Let me just say again that we can compete with anybody and win. Our \nworkers, our businesses, our innovation can compete with anybody and \nwin. But it is up to us in Congress, working with the White House, to \nmake sure the rules are fair. I hope colleagues will join us in passing \nthe Portman-Stabenow amendment to make it clear we understand in a \nglobal economy what is at stake and that we are going to vote on the \nside of American businesses and American workers.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/19/senate-section/article/S3024-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate the Presiding \nOfficer being my colleague from my State of Ohio.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1251\n\n  Mr. President, with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, we are considering \nthe largest trade deal in our Nation's history. Forty percent of GDP is \naffected by the Trans-Pacific Partnership. We have a responsibility to \nensure this deal does not get any bigger without congressional \napproval. That is why I am offering this amendment, the so-called \ndocking amendment, along with many of my colleagues, to prevent the \nTrans-Pacific Partnership from being a backdoor trade agreement with \nChina. What does that mean? Right now, there is nothing in this trade \nlegislation--nothing--that we are considering to prevent the People's \nRepublic of China from joining the TPP at a later date. Without a \nformal process requiring congressional input and approval for countries \nlike China to join the TPP, we might as well be talking about the China \nfree-trade agreement.\n  This amendment spells out in law a detailed, important process, step \nby step, for future TPP partners to join the agreement. It does not say \nthey cannot join; it just says here is how they join--because TPP and \nTPA seem to be silent on that.\n  Here is how it works. The President would be required to notify \nCongress of his or her intent to enter into negotiations with a country \nthat wants to join the TPP. The notice period would be 90 days. During \nthat time, the Finance Committee and the Ways and Means Committee would \nhave to vote to certify that the country considering joining the TPP is \ncapable of meeting the standards of the agreement. It would stop sort \nof backdoor Presidential authority, whether it is President Obama or \nthe next President making that decision. After that, both the Senate \nand the House would have to pass a resolution within the 90-day window \napproving that country joining the negotiations.\n  So if the President decides that he or she wants China to join these \n12 Trans-Pacific Partnership countries, the President cannot do that \nunilaterally. The President needs to go through this process and \nultimately bring it to a vote by Congress. Then the American people can \nhave their say. If it is just done unilaterally and quickly and maybe \neven kind of quietly by the President, the public would have no input. \nBut if it goes through the congressional process, the Finance Committee \nand the Ways and Means Committee--I do not think we speak to the order \nof that--the notice period would be 90 days, so the country would then \nhave 90 days to speak its mind about what we all think, we 300-some \nmillion people in this country think about this new country--not just \nChina. That is obviously the most important, the most salient, the one \nwe pay the most attention to--the second largest economy in the world. \nThe implementing bill for that country to join the TPP would be subject \nto fast-track authority only if TPA were still in effect at that time. \nThis process is vital to ensuring a public debate on what would be one \nof the most consequential economic decisions in a decade.\n  TPP, as we all know, already affects 40 percent of the world's GDP. \nIf China piggybacks on this agreement, we will be looking at a sweeping \nagreement that will encompass the two largest economies on Earth. In \nfact, it would then perhaps be three; it would be the United States, \nthen China, then Japan. A deal of that scale demands public scrutiny. A \ndeal of that scale demands congressional input. A deal of that scale \ndemands that the American public weigh in.\n  We know China already expressed interest in joining the agreement at \nthe end of last year. News reports indicate they are monitoring these \ntalks closely. Of course they are. We also know China manipulates its \ncurrency, even though Presidents Obama and Bush would not say that. We \nknow they manipulate their currency. We know China floods our market \nwith subsidized and dumped steel imports. We know China pursues an \nindustrial policy designed to undercut American manufacturing.\n  Sitting in front of me is the junior Senator from the State of \nWashington, who has worked so hard and is on this floor to make sure it \nhappens, that we reauthorize the Export-Import Bank. We know what China \nhas done there to sort of end run the United States and what the \nfailure of our doing that here would mean to even give greater \nadvantages to China.\n  Mr. President, 2016 will mark China's 15-year anniversary in the \nWorld Trade Organization. We saw what happened after Congress, in 1999, \n2000--that period--normalized trade relations with China. China became \na member of the World Trade Organization. Fifteen years ago, our trade \ndeficit with China was not much more than $15 billion a year. Today, \nour trade deficit with China is $25 billion a month. So it went\n\n[[Page S3025]]\n\nfrom $15 billion to a factor of $300 billion--all in the space of 15 \nyears. Think about that.\n  We know what Presidents over time have said about trade deficits--\nthat when we have a trade deficit of $1 billion, what that means for \nlost jobs. It means we are buying $1 billion worth of goods more than \nwe are selling to that country. Every day with China, we buy $1 billion \nmore of goods--every day almost $1 billion--$900 million, roughly, more \nthan we sell to China every day. We know what that means on job loss. \nWe are not making it in the United States. They will make it in China. \nThe workers in China are making it, not the workers in the United \nStates. So that trade gap with China represents a huge percentage of \nour total U.S. trade deficit. Meanwhile, China continues to thwart the \nrules with impunity.\n  We have focused on integrating China into the international system--\nsomething we want to do--but we only hope it will comply with the rules \nwe should follow. We give China chance after chance, pushing for \nincreased engagement. China continues to play by its own rules. \nCurrency manipulation is a good example.\n  I appreciate the Presiding Officer's work on that issue, on currency \nmanipulation. That should be voted on in this body in the next, I \nassume, 48 years.\n  Year after year, the U.S. Treasury says China's currency is \nsignificantly undervalued. Year after year, we give China a chance--\nanother chance, another chance--to change its monetary policy, but we \nwill not call China a currency manipulator. President Bush would not do \nit. President Obama would not do it. Up to 5 million American workers \nhave lost their jobs. Our trade deficit has grown by hundreds of \nbillions of dollars due to currency manipulation.\n  We have clear evidence that China disregards international trade \nlaws. Why would we think it would be any different if they get a \nbackdoor entry into the Trans-Pacific Partnership? That is why we \ncannot allow TPP to become a backdoor way to pass a free-trade \nagreement with China without a vote in Congress.\n  I know Senator Menendez has raised these concerns for a while. I \nappreciate that support and the support of our other cosponsors on this \nissue.\n  This amendment is not a poison pill. All this amendment does is \nclarify the process for new countries to join the TPP, should it pass. \nIt does not say we cannot bring in new countries. It does say that \nCongress has to vote on it. Congressional approval is not required for \nadditional non-Communist countries to join WTO agreements after the \nUnited States enters into them. We need this amendment to prevent that \nsame so-called docking process from being used with the TPP. China and \nthose countries like China that are not market economies are \ndifferently structured economies, different kinds of countries. We are \nnot saying: No, never. You cannot enter into the TPP. We are simply \nsaying Congress should have a say in it and, most importantly, the \npublic should be able to speak out on this and have a period of time to \ntalk to their Members of Congress.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in adopting this critical amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President----\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nSenator Warren's remarks, I be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I want to start by saying thank you to Senator Brown for his \nextraordinary leadership on this issue and his determination that \nvoices be heard around this country on this trade debate, that the \npeople who are actually affected be heard from. I say thank you very \nmuch to Senator Brown for all he has done here.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1327\n\n  Mr. President, I join with Senator Heitkamp, Senator Manchin, and a \nnumber of other Senators to propose a simple change to the fast-track \nbill, a change that would prevent Congress from using this expedited \nprocess on any trade deal that includes so-called investor-state \ndispute settlement provisions. I come to the floor to urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n\n  ISDS is an obscure process that allows big companies to go to \ncorporate-friendly arbitration panels that sit outside any court system \nin order to challenge laws they don't like. These panels can force \ntaxpayers to write huge checks to those big corporations, with no need \nto file a suit in court, no appeals, and no judicial review.\n  Most Americans don't think the minimum wage or antismoking \nregulations are trade barriers, but a foreign corporation used ISDS to \nsue Egypt after Egypt raised its minimum wage. Tobacco giant Philip \nMorris went after Australia and Uruguay to stop their rules to cut \nsmoking rates. Under the TPP, corporations can use these corporate-\nfriendly panels to challenge rules right here in America.\n  It wasn't always this way. ISDS has been around for a while, and from \n1959 to 2002 there were fewer than 100 claims in the whole world. But, \nboy, has that changed. In 2012 alone, there were 58 cases. Corporate \nlawyers have started figuring out just how powerful a tool these panels \ncan be for corporate clients. The huge financial penalties that these \ncases can impose on taxpayers have already caused New Zealand to give \nup on some tough antismoking rules. It has already caused Germany to \npull back from clean water protections, and it has caused Canada to \nstand down on environmental protections.\n  If that worries you, you are not alone. Experts from all over the \npolitical spectrum--conservatives and liberals, economists and legal \nscholars on the left and the right, opponents of trade deals and \nsupporters of trade deals--have all argued that these corporate-\nfriendly panels should be dropped from our future trade deals.\n  Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that we should not \ngive ``investors the power to sue foreign governments to weaken their \nenvironmental and public health rules.''\n  Nobel Prize-winning economist Joe Stiglitz, Harvard law professor \nLaurence Tribe, and other top American legal experts noted that ``the \nthreat and expense of ISDS proceedings have forced nations to abandon \nimportant public policies'' and that ``laws and regulations enacted by \ndemocratically elected officials are put at risk in a process insulated \nfrom democratic input.''\n  The head of the trade policy program at the conservative CATO \nInstitute has said that ISDS ``raises serious questions about \ndemocratic accountability, sovereignty, checks and balances, and the \nseparation of powers''--concerns that ``libertarians and other free \nmarket advocates should share.''\n  ISDS is a major part of the reason why, no matter what promises are \nmade, huge trade deals often just tilt the playing field further in \nfavor of big multinational corporations. If a country wants to adopt \nstrong new protections for workers, such as an increase in the minimum \nwage, a corporation can use these corporate-friendly panels to seek \nmillions--or billions--in taxpayer compensation because the new rules \nmight eat into the company's profits.\n  But, boy, it doesn't work in the other direction. If a country wants \nto undermine worker rights by allowing child labor or slave labor or \npaying workers pennies an hour, there is no special worker-friendly \nprocess for challenging that. Instead, advocates for workers are stuck \nbegging their governments to bring enforcement actions and protect \ntheir rights. That process can take years, if the government responds \nat all. In fact, just yesterday my office released a 15-page report \ndetailing how for decades both Republican and Democratic Presidents \nmade the same promises over and over and over again about how good \nthese deals would be for workers, and both Republican and Democratic \nPresidents failed to enforce the labor standards promises in those \ntrade agreements.\n  Giving corporations special rights to challenge our laws outside our \nlegal system is a terrible idea. Experts from every place on the \npolitical spectrum have concluded that it is unfair, it undermines the \nrule of law, it threatens American sovereignty, and it creates an end-\nrun around the democratic process. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment so we can keep\n\n[[Page S3026]]\n\nthese corporate-friendly panels out of future trade agreements.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           amendment No. 1312\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, last week the Senate voted 97 to 1 to \nreauthorize the African Growth and Opportunity Act--AGOA--for 10 years. \nIt was first enacted in 2000, so the 10 years were up and we had to get \nit reinstated. It provides the African countries with duty-free access \non most of their exports to the United States.\n  I have long been a supporter of AGOA. The program has done a lot to \nimprove our trade relationship with the continent of Africa, primarily \nsub-Saharan Africa. Since 2002, annual trade between the United States \nand sub-Saharan Africa has increased by almost 50 percent. So it is \nvery successful. It has also been estimated by the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce that it has had the effect of increasing 300,000 jobs in sub-\nSaharan Africa and 100,000 jobs here in the United States.\n  Trade with Africa is important because many of the world's fastest \ngrowing economies are in Africa. According to an analysis that was done \nfor The Economist magazine, six of the world's fastest growing \neconomies were in sub-Saharan Africa in the 10 years it has been in \neffect.\n  This is going to continue. I have seen it firsthand. Every time I go \nto Ethiopia, Rwanda, Tanzania or many of the other countries in Africa, \nI see more and more cranes going up and bigger and better buildings. It \nis really a live spot in the world. The infrastructure in places like \nRwanda and Tanzania is high quality. People who go to Rwanda come back \nwith memories of something that is a modern city, not a Third World \ncountry, as it has been in the past.\n  So we have really good things going on there, and we need to continue \nto build on their trade, infrastructure, roads, highways, seaports, \nrailways, and airports to help their economies grow.\n  For too long sub-Saharan Africa has been ignored as a trading partner \nby the United States. I have been to Africa probably more than any \nother Members have. In fact, there was something very critical of me \njust last weekend in the press--if I can find it here I will state what \nit was--anyway, they were critical of the attention I have been paying \nto Africa.\n  I can remember when the United States had the same problem. We \nignored Africa. Back when we were going into Bosnia, I was kind of \nleading the effort to keep Americans from going into Bosnia. This was \nduring the Clinton administration. The excuse they were using was that \nwe had to get into Bosnia because of ethnic cleansing. I said on the \nSenate floor, for every person who has been ethnically cleansed in \nBosnia, there are 100 in West Africa.\n  Just last weekend, ``Vice,'' a satirical show on HBO, tried to \nconnect me to a law drafted by the Parliament in Uganda that was \nantigay. I have always opposed this law and had nothing to do with it. \nHowever, there are things that are going on in all these countries that \nneed to be looked into.\n  My work in Uganda started many years ago to help bring an end to the \nLord's Resistance Army. A lot of people are fully aware of the LRA now, \nbut they weren't back then. There was one individual, Joseph Kony, who \nwas going into the various areas of Northern Uganda and was kidnapping \nthe little kids. They called them ``the children's army.'' The young \npeople would be kidnapped out of their village and then be forced to \nlearn to join their little army, to kidnap other people. If they \nrefused, they were forced to go back to their villages and murder their \nparents. That is the LRA, and we finally are making progress there.\n  Other countries around the world are not ignoring Africa's potential \nas we have been. Brazil and China have secured preferential trade \nagreements with Africa. Every time you see something new and shiny in \nAfrica, it comes from China. Economic Partnership Agreements of the \nEuropean Union have also been signed. So we are kind of left out. This \nAGOA has been a worthwhile program.\n  We need to start looking ahead to the future. Nearly a billion people \nwho live in sub-Saharan Africa and individual countries over the next \ndecade or two will reach the point where they are competing head-to-\nhead with many other countries around the world.\n  Our thinking about trade with Africa needs to be mature as their \neconomies grow. That is why Senator Coons and I have offered the \nAfrican Free Trade Initiative Act, amendment No. 1312 to the trade \npromotion authority act. We are doing it jointly. This amendment \nrequires the President to establish a plan to negotiate and enter into \nfree-trade agreements with our friends in sub-Saharan Africa. African \nnations want to enter into free-trade agreements with us. When I was in \nTanzania earlier this year, I met with Richard Sezibera. Richard \nSezibera is the Secretary General of the East African Community, which \nis made up of Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi, Tanzania, and Kenya. Richard \nSezibera told me he wants their Eastern African Community to enter into \na free-trade agreement with the United States--just those five \ncountries. This makes sense because FTAs bind business communities \ntogether and can pay long-term national security and foreign policy \ndividends.\n  While some in our government may not deem sub-Saharan African \ncountries ``ready'' for an FTA with us, our amendment requires the \nadministration to articulate what each country needs to do to get \nready. It is not enough for them just to say they are not ready to be \nassociated with us in this type of a treaty. The amendment also \nrequires the administration to determine what kind of resources might \nbe needed to help the countries get ready for an FTA with us. Between \nthe Millenium Challenge Corporation and USAID, we have had a lot of \nresources going into sub-Saharan African countries to help their \neconomies develop, and many outside aid organizations and other \ncountries do as well. It makes sense to identify which of these \nresources could be channeled for the purpose of developing a free-trade \nagreement with us.\n  We had a great guy. Unfortunately, he is leaving USAID. His name is \nRaj Shah. He has taken a personal interest in Africa, in developing \nrelations with Africa.\n  USAID has a large trade focus, but much of its work is geared toward \nhelping small businesses in places like Tanzania grow their exports. \nNow, this is good. It is a good thing to do, but they should also be \nworking at higher levels to improve the trade activities of these \neconomies as a whole. They can do this by working with our African \nfriends, helping them prepare for a broader trade relationship with the \nUnited States, either by helping them identify how they can improve \ntheir agriculture safety regulations or general private property \nrights. To that end, our amendment authorizes USAID to use its \nappropriations to help implement the strategy that will be developed \nunder this amendment.\n  The Senate just reauthorized AGOA for another 10 years. In the next \n10 years, we should be considering one or more free-trade agreements \nwith our partners in sub-Saharan Africa. Our amendment will help this \ndesire become a reality.\n  As I said, our government and the media have to get beyond their \nopposition to Africa, and hopefully we will be able to be doing that \nbefore long. If we don't make free-trade agreements with Africa a \npriority, then I think we will find ourselves here in 10 years and see \na much stronger, highly competitive African economy. We will be \nreauthorizing AGOA again and asking ourselves: Why didn't we push to \nenact free-trade agreements with these countries? We would rather not \nfind ourselves there. If we don't do it, China will, and we should be \nthe ones writing the rules for trade in Africa, just as we are trying \nto do in Asia.\n  So I appreciate the support of Senator Coons and others on this \namendment, and hopefully it can be adopted to the free-trade promotion \nauthority bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, as we continue to debate and file \namendments to the trade promotion authority, the fast-track \nlegislation, I ask unanimous consent to make two amendments pending and \nask that the pending amendment be set aside and\n\n[[Page S3027]]\n\ncall up my amendment No. 1233 and amendment No. 1234.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I was under the impression that we would \nbe able to have discussion and debate on the legislation before us. My \ntwo amendments would deal with two very serious issues. I am \ndisappointed that we have an objection.\n  My first amendment, 1233, would ensure that any changes to U.S. law \nor policy are passed by Congress. Specifically, if implementing \nlegislation allowed future changes to be made to a trade agreement that \ncould affect or overrule existing U.S. law without Congressional \napproval, then that legislation could not be fast-tracked. The \nimplementing legislation would have to guarantee that all future \nchanges would have to be approved by Congress. I think that is \nperfectly appropriate, and it is an absolute responsibility of Congress \nto ensure its own authority in matters of these kind.\n  Indeed, the Constitution gives plenary authority to Congress over \nimmigration law and trade. Under this amendment that I have offered, \nCongress cannot delegate the power to change U.S. law to the \nExecutive--Congress cannot do that and must not do that--or to some \ninternational body that would be created if this trade agreement--the \nTrans-Pacific Partnership--enters into force. This is not made clear \nunder the current bill.\n  Colleagues, we need to think about this commission--an international \ncommission--that will be created with 11 trading partners in the TPP. \nThis commission will be given power, and our trading partners will be \ngiven powers if Congress approves this, presumably. Under the TPP, that \ncommission is given the authority to amend the trade agreement that is \ninitially passed if they find that circumstances have changed and they \ndesire to change it.\n  This is called the `living agreement' provision. The `living \nagreement' provision explicitly states these things in this trade \nagreement. The term `living agreement' should make our hair stand up on \nthe backs of our necks because this is a dangerous thing. What it means \nis that the commission can alter the agreement. We want to be sure that \nif this commission alters the agreement--assuming the TPP enters into \nforce--that it is not given the power to change U.S. law, even if the \nPresident agrees.\n  There is another question. Senator Brown, I think, has offered an \namendment on this question, and my amendment would also fix it. It \ndeals with the admission of new countries into the 11 party--12, \ncounting the United States--TPP trade agreement. It is pretty clear. \nThis commission has the power to admit new members. It says: With \nregard to the amendment process of the commission, that the process \nwill look similar to that of the World Trade Organization. We have \nshared this with Senator Hatch and his fine staff. I think they \nunderstand what we are talking about here.\n  This suggests that TPP procedures are likely to mirror WTO \nprocedures. Well, the United States has had a long-term problem with \nthe World Trade Organization because we approved the World Trade \nOrganization and passed legislation implementing that agreement, and we \ndid not realize it allowed new members to be admitted without a vote of \nCongress. So under TPP, if it mirrors the WTO rules for amendments and \naccessions, the new members--it appears quite plain to me--could be \nadmitted by just 8 of the 12 TPP members--not a unanimous vote as NATO \nrequires or the European Union requires.\n  At one point, the TPP says there must be ``consensus,'' but then it \ntalks about WTO. WTO does not require consensus on everything. So I \nhave to say, colleagues, that, first and foremost, I do not know why we \nhave to create a new commission--a transnational commission that has \nthe ability to discipline the United States, to impose penalties on the \nUnited States by what might be a two-thirds vote under a number of \ncircumstances, and create additional constraints on the ability of this \ngreat Nation to function.\n  I do not know why we would not be better off dealing--as we have done \nwith other countries--with bilateral trade agreements between the two \nof us, not creating some international body such as the United Nations, \nthe WTO, or as Europe has done with the European Union.\n  So I am disappointed that we are not going to be able to have my \namendment to address this called up now, because if they can block this \namendment from being called up, this amendment can be shut out \naltogether. That is the fact. The train would be advancing without real \ndebate and without a real opportunity for this concept to be addressed \nand voted on by Members of Congress. I am sure people would rather not \nhave it come up--would rather not have questions about this agreement \nbe raised. I think it is a legitimate question. I would urge my \ncolleagues to continue to evaluate the amendment and to see if we \ncannot get it up pending. Let's have a vote on it, and let's adopt it.\n  Now, I also have offered amendment No. 1234. First, my previous \namendment was No. 1233. This would be 1234. It would hold the Obama \nadministration and the United States Trade Representative to their \nassurances that no trade agreement will be used to change U.S. \nimmigration law or policy. This has been done in the past to a \nsignificant degree. It resulted in Chairman Sensenbrenner and ranking \nmember Conyers writing a letter saying: Never again should any trade \nagreement amend immigration law.\n  That is the province of the Congress, according to the Constitution. \nIn 2003, I offered a resolution after a past trade agreement did just \nthat--bypassed Congress' authority over immigration law. The resolution \npassed unanimously. Senator Feinstein and other Democrats signed on. It \nsaid: Never again will immigration law be amended as part of a trade \nagreement. Trade agreements are not the way to change law of the United \nStates, especially when you have a President who is rewriting \nimmigration law, enforcing immigration law that Congress explicitly \nrejected through his Executive amnesty.\n  So my amendment is modeled after the Congressional Responsibility for \nImmigration Act of 2003, a bill sponsored by our Democratic colleagues, \nSenators Leahy, Feinstein, and Kennedy--former Senator Kennedy, our \nformer colleague. It would prohibit the application of fast-track \nauthority procedures to any implementing bill that affects U.S. \nimmigration law or policy or the entry of aliens, if an implementing \nbill or trade agreement violates those terms.\n  Then, any Member could raise a point of order against the \nimplementing bill, ensuring that the bill is considered under regular \nSenate procedures allowing amendment and debate. Look, now they tell us \nthat we should not be concerned. Colleagues, we have heard it said that \nthis will not happen--no future trade agreements will affect U.S. \nimmigration law. All right, but I am a little nervous about that. I \nhave been watching the language on this. Senator Grassley, at the \nFinance Committee hearing a few weeks ago, asked the Trade \nRepresentative, Mr. Froman, this:\n\n       My question: Could you assure the committee that the TPP \n     agreement or any side agreement does not and will not contain \n     any provision relating to immigration, visa processing or \n     temporary entries of persons?\n\n  That is a good question--simple question. They have been indicating \nnot. His answer sounds good at first blush.\n\n       Thank you, Senator Grassley. And the answer is yes, I can \n     assure you that we are not negotiating anything in TPP that \n     would require any modifications of the U.S. immigration laws \n     or system, any changes of our existing visa system, and in \n     fact the TPP explicitly states that it will not require any \n     changes in any party's immigration law or procedures. Now the \n     11 other TPP countries are making offers to each other in the \n     area of temporary entry, but we have decided not to do so. So \n     I appreciate the opportunity to clarify that.\n\n  So we have decided not to do so--now, at this moment, before the \ntrade agreement is up for approval by Congress, knowing it would be \ncontroversial if the implementing bill included immigration changes. \nBut that does not mean we are not party to any immigration provisions \nin the TPP that could be used to make changes later. One of the \nchapters in the agreement deals with immigration and temporary entry. I \ndo not see anything that would prohibit the current administration or\n\n[[Page S3028]]\n\na new administration from trying to use this trade agreement to advance \nan immigration agenda.\n  So if the Trade Representative really means it when he assures us \nthere will be no changes in the future, then I would suggest my \namendment would be something that Ambassador Froman would be delighted \nto support to keep us from having this problem and to remove this \npotential controversy from the legislation. I think it would also--for \nthose who want to see it passed--enhance the opportunity to pass the \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, this week we are considering legislation \nthat could have real importance for our country over the next several \nyears on the economic front and also on the national security front. \nThat legislation is trade promotion authority.\n  Trade promotion authority helps the United States negotiate strong \ntrade deals that benefit American farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers \nand expand opportunities for American workers. Under TPA, Congress sets \nguidelines for trade negotiations and outlines the priorities the \nadministration must follow. In return, Congress promises a simple up-\nor-down vote on the resulting trade agreement, instead of a long \namendment process that could leave the final deal looking nothing like \nwhat was originally negotiated.\n  The promise of that up-or-down vote sends a powerful message to our \nnegotiating partners that Congress and U.S. trade negotiators are on \nthe same page, which gives other countries the confidence they need to \nput their best offers on the table.\n  That, in turn, allows the United States to secure trade deals that \nare favorable to U.S. workers and to businesses and to open new markets \nto products that are marked ``Made in the U.S.A.'' Almost every one of \nthe 14 trade agreements to which the United States is a party was \nnegotiated using trade promotion authority. Currently, the \nadministration is negotiating two major trade agreements that have the \npotential to vastly expand the market for American goods and services \nin the EU and in the Pacific.\n  The Trans-Pacific Partnership is being negotiated with a number of \nAsia-Pacific nations, including Australia, Japan, New Zealand, \nSingapore, and Vietnam. If this agreement is done right, it will \nbenefit a number of industries, including an industry that is very \nimportant to my State; that is, agriculture.\n  Currently, American agricultural products face heavy tariffs in many \nTrans-Pacific Partnership countries. Poultry tariffs, for example, in \nTPP countries go up to a staggering 240 percent. That is a tremendous \nobstacle for American producers. Reducing the barriers that American \nagricultural products face in these countries would have enormous \nbenefits for American farmers and ranchers in my home State of South \nDakota and across the country.\n  In fact, one pork producer in my State contacted me to tell me that a \nsuccessful TPP deal could increase U.S. pork exports to just one of the \nTrans-Pacific Partnership countries by hundreds of millions of dollars. \nI know that is important in my State, important in the Presiding \nOfficer's State, and important in every agricultural State across this \nNation.\n  That is why former Agriculture Secretaries from both parties, \nrepresenting every administration going back to President Carter, \nissued a joint letter in February emphasizing the importance of trade \nto farmers and ranchers and urging passage of trade promotion \nauthority. They wrote in that letter:\n\n       Access to export markets is vital for increasing sales and \n     supporting farm income at home. Opening markets helps farm \n     families and their communities prosper.\n\n  It is not every day that you see former members of both Democratic \nand Republican administrations coming together to advocate a particular \npolicy.\n  I would say that this is the free and fair trade for a healthy \neconomy that describes precisely what it is that we are talking about. \nWe are talking about more exports for American agricultural products, \nmanufactured goods, digital goods--you name it, across the board. What \nthat means is more jobs and higher take-home pay for American workers.\n  The bipartisan agreement isn't limited to former Agriculture \nSecretaries who have come out in support of it. Ten former Treasury \nSecretaries--again, representing administrations of both political \nparties--came together to draft their own letter, stressing the \nimportance of trade promotion authority and securing favorable \nagreements for our country. They said:\n\n       Our support for open trade agreements is based on a simple \n     premise. Expanding the size of the market where American \n     goods and services can compete on a level playing field is \n     good for American workers and their families. Expanded \n     international trade means more American jobs and higher \n     American incomes. It means greater access for American \n     businesses to markets and consumers around the world, and it \n     means lower prices for American families here at home.\n\n  That is from former Treasury Secretaries of this country representing \nboth political parties.\n  Still another bipartisan group of former administration officials \ncame together this month to urge support for trade promotion authority. \nThis time it was seven former Secretaries of Defense, as well as a \nnumber of retired military leaders.\n  Their letter emphasizes another important aspect of trade that often \ngets overlooked in these discussions, and that is its national security \nimplications. Discussions of the benefits of trade tend to focus on the \neconomic benefits, of which there are many. So it is with good reason \nthat we talk about the economy, jobs, and higher wages. But the new \ntrade agreements have the potential to result not only in economic \ngains for American farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers but in national \nsecurity gains for our country.\n  When we make trade deals with other countries, we are not just \nopening new markets for our goods. We are also developing and cementing \nalliances. Trade agreements build bonds. They build bonds of friendship \nwith other nations that extend not only to cooperation on economic \nissues but to cooperation on security issues as well.\n  Two major trade agreements the United States is currently \nconsidering, the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade \nand Investment Partnership, have the potential to provide significant \nstrategic benefits for our country.\n  These agreements--these are the Defense Secretaries writing--``would \nreinforce important relationships with important allies and partners in \ncritical regions of the world. By binding us closer together with \nJapan, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Australia, among others, TPP would \nstrengthen existing and emerging security relationships in the Asia-\nPacific. . . . In Europe, TTIP would reinvigorate the transatlantic \npartnership and send an equally strong signal about the commitment of \nthe United States to our European allies.''\n  That is again from the letter coming from seven former Defense \nSecretaries representing administrations of both political parties.\n  The Secretaries go on to note:\n\n       The successful conclusion of TPP and TTIP would also draw \n     in other nations and encourage them to undertake political \n     and economic reforms. The result will be deeper regional \n     economic integration, increased political cooperation, and \n     ultimately greater stability in the two regions of the world \n     that will have the greatest long-term impact on U.S. \n     prosperity and security.\n\n  In other words, these agreements will not only provide our Nation \nwith significant economic benefits, they will also make a crucial \ncontribution to our national security. The Defense Secretaries and \nmilitary leaders also highlight another key point. Just because the \nUnited States isn't negotiating trade agreements doesn't mean other \ncountries won't be.\n  The fact that the United States hasn't signed a single trade \nagreement over the past 5 years hasn't prevented other countries from \nsigning numerous trade agreements over the same period. In fact, there \nare more than 260 trade agreements in effect around the globe today, \nbut the United States is only a party to 14 of those.\n  If America fails to lead on trade, other nations, such as China, are \ngoing to step in to fill the void. And these nations will not have the \nbest interests of American workers and American families in mind.\n  Free and fair trade agreements are essential for growing our economy \nand\n\n[[Page S3029]]\n\nensuring that products marked ``Made in the U.S.A.'' can compete on a \nlevel playing field around the globe. They are also an essential tool \nfor strengthening our relationship with our allies, which is of \nparticular concern now with so many areas of instability around the \nglobe. Trade promotion authority provides the best way of securing \nthese agreements.\n  The bipartisan legislation that we are considering this week \nreauthorizes trade promotion authority and includes a number of \nvaluable updates, such as provisions to strengthen the transparency of \nthe negotiating process and to ensure that the American people stay \ninformed. It also contains provisions that I have pushed forward to \nrequire negotiators to ensure that trade agreements promote digital \ntrade as well as trade in physical goods and services.\n  Given the increasing importance of digitally enabled commerce in the \n21st century economy, it is essential that our trade agreements include \nnew rules that keep digital trade free from unnecessary government \ninterference. I have previously introduced legislation to help ensure \nthat the free flow of digital goods and services is protected, and I am \npleased that the bipartisan deal that was reached includes many of the \nvery measures I have advocated.\n  Democrats and Republicans in the Senate have repeatedly come together \nthis year to pass legislation to address challenges that are facing our \ncountry. I hope we will see the same type of bipartisanship on this \nbill. This legislation will benefit American farmers, ranchers, and \nmanufacturers. It will help to open new markets for American workers, \nand it will benefit American families. And it will help make our \ncountry more secure.\n  The President supports this legislation. A number of Senate Democrats \nare working with Republicans to get this done.\n  I hope that the rest of the Democrats in the Senate will join us to \npass this important bill for American workers and businesses and make \ntrade promotion authority legislation our next bipartisan achievement \nfor the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                       Honoring Our Armed Forces\n\n    Staff Sergeant Matthew Ryan Ammerman and Corporal Jordan Spears\n\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Madam President, Memorial Day is next week, so I wish \nto take a moment to remember and recognize the courageous men and women \nof the Armed Forces who lost their lives serving in the line of duty \nthis past year.\n  Indiana lost two of its own, Army SSG Matthew Ryan Ammerman and \nMarine Cpl Jordan Spears, two young men who selflessly chose service to \ntheir country and gave the ultimate sacrifice.\n  SSG Matthew Ryan Ammerman of Noblesville served three tours of duty, \ntwo in Afghanistan and one in Iraq. A decorated soldier who received \nmultiple medals during his career, Staff Sergeant Ammerman joined the \nArmy in July of 2004. He deployed to Iraq in 2006 and then to \nAfghanistan in 2009. He went on to graduate as a Special Forces \ncommunications sergeant in 2013 before deploying to Afghanistan the \nfollowing year as part of Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  Staff Sergeant Ammerman was killed on December 3, 2014, when his unit \ncame under fire while conducting operations in Zabul Province. He was \n29 years old. He is survived by his wife and two brothers.\n  Cpl Jordan Spears' childhood dream was to become a marine. His dad \nsaid he was so proud to wear the Marine uniform. He was a native of \nMemphis, IN. Corporal Spears met with a recruiter when he was 17 and \nwanted to be deployed, his dad said.\n  He was deployed in July of 2014 to the USS Makin Island for U.S. \nmilitary operations against ISIS. Corporal Spears was lost at sea on \nOctober 1, 2014, while conducting flight operations in the North \nArabian Gulf. He was 21 years old. He is survived by his parents and \nfive siblings who loved him very much.\n  Indiana grieves for the loss of these two, extraordinary Hoosiers, as \nour country aches at the loss of many more husbands, wives, dads, moms, \nsons, and daughters. The loss of these heroes will not just be felt \nthis Memorial Day. They will be missed at the dinner table, at birthday \ncelebrations, at holidays, and beyond. This is a reality many military \nfamilies must cope with.\n  Let us take a moment to stand beside every military family for the \ntremendous weight they often carry for their service to this great \nNation.\n  And to the families and friends of Staff Sergeant Ammerman and \nCorporal Spears, we all send our continued thoughts and prayers. \nHoosiers will never forget your loved one's sacrifice to this country.\n  Memorial Day provides us an additional opportunity to reflect on the \nbravery of the few who ensure the freedom, the safety, and the way of \nlife for all of us. We will always be grateful to America's heroes, the \nservice men and women in the Armed Forces, and their loved ones.\n  As a Senator for Indiana and on behalf of all Hoosiers, let us thank \nall the men and women in uniform for standing the watch and honor the \nmemory of all who are no longer with us for their bravery, their \ncourage, and their patriotism.\n  God bless Indiana and God bless America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise to ask unanimous consent to speak \nas in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise to talk about the trade debate we \nare having in the Senate. I know we have heard a lot of debate on both \nsides.\n  I wish first to talk about some of the background before I get to \nwhat is in front of us in terms of the process in voting, amendments, \nand things like that.\n  I represent the State of Pennsylvania, which, like many States, \nsuffered through the devastation of not just the 1980s--when it comes \nto job loss in, for example, the steel industry, we know that, for \nexample, in a very short timeframe, about 5 years, for example, the \nsteelworkers lost half of their jobs in southwestern Pennsylvania--in \njust those 5 years. They went from around 90,000 steelworkers down to \nbelow 45,000 in just 5 years. That is only one example of job loss that \nfamilies in southwestern Pennsylvania have lived through, as well as \nother examples from around the State that we don't have time to recite \ntoday.\n  So that is kind of the backdrop. And, thank goodness, the steel \nindustry and the steelworkers came together and were able to recover \nsomewhat--obviously, not fully, but they were able to recover over \ntime. And in that time period--we are getting into the 1990s and then \ninto the 2000s--we have had a lot of assertions made that if a trade \nagreement is brought into effect, we would have job growth and it would \nhelp those who had been displaced.\n  But, unfortunately, what has happened over time is that folks in \nparts of Pennsylvania have seen some of the history. Just to give some \nexamples--and this is a Department of Labor number--525,094 workers \nwere certified as displaced from the period 1993 to 2002 in the \naftermath of the so-called NAFTA, the North American Free Trade \nAgreement.\n  Over a period of time between 1993 and 2010, the trade deficit with \nMexico was up by some $66 billion, and that is as of 2010, over those \n17 or so years.\n  That is the backdrop when we debate trade itself. Now, I know there \nhave been assertions made that this agreement, the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership with 11 other countries, will be different and that there \nwill be protections in there that weren't in earlier agreements.\n  I have real concerns about those assertions, and I have doubts that \nthey will play out in that manner because, in the end, this debate is \nabout wages and jobs. It is really, kind of, in one sense, one major \nissue.\n  Will this agreement and will the trade promotion authority that \nundergirds this agreement advance or hinder job growth and the growth \nof wages? I have real concerns about arguments that say it will, that \nit will advance job creation.\n  One of the assertions often made, as well, is that job loss over \ntime, over several decades--it has been more than one generation now in \naffected States such as Pennsylvania--job loss or wage\n\n[[Page S3030]]\n\ndiminution is attributable to a number of factors. And there is no \nquestion about it; that is right.\n  But even when you are able to--or I should say especially when you \nare able to isolate the issue of trade, there are some data that \nsupport that as well, that you can attribute job loss or wage \ndiminution simply to trade and not to other overarching issues. For \nexample, the Review of Economic Statistics in October 2014, in a \nsignificant and substantial report, analyzed a number of issues that \nrelate to trade. Here is the seminal conclusion from that report: \n``Occupation switching due to trade led to real wage losses of 12 to 17 \npercent.'' And occupation switching is, of course, job displacement.\n  That covers the period from 1984 to 2002, so it covers a period prior \nto the North American Free Trade Agreement and, of course, about 8 \nyears or so after the agreement was in effect. So my concern over the \nlong term is about wages and Pennsylvania jobs.\n  We have a more recent example, and it isn't grounded in the arguments \nthat relate for or against NAFTA, the North American Free Trade \nAgreement. Just since the South Korea trade agreement--a more recent \ntrade agreement--has been in effect, the trade imbalance or deficit \nwith South Korea has increased substantially. By one estimate, it is \nabout 12 to 1--$12 billion of imports on our side to just $1 billion on \ntheir side. That is the kind of ratio we don't want. We want the ratio \nto be something in our favor, not 12 to 1 against it.\n  So what do we do? We have an opportunity over the next couple of days \nto continue to debate trade promotion authority. In essence, this is \nthe last chance for Congress to have a real impact--or any impact, \nreally--on what happens in terms of the ultimate consideration of the \nTrans-Pacific Partnership, the trade agreement itself.\n  Many of us have amendments, and I would make two arguments before I \nrelinquish the floor. One is that we should have a reasonable number of \namendments and have a debate about these issues. We have had some \ndebate already but very few votes and very few amendments. I believe we \nshould make sure that folks for trade promotion authority or against \nand folks for the Trans-Pacific Partnership or against should have a \nchance to vote.\n  I will have a couple of amendments. I have filed them. I will just \ntalk about two, and then I will conclude.\n  No. 1 is a ``Buy American'' amendment. It would deny trade promotion \nauthority privileges to free-trade agreements that weaken or undermine \n``Buy American'' provisions--very simple but I think very substantial \nin terms of the potential adverse impacts or positive protections it \ncan provide.\n  We should make sure that ``Buy American'' is maintained, that trade \npromotion authority doesn't undermine it, and we should not allow the \ntrade agreement itself to undermine the ``Buy American'' provision. \nThat is one of the least things we can do in the context of this \ndebate.\n  The second amendment I will highlight, among several, is \ncongressional certification. This amendment would require certification \nby the two relevant committees--the Committee on Finance in the Senate \nand the House Ways and Means Committee--that negotiating objectives \nhave been met, so that prior to a trade agreement going into effect and \nonce there is a final review that those objectives the administration \nand every administration asserts are part of the trade agreement--that \nhas a review and then a subsequent certification by the two relevant \ncommittees.\n  I know there is a lot more to debate, but I would hope that on \nsomething as substantial and seismic in its impact on our economy and \nthe economy of the world--40 percent of the world's GDP is contained in \nthis agreement, TPP, and we know trade promotion authority is kind of \nthe rule book in a sense for the Trans-Pacific Partnership--that debate \nwe are having on trade promotion authority should allow States such as \nPennsylvania or Ohio or any other State to have its voice heard, to \nallow the people of our States, especially folks who have concerns \nabout these agreements, to have their voices heard. The only way their \nvoices can be heard ultimately, in addition to their own advocacy and \ntheir own efforts to make statements to us, is here on the floor of the \nSenate, to have debates and then have votes on amendments, and we will \nsee where we stand at the end of the week.\n  To shut off debate and to stop at this moment in time, as some seem \nto want to do, is contrary to what the Senate should do on something as \nsubstantial as the trade promotion authority, which will affect the \ntrade agreement impacting 40 percent of the world's GDP, and I don't \nthink it is asking too much to have a few more hours or even a day or \ntwo more of votes on the floor of the Senate.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 2048\n\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, free trade is of absolute importance in \nthis country. We need free trade. I like free trade. I want trade to be \nas free as it possibly can be. It is not, however, as pressing as \nanother matter that we should be considering now.\n  Certain provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act will expire a week from \nSunday at midnight. This is an important issue, and it is one that \ndeserves debate and full consideration within the Senate.\n  I want to point out that we have had months and months to plan for \nthis deadline--years, in fact. During these last several months, we \nhave worked with House Members, members of the law enforcement \ncommunity, and members of the intelligence community to create a \ncompromise bill that now enjoys the support of the Attorney General of \nthe United States, of the Director of National Intelligence, the \ntelecom industry, the NRA, the tech community privacy groups, and 338 \nMembers of the House of Representatives. This is a supermajority--a \nsuper-duper majority.\n  We have had a week since the House passed this bill, and it is time \nthat we take it up in earnest and give it the full attention and \nconsideration of the Senate that it deserves. Then we can return to TPA \nand finish it without facing expiration of a key national security tool \nwithout anything to put in its place.\n  This is a bill--the USA FREEDOM Act, as enacted by the House of \nRepresentatives--that represents an important compromise, represents a \nvery careful and effective balancing between privacy and security \ninterests, recognizing the fact that our privacy and our security are \nnot in conflict. They are part of the same thing. We are secure in part \nbecause our privacy is respected. This bill respects both of those.\n  We know that it is not easy to get to 218 votes for a lot of things \non this issue in the House of Representative. In fact, we know it is \nimpossible to get to 218 votes in the House of Representatives for a \nclean reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act provisions in question.\n  We know that a lot of other things would be difficult to impossible \nto pass in the House. We know that one bill does enjoy a supermajority \nin the House of Representatives, and that is the USA FREEDOM Act. We \nshould be taking that up now.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate set aside \nconsideration of H.R. 1314, the TPA legislation, and move to the \nimmediate consideration of H.R. 2048, the USA FREEDOM Act, that the \nmotion to proceed be agreed to, and that the bill be open for \namendments; further, that upon disposition of H.R. 2048, the Senate \nresume consideration of H.R. 1314.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. COTTON. Madam President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PATRIOT Act is a critical tool for our national security. The \njunior Senator from Utah is correct that three provisions do expire at \nthe end of this month: the so-called roving wiretap provision that will \nallow intelligence professionals and law enforcement officials to track \nterrorists no matter what device they might use, the so-called ``lone \nwolf'' provision that would allow our intelligence authorities to \nidentify and stop terrorists who\n\n[[Page S3031]]\n\nare not necessarily clearly linked to an overseas terrorist \norganization, and, finally, section 215 of the PATRIOT Act, which has \nenabled our intelligence professionals at the National Security Agency \nto help keep our country safe in the so-called telephony metadata \nprogram, which was unlawfully disclosed by Edward Snowden 2 years ago, \nwhich is why we are able to discuss such a highly classified program.\n  The junior Senator from Utah and I disagree about the program and the \nlegislation. There will be a time for that debate because it is the \nmost important issue we could debating in the United States, our \nnational security and the tools we need to keep our country safe.\n  For the time being, we are on the trade promotion authority bill. \nThat was a decision made last week. This is maybe not the decision that \nthe junior Senator from Utah would have made, and it is not the \ndecision I would have made, but that is where we are. Perhaps we could \nhave been done with the TPA bill if the other side of the aisle had \nallowed amendments to be processed last week and if there had not been \na needless filibuster of the motion to proceed to the bill, but that is \nwater under the bridge. We should move forward in an orderly fashion \nand process the amendments that are pending on the trade promotion \nauthority bill. We should have a final vote on that bill and then we \nshould move on to the PATRIOT Act reauthorization bill. There will be \ntime for robust debate in public, which is exactly what so many of our \nMembers have been doing in private, given the classified nature of \nthese programs. If we have to work beyond Thursday, I am more than \nhappy to do that. I will even work on Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and \ninto next week, if that is what is necessary to first process the trade \nbill and then finally to reauthorize the important provisions of the \nPATRIOT Act.\n  Madam President, I object to the unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I also--no matter how we vote on trade--\nunderstand the importance of it.\n  I wish to compliment the Senator from Utah for his statements. The \nfact is, a great deal of work has gone into the USA FREEDOM Act of \n2015. The Senator from Utah's bill and my bill is the same version as \nthe one passed by the House. I hope people will not lose sight of the \nfact that the House of Representatives really did what the American \npublic wants, by an overwhelming bipartisan majority they passed the \nUSA FREEDOM Act. Some had been saying that the other body could not \nhave gotten that kind of a vote, until say, the Sun rises in the East. \nBut the House came together from across the political spectrum in both \nparties to pass the bill. I think we ought to respect that.\n  We also--as the Senator from Utah and others have said--have a \nunanimous decision from a three-judge panel of the Second Circuit, \nwhich declared the current program illegal. We can pass the bill, the \nUSA FREEDOM Act, which passed in the House. It means that both sides \nhave given a lot to get there. We ought to pass it in this body at some \npoint--maybe when the trade legislation and the highway bill are \ncompleted, we should just take the USA FREEDOM Act up and pass it. If \nthere are questions once it has gone into effect, we can always come \nback and make other changes to the law, but we ought to pass this \nlegislation and at least give some stability to our intelligence \ncommunity. The Director of National Intelligence and the Attorney \nGeneral have said they support it, and we ought to accept it and go \nforward. The USA FREEDOM Act takes care of the questions of the courts \nand we should pass it.\n  I concur with the Senator from Utah, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask the Chair what business is pending \nbefore the Senate.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1327\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. H.R. 1314 is currently the pending bill, and \namendment No. 1327 is pending.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Relating to the trade promotion authority bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I wish to speak on that issue.\n  Madam President, we cannot ignore that more than 95 percent of the \npotential customers for goods and services and agricultural produce \nlive outside the United States of America. This means that to grow our \neconomy and to maintain our influence in the world, we clearly have to \nembrace trade; however, this doesn't mean we would embrace every \nproposed trade agreement.\n  I have voted for about half of the trade agreements that have come \nbefore me in the House and Senate during my congressional service. I \nthink some of those were good, on reflection, and some of them were \nnot. There have been proposals made for free trade which I thought \nspeak to the basic issue: Is America competitive in the 21st century? \nCan we outproduce other countries in the world? I never had any doubt \nabout that, except for some given circumstances where another country \nhas a specialty or some particular skill. I trust the United States. I \ntrust our economy, our workers, and our business leaders.\n  When it comes to a trade agreement, I think we have to answer some \nhard questions about the specific trade agreement, not the principle of \ntrade. Here is something most people do not know. They have proposed \nthis trade promotion authority so we can vote on the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership. This is a document that has been negotiated over many \nmonths and is available for Members of Congress to see in a secluded \nsetting. We cannot bring in as many staff as we would like, we cannot \ntake the document out of the room, but it is accessible to us. Here is \nthe point that is not often made: We have been told by the \nadministration that this is not the final draft of the trade agreement. \nWe have been told that after we pass the trade promotion authority \nbill, if we do, then there will be some more amendments and changes. So \nwhat we would view today is not necessarily what will be voted on at \nsome later date. It is incomplete. It is a work in progress.\n  There are some things we should know and should reflect on. First, I \nwill look at it from a very personal perspective. I am honored to \nrepresent the State of Illinois. It is one of the largest exporting \nStates in the Midwest, and it is the fifth largest exporting State in \nour Nation. Illinois exports totaled over $65 billion in 2013 and about \n10 percent of my State's gross State product.\n  Since 2009, Illinois exports increased by 58 percent, more than the \nnational average of 50 percent. Fifty-six percent of exported Illinois \ngoods in 2014--about $38 billion worth of exports--went to countries \ncurrently negotiating this Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement with the \nUnited States. Is this important to my State? Is this part of the world \nimportant to my State? Of course it is. However, Illinois' success in \nexporting its products depends on good trade agreements that level the \nplaying field, not just for Illinois companies but for American \ncompanies. This means we need to have strong antidumping rules that \nprevent companies overseas from dumping cheap, for example, steel \nproducts and other goods to undercut domestic prices and put our \ncompanies out of business. Did that happen? It sure did.\n  A little over 10 years ago, three countries that we trade with--\nBrazil, Japan, and Russia--had an idea. They figured out a way to drive \nAmerican steel companies out of business. How did they do it? Were they \nbetter or more competitive? No. They dumped their steel. What does it \nmean to dump a product? It means to sell it in another country at lower \nthan the cost of production in your own country. They took a loss on \nevery ton of steel until they ran that American steel company out of \nbusiness.\n  We saw it coming. We saw this dumping taking place. We had trade \nagreements, and we took them to the enforcement authorities. We said: \nThey are killing us. They are killing these steel companies in America \nand the people who work there and that is not fair and it violates the \ntrade agreement. The organizations responsible for policing these trade \nagreements said: We are going to put that on the docket and we will get \nto that in just a few months.\n  Well, a few months turned into a few years. We won the case. They had\n\n[[Page S3032]]\n\ndumped steel in the United States, but the net result of it was not \nwhat we were looking for. The American steel companies went out of \nbusiness. They could not compete against this dumped steel coming in \nfrom foreign countries.\n  When it comes to these agreements, we need to ask some basic \nquestions. Is it enforceable on a timely basis? Can we stop unfair \ntrade practices before they kill American jobs? That is pretty basic.\n  This steel issue continues to haunt us. Steel dumping is one of the \nreasons that the U.S. Steel plant in Granite City, IL, an area I grew \nup in, will stop production at the end of the month and put 2,080 \nIllinois jobs in jeopardy.\n  Fair trade agreements should include enforcement and they should also \ninclude enforceable currency manipulation provisions. When a country \ndevalues its currency, the U.S.-made products, in comparison, become \nmore expensive, and that adds to our trade deficit. It makes it \ndifficult for U.S. companies to compete. There are a lot of ways to \nwork on these trade agreements to the advantage of the exporting \ncountry if you break the rules.\n  Trade agreements should allow the United States to enact and \nimplement consumer protection laws meant to protect the public. We \ndon't want to go to the lowest common denominator when it comes to the \nbasics, such as protecting consumers, protecting the environment, and \nprotecting the workers. So whether it is food safety, environmental, \npublic health, consumer financial protection, an investor's future \nproducts should not take priority over a country's right to protect its \nown people.\n  There is something known as the investor-state dispute settlement. It \nis a procedure which I want to describe to you because I think it gets \nto the heart of this trade agreement we are being asked to vote on. \nInvestor-state dispute settlement procedures--often included in trade \nagreements and is included in several trade agreements that the United \nStates is party to--prioritize corporate investors above almost \neverything.\n  What is it? This is how it works: It allows a corporation to \nchallenge a law in an international court if the law, in the eyes of \nthat corporation, violates a trade agreement and infringes on the \ninvestment made by a business. That sounds kind of theoretical. I will \nbe specific.\n  We want U.S. businesses to have protections when they operate in \nother countries, so it appears to make sense, but corporations have \ngone too far. Corporations are using this dispute settlement to \nchallenge legitimate laws in countries that protect the public, such as \npublic health laws, environmental rules, land use, and food safety \npolicies. More than 500 of these cases have been brought by \ncorporations challenging the laws in various countries, including U.S. \nlaws.\n  A U.S. chemical company launched a case against Canada, as a nation, \nwhen Canada banned a toxic gasoline additive used to improve engine \nperformance--an additive already banned in the United States. An oil \ncompany sued Ecuador after a domestic court there ruled that the \ncompany owed $9.5 billion to clean up and provide health care to the \nworkers in Ecuador after the oil company had dumped billions of gallons \nof toxic water in open-air oil sludge pits in Ecuador's Amazon.\n  Do you get the picture? Your country passes a law to protect the \npeople living in your country, and then a corporation that has trade \nbusiness with your company sues the country where the law was passed \nand says that new law is going to cost them money.\n  Those are two examples. A toxic additive to gasoline--a corporation \nsues Canada and says you cannot ban that; that will cost us profits. \nEfforts by Ecuador to avoid toxic dumping in their own country are \nbeing sued by an oil company that says, if you do that, it will cost us \nmoney. They did not go through the court system. They went through this \ninvestor settlement dispute.\n  There are so many examples of corporations using investor settlement \ndispute to undermine, rollback or delay laws meant to protect the \npublic. One of the most egregious examples is Philip Morris. I kind of \ntake this personally. As long as I have been around Congress, in the \nHouse and Senate, I have had a battle with tobacco companies. It \nhappens to be the only product which when used according to \nmanufacturers' directions will kill you and can still be sold legally. \nSo I don't happen to think tobacco companies are in the best interest \nof public health for America or any other country.\n  About 26 years ago, I passed a law banning smoking on airplanes. It \nwas the first time tobacco companies ever lost. I passed it in the \nHouse, and my good friend the late Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey \npassed it over here. It is the law of the land. For over 25 years, \nnobody smokes on an airplane. Tobacco companies fought us every single \nstep of the way.\n  Philip Morris, one of the largest tobacco producers in the world, is \naggressively challenging domestic tobacco laws around the world using \nthe same investor-state dispute settlement that is going to be included \nin this agreement.\n  In Australia, as an example, after the highest court ruled against \nPhilip Morris and upheld an Australian law requiring warning labels to \ncover a large majority of cigarette packaging, Philip Morris did not \ngive up. Instead, Philip Morris sued Australia in an international \ntribunal under investor-state dispute settlement provisions in the \nAustralia-Hong Kong Bilateral Investment Treaty. If Philip Morris wins, \nAustralia could be forced to pay Philip Morris for expected future \nlosses because of a warning label on tobacco products. It could be \nbillions of dollars.\n\n  Proponents of this settlement dispute that is baked into this \nagreement we are going to be asked to vote on rightly claim these \nprocedures can't require countries to change their laws. In other \nwords, Philip Morris can sue Australia and say: Your new law is going \nto cost us money. Keep it if you wish, but we lost profits because of \nthis new law, and you have to pay us for our lost profits.\n  They can force countries like Australia to choose between changing \nthe law or using their own taxpayer dollars to pay billions of dollars \nto a company like Philip Morris for their expected future losses. Think \nabout that for a second. Philip Morris is selling a product that kills \nif it is used as intended. Some 6.3 million people each year across the \nworld die because of tobacco-related disease. Australia's health care \nsystem loses millions of dollars in tobacco-related illnesses for \npeople in their own country, as well as lost productivity at their \nworkplaces. Yet, when Australia enacts a public health law requiring \nlabels on tobacco products, Philip Morris can sue Australia? Yes, that \nis right. Tobacco products produced by Philip Morris are literally \nkilling Australian citizens, and Philip Morris is suing Australia \nbecause the warning labels may cost them future profits.\n  The same thing is happening in Uruguay. Philip Morris again lost its \ncase against Uruguay challenging its tobacco control laws which helped \nreduce tobacco use in that country by 4.3 percent. Now Philip Morris \nsays: If we can't win in the courts, we are going to win through the \ntrade agreement. We are going to win through the trade treaty, the \ndispute settlement in the trade treaty.\n  Sometimes even just the threat of a trade dispute challenging a law \nis enough to block, delay, or prevent enactment of a public health law \nbecause a country doesn't have the resources to engage in an expensive \nand lengthy lawsuit. This was the case in New Zealand and Nambia.\n  Corporations are using investor-state dispute settlements to \nundermine legitimate public laws, from financial protection, to public \nhealth, to environment and food safety. What are we thinking? If we \nwould allow corporations under a new trade agreement to come in and \nattack public health laws in America, to come in and attack \nenvironmental protection in America--because they can argue: If I can't \npollute in that river, it is going to cost my company a lot of money; \ntherefore, you have to pay us if you want to keep that pollution law on \nthe books.\n  That is why I am supporting Senator Elizabeth Warren's amendment that \nremoves fast-track authority for any trade agreement that includes \nthese investor-state dispute settlements. State-to-state dispute \nsettlements would still be available if the corporation's rights have \nbeen violated or if a country passes a law that violates a trade \nagreement. But there is no need to go the extra step and give priority\n\n[[Page S3033]]\n\nto the rights of corporations over the rights of people when it comes \nto laws that protect health, food, clean water, and clean air.\n  As the Senate continues to debate on giving fast-track authority to \nthese trade agreements currently being negotiated, we still don't know \nwhat is in the agreements--not entirely. Providing fast-track authority \nfor these agreements would prevent this Senate from offering amendments \nthat would provide only one up-or-down vote after the agreement is \nfinalized.\n  I support fair trade. I support trade. I hope the final agreements \nwill meet the standards we have spoken of. But I cannot support \ngranting fast-track authority to agreements where we don't know their \ncontents and we could give away the most basic responsibility we have \nas Senators in the United States--to protect the people of America.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Export-Import Bank\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the vitally important Export-Import Bank \nexpires at the end of June. It will be gone. If this program expires--\nit is not like anything else--we will have to start all over again. We \nwill have to have hearings. We will have to have markups in both \nHouses. If we can extend the authorization of this, it will solve so \nmany problems for us.\n  The Export-Import Bank creates jobs in our country--in the United \nStates--by providing loans and loan guarantees so customers in foreign \ncountries can buy our exports. An example is airplanes. I have spoken \nto Mr. McNerney, the head of Boeing, and one of the vital parts of \ntheir business is being able to have other countries have businesses \nwithin those countries come and want to buy their airplanes or \ncountries that want to buy their airplanes. They have difficulty doing \nthat without the ability of the Export-Import Bank to help raise the \nfinancing.\n  I greatly appreciate Senator Cantwell now bringing the attention of \nthis body to this important program that is going to expire soon. I \nappreciate Senator Heitkamp for working on legislation dealing with \nthis important issue.\n  The Export-Import Bank just this year sustained 165,000 jobs. It will \nbe a lot more if there is a long-term extension of this bill. So one \nmight think, of course, that a program such as this which supports \n165,000 jobs in just 1 year would cost taxpayers an arm and a leg, a \nfortune, but in this case, they would be wrong. It is just the \nopposite. We make money on the Export-Import Bank. Over the last 10 \nyears, the Bank has returned more than $7 billion to the U.S. Treasury. \nThat is $7 billion the U.S. taxpayer does not have to pay because the \nprogram is so important and so successful.\n  A program as effective as the Export-Import Bank should have no \nproblem getting reauthorized, but it has had a lot of trouble. As \nrecently as 2006, the Bank's charter was extended by unanimous consent. \nIt didn't even have a vote. But today the Export-Import Bank is in \nserious danger of being terminated, ended. The Senate banking committee \nhas made no effort to bring up the Bank's reauthorization, and the \nmajority leader doesn't have a path forward. The best, he said, is we \nwill give you a vote on it. Giving a vote on it is meaningless.\n  So what has changed since just a few years ago when we extended this \nby unanimous consent? Why has this immensely successful program over \nthe last few years been on the chopping block? I will tell my \ncolleagues why. It is because the Koch brothers have decided that it \nneeds to go. They want to get rid of it. It is part of their attack on \ngovernment programs, and this is a government program. They don't care \nif a bank creates jobs or makes money; they simply want to get rid of \nit.\n  That is not the worst of it. Every other developed country supports \ntheir exports. China and Europe support their exports, and so do Brazil \nand India. They all do. But the Koch brothers don't care. They want the \nUnited States to be unilaterally disarmed. They are telling their \nRepublican friends in Congress that the United States should just get \nrid of this program. They don't care that this will put U.S. companies \nat a competitive disadvantage, and that is an understatement. They \ndon't care that this will cost U.S. jobs, and that is an \nunderstatement. They don't even care that this will put a larger burden \non taxpayers to have to make up the lost revenue. All the Koch brothers \ncare about is maintaining their warped, illogical view of taking down a \ngovernment program and making more money for their massive business \ninterests.\n  I encourage my colleagues to reject this misguided view. Let's stop \nshooting ourselves in the foot. Let's pass a long-term extension of the \nExport-Import Bank. On this bill, the trade bill--if it became part of \nthe trade bill, it would be signed into law. The President loves the \nExport-Import Bank. He said so publicly. We have been trying to get \nthis done, but now the Republicans have said no thanks because their \nguiding light, the Koch brothers, don't like it because it is a \ngovernment program.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1327\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as we continue to debate the future of \nAmerica's trade policy, we have seen an onslaught of misleading claims \nand shocking tales of horror that have little or no connection to \nreality. Many of these ghost stories we have heard evolve around \nrelatively obscure legal provisions relating to investor-state dispute \nsettlement, or ISDS. Senator Warren has called up an amendment that \nwould give voice to those stories by stripping TPA protections from any \ntrade agreement that includes ISDS provisions.\n  I call ISDS provisions obscure not because no one knows about them or \nthey are unimportant but because in the real world where people \nactually live, they are not part of our day-to-day lives. It is only in \nthe overly hyperbolic and borderline fictional world of political \ndebate that ISDS provisions impact the lives of everyday people.\n  Simply defined, ISDS permits companies to challenge unfair or \ndiscriminatory treatment by foreign governments in binding arbitration \nrather than in ordinary courts. The purpose is to encourage the free \nflow of capital by protecting investors from uncompensated \nexpropriation and other abuses that may not be adequately rectified in \nregular domestic courts that in many cases tend to disfavor foreign \ncompanies. That is it. That is all it is. This has nothing to do with \nsecret tribunals that undermine U.S. sovereignty or provisions giving \ncorporations the power to rewrite U.S. laws and regulations.\n  We are hearing a lot of these stories about ISDS these days because \nthe Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, which is currently under \nnegotiation, includes such a provision. Of course, it would be a shock \nif it didn't. ISDS is a standard element of all U.S. trade agreements \nand international agreements in general. All told, there are 3,000 \ntrade and investment agreements that include ISDS around the world. The \nUnited States has these types of agreements with 50 countries. They \nhave been around for more than three decades.\n  Contrary to some of the claims made by opponents of free-trade \nagreements, ISDS is not a weapon foreign entities use against the \nUnited States. In fact, the United States demands the inclusion of \nthese types of provisions in our trade agreements in order to protect \nAmerican businesses from discrimination from foreign governments. You \nsee, here in the United States, foreign companies and investors are \nassured fair and equal treatment under our laws and in our court \nsystem. While the same is true with regard to many of our trading \npartners, it is by no means guaranteed. ISDS is one mechanism we have \nto ensure a fair process\n\n[[Page S3034]]\n\nfor our job creators who do business overseas. It is not widely used, \nbut it provides an important backstop.\n  Of course, those who use ISDS as a bludgeon against free-trade \nagreements tend to use arguments that are short on actual, verifiable \nfacts. For example, we hear claims that ISDS allows corporations to \noverturn laws and regulations both here in the United States and \nabroad. The truth is that ISDS arbitrators have no power to overturn \nlaws and regulations. The only recourse for a party that wins an ISDS \narbitration happens to be financial compensation.\n  Others have claimed that ISDS can be used to undermine our health \ncare or welfare system or to undo our environmental protections. Once \nagain, the facts tell a far different story. Most ISDS cases involve \nvery narrow issues affecting individual investors, such as contract \ndisputes, licensing, and permitting. There has never been a successful \nclaim in ISDS that a nondiscriminatory public health, welfare, or \nenvironmental rule or legislation violated fairness or \nantidiscrimination requirements.\n  We have also heard people say that ISDS provisions put U.S. taxpayers \non the line for losses. In truth, the U.S. Government has never lost an \nISDS case. In fact, only 17 cases have been brought against the United \nStates in the entire history of ISDS. By contrast, 15,000 cases get \nfiled against the U.S. Government in claims court every year. In short, \nISDS poses no threats to the American taxpayer.\n  In the end, virtually all of the tall tales we hear about ISDS come \nin the form of ridiculous hypotheticals that have very little basis in \nreality. But the facts are what they are. While it is only used \nsparingly, ISDS remains an important tool to protect U.S. investors and \nbusinesses. It is a fixture in international agreements, and if our \nnegotiators did not demand its inclusion in our trade agreements, they \nwould be doing our country a disservice.\n  In March, the Washington Post editorial board--not really known for \nhaving an unabashedly probusiness bias--published an editorial \noutlining the shortcomings of the anti-ISDS crusade.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the editorial printed \nin the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  Once again, I am all for a fair and open debate on trade policy. I am \nglad we are on the floor having this discussion. I hope we can stick to \nthe facts and not spend our time debating unsubstantiated scare \ntactics.\n  I urge my colleagues to let common sense prevail and to vote against \nthe Warren ISDS amendment.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, March 11, 2015]\n\n                   Don't Buy the Trade Deal Alarmism\n\n                          (By Editorial Board)\n\n       President Obama's proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade \n     agreement is in trouble on Capitol Hill. Senate Finance \n     Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) says a bill to enable \n     expedited consideration of the pact will be delayed until \n     April because of opposition from liberal Democrats and a few \n     tea party Republicans. The latest rallying cry for TPP foes \n     is that it would allegedly threaten environmental and labor \n     regulations, as well as U.S. sovereignty, for the benefit, as \n     Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) noted recently, of ``the \n     biggest multinational corporations in the world.''\n       The supposed menace is the TPP's Investor-State Dispute \n     Settlement mechanism, similar to language in more than 3,000 \n     agreements among 180 countries, including 50 agreements to \n     which the United States is a party. It would permit companies \n     to challenge unfair or discriminatory treatment by TPP \n     governments in binding arbitration rather than an ordinary \n     court. The useful purpose of the settlement provision is to \n     encourage the free flow of capital by protecting foreign \n     investors from uncompensated expropriation and other abuses \n     in countries where they are, as outsiders, disfavored in \n     court--or in countries that may lack well-developed court \n     systems at all.\n       Contrary to predictions that these processes are stacked in \n     favor of multinationals, the United Nations reports that \n     governments won 37 percent of cases and business only 25 \n     percent; 28 percent were settled before the arbitrators \n     ruled. In the history of ISDS, 356 cases have been litigated \n     all the way to conclusion. Only 17 complaints were lodged \n     against the United States. The number of such cases has \n     increased in recent years but mainly because foreign \n     investment itself has increased.\n       Critics trumpet ISDS horror stories, but upon closer \n     inspection they generally turn out not to be so horrible. \n     Take the oft-made accusation, repeated by Ms. Warren and \n     others, that a French firm used the provision to sue Egypt \n     ``because Egypt raised its minimum wage.'' Actually, Veolia \n     of France, a waste management company, invoked ISDS to \n     enforce a contract with the government of Alexandria, Egypt, \n     that it says required compensation if costs increased; the \n     company maintains that the wage increases triggered this \n     provision. Incidentally, Veolia was working with Alexandria \n     on a World Bank-supported project to reduce greenhouse gases, \n     not some corporate plot to exploit the people. The case--\n     which would result, at most, in a monetary award to Veolia, \n     not the overthrow of the minimum wage--remains in litigation.\n       Obama administration negotiators have sought to minimize \n     the misuse of this settlement provision under the TPP by \n     recognizing each country's ``inherent right'' to regulate for \n     health, safety and quality-of-life objectives. The vast \n     majority of TPP countries are legally well-developed (Canada, \n     Australia, New Zealand) or already free-trade partners with \n     the United States (Mexico, Peru, Chile). So the TPP changes \n     the status quo hardly at all.\n       It seems that the opponents' real beef is with the \n     administration's view that the United States and its trading \n     partners should encourage private investment in one another's \n     economies. On balance, though, free-flowing capital creates \n     more jobs and wealth than it destroys. The TPP would not only \n     increase economic activity but also enhance geopolitical ties \n     between the United States and its East Asian allies, \n     especially Japan. No amount of alarmism should distract \n     Congress from these benefits.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of the thousands \nof men, women, and children around the world who are the victims of \nhuman trafficking. I rise in their defense, on their behalf, and in the \ninterests of responsible trade policy that recognizes that there can be \nno reward to nations that ignore the problem and do nothing to end the \nscourge of what amounts to modern-day slavery--one of the greatest \nmoral challenges of our time.\n  After negotiations with the White House, the USTR, and my colleagues \non the Finance Committee, Senator Wyden and I at the appropriate time \nwill be offering an amendment to the trade bill to make sure that any \ntier 3-rated nation--those are the nations that have the worst record \nin our ``Trafficking in Persons Report''--that any tier 3-rated nation \nhoping to benefit from the Trans-Pacific Partnership will have to \naddress the problem of human trafficking in their country. They will \nhave to make concrete efforts to meet the standards stipulated in the \nTrafficking Victims Protection Act or they will not have the benefit of \nprivileged fast-track access to our markets, period.\n  This modification to my original amendment allows for a narrow \nexception, not just a waiver, as we do with most of the restrictions on \nthe executive branch. This exception may apply only to a country that \nhas been certified by the State Department as having taken ``concrete \nactions . . . to implement the principal recommendations'' of the \n``Trafficking in Persons Report.'' It will have to be made public so \nthat all will be able to judge that the implementation of those \nconcrete actions toward those recommendations has taken place. That has \nreal meaning. Those recommendations are the roadmap we lay out for \ncountries to move from tier 3.\n  This is a historic change in the nature of trade agreements now and \nin the future. For the first time, we will have on the Senate floor \ntrade promotion authority that says we cannot provide fast-track for a \ntrade deal with countries that have done nothing to stem the tide of \nhuman trafficking. For the first time, we have an amendment in a major \nbill that would impose real consequences and real repercussions for \nturning a blind eye to recruiting, harboring, transporting, providing, \nor obtaining a person for compelled labor or commercial sexual acts \nwith the use of force, fraud, or coercion. For the first time, we have \ngiven teeth to the State Department's TIP report and will hold nations \naccountable for their inaction. While the report has provided us with \nimportant information, it has relied on moral authority but has had no \nreal-world impact on real-world suffering.\n  Should this bill pass and be signed into law, at least we will not \nreward\n\n[[Page S3035]]\n\nnations with the worst record on reining in human traffickers with the \nbenefits of a fast-track to American markets.\n  My mother was a seamstress in northern New Jersey. No one worked \nharder. She came home tired, but she came home to her family and was \nproud of her work. She wasn't held hostage by her employers, forced to \nhand over her salary, her passport, or worse.\n  Thanks to the hard work of the community of advocates against \ntrafficking and the commitment of my colleagues on the committee, the \n``no fast-track for human traffickers'' amendment is in the legislation \nwe are debating presently on the floor. I understand there are those \nwho would prefer to see this amendment just disappear, but, just like \nthose it protects who are suffering around the world, it will be alive \nin every trade agreement now and into the future. This amendment says \nthat we will not be silenced. We will not be bowed because some want \nfree trade at any cost--at any human cost--even if it means letting in \nthose nations that our own State Department has determined to be \nnegligent at best in dealing with the scourge of human trafficking in \ntheir countries.\n  This amendment speaks volumes about how we approach trade, how we \napproach the concept of fast-track policy. We, Congress, set the terms \nthat shape fast-track negotiations, not the other way around. Before \nany country gains access to U.S. markets, they must show they have \ntaken concrete steps to eliminate human trafficking or there will be no \nfast-track--not for tier 3 nations at the bottom of the State \nDepartment's list.\n  Benjamin Franklin said, ``Justice will not be served until those who \nare unaffected are as outraged as those who are.'' Well, let's be \noutraged and make sure this amendment remains a key element of American \ntrade policy.\n  I thank Senator Wyden, the ranking member, for helping to develop \ncompromise language that has preserved the full intent of the \namendment, and I thank all the human rights and trafficking groups that \nhave come forward, worked hard, and helped draw attention to this \nproblem and provided a new public mechanism to hold this administration \nor any other administration accountable for their efforts to end human \ntrafficking around the world and not reward the very worst human \ntraffickers with access to our markets.\n  This is a victory for those fighting the scourge of human \ntrafficking. Fast-track is no longer a given, no matter how bad a \nnation's record is on how it deals with those who would traffic in \nhuman beings for profit. This amendment is for all those who have been \nsubjected to sexual exploitation, forced labor, forced marriage, debt \nbondage, and the sale and exploitation of children around the world.\n  It is for the world's 50 million refugees and displaced people, the \nlargest number since World War II, many of whom are targets of \ntraffickers. It is for the 36 million women and 5 million children \naround the world subjected to involuntary labor and sexual \nexploitation. For the victims of these crimes, the term ``modern \nslavery'' more starkly describes what is happening around the world \nand, sadly, what is happening in our own backyard--too often in the \nnail salons in our Nation.\n  I will continue to fight against human trafficking in all of its \nforms. All of us remain vigilant, constantly aware that the cost of \nhuman trafficking is not just far away across the ocean in a distant \ncountry. It is a moral crisis of international proportions that has \nreached our own shores, right here in our own backyard.\n  So again let me thank Senator Wyden for his efforts and the 16 \ncolleagues of the Senate Finance Committee--Democrats and Republicans \nalike--who voted for my amendment in the committee. Most importantly, \nlet me thank all of the human rights groups who have worked closely \nwith me to ensure that we do not reward nations with the worst record \non addressing human trafficking with fast-track access to our markets.\n  Let all of those who are suffering around the world at the hands of \nhuman traffickers be the face of any future trade agreements. I have a \nlist of groups that have worked every day to eradicate human slavery \nand that have supported my work on this important effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this list be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Coalition to Abolish Slavery and Trafficking (CAST), \n     Coalition of Immokalee Workers CIW), ECPAT-USA, Free the \n     Slaves, Futures Without Violence (FUTURES), International \n     Justice Mission, National Domestic Workers Alliance (NDWA), \n     National Network for Youth (NN4Y), Polaris, Safe Horizon, \n     Solidarity Center, Verite, Vital Voices Global Partnership, \n     World Vision.\n       American Jewish World Service, Bakhita Initiative, \n     Bernardine Franciscan Sisters, Catholics in Alliance for the \n     Common Good, Church of the Brethren, Office of Public \n     Witness, Columban Center for Advocacy and Outreach, Daughters \n     of Charity, USA, Franciscan Action Network, Friends Committee \n     on National Legislation, Maryknoll Office for Global \n     Concerns, Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, Leadership \n     Conference of Women Religious, NETWORK, A National Catholic \n     Social Justice Lobby, Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), Religious \n     Sisters of Charity, Scalabrini International Migration \n     Network, School Sisters of Notre Dame, U.S. Shalom Offices, \n     Sisters of Charity of Nazareth Western Province Leadership, \n     Sisters of Mercy of the Americas--Institute Leadership Team, \n     Sisters of the Holy Cross, Trinity Health, Tri-State \n     Coalition for Responsible Investment, United Church of \n     Christ, Justice and Witness Ministries.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I appreciate greatly the kind remarks of my \ncolleague from New Jersey about my role in all of this. I do not want \nto make this a bouquet-tossing contest, but I do want the Senate to \nknow and I want the country to know how important it has been that \nSenator Menendez has led this charge.\n  As my colleague noted, human rights advocates, those who have been in \nthe trenches in the fight against trafficking, have come together to \nwork with us. Senator Menendez, since our debate in the committee, has \nled this fight. At that time, colleagues, the committee approved an \nimportant amendment to ensure that trade agreements with countries that \ndrop the ball on trafficking get no special privileges here in the \nCongress.\n  The reason that my colleague has put all of this time and energy and \npassion into it is that he understands--everyone here, Democrats and \nRepublicans--that human trafficking is a plague that must be fought at \nevery opportunity. So what Senator Menendez and I have done over the \nlast few weeks is to work together to try to find a practical way to \nfurther improve the language in this original amendment.\n  What these alterations--really improvements--are going to do is to \ncreate a new process by which the President will report to the Congress \non the concrete, specific steps other countries are taking to crack \ndown on trafficking. I think--and we just got their statement--the \nAlliance to End Slavery and Trafficking, one of the leading groups that \nhas been fighting this scourge the hardest, has just summed up--I just \ngot this a few minutes ago--what the Menendez effort is all about. A \ntest, the organization has called it, and I quote here, and describes \nit as a ``positive step forward'' in the fight to combat human \ntrafficking.\n  When we take their statement with the fact that Senator Menendez has \nbrought the State Department on board, I think with what we are \nshowing--and this has been a major theme, frankly, of what I have \nsought to do over these many months, negotiating with Chairman Hatch \nand colleagues, is to try to make sure that we come up with policies \nthat demonstrate that there is a new era of trade policy afoot, a new \nera when trade is done right.\n  Because of the good work of my colleague from New Jersey, the \namendment that we will be offering here, under my colleague's \nleadership, is a demonstration that we can do trade right, that we can \ndo everything possible to eradicate this plague that so many around the \nworld have mobilized to address. I congratulate my colleague for his \nefforts. Colleagues should note that this would not have happened had \nit not been for Senator Menendez.\n  This was a matter that certainly colleagues felt very strongly about. \nPeople said: Oh, the whole debate is over. It cannot be resolved. \nSenator Menendez said: There is a way to bring people together. I \ncongratulate my colleague\n\n[[Page S3036]]\n\nfor putting this together. I look forward to voting on it later \ntonight, I hope.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak a \nlittle bit today about the trade legislation that is before this body \nthis afternoon. As we have talked about over the last week, as I have \ncome to the floor, I do think we ought to be expanding exports in this \ncountry because it is good for jobs.\n  I think trade-opening agreements can be very good for the workers and \nfarmers, people that provide services who I represent in the State of \nOhio. We need those jobs. 60 percent of our soybean crop is exported in \nOhio, our biggest agricultural product. One of every three acres is \nplanted for export now. For our farmers, those overseas markets are \nreally important. Of course we want to expand them.\n  For our industrial workers, about 25 percent of our factory jobs in \nOhio are now trade jobs, export jobs. We want to expand them. For 7 \nyears we have not had the ability to open up new markets, by knocking \ndown barriers overseas. So that is a good thing. We should all be for \nthat. Everyone should be for that. But the question is, as we knock \ndown barriers overseas, are the other countries playing by the rules? \nIf not, then it is not fair to our workers, our farmers, our service \nproviders.\n  In Ohio, a lot of companies have become more productive. They have \nworked on productivity, and they have worked on efficiency. Workers \nhave given concessions, including some of our major labor unions: the \nUAW, steel workers, and others, in an effort to join the global economy \nin a competitive way. What they are saying to me is this: You know, \nRob, I would like to be able to be in this global marketplace and \ncompete. But I want to be sure it is fair. If it is, I can do fine. I \nam confident. I am confident of them. So part of the discussion on the \nfloor today is not just about expanding exports, as important as that \nis. But it is this: How do you have a more level playing field so that \nour workers are getting a fair shake, so that our farmers know, when \nthey are competing in global markets around the world, that there is \nthis more level playing field, so we have the ability to tell them--to \nlook them straight in the eye and say: You know what; this is going to \nbe good for you.\n  I will mention a couple of issues. Today, I saw Senator Brown on the \nfloor. This has to do with an amendment that we would like to offer in \nthe trade promotion authority bill, which actually was part of the \nCustoms bill which was voted on in committee and voted on here on the \nfloor.\n  The idea is that instead of having it in the Customs bill, where it \nmay or may not be successful, to have it in the trade promotion \nauthority bill, where it is much more likely to go to the President, to \nhis desk for signature. I will say that this amendment is language that \nSenator Orrin Hatch, who is here on the floor with us today, the \nadministration and others, supported putting into the Customs bill \nbecause they thought it was good policy.\n  Senator Hatch is very discriminating. He knows what is good trade \npolicy in terms of being sure that we have this more level playing \nfield for our workers in this area of subsidized imports and dumped \nimports into this country. So what we did was that we got this language \ninto the Customs bill, and now we want to be sure it is part of the \ntrade promotion authority bill.\n  Why is this so important?\n  Well, part of this level playing field is to ensure that when \nproducts are being sold into the United States of America, they aren't \nbeing sold at below their cost. If they are sold at below their cost, \nit is called dumping. It is an international standard. We have laws \nagainst it, but so do the other countries.\n  The World Trade Organization has enforcement measures against that. \nYou are not supposed to dump product into another country in order to \ngain market share. It is kind of like a loss leader. What happens is, \nof course, our domestic companies can't compete with that because other \ncountries are allowing their companies to sell at below cost. So when \nthere is dumping, we want to be able to have a remedy for our workers \nand our companies.\n  The second one is called countervailing duties for subsidized \nproduct. That is when another country actually subsidizes their exports \nin order to get market share. That is not fair either.\n  Let's take the example of somebody who works in the steel industry in \nOhio. They are trying to compete to sell steel to, say, the auto plant. \nAnother country comes into the United States and sells their product \nthat is subsidized that is well below the cost of our manufacturer. \nThat is unfair. So you are able to put in place countervailing duties \nagainst that product.\n  All we are saying is that we would like to clarify the law so it is \neasier for a company, easier for those U.S. workers, to be able to show \nthey are injured when you have dumping, when you have subsidized \nproducts coming into this country. Again, this is broadly supported. It \nis bipartisan. It is one that, again, was part of another bill called \nthe Customs bill. It should be part of our legislation, in our view, \nand we hope it will be offered as an amendment. If it is able to be \noffered, I think it will pass because, again, I think this is an issue \nwhere there is a lot of consensus.\n  One of the problems right now is sometimes companies have such a hard \ntime proving material injury that by the time they prove it, it is too \nlate. In other words, they have lost market share, they have lost the \nability to be competitive in the United States, and they end up having \nto lay people off--and sometimes, in some cases, in some companies in \nOhio, including the steel business, they have gone out of business.\n  So this is, I think, a commonsense, logical approach that again has a \nlot of support. I hope that amendment will be able to be offered and \nthat we will include that on the trade promotion authority.\n  The second amendment has to do with a third area of unfair trade. We \ntalked about dumping. We talked about subsidizing. Another one is when \na country says: You know what. I am actually going to intervene in \ncurrency markets globally in order to drive down the value of my \ncurrency explicitly to get an export advantage over other countries.\n  It is called currency manipulation. It is a standard that has been \ndeveloped over the years by the International Monetary Fund. It is very \nspecific, and it says that when you do that--because it does distort \nmarkets, it does affect trade--it is considered to be an unfair trade \npractice. The problem is there hasn't been enforcement of that.\n  What happens is, when countries do it, the value of their currency \ngoes down. Therefore, their exports they sell, say, to the United \nStates of America are relatively less expensive, and our exports to \nthem are relatively more expensive.\n  Paul Volcker, who is the former Chairman of the Federal Reserve, made \nan interesting comment. He said, ``In five minutes, exchange rates can \nwipe out what it took trade negotiators ten years to accomplish.'' I \nthink there is some truth to that. It can happen relatively quickly.\n  I have walked on a shop floor in my home State of Ohio, the company \nthat makes steel pins--and these are very important steel pins because \nthey hold up speakers at big concert halls. They have to be strong, and \nthey have to be precisely drilled and made. They brought some that work \nback from China. God bless them.\n  I am walking the shop floor, and I am talking about how they have \nthese new machines, they have taken their workers through new training, \nthey have done everything to be more efficient and more productive, but \nthey tell me: Rob, you know, unfortunately, we are going to lose some \nof this business now because of currency manipulation. We just can't \ncompete.\n  So despite everything they were doing right and the concessions some \nof their workers were making in order to be more competitive, they \ncouldn't if there was currency manipulation.\n\n[[Page S3037]]\n\n  Everybody believes currency manipulation is a bad thing--the WTO \ndoes, the World Trade Organization. They have standards, and they \ndeferred to the International Monetary Fund because it is a currency \nissue. The International Monetary Fund has standards. Those standards \nare such that if you look at our legislation, we pick up the standards \nfrom the International Monetary Fund.\n  So we say, ``With respect to unfair currency exchange practices \n[which] target protracted large-scale intervention in one direction in \nthe exchange markets by a party to a trade agreement to gain an unfair \ncompetitive advantage in trade over other parties.''\n  So it is very specific. It is consistent with the IMF and WTO \nstandards, but the amendment goes even further to ensure that is what \nwe are talking about by saying that whatever we do has to be \n``consistent with existing principles and agreements of the \nInternational Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization.'' So it \nis a targeted approach to currency manipulation.\n  By the way, someone said: Well, what about QE 1, 2, 3? What about \nmonetary policy?\n  That is not governed, because the way we define this is, again, the \nIMF definition of ``protracted large-scale intervention in one \ndirection in the exchange markets by a party to a trade agreement to \ngain an unfair competitive advantage in trade.''\n  That is not why we did QE 2. We did it to stimulate our economy. We \ncan argue about the merits or demerits of that monetary policy, but it \ndoes not fit into that definition because concerns were raised about, \nwell, maybe it could be.\n  As we filed this amendment this week, we added something else to the \namendment. It is a very short amendment. I encourage you to read it, \nSenate amendment No. 1299. It says: ``Nothing in the previous sentence \nshall be construed to restrict the exercise of domestic monetary \npolicy.''\n  So you may hear this debate on the floor: Well, gosh. I am worried \nthis is going to come back against us.\n  It can't.\n  All this says is our negotiators, in doing a trade agreement, have to \nmake currency manipulation one of the negotiating objectives. We \nalready have labor issues, environmental issues, and other issues that \nare negotiating objectives. We have passed one here earlier this week \nwith regard to human rights. Certainly, currency manipulation ought to \nbe one of them. It does affect trade.\n  Now, I know the Secretary of the Treasury issued a veto threat today \nand said he would recommend the President veto. This has been in \ndiscussion for a number of weeks now, and up until now there has not \nbeen a veto threat. So that is new today. I find that surprising; \nfirst, because we have had a lot of discussion about this, and this is \nthe first time there has been a recommended veto threat. It is not a \nrecommendation that Presidents always agree with when a Cabinet member \nsays that, but it has to be taken seriously.\n  I would be very surprised if the President of the United States were \nto say: You know what. I like this trade promotion authority. This is \ngood. It expands exports--which is a good thing in my view, as I have \nsaid earlier--but somehow I am going to veto it because, boy, we just \ncan't take on currency manipulation.\n  This is at a time when everybody--everybody--the administration, \nMembers of the House and Senate, Democratic and Republican, all agree \ncurrency manipulation ought to be prohibited.\n  In fact, the side-by-side amendment that is being offered by my good \nfriend and colleague Senator Hatch and my good friend Senator Wyden \nalso said we should not have currency manipulation. In fact, they pick \nup our exact language on how to define currency manipulation, but they \ndon't have any enforcement. There are no teeth to it. It says you could \ndo this or that, you could have reporting, you could have rules or you \ncould have monitoring or you could do nothing.\n  What ours says is very simple: Let's just make currency manipulation \nthe same as everything else that is a negotiating objective that is \nenforceable. Let's subject it to dispute resolution.\n  So you have opportunity; one, first, you have to start with \nconsultation with the other party; and, second, if there are \nconsultations that break down, if you can't resolve it, then it goes to \na dispute resolution process.\n  Someone said: Well, the United States would be the judge and the \njury.\n  Not at all. As a former U.S. Trade Representative, who has been \ninvolved in these negotiations, who has taken into account negotiating \nobjectives, I can tell you these three-judge panels are objective. That \nis the whole idea, and they determine whether there has been \nmanipulation under the agreement that the parties have reached. So what \nthis says is: Let's raise this issue. Let's have a discussion about it. \nIt is a negotiating objective, and let's see what we can agree with, \nwith the parties, and let's make it subject to the same dispute \nresolution you would have with other issues, such as the environment, \nsuch as labor, so this is actually enforceable.\n  So the question on the floor is going to be: Do you support getting \nrid of currency manipulation because you know it affects people you \npresent negatively? And the answer is going to be a resounding yes.\n  By the way, 60 Senators wrote a letter in the last Congress--60 of \nthem--saying that in trade agreements there ought to be an enforceable \ncurrency manipulation provision. This amendment would require 51 \nbecause it is germane. So it is just interesting. If it doesn't \nsucceed--because I know my leadership is against this, I know the White \nHouse has now said they are against it. We will see how people vote on \nthis because everybody agrees we ought to deal with this. The question \nis whether we ought to have teeth in it, whether it ought to be \nenforceable or not.\n  By the way, what is trade promotion authority? Why are we doing all \nof this? We are doing it because this is the way Congress can express \nto an administration what our prerogatives are. Again, 60 Senators have \nsigned that letter. It seems like everybody agrees currency \nmanipulation is a bad thing.\n  The side-by-side--meaning the alternative--in an effort to defeat our \namendment, the alternative acknowledges currency manipulation is a bad \nthing and sets up the exact definition that we use. Ours is a little \nbetter because it also exempts monetary policy explicitly, and theirs \ndoes not, by the way. But then at the end it says: And what are you \ngoing to do about it?\n  Well, you decide. You can do this or this or this or nothing.\n  Ours says: No, you have to subject it to the same enforcement you \nhave with other provisions in a trade agreement.\n  So I am hopeful we can get this passed. People have said: Well, this \nis about the auto companies. You know, I am not ashamed to represent \nthe auto companies. I am co-chair of the Auto Caucus. The automobile \nindustry in this country is incredibly important. We are proud in Ohio \nto be the No. 2 auto State in the Nation. By the way, the UAW and the \nmanagement have made a lot of concessions. They have made a lot of \nchanges to the way they produce automobiles to be more efficient, to \nhave the safest, best automobiles in the world produced in the United \nStates of America. I think they do deserve a fair shot. Again, the \nagreement can reduce all sorts of tariff barriers and so on to give \nthem a shot at going into some of these markets. But if at the end of \nthe day there is currency manipulation, as Chairman Volcker said--\nformer Fed Chair Paul Volcker--``In five minutes, exchange rates can \nwipe out what it took trade negotiators ten years to accomplish.'' So I \nam very proud to be on the floor saying: Yes, it is important to the \nautoworkers.\n  But it is much broader than that. The fact that the steel companies \naround the country have also supported this, the fact that other \nindustries have supported this, it affects everybody. It affects \nfarmers. If we are selling 60 percent of our soybean crops overseas, \nand they have currency manipulation making our product more expensive, \nthat is bad for our farmers.\n  If you are selling these steel pins I talked about earlier overseas--\nI had the fastener industry come see me this week. They are from Ohio. \nThese are the people who make screws, nuts, and bolts. They are \nconcerned about it. So\n\n[[Page S3038]]\n\nit is not one narrow group. It is anybody who is involved in \ninternational trade and understands the need for us not to allow this \nto happen. Others have said. Well, this is a poison pill.\n  I view it more as a vitamin than a poison pill because I think it \nstrengthens the underlying law. I think it makes it more likely we can \nget a consensus for trade going forward, including in the House of \nRepresentatives, where people want to vote for trade promotion \nauthority, they want to expand exports, but they want to be sure it is \nfair. They want to be sure their workers and their farmers get a fair \nshake.\n  So I know the President has said he doesn't like it much, but the \nPresident, in the past, has spoken articulately and vociferously \nagainst currency manipulation. His statements have been very clear. He \nnot only thinks it is wrong, he thinks it must be enforced. So I would \nfind it surprising that he would be willing to move forward.\n  Is it poison pill because of the House? Again, I think it actually \nadds votes. Why wouldn't it? Is it a poison pill in terms of the \nadministration? I hope not, and I can't believe it would be. This is a \npriority for the President to get trade promotion authority done, and I \nagree with him.\n  I think it is important for us to give our workers and our farmers \nthe chance to export more of their products to the 95 percent of \nconsumers who live outside of our borders, who are not Americans but \nwho want to buy the best products in the world that are stamped ``Made \nin America.'' We want to do more than that.\n  Then, finally, is it a poison pill for the countries that are \nnegotiating what is called the Trans-Pacific Partnership--called the \nTPP. Well, I have heard Japan doesn't like this amendment much. It \nconcerns me if our friends in Japan--and they are allies and friends, \nand I have worked closely with them.\n  When I was the Trade Ambassador, we worked more closely with Japan \nthan anybody had previously, I would say. I brought them into the close \ncircle of countries that were trying to move forward, in this case, on \ninternational standards through the Doha agreement. I have great \nrespect for them.\n  By the way, they are not manipulating their currency now and haven't \nbeen, in my view, since probably 2012, maybe the end of 2011, by the \nvery definition in here. So why would they be worried? I don't know.\n  But it worries me that they wouldn't be willing to sign off on a \nprovision like this, very sensible, saying: Let's all agree not to \nmanipulate our currency so we can have a more level playing field \nbetween all of our countries.\n  They have manipulated their currency in the past. The IMF would say, \nI think, about 300 times before 2012. So I don't know if they really \nwouldn't negotiate with us. In fact, this is a very important agreement \nto them. It is a very important agreement to them because they, like \nus, want to expand our trade ties together in the fastest growing part \nof the world--in the Pacific region. And that is good.\n  So look, I appreciate the fact we are going to have a difference of \nopinion on this. I just hope people will actually look at the facts. \nLook at the language. Look at the fact that this is an issue we all \nagree on in terms of currency manipulation. The alternative amendments \nwill have that. The only question is, Should it be enforceable? Should \nit have teeth? Should we be able to go home and look our workers in the \neye and say: You know what? We have taken care of you on this one. You \nare not going to find yourself playing by the rules, making \nconcessions, going through retraining, making these big investments in \nthese companies with the most up-to-date equipment to be competitive \nand then find, oh my gosh, the rug is pulled out from under us by \nmanipulation.\n  So here we have President Barack Obama. I mentioned his statement \nearlier. This is in June of 2007: ``I will work with my colleagues in \nthe Senate to ensure that any trade agreement brought before the \nCongress is measured not against administration commitments but instead \nagainst the rights of Americans to protection from unfair trade \npractices, including currency manipulation.''\n  I know where the President stands on this. He, like me, like other \nSenators in this Chamber, wants to be sure we do deal with currency \nmanipulation. In this case he is saying with regard specifically to \ntrade agreements brought before this Congress. That is what TPA is all \nabout--establishing our congressional prerogatives as to trade.\n  So I hope we will be able to move forward with expanding \nopportunities for everybody we represent, because that is what trade is \nabout. It is about creating more and better jobs. If you are against \nexports, you are against creating better jobs. Trade jobs pay, they \nsay, on average 13 to 18 percent more. Why? Because they tend to be \njobs in the manufacturing sector, in the technology sector. They tend \nto be good jobs.\n  We want more of them in my State of Ohio. Our farmers want more \nexports. It is good for their prices. And they all deserve to have \nthese markets overseas because they are working hard to create the best \nproducts in the world. All they want is a level playing field to ensure \nthey have the opportunity to send those products overseas to the 95 \npercent of consumers outside our borders.\n  If we do that--if we do that and at the same time ensure it is fair--\nwe will be able to look them in the eye and say that this is going to \nbe good for you and your families.\n  Here is what Secretary Lew said earlier today: ``Holding our trading \npartners accountable for their currency practices has always been \nimportant to this administration.''\n  Let us hold them accountable. We can't hold them accountable if there \nis no enforcement. We can't hold them accountable if there are no \nteeth. That is all we are asking for today.\n  I would ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to look at this \nlanguage and look at this issue. Earlier, one of my colleagues came to \nspeak and he had a sign like this, and it talked about free trade and \nfair trade. That is what we are talking about. Let us be sure we have \nfree trade and fair trade. If we do that, we can begin to rebuild a \nconsensus around trade that used to be a bipartisan consensus, and we \ncan begin to create a better future for our kids and grandkids--more \nengaged in global markets, getting better-paying jobs and more jobs, \nand ensuring America's promise is met.\n  At a time when we have a historically weak recovery, what better \nthing to do than to give this economy a shot in the arm by expanding \nexports and by doing so in the context of creating a more level playing \nfield for the people we represent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, this is an exceptional thing we are \ndebating right now. We are talking about limiting our own \nconstitutional power. We are talking about a trade promotion authority \nact that would restrict our ability to offer and debate amendments on \nfree-trade agreements.\n  We have been told this is the only way we can move forward on things \nsuch as the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the soon-to-be-completed \nEuropean free-trade agreement. There are great disagreements about \nwhether that is necessary.\n  It is hard to understand why we hold trade to a fundamentally \ndifferent standard than so many other things that are vitally necessary \nfor our economy to move forward. Why not have a different process to \npass immigration reform or energy reform or tax reform? Those are just \nas, if not more, necessary to economic growth than trade.\n  But in that we are talking about limiting our ability to offer \namendments to a trade agreement, it would be the height of irony if we \nwere to conduct that debate in a way that limited our ability to also \noffer amendments on the very act that takes away our power to amend the \ntrade agreements.\n  So here is just a point on process. I am fairly new to this body. \nThis is the first time I have been in the Senate debating a trade \nagreement. Certainly, it is the first time I have been in the Congress \nto debate a fast-track bill, a trade promotion authority. I think we \ncan take our time to allow this body to work its will, to make sure we \nvote on more than a handful of amendments to a piece of legislation \nthat takes away our power to offer amendments on the final trade bills.\n  We took 3 weeks to debate the last fast-track bill. Now, I don't \nthink anybody is asking for 3 weeks, but we are\n\n[[Page S3039]]\n\nasking for more than a few days, given that many of us think we have \namendments, such as the one Senator Portman is offering, that can make \nthis bill a lot better. So I am coming to the floor today to ask for \nthat time to get to a better place on this bill and, specifically, to \nask for this body to take up a series of amendments surrounding one \nvital issue, and that is the issue of protecting the American supply \nchain on products bought by the U.S. Government. It is commonly \nreferred to as the ``Buy American'' law. It has been on the books for \ndecades.\n  It is a pretty simple premise. When we are buying things for the U.S. \nGovernment, we should buy them from American companies, by and large. \nIt is a pretty meager requirement. At the start, it just says that when \nyou buy stuff for the American Government, primarily for the Defense \nDepartment, you should buy 50 percent of it from U.S. companies.\n  That makes a lot of sense to people in the United States. In my State \nof Connecticut, we believe that is just good economics, but it is also \ngood national security policy, because if you are not making things for \nthe Department of Defense here, you are making them abroad, and you \nbecome reliant on a supply chain that is increasingly internationalized \nand puts you at risk when one of those companies that is supplying \nparts for a jet engine, for a tank, for a weapon all of a sudden isn't \nyour ally any longer.\n  The ``Buy American'' law has been riddled with loophole after \nloophole, exception after exception, such that the exception is now the \nrule. I won't go through the litany of ways you can get around the \n``Buy American'' law, so that sometimes today items being bought by the \nDepartment of Defense are majority made outside the United States and \nfrankly, often by countries that we may not be in total alignment with \nwhen it comes to our security policy.\n  I want to talk about one waiver, one way around the ``Buy American'' \nlaw, and that is a really big one. There is a waiver to the ``Buy \nAmerican'' law for any country that we have entered into a free-trade \nagreement with. So if you have signed a free-trade agreement with the \nUnited States, you can supply content to goods made for the U.S. \nmilitary and have it count as made in America.\n  Now, that is a pretty limited exception when you have only a small \nnumber of countries you have signed free-trade agreements with. But the \ntwo regions we are talking about adding to the ranks of those that have \ntrade agreements with the United States would represent the bulk of the \nglobal economy. We are talking about a swath of countries in Asia with \nvery low wages and then, ultimately, with the European trade agreement, \nthe whole of Europe.\n  All of a sudden, we don't have a small exception to the ``Buy \nAmerican'' rule, we have a truck-sized exception to the ``Buy \nAmerican'' rule, rendering it almost obsolete and unenforceable at that \npoint, because then almost any country that is producing a good can \napply for the trade-agreement waiver.\n  So we have a series of amendments that would try to tighten up this \nparticular waiver, this particular option built into trade agreements. \nThe amendment I hope to offer simply says that if you want this waiver \naround the ``Buy American'' law, then you have to show that, No. 1, the \nresult of moving the work overseas won't cause a U.S. company to go \nunder--and I can give examples of when that has happened--and, No. 2, \nyou have to prove it you can't find it in the United States--that your \nonly option is to go overseas because you can't find it in the United \nStates. If there is an American company making it for a reasonable \nprice, then that company should be able to get that waiver.\n  Now, it doesn't take away all the other waivers. There is a waiver, \nfor instance, that says if you can get it much cheaper overseas, then \nyou can go overseas. We don't eliminate that waiver. We just say you \nhave to prove you can't get it in the United States and you can't get \nit for a reasonable price in the United States, and then this waiver \nwould apply.\n  I think all of our constituents would support trade agreements that \nmake sure our taxpayer dollars being used to buy goods for the United \nStates get used, preferentially, on American companies. And simply by \ntightening up this loophole in the ``Buy American'' law, we will \nprotect a lot of jobs.\n  How do we know that? Because in 2013, the last year for which we have \nrecords, there were 1,200 of these waivers approved--1,200 waivers for \nexisting countries with free-trade agreements--worth $500 million worth \nof goods. That is $500 million worth of work that would have gone to \nU.S. companies that went to foreign companies because of this waiver \nthat said that any country that has a free-trade agreement just doesn't \nhave to worry about the ``Buy American'' clause. That is 1,200 today. \nImagine how many that will be in a year if we were to add all of the \ncountries in TPP and all of the countries in TTIP. We are talking about \nfactors of two and three and four added to that number.\n  So all I am asking for at this point is a debate. Let us just make \nsure on this seminal issue, the preference that we give American \ncompanies for work paid for by Federal taxpayers, that we have a \ndiscussion about that on the floor of the Senate at some point over the \ncourse of this week. Members can choose to vote up or down. They can \nchoose to support American companies. They can choose to support the \noutsourcing of American taxpayer work. But let us have a discussion on \nit. We don't need 3 weeks, like we did last time, but be probably need \na couple more days.\n  This is as big as you get for the Senate. We are debating giving away \nour power to amend a major trade obligation of the U.S. Government. Let \nus have a debate about the consequences of that with respect to \nAmerican companies.\n  It would make a difference to one set of people in my district, and I \nwill end on this--the former workers of Ansonia Copper & Brass. This is \na company that made copper-nickel tubing for our submarines. They were \nthe only American company that made this copper-nickel tubing, and they \nhad a competitor in Europe that was trying to take their business away. \nBecause of a waiver to the ``Buy American'' law, the contract was \nawarded by the Department of Defense to the European firm and taken \naway from Ansonia Copper & Brass. Because of that waiver to the ``Buy \nAmerican'' law, Ansonia Copper & Brass went out of business. We now \nhave no ability in the United States to produce copper-nickel tubing. \nSome of the most important components to the American sub fleet in the \nUnited States--gone. Our capacity has ended. And you can't just rebuild \nthis, because this is a really specialized kind of material, a really \nspecialized kind of product. Once that equipment, once that expertise \nis gone, you can't just start it back overnight. That has real security \nconsequences for the United States.\n  I would argue that, even more importantly, it has serious economic \nconsequences for the men and women who were laid off about a year ago \nfrom Ansonia Copper & Brass, because of an ill-thought-out waiver to \nthe ``Buy American'' clause that compromises our economic security and \nour national security. Let us just pledge to have a debate about that \non the floor of the Senate before we come to a final vote on trade \npromotion authority.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I want to take a moment to add to what \nmy partner on the Portman-Stabenow amendment has said on the floor. I \nappreciate working with Senator Portman on this important issue. I find \nit very interesting, as we are debating--as other colleagues have \nsaid--a policy that allows the administration to go ahead and negotiate \na trade agreement where we voluntarily give up our right to change, to \namend, and that we voluntarily, as a Congress, say we are not going to \nallow anyone to object to make it a 60-vote threshold. So we are giving \nthem the fast-track authority. The tradeoff, the way we are supposed to \nbe doing that is by setting up a set of negotiating objectives and\n\n[[Page S3040]]\n\nexpectations for what will be negotiated in the agreements. That is the \ndeal here--fast-track authority, setting up the expectations. What we \nbelieve on behalf of our constituents, the people we represent, are the \nmost important things that we want to make sure are covered: \nenforcement, strong labor and environmental standards, and the No. 1 \ntrade distorting policy in the world today, which is currency \nmanipulation.\n  We want to be able to say, if you are going to get this special \nability to take away our right to change something, then we expect \ncertain things. We expect that we are going to be negotiating from a \nposition of strength so that we are racing up in the world economy, \nbringing other countries up in terms of wages, what is happening in \nterms of protecting our environment, protecting our intellectual \nproperty rights, stopping other countries from cheating on currency or \nother trade violations. We want to create a race up, not a race to the \nbottom, not a race to the bottom where the comments are this: Well, if \nyou would only work for less, we can be competitive. If we only take \naway your pension, if we only take away your health care, if we only \nmake sure that we do not enforce our trade laws, we can be competitive. \nObviously, that makes no sense.\n  In the area of currency, what Senator Portman and I are doing is \nputting forth the very straightforward case that there should be a \nnegotiating objective that is enforceable, that is tied to IMF \ndefinitions. It makes it clear that we are not talking about our \ndomestic policies. We are not talking about Fed policies. We are not \ntalking about quantitative easing. We are talking about the foreign \ncurrency policies that under the International Monetary Fund, 188 \ncountries, including the Asian countries we are negotiating with, have \nall signed up to agree to. All signed on the dotted line--the United \nStates, Japan, all the countries that we are talking about--that they \nwill not manipulate their currency.\n  The problem is they still do. The problem is that Japan, after \nsigning on the dotted line under the International Monetary Fund, has \nover the last 25 years manipulated the currency 376 times. We are \nsaying that if we are going to let you go into a negotiation and come \nout with a trade agreement of 40 percent of the global economy in Asia \nand where we are seeing the bulk of the currency manipulation, then we \nbelieve there ought to be an enforceable standard, that we ought to \nhave an expectation of a currency manipulation provision that would be \nenforceable at least as a negotiating objective. That is what we are \ntalking about.\n  You would think--it is unbelievable the reaction. I understand after \nworking with many, many Secretaries of the Treasury--and I have \nincredible respect and admiration for our current Secretary--but every \nSecretary under every President I have had the opportunity to work \nwith--Democrat or Republican--all believe the same: Do not get into \nthis area of policy. I understand that. I do. I respect it. I disagree \nin this case, but I understand that reaction. But when we are talking \nabout a 21st-century framework on trade and what we need to do in \nenforcement--and we passed a customs bill that has incredibly important \nenforcement provisions in it. I am pleased that a number of those are \nones that I have been working on--that Senator Lindsey Graham and I \nhave been working on for years--provisions that are in that bill.\n  I am very pleased to see that the broader currency issue is addressed \nin there that Senator Schumer, Senator Graham, Senator Brown, and I and \nothers have been working on for years, trying to not be in the Trans-\nPacific Partnership negotiations, as we know. All of these things are \ngood to be able to do. But if we are going to do that, we need to \naddress--as has been quoted by one of our auto manufacturers--the \nmother of all trade barriers, which is currency manipulation. We know \nit is going on.\n  On the one hand, we hear from those on the other side that it is a \npoison pill to put this in the fast-track authority. The question is, \nWhy? Why is it a poison pill? Why is it a poison pill?\n  Well, because Japan will not like it. Japan will walk away from TPP. \nWell, on the other side we hear that the Bank of Japan does not do \ncurrency manipulation anymore. They do not do it anymore. Why do we \nhave to worry about it if they do not do it anymore?\n  If they do not do it anymore, then why in the world would they walk \naway from a negotiation if we have a negotiating objective on currency? \nIt makes you wonder. Do they want to go from 376 times to 377 times? \nThat is what I would assume, if that is that important that it would \nkill an entire agreement with 12 different countries to have a \nnegotiating principle in there on currency. It is not just Japan, \nalthough, that is the major concern. We have seen this happen in \nSingapore, Malaysia, and other countries. If they do not intend to use \nthat as a way to get an edge, to beat us on an unlevel playing field, \nthen why in the world would they care? That is the question.\n  They cannot have it both ways. They cannot say they are not doing it \nanymore. But if we put this in there, somehow we are not going to be \nable to get this agreement. Our job in a global economy is to make sure \nthe rules are fair for our businesses and our workers.\n  So far, it is estimated that we have lost some 5 million jobs and \ncounting because of just one thing--currency manipulation. What is \nthat? That means that Japan builds an automobile, and they sell it \nsomeplace else. When they are using the Bank of Japan to manipulate \ntheir currency, they are able to get a discount on the price \nartificially. We are told, on average anywhere from $6,000 to $11,000 \non the price of an automobile. That is a lot when you are competing.\n  It is not a differential because they are more efficient at \nmanufacturing or even paying their people less. It is because they \ncheat. It is because they cheat. It is not about selling into Japan, \nwhich is very difficult right now. But we also know that even if we \ntook away the nontariff trade barriers, they have a culture of wanting \nto buy their own automobiles, which I wish we shared. It would be less \nof an issue if we in America were buying American. But the concern is \nthat in a global economy, American companies are competing with \nJapanese companies to go into India--over a billion people--or Brazil \nor the Middle East or everyplace between America and Japan.\n  If we are creating this huge trade agreement and we do not address \nthe fact that they can compete with us for those customers in other \ncountries in an unfair way and we do not deal with that, we are forcing \nour manufacturers to try to compete with their hands tied behind their \nback. Why would we do that?\n  It is our job to make sure they have every opportunity to succeed--\nevery opportunity--and that their playing field is level. How many \ntimes do we all say those words: ``level playing field,'' ``level \nplaying field.''\n  We are hearing from manufacturers who want to trade. These are global \ncompanies that always support trade agreements. They are saying to us: \nPay attention here. This is an issue that has gotten out of hand, that \nwe need in the framework when we are negotiating a trade agreement with \n40 percent of the global economy. For the places that manipulate the \ncurrency, we need to make sure they are not doing that.\n  That is what the Portman-Stabenow amendment takes a step to do. I \nwould like to go even further and say that you do not get fast-track \nauthority unless you have strong currency enforcement in the agreement. \nThis is not that far. This is, in fact, the reasonable middle. It says \nwe are going to have a strong negotiating objective that is tied to \nenforceable standards under the International Monetary Fund, the WTO, \nthat it is a negotiating principle and we expect that to be in there. \nWe expect it to be in there. But it does not have the hammer of saying \nyou would not get fast-track authority because we want this to be \nsomething that has strong bipartisan support, that comes to the middle \nhere in terms of what is viewed as reasonable and supporting the \nability to have flexibility in negotiations and so on.\n  For the life of me, I do not understand the reaction on the other \nside in terms of the statements that this is a poison pill or that this \nis some outrageous thing to say that along with protecting intellectual \nproperty rights and focusing on labor standards and environmental \nprotection, that we would have a negotiating objective on currency.\n  We do not dictate the outcome of it, which I would love to do. We do \nnot do\n\n[[Page S3041]]\n\nthat. We say, you have to put forward your best efforts here, and you \nhave to put folks on notice that we are serious because this is one of \nour negotiating objectives. When it is time for the vote, I hope that \nit will be in this next group of amendments.\n  We appreciate very much that the amendment is pending, and we look \nforward to a vote. We would like very much to see that happen this \nevening. There is no reason not to have it. We are ready to have that \nvote. I think we have about 25 percent of the whole Senate now as \ncosponsors, and we would love to have more. This is a bipartisan \namendment. It is reasonable, and it tackles the No. 1 trade distorting \nbarrier right now in the global economy, which is currency \nmanipulation. It does it in a responsible way.\n  I will close by saying this. Again, we hear that this is a poison \npill because the main folks who have been currency manipulating, who \nwould be part of the TPP, do not want this, do not want anything saying \nthe word ``currency'' that would be possibly enforceable.\n  We are hearing that the Bank of Japan is not doing it anymore, so you \ndo not need the language. But, by the way, they will walk away from the \nagreement if you have it in the language in there. You cannot have it \nboth ways. Either they intend to do it again, and that is why they are \nobjecting to an agreement with any kind of currency manipulation \nenforcement, or they are not going to do it again and it should not \nmatter. They can't have it both ways on this debate. The fact that \nfolks are trying to have it both ways makes me very concerned about \nwhat is really going on in the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator Portman in passing this \nvery reasonable amendment to make currency manipulation a priority in \nour negotiations.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I second the words of the senior Senator \nfrom Michigan. She is exactly right about the importance of currency. \nAs she said, it is a negotiating objective. Frankly, I wish we could \nwrite even stronger language because we know that the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative--whether it is a Trade Representative serving a Democrat \nor a Republican--doesn't pay quite as much attention to the negotiating \nobjectives as we want. But there is no reason we shouldn't write strong \nnegotiating objectives. Senator Stabenow's amendment with my colleague \nfrom Ohio is exactly the right major step forward.\n  I wish to make one other comment. I believe Senator Franken, Senator \nBoxer, and Senator Whitehouse are coming to the floor, along with \nSenator Murphy, Senator Casey, Senator Warren, and Senator Stabenow, to \nspeak about amendments that really matter to TPA. There are literally \nalmost two dozen Democratic Senators and I believe at least 8 or 10 \nRepublican Senators--I am not sure of that number--who have good, \nsolid, substantive amendments. That is why I want to see us do what \nSenator McConnell has talked about, and that is have a full hearing and \nairing of amendments that are substantive. There are dozens of \nsubstantive amendments offered by at least a couple dozen Senators.\n  I wish to refer to one thing my colleague from Ohio said earlier, \nbefore Senator Stabenow's speech, and that is about the amendment that \nrefers to leveling the playing field, which we have been working on and \nwhich is all about trade enforcement. I jotted down one thing he said, \nwhich I want to emphasize. He said that by the time our government is \nable to prove injury and prove an unfair trade practice, the injury is \nalready so great to our workers and our companies. He expanded on that, \nand I wish to expand on that for a moment.\n  I have spent hours and hours over the years visiting plants in Ohio \nand seeing what happened to a number of our companies and the workers \nwho work at those companies when countries such as South Korea engage \nin unfair trade practices, whether it is steel, coated paper, tires, or \ndumping oil country tubular steel--dumping means they may subsidize \ncapital. In addition to lower wages, it may be water, energy, or land. \nHaving lower wages is not an unfair trade practice, but the other \nexamples are. We know what that means. It means that our workers can't \ncompete when they don't play fair.\n  Whether it is Colorado, Ohio, or Michigan, we follow the rule of law, \nso it takes a period of time to prove these companies are engaging in \nunfair trade practices. We see a number of these countries and \ncompanies--it may be Korea, China, or somewhere else--not just gaming \nthe currency system, but we see them so often not being forthcoming \neven though international laws require that they be forthcoming with \ninformation so we can process whether they, in fact, are subsidizing \ntheir production and dumping their product. They may give us inadequate \nor faulty information or they may give us purposely erroneous \ninformation. By the time we put together the trade case, small \nbusinesses, particularly in the supply chain, have gone out of business \nor have been damaged beyond their ability to survive long term, and so \noften, workers have been laid off.\n  I saw what happened in Lorain, OH, and I saw what has happened in \nCleveland and Gallipolis and Chillicothe. I saw what happened in \nTrumbull County, OH, and Youngstown, OH, when China and Korea cheated \non the oil country tubular steel issue.\n  Leveling the playing field will help us fight back. That is why so \nmany corporations and labor unions support this legislation.\n  It matters to our communities because when a plant closes and workers \nare laid off, it is not just those workers and those families who are \naffected, it devastates the community. Firefighters, teachers, and \npolice end up getting laid off, and the community is less safe. All of \nthose things happen because we don't stand up and enforce trade law, we \ndon't stand up for our international interests, and we don't stand up \nfor our economic security and our community interests. That is why the \nStabenow amendment on currency is so important, and that is why the \nBrown-Portman amendment is important--so we can level the playing \nfield.\n  We have at least half a dozen Republican sponsors, and we have a \nnumber of Democratic sponsors as well. That language was so \nuncontroversial that it was adopted in the Finance Committee in the \nmanagers' package in the underlying bill that Senator Hatch and Senator \nWyden negotiated at the beginning, about a month or so ago.\n  I applaud Senator Stabenow for her work on currency.\n  I urge my colleagues, first of all, to make the amendment on leveling \nthe playing field pending, and second, to move on this legislation.\n  I also appreciate the leadership Senator Whitehouse, who just joined \nus on the floor, has shown on these trade agreements.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I know Senator Whitehouse is here and I \nhave already spoken, but I wish to echo Senator Brown's strong appeal \nthat we vote on the leveling the playing field amendment. It is \ncritical.\n  We have seen communities across Michigan as well as throughout the \ncountry that have been devastated. We not only lose good-paying jobs \nwhen a plant closes, but we lose small businesses from across the \nstreet, and it affects the whole community.\n  This is an incredibly important amendment. I hope we will get a vote \non it. I believe the votes are here to support that amendment on a \nbipartisan basis, and I think it is critical that we vote and adopt it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I have an amendment which I wish to \ndiscuss.\n  About a year ago, we as a Senate, unanimously by a voice vote, \nratified four treaties that helped protect American fisheries from \nillegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing around the world. It is \ncalled pirate fishing. This was an effort by the Oceans Caucus. It was \nled by me and then-Senator Begich on our side and Senator Murkowski and \nSenator Wicker on the other side of the aisle. It was hotlined on both \nsides and cleared.\n  It is a useful treaty to be in. It is important for our American \nfishing industry to make sure that they are not being punished or \nharmed by foreign competitors who are not fishing\n\n[[Page S3042]]\n\nsustainably, fishing illegally, or violating the laws of the \njurisdiction in which they are fishing. Because of their misbehavior, \nthey are able to bring catch to market less expensively than fishermen \nwho play by the rules.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside so I \nmay call up my amendment No. 1387.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I understand there are issues on the \nfloor that need to be resolved and there are objections pending, but I \ndid wish to speak to this amendment. It is an amendment I hope can \neither get a vote or, because of its noncontroversial, bipartisan \nstatus, perhaps can be added at a time when there is a managers' \namendment or some means of dealing with noncontroversial additions to \nthis legislation.\n  So the objection having been made to my request, I will yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly on the trade \nlegislation before us and on the importance of considering and voting \non amendments that would improve it. I have submitted amendments of my \nown. I am co-leading a pair of amendments with Senator Baldwin, and \nthere are a number of very important amendments that I support.\n  We are talking about how we will consider trade agreements that would \ncover a major portion of the entire global economy. That is a very \nimportant subject, and I believe we need to fully debate this bill. I \nalso believe we need to have votes on a number of amendments to make \nthis bill better than it currently is.\n  I believe that when trade is done right, it can benefit our workers, \nour communities, and our businesses. But I am concerned that the fast-\ntrack procedures set up by the trade promotion authority bill we are \nconsidering will not do enough to make sure we do trade right. So, at a \nminimum, I believe we should debate and have votes on a number of \namendments that would considerably strengthen this bill.\n  I have submitted two amendments of my own. One of my amendments would \nstrengthen the negotiating objective on labor and environmental \nstandards in the trade promotion authority bill. Right now, the bill \neffectively says that partner countries violate those standards only \nwhen they fail to enforce labor or environmental laws on a sustained \nand recurring basis. The notion that violations of standards need to be \nsustained and recurring to really count as violations is not found \nelsewhere in the bill and doesn't hold with respect to, for example, \nintellectual property, digital trade, or regulatory practices. My very \nsimple amendment would take out ``sustained and recurring'' so that a \nlabor violation is a labor violation.\n  My other amendment is my Community College to Career Fund Act, which \nis designed to address the skills gap where there are jobs open in our \ncountry because there are not workers with the right skills to fill \nthem. Just like Senator Stabenow's amendment on renewing the community \ncollege portion of trade adjustment assistance, or TAA, of which I am a \ncosponsor, my amendment will bolster workforce development and \ntraining.\n  The community college portion of TAA has been successful in helping \nto retrain workers and communities that have been harmed by trade, and \nthat is a good thing. My amendment builds on this by helping community \ncolleges partner with business sectors in order to improve our ability \nto get people into jobs in manufacturing that are high-skilled jobs or \nin IT or in health care by providing them the skills they need. This \nwill make all of our communities more resilient and economically \nsuccessful.\n  I am also proud to co-lead two amendments with Senator Baldwin of \nWisconsin on our trade remedy laws. One would prevent trade \nnegotiations from weakening those laws, and the other would strengthen \nthe language in the TPA bill on trade remedy laws--the laws that \nenforce our trade policies and protect our domestic industries from \ndumped and subsidized imports from other countries.\n  In Minnesota, I have seen firsthand the damage that happens when we \ndon't have and, just as importantly, can't enforce strong trade \nprotections. In the last few months alone, we have seen what happens \nwhen other countries unfairly dump their goods here. In this case, it \nwas steel products. Nearly 1,000 Minnesotans are losing their jobs \nafter a flood of dumped steel imports. Our provisions stand up for \nAmerican manufacturers by putting in place and enforcing fair trade \npractices.\n  In addition to these amendments, there are many other important \namendments my colleagues have offered on currency manipulation, \ninvestor-state dispute settlement, ``Buy American,'' and a number of \nother issues.\n  I believe that these issues are worth debating and that we should be \nvoting on amendments on the important subjects which I have mentioned \nas well as on other important subjects.\n  In my view, this bill is in need of substantial improvement, and we \nshould not cut off the process of trying to make those improvements. We \nneed to be voting on amendments, and we need to be working to improve \nthis bill.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have been listening to colleagues speak \nabout the importance of having a very open process here where we can \noffer our amendments and make this fast-track a better deal for the \nmiddle class and for jobs in our Nation. It is rather shocking to \nrecognize that this huge agreement, which is going to cover 40 percent \nof trade in this world, is being jammed down our throats in a couple of \ndays. It is ridiculous. When we look at other agreements, they have had \nfar more time. We have well over 100 amendments filed and we have been \noffered 6 amendments.\n  I know the Senator from Washington has laid down the gauntlet on the \nEx-Im Bank. I support her. We have differing views on the underlying \nbill, but I think she is right because it is really hard to imagine \npassing this huge bill and then ignoring the fact that Ex-Im Bank is \ngoing to go away.\n  To me, as chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nrecognizing that the entire highway bill is ending--the entire highway \nprogram is ending on May 31--to take up this bill without taking care \nof that is absurd. To take up this bill before raising the minimum wage \nis ridiculous. To take up this bill before we make sure we have \ncomprehensive immigration reform so workers can come out of the shadows \nis just the height of insanity. To take up this bill before we have \ntaken up the Ex-Im Bank, as I know my friend from Washington has \nexplained, is absurd. We have deals that are pending with our small \nbusinesses through the Ex-Im Bank. They are going to be entirely \nupended.\n  So I took the majority leader at his word. I thought we were going to \nhave votes to put the enforcement inside this bill, and now that \ndoesn't appear to be happening.\n  Let me just tell my colleagues about the amendment I wish to offer. I \nthink it would pass here overwhelmingly. I have no illusions that we \nwill be allowed to vote on it, but it simply says: If a country doesn't \nhave a minimum wage of at least 2 bucks an hour, we can't fast-track a \ntrade agreement with that country. Let me reiterate. The amendment \nsimply says: You can't be fast-tracked if you don't pay at least $2 an \nhour.\n  Let's talk about it. Why is this important? I voted for fast-track \nfor NAFTA. What a mistake that was. President Clinton promised us the \nworld. Republicans and Democrats who were protrade promised us the \nworld. Do we know what happened? We lost 700,000 jobs, mostly in \nmanufacturing. What makes my colleagues think we are not going to see \nthese 12 million manufacturing jobs leave when Chile pays $1.91 an \nhour--$1.91 an hour. Malaysia pays $1.21 an hour. Peru pays $1.15 an \nhour. Mexico pays 80 cents an hour. Vietnam pays 58 cents an hour. \nBrunei and Singapore, well, they have no minimum wage at all.\n\n[[Page S3043]]\n\n  So we have a very simple amendment here which I don't believe I will \never get a chance to offer, but it is simple.\n  I know if I went outside and asked the average American how they felt \nand said: Do you think it is right for us to do a trade deal with \ncountries that pay poverty wages, slave wages to their people--how are \nwe going to compete with that? And people say: Oh, well, our workers \nare smarter.\n  That is right. But those workers, let me tell my colleagues, are very \nsmart in Chile and Malaysia and Peru and Mexico and Vietnam and Brunei \nand Singapore. They are very good. It is tragic that they are in \ncountries that pay them slave wages. That is this great deal we are \ngoing to make.\n  It is true that Australia has a very high minimum wage of $13.47; New \nZealand, $10.87; Canada, $8.69. And I am embarrassed to say ours is \nstill $7.25. Our States and cities are making up for it by raising \ntheir minimum wages. It is a tragedy. This is a race to the bottom. \nJapan has $6.51; and then we get to Chile at $1.91; Malaysia, $1.21; \nPeru at $1.15; Mexico at 80 cents; Vietnam at 58 cents; and Brunei and \nSingapore have no minimum wages whatsoever.\n  So I have this very good amendment, and I hope it makes it onto the \nlist, I say to the majority leader. Then I have a series of amendments \nthat deal with the environment.\n  If we are worried about an extrajudicial system to overturn our laws, \nall we have to do is look at what the World Trade Organization did \nyesterday when they said we cannot have country-of-origin labeling \nwithout getting tariffs put on our products. It had to do with beef. I \nam sure the Presiding Officer cares a lot about that. The fact is that \ncountry-of-origin labeling is critical. I want to know where the beef \ncomes from because there have been all kinds of tragedies with diseases \nwith beef, and I want to buy American. But the World Trade Organization \nsaid no. They said that is a trade barrier. Guess what it means? It \nmeans that if we don't cancel out that law, they are going to put \ntariffs not just on beef, they are going to put tariffs on wine, on our \nstrawberries, our fruits, our vegetables, everything. They are going to \nput tariffs on it.\n  So here we are about to go into this massive trade deal with \ncountries that pay slave wages, that have terrible environmental laws, \nwith an extrajudicial process where companies can sue our States, sue \nour Nation if they say that the laws we have are barriers, and we are \ngoing to do all this on a Thursday so people can go on their trips. Uh-\nuh. No. I say no. That is wrong. We need to have votes on all of these \nthings.\n  I will tell my colleagues, we could see polluters bringing cases in \nfront of this new extrajudicial body and saying: Sorry, but the Clean \nPower Plan is making us spend too much money. Toxic laws here in \nAmerica are making us spend too much money. Your laws against lead \npoisoning are making us spend too much money. Your laws controlling \nformaldehyde, California, are costing us too much money.\n  Then we are going to see lawsuits--and we have seen them in the \npast--and all we have to do is look at what happened with the WTO, the \nWorld Trade Organization, and we are in big trouble.\n  So on the one hand we are making a deal with seven nations that have \nslave wages or no minimum wage, so bye-bye, manufacturing; and \nsecondly, we have this extrajudicial body that Senator Elizabeth Warren \nhas been so eloquent about that can actually overrule America's laws \nand California's laws and Colorado's laws and Washington State's \nlaws. And I have a number of amendments here that state that if we have \nlaws that deal with toxic substances in toys--that is Boxer 1356--you \ncan't mess with that. I have another one that says if we have laws that \nreduce exposure to known cancer-causing substances, you can't overrule \nthose laws, but I can't get that on the list. My amendment is not on \nthe list.\n\n  I have one that says that if we have laws that make sure pesticides \nare safe, sorry, we are not going to stand by and allow this \nextrajudicial process to work. That should be exempted, and toxic gas \npollutants should be exempted, such as mercury and asbestos exposure. \nSo all of my amendments make sure we do not enter into new trade \nagreements that have the effect of changing our longstanding \nenvironmental principle of ``polluters pay'' into ``polluters get \npaid.'' That is what this is about. A polluter can sue in this trade \nagreement.\n  I went downstairs. I had to give up all my electronics. I couldn't \ntake notes with me, but I know enough to see what this is about. A \npolluter can go and make the case that Colorado or California has \nprotective laws, and, by God, it made them pay more money to produce \ntheir products, and they ask for millions of dollars.\n  This is not a fiction. This has happened in past trade agreements. \nBelieve me. Countries have paid through the nose and have had to repeal \ntheir laws. So we are rushing into a fast-track vote on something that \nis very dangerous. It is dangerous to the middle class. It is dangerous \nfor jobs. And we are pushing it ahead of things that we ought to be \ndoing, such as raising the minimum wage, passing the Ex-Im Bank, \npassing immigration laws, putting together the funding for a highway \nbill. We haven't raised the gas tax in 20 years. If we raise it a penny \nevery quarter till we raise about 6 cents or 8 cents, it would cost the \naverage driver 30 bucks. We can fix the 69 bridges that are collapsing. \nWe can fix the 50 percent of roads that are out of compliance and not \nsafe. And we can create 3 million jobs. But, oh, no, we are not doing \nthat agenda for the middle class. We are doing things that threaten the \nmiddle class and that further threaten the health and safety of our \npeople.\n  So I hope working with Senator McConnell and Senator Brown and \nSenator Wyden, we can get a path forward here to hear our amendments.\n  We have a promise from the majority leader: This is a new day.\n  The press asked me: Is this a new day in the Senate with Senator \nMcConnell? I said no--not.\n  I can't get my amendments in. I have 10 amendments up. I can't get \nthem on any list. Maybe it is because they don't want to vote on this--\nthe protrade people. They don't want to vote to say that any deal with \na country that doesn't pay at least two bucks an hour can't be fast-\ntracked. It is a hard vote. It is a hard vote, and I want that vote. So \nI am going to do everything in my power to solve this. I am going to \nuse every tool at my disposal. I know the Senator from Washington is \nalready doing it for me, in a way, but I stand as a backup here, \nbecause I don't like this being jammed down the throats of the people. \nThis is wrong.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, these trade agreements are big deals. \nTrade promotion authority used to mean setting tariffs. Now they can \naffect everything from the safety of our food to the working conditions \nof people around the world and environmental standards. Very frankly \nand simply, that means that Americans should know what the agreements \nsay and what our government is saying about them, and they should be \ngiven that information while there is a meaningful chance to influence \nthem.\n  I hope to influence them through this deliberative process. It is \nsupposed to be open and transparent. I have two amendments--one that \nwould promote greater transparency in trade agreements and the second \nto help ensure that foreign countries cannot use trade agreements to \nundermine the safety and security of America's food supply.\n  First, on the subject of transparency, nothing is more fundamental \nthan for the American people to know what is in these trade agreements. \nDespite their significance, despite the far-reaching ramifications and \nimplications they have for our American economy and, indeed, our way of \nlife, they are being negotiated in secret. In fact, Members of Congress \ncan view them only if they go to secure locations, and staff of Members \nof Congress can see them only if they are accompanied by the Members \nthemselves. The real problem is not Members of Congress or their staff \nbut the American public who are kept in the dark. They are the supposed \nbeneficiaries of these deals, and yet they are kept from knowing what \nis in them. The TPA would allow the text of an agreement to be made \npublic only after it is already finalized--a point that is way too late \nfor the people most directly and urgently affected by the deals to do \nanything but try to get Congress to vote down\n\n[[Page S3044]]\n\nthe whole thing in its entirety at once. That is not productive. That \nis not fair.\n  More transparency would allow issues over a particular provision to \nbe resolved individually on their own. This kind of practice is not in \naccordance with our democratic condition, an open and transparent \nprocess to set policy--whether it is trade policy or any other issue of \neconomic and political consequence.\n  So making the TPA more transparent is a relatively easy fix. My \namendment would do it. This amendment would require the publication of \n``formal proposals advanced by the United States in negotiations for a \ntrade agreement.''\n  ``Formal proposals advanced by the United States in negotiations for \na trade agreement''--that means that the United States, when it takes \nan official position and offers it to another country, ought to tell \nthe American people, its own people--not just the people who are rulers \nof another country but our own people. They have a right to know when \nthis administration or any other offers something to people of another \ncountry, and my amendment would require that basic protection and \ntransparency.\n  Very importantly, this amendment would not prohibit confidential \nnegotiations or closed-door deliberations. Some off-the-record \ndiscussion, no question, is necessary for effective consideration of \nany multilateral agreement. And this amendment would not affect \nnegotiations specifically relating to tariffs and similar market-access \nprovisions that are the traditional subjects of trade negotiations.\n  Some negotiations have to be done in confidence--in private--but \nbasic positions, official proposals, are outside of this realm--\nproposals that look more like traditional legislative policymaking, \nbecause they can involve give or take, sacrifices from the American \npeople, and give and take by other countries. They can align standards \nfor regulations across a number of areas, from drug development to \nfinance.\n  Other countries can be encouraged. They can be empowered to adopt \nstronger protections for workers, for clean air and water and more. But \nharm can be done if trade agreements undermine American laws and \nAmerican protections for health, safety, and security of our citizens.\n  There are a number of amendments that I have supported that will \ndirectly address labor issues, environmental issues, and security \nissues. This amendment would simply ensure that all of these issues are \nconsidered in an open, fair, and transparent way, so the American \npeople--not just we in this Chamber, not just our negotiators, not just \nthe President and his advisers--know what is happening.\n  Publication of formal proposals, which is a term of art in trade \nagreements, would bring American transparency practice in line with the \ngeneral practices of our European allies. The European Union countries \nengaged in the TTIP negotiations announcing that they will post on the \nInternet all textual proposals that will be offered to the United \nStates, as well as position papers, establishing their approach and \nanalysis. And America should simply do the same. We are a nation that \nprides itself on leading the world in transparency, openness, and \ndemocracy. We should not be behind our European allies on that score.\n  I am very grateful for the support of Senator Brown, a tremendous \nleader in this effort to ensure that American trade agreements work for \nthe American people, as well as Senator Baldwin and Senator Udall. And \nI urge other colleagues to support this amendment and the other \namendments that I am offering on food safety.\n  And I am grateful, again, to have the support of Senator Brown on \nthis one. It would establish as a principal negotiating objective of \nthe United States the protection and promotion of strong food safety \nlaws as well as regulations and inspections. Enforcement is key. \nStandards are vital. Ensuring that trade agreements do not weaken or \ndiminish our food safety standards ought to be a given.\n  We take for granted all too often that our food is safe until we \ndiscover that it isn't, until we find there are food poisonings and \ntragedies that result from unsafe food. We saw it at the beginning of \nthe last century. Unscrupulous corporations can cut corners by skimping \non food safety or worse, by introducing dangerous additives or \nadulterations to foods, making them or processing them under unsafe or \nunacceptable conditions. They may save money, but they sacrifice lives \nand safety. The consequences in real lives and real time can be \ndisastrous--not only in lives but in dollars.\n  The majority of food manufacturers and producers take their safety \nresponsibilities seriously. The majority in this country certainly do. \nBut what about abroad? What about in another country? What about in \ncountries where the standards are nonexistent or not enforced? A \ncampaign of dedicated advocacy and scientific research led to a system \nof food inspection in this country, which is far from perfect but way \nahead of other countries, and it gives Americans the confidence they \nneed and deserve to walk into any supermarket or restaurant in this \ncountry and feel trust--deserved because it is earned and because the \nlaws are enforced.\n  Not all countries, unfortunately, follow these practices. Few \ncountries have the standards that ours does. Food production is still \nunder-inspected, spoiled or adulterated in those countries, and that is \nthe product that we want excluded from this country if they fail to \nmeet those standards. I am concerned that this trade agreement will \naffect our own food safety regulations by introducing those deficient \nproducts--unsafe food--into this country.\n  My amendment directs negotiators to ensure that imports of that food \ndo not undermine the trust and confidence of our people in our own food \nsupply as well as products from abroad. Countries with less stringent \nstandards in protecting their citizens should not be permitted to use \ntrade agreements to force this country to imitate them.\n  Trade is a crucial part of the American economy. It is an essential \npart of our Connecticut economy. Trade, when it is done right, is a \ngreat boon to many people and our entire economy. Defense and \naerospace, small manufacturers, furniture and food companies in \nConnecticut all thrive because of trade. I want the world to see what \nConnecticut businesses have to offer, what our exports can do for them.\n  I know we can compete with anyone. I know how important exports are \nto my State, but I also know trade deals can have negative, unintended \nconsequences, which is what we want to prevent; consequences in abuses \nby foreign governments seeking to subvert or circumvent American \nregulations or by giant multinational companies looking to move jobs \nand capital to where labor is cheapest and can be exploited easiest or \nwhere health or environmental protections are weakest.\n  My amendments would help ensure that the American people know what \nare in these trade agreements before they are approved, while they are \nnegotiated, and when our food can be protected and transparency \nassured.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, during this trade debate, we have often \nheard a lot about the words ``enforcement'' or ``enforceable,'' \nparticularly the phrase ``enforceable labor and environmental \nstandards.'' But the fact is there are no enforceable labor and \nenvironmental standards. There is no new generation of treaty in the \nTPP that is going to create something we have not had before.\n  What we have had before has simply failed us. Why is that? Well, we \nhad side agreements on labor and the environment in NAFTA. Much is made \nof the fact that, well, we are not going to have side agreements \nanymore; we are actually going to put these standards right in the \ntreaty itself. So somehow folks are arguing in support of this treaty \nthat moving the print from over here to here somehow makes is it more \neffective.\n  That is not the case. We had the same labor and environmental \nstandards in the agreements we passed a few years ago, agreements I \nvoted against--the agreement with Colombia, the agreement with Korea.\n  But what have we seen over time? Have we ever seen any of these labor \nobjectives and these environmental standards enforced? Let me give you \na sense of what we are talking about.\n\n[[Page S3045]]\n\nUnder the International Labor Organization, ILO, they have a set of \nstandards. They have lots of details. But there are things like freedom \nof association and the right to collective bargaining and elimination \nof forced labor or compulsory labor, as it is referred to, the \nabolition of child labor, the elimination of discrimination in the \nworkplace.\n  Certainly, at the heart of this--back to the right of collective \nbargaining--is the right of unions to organize, the right of workers to \ntalk to each other and to bargain for a fair return for their efforts. \nBut have we ever enforced a single ILO provision? No, we have not. In \nfact, we have only challenged the terrible labor practices in another \nnation once; that is, Guatemala. That went through years before we \nofficially challenged it, and now it is still not resolved some 8 years \nafter it was first challenged.\n  Is there anything new that changes the process in the anticipated \nTrans-Pacific Partnership? No, it is the same process: put in the ILO \nstandards and hope people will aspire to honor them--hope, the same \nhope that has failed us time and time again in treaty after treaty. So \nthe next time someone comes to this floor and says there is an \nenforceable labor standard, no one should believe it because it is not \nthere.\n  We have not enforced one labor standard, not one. Guatemala is the \nonly one we have challenged, and that one, after 8 years, we still have \nnot resolved it. How about environmental standards? Have we filed \nchallenges on environmental standards? What are these environmental \nstandards? Well, basically it is a requirement to honor international \ntreaties.\n  No, these things are violated all over the place, but we have not \nchallenged them a single time. Now, why is it that the United States \ndoes not challenge these violations? Well, first, it has to be a \ngovernment-to-government action, when an issue is raised and folks are \ntold: Hey, government, U.S. Government, you really should do something \nabout trade unionists being murdered in Colombia.\n  Well, no, if we object, it will create ripples in the relationship. \nSo the U.S. Government does not want to take action. It does not want \nto create ripples in the relationship. But if pressed, folks come and \nsay: You know, it really matters that you said you would enforce this, \nU.S. Government, but you are not. You should really do something.\n  Well, you know, if we object to the way they are conducting \nthemselves in regard to labor and environmental standards, there will \nbe retaliatory actions against the United States. Then it will just be: \nWe will challenge them, they will challenge us, and it will go on for \nyears and years. It will disrupt the whole relationship. Why would we \ndo that?\n  If that is not enough, then if the government, our government, is \nreally serious about enforcing something, then the companies that have \ninvested in that nation, then they come forward and say: Wait. The \nwhole goal of this trade agreement was to create a stable environment \nfor investing. If you challenge and try to have them honor the labor \nand environmental provisions, ultimately, not only will it produce \nretaliatory actions that will be potentially harmful, but if you should \nwin somewhere down the line, that means there may be tariffs on the \nproducts that we produce in that country and they will not be able to \nenter the United States. Please do not mess up our investment in that \nnation.\n  So for these reasons, there has been no enforcement--none. Again, \nthere was one effort in Guatemala never resolved. There is nothing new \nin this anticipated Trans-Pacific Partnership that would operate any \ndifferently.\n  How about if we had snapback provisions? We have been talking quite a \nlot on the situation with Iran, that if we reach an agreement with them \nin June, Congress is going to want to make sure that if there are \nviolations of the agreement, that the controls on Iranian trade that \nhave been effective in bringing them to the negotiating table will snap \nback into place to make sure folks really respond in Iran to honoring \nthe agreement.\n  Is there any snapback provision anticipated, new strategy, this new \ntool to make sure the agreements are actually honored? No, there are \nnot. So the old system has not worked. There is no new system. There \nhas been no enforcement. Anyone who tells you there are enforceable \nlabor and environmental standards is not telling you the truth because \nthere are not. That is why we need to change the negotiations.\n  Now, the goal of fast-track was to lay out a series of objectives for \nthe U.S. Government to pursue in writing an agreement on trade with \nother nations.\n  This is a little bit complicated now, because when you raise up an \nidea and say this should be addressed, the administration says, well, \nyes, but we have already negotiated this treaty. We cannot go back to \nthe negotiating table and change it. We are 95 to 98 percent complete.\n  So, for example, we have been raising the issue of currency \nmanipulation. This is a fundamental--fundamental--provision of what \nshould be in a trade agreement, because when you get rid of a tariff, \nyou can create an effective tariff on your trading partner's products \nand a subsidy on your own through intervention in the currency markets. \nIt is known as currency manipulation. It should be covered, but it is \nnot.\n  When you talk to the administration, the administration says we just \ncannot go back and talk about things that we have not already put on \nthe table. So that would be unacceptable for us to take on this \nimportant provision now because we have already negotiated the \nagreement.\n  Well, then, what is really the point of fast-track, if it is not to \nlay out the standards that are expected for an agreement? In that case, \nit is nothing but a rubberstamp for an already negotiated treaty that \ndoes not meet the things that folks in this room are saying are \nimportant to have. In that case, it just simply becomes a greased track \nfor approving the treaty or the agreement, as it is referred to. It is \nnot referred to as a treaty. Why not? When it creates an international \nbody that can assess fines on the United States, does that not qualify \nas a treaty? No. Because the folks who are negotiating this do not want \nit to be subject to the supermajority that the Constitution requires \nfor a treaty. So they say we will call it an agreement. That will fix \nthat. Now it is only a simple majority vote, and we will get this fast-\ntrack under the argument that Congress is getting a chance to say what \nneeds to be in the treaty--but not really because we refuse to take any \nitem we haven't already put in the agreement.\n  So that is really the state of affairs. That is why, instead of \nsimply having negotiating objectives, we need to have negotiating \nstandards that have to be met before an agreement is brought back to \nthis body under the fast-track rule. Objectives are just wishful \nthinking, wishful thinking that you have some type of ``enforceable \nlabor provisions,'' wishful thinking that there are some forms of \nenforceable environmental standards.\n  Is that really enough? Is that all we are asking for is a little bit \nof wishful thinking, when we already know it is not going to be \nhonored? So let's put in mandatory negotiating objectives in these two \ncategories. That is why I have submitted amendment No. 1369. I ask \nunanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside and that my \namendment be brought up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I am saddened to hear that there is an objection in a context in \nwhich the majority leader has argued that he is going to have a robust \nand open amendment process. So why is there an objection to bringing an \namendment forward to debate a core issue, which speech after speech \nafter speech in support of this agreement--this fast-track to \naccelerate consideration of TPP--has referred to enforceable labor \nstandards? Why not debate an amendment that would actually require \nenforceable labor standards? Why not?\n  Well, because apparently that is not a serious goal. Let's turn to \nanother piece of this. There is a part of this system referred to as \n``dispute settlement,'' an international system of dispute settlement, \nISDS. What this does is it sets up a tribunal not subject to American \nlaw. It is an international tribunal, has one person chosen by America \nand one chosen by a foreign\n\n[[Page S3046]]\n\ninvestor and one chosen by the combination.\n  This group, this ISDS, is empowered to apply a series of standards \nand say that an action by our country has damaged the interest of a \nforeign investor, and the foreign investor must be compensated or, if \nthey are not compensated, that the law has to be changed. Well, really \nthis whole concept was generated to protect American investments in \ncountries that had weak judicial systems because that way, if you had \nan investment and the foreign country tried to expropriate it, change \nthe law so you could not sell what you were making or something of that \nnature, there was a way to address that.\n  One can understand why American businesses would want that sort of \nstability. You can also understand why countries with poor judicial \nsystems would want to sign on to such a system in order to encourage \ninvestment in their country. They want the jobs. They want that foreign \ninvestment.\n  But in the United States, we have a good judicial system. Why would \nwe allow it to be displaced by an international tribunal--a tribunal \nthat has not even been approved through the treaty process, mandated in \nthe Constitution? Why would we give the power to three corporate \nlawyers who have conflicts of interest--there is no prohibition on \nconflicts of interest for the members who serve as judges--and allow \nthem to rule on our consumer laws, allow them to rule on our public \nhealth laws, allow them to rule on our environmental laws? Quite \nfrankly, that is giving away a significant piece of our sovereignty, \ncarving a big hole out of our judicial system and handing it over to an \ninternational tribunal. If that doesn't constitute something that \nshould qualify for treaty status--giving away a chunk of sovereignty \nout of our judicial system--I don't know what would qualify for a \ntreaty. But this little slick game is underway of calling it an \nagreement in order to bypass our constitutional standard. And what does \nthat mean? That means if a State says ``We no longer want to allow \nchemicals to be put into our carpets because those flame retardants are \ncausing cancer in our children,'' a foreign investor who has set up a \nfactory to make flame retardants can file suit against the United \nStates and say they have been damaged as a foreign investor. The \nforeign investor gets rights that do not belong to in-country \ninvestors. Why should we give special rights to foreign investors that \nAmerican investors do not have?\n  Why should we proceed and have a labeling law on e-cigarettes--a new \nchallenge, if you will? Let's say, for example, that we require \nmandatory caps, childproof caps on the bottles. Let's say we banned the \nflavorings on e-cigarettes. Those flavorings are things such as double \nchocolate delight or any other number of candy flavors, bubble gum--you \nname it. If it sounds like candy, there is a container of liquid \nnicotine with that name on it. So you take away the flavorings, you \ngreatly diminish the sales targeted at our youth.\n  Why would we control the flavorings? Well, we passed a law in 2009 \nthat gave that power to the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration. The \nFood and Drug Administration has done an initial draft deeming \nregulation. Under this draft deeming regulation, they attempt to \ncontrol or perhaps may control the flavorings. They would do so because \ncigarette companies--that is, tobacco companies--are targeting our \nchildren because they know that addiction occurs before the age of 21. \nYou want to get our middle school and high school children puffing on \ne-cigarettes so that they will be addicted before they reach 21 because \nby then the brain has developed to the degree that people rarely get \naddicted.\n  So we, in protection of the health of our children, have seriously \nconsidered--created a framework for regulating this candy-flavored \nattack on the health of our youth. That is why we do it, for the \nprotection of our youth. But along comes a foreign investor who set up \na factory to create liquid nicotine and says: I can't sell my product \nnow because I invested in all this equipment to do all these candy \nflavors and you are banning it. You either have to change your law or I \nget to be compensated.\n  So we should carve out of this ISDS settlement, if we have it at \nall--and I think it should be opt-in. A country that wants foreign \ninvestment because they know they have a shaky judicial system should \nopt into it. We would not opt in because we have a fair judicial \nsystem. But if it is going to exist, it should definitely carve out our \npublic health, our consumer laws, and our environmental laws. And that \nis exactly why I have amendment No. 1401.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside and amendment No. 1401 be called up.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines). Objection is heard.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I will keep pushing for consideration of my amendments, \nwhich are being banned from consideration on this floor, because if we \nare going to have a ``robust and open amendment process,'' we should, \nin fact, have a robust and open amendment process and consider these \nserious issues before us.\n  So let's turn to a third area, which is the fact that the Trans-\nPacific Partnership--you hear robust labor protections that level the \nplaying field. Well, a level playing field would involve roughly \nsimilar standards between countries. So is there anything that levels \nin any way the vast difference between the minimum wage in some of the \nprospective TPP countries and other countries? The answer is no, not a \nthing. The single most important labor differential between the nations \nis not addressed in any shape or form.\n  So if we were to look at the minimum wages, we would find, as the \nSenator from California noted earlier, that Brunei and Singapore have \nno minimum wage at all. Mexico and Vietnam are under $1 in minimum \nwage. Malaysia, Peru, and Chile are under $2.50. So basically we have 7 \ncountries out of this group of 12 that have a minimum wage that either \ndoesn't exist or is under roughly $2.50. That is very different from \nthe other five countries in this agreement. These are countries such as \nthe United States, with a minimum wage at $7.25--it should be higher, \nbut it is $7.25; Japan's is $8.17; Canada has a minimum wage of $9.75; \nNew Zealand, $11.18; and Australia's is $16.87--more than double the \nUnited States, which was surprising to me.\n  Well, if you have this vast difference and you have manufacturers in \nthe United States, Japan, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia, these \nmanufacturers would like to play off China against Malaysia and \nMalaysia against Vietnam and Vietnam against Mexico because that way \nthey can drive the lowest possible wages between these countries.\n  Let me be quick to say that there are American companies--highly \nresponsible American companies--that depend on overseas manufacturing \nthat are very careful in monitoring their subcontractors and the \nconditions in which their subcontractors operate. These are often the \nbrands that we know well, that are pillars in our community. But for \nevery one of those, there are dozens of contractors and subcontractors \nthat are seeking the lowest possible cost to make something, and that \nis why they want to play off these countries against each other. Oh, \nMalaysia, you are raising your minimum wage. Oh, you are enforcing your \nenvironmental standard. We are going to increase production in our \nVietnamese factory. Oh, Vietnam, you now are saying you want to honor \nthe ILO labor standard? Well, that is a problem. We are going to \nproduce more in our Mexico factory. So this is opening a race to the \nbottom.\n  If we are going to come to the floor--as many have--to say that there \nare fundamentally even labor standards between the countries in this \nagreement, shouldn't we have even standards? Shouldn't we have an even \nminimum wage standard or at a minimum at least require there to be a \nbase minimum wage and then have that raised over time for participants \nso as to reduce the differential between the highest paid and the \nlowest paid? Because not only does this system set up an ability and an \neffort to play off Malaysia against Mexico, against Vietnam, but it \nalso sets up a situation where the conversation is like this: Oh, so \nhere in America we are going to raise our minimum wage. Well, that \nmeans we are going to have to shift another 1,000 jobs somewhere else--\nmaybe to\n\n[[Page S3047]]\n\nMalaysia, maybe to Vietnam. Maybe we will use the WTO and go to China.\n  It has a big impact on suppressing living wages in our country, and \nwe have seen this impact. Since 1974, we have seen productivity soar in \nour country, but the actual return to workers, inflation adjusted, has \nbeen flat and then declining for the last 10 years. Families are having \na terribly difficult time getting by.\n  So not only do we have a stake in fairness not to create a race to \nthe bottom between Malaysia, Vietnam, Mexico, and Peru, but we also \nhave an incentive not to create a situation where U.S. living wages are \nconstantly eviscerated under the threat of shipping those jobs \noverseas. Well, maybe we will assemble it here, but we will do more of \nour subcomponents in those countries. And once you set up an effective, \nefficient factory overseas, it makes it easier and easier to ship \nthose.\n  That is why I have an amendment that says: At a minimum, let's fill \nthis gaping gap. Let's proceed to require there to be, as part of the \nnegotiations, the negotiation of a minimum wage for entry and for that \nminimum wage to be gradually increased in order to diminish the \ndisparities between the high-wage countries, of which there are five in \nthis agreement, and the low-wage countries, of which there are seven. \nThis would be good to end the play off of one low-wage country against \nanother, and it would be good to diminish the comparative advantage of \nlow-wage countries in terms of taking manufacturing out of the United \nStates. That is why I drafted amendment No. 1409.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside and for my amendment No. 1409 to be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I am zero for three now in terms of being able to get \nsubstantive amendments, serious amendments on this floor for debate, \nbut I will try to on one more, and this one is anchored in recent news \nthat we have seen the country-of-origin labeling--or COOL, as it is \ncalled--country-of-origin labeling standard knocked down just \nyesterday. What does this mean? This means it is going to be considered \na trade violation for us to inform Americans on where their meat comes \nfrom. Isn't it a fundamental right in our country to know where our \nfood comes from? Shouldn't we always have the right to know that? But \nwe have engaged in a trade agreement--a previous trade agreement--and \nnow the adjudicating body of that agreement says: No, no, no. That is \nunfair, to tell people where the meat comes from. Well, I think that is \nwrong, absolutely 100 percent wrong. Every American consumer should \nhave the right to know where their meat comes from, and if I want to \nbuy American-grown beef, I should have the right to do that, and I \ncan't exercise that right unless I know--on the package--where it was \ngrown.\n  If there are human rights violations or labor violations in Colombia \nand I don't want to buy Colombia meat until they fix their labor \nnegotiations, I should have the right to use my dollar to buy my meat \nfrom the United States of America and not meat grown in Colombia. But \nthat has been struck down because we gave away previously a chunk of \nour sovereignty. That is the danger of giving away the sovereignty of \nthe United States of America to an international group that strikes \ndown fundamental rights that every one of us should have. So let's fix \nthat.\n  That is why I drafted amendment No. 1404 which would declare that the \nright to establish information for consumers about where their food \ncomes from will not be violated by the agreement that is brought back \nto the Senate.\n  I hope everyone will join me in unanimous consent in saying that \nabsolutely we are going to defend the rights of Americans to know where \ntheir food comes from.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside and that amendment No. 1404 be brought up in order that we \nshould all be able to exercise our rights to not buy products from \ncountries that we find in violation of fundamental human rights or \nother labor abuses or environmental errors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I see my colleagues on the floor who have their own \namendments to address. I will conclude by saying that if I can't get up \none of my four amendments to be debated--all substantive and all \naddressing key components of this agreement--then this is not a robust \nprocess, this is not an open process, and I ask the majority leader to \nkeep his vision that he laid out on this floor that this would be an \nopen process and a robust process.\n  Thank you.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the pending business, \nwhich is the trade promotion authority, also known as TPA, adding to \nthe many initials we are throwing around these days.\n  I thought the Senate came to an agreement to move forward on this \nlegislation, and as promised by the majority leader allowing \namendments, but we are not getting to vote. I hope we can note that the \nobjections are not coming from the Republican side of the aisle.\n  I believe the United States must engage in a global marketplace if \nthey are going to survive economically. I also understand there are \nconcerns about TPA. In particular, there is confusion about what \nexactly happens when Congress passes a TPA bill. History provides us an \ninsight into why Congress created this particular authority.\n  Article I of the U.S. Constitution states, ``Congress shall have the \nPower To . . . regulate Commerce with foreign nations.'' For over 150 \nyears, Congress established tariff rates directly. However, under the \nReciprocal Trade Agreement of 1934, RTAA--more initials--Congress \ndelegated this authority to the President, who could reduce tariffs \nwithin preapproved levels in reciprocal trade agreements.\n  In response to Presidential overreach under the act, Congress enacted \nthe first trade promotion authority bill in 1974. Since that time, \nCongress has regularly enacted TPA legislation which defines U.S. \nnegotiating objectives and priorities for trade agreements.\n  As an added measure, Congress includes time limits on the use of TPA \nand retains the option to disapprove of an extension when the President \nrequests one. Finally, each Chamber has the right to exercise its \nconstitutional authority to change TPA in an implementing bill.\n  The underlying TPA bill builds on the tradition of Congress setting \nthe terms for trade by expanding the transparency and consultation \nrequirements for the administration. The procedure allows any Member of \nthe House or Senate to unilaterally push to remove TPA authority if he \nor she believes the White House has not consulted fully with Congress. \nThis is an important check to ensure that Congress is not turning over \nthe fast-track keys to an administration that will disrespect the \nnegotiating objectives Congress sets in its TPA bill.\n  I am confident in supporting TPA because it advances the ball on the \nTrans-Pacific Partnership--TPP. The TPP agreement is not just a trade \nagreement, it is an economic and strategic agreement. The TPA parties \nalready include a number of nations the United States already has \nbilateral free-trade agreements with, including Australia, Chile, \nSingapore, and Peru. This starting point ensures that TPP includes the \nhighest standards of trade favorable to an economically free and fair \nmarket.\n  Additionally, we know the United States needs to continue setting the \ntone in the Pacific region both economically and politically. The TPP \nachieves the goal by taking the first step in creating the leading \ntrade agreement of the 21st century.\n  Let me give some examples of how TPP will benefit Wyoming. Despite \nhaving no direct access to the Pacific Ocean, in 2014, businesses from \nWyoming exported $1 billion in goods to TPP partners, which would grow \nunder the new agreement. For Wyoming, most of its trade is in the \nnatural chemical industry. A key industrial\n\n[[Page S3048]]\n\nand chemical product I have spoken about on the Senate floor is soda \nash. Wyoming also exports machinery and energy products to these \nPacific markets.\n  I must also add that over two-thirds of the firms exporting goods \nfrom Wyoming are small- or medium-sized businesses. Exports are \nincreasingly playing a role in job growth in my State. In 1992, just 12 \npercent of the jobs in the State of Wyoming were tied to international \ntrade. As of 2013, one in six jobs in Wyoming is dependent on \ninternational trade. The TPP agreement is an opportunity for Wyoming's \nbusinesses, especially in mining, manufacturing, and agriculture, to \nexpand their markets and grow. This is why on April 22 I voted to \nsupport TPA in the Senate Committee on Finance.\n  Trade promotion authority also plays a key role in advancing the \ninterests of our Nation's most competitive businesses, including \ntechnology and medical innovation. I have long spoken about the \nimportance of protecting American innovations overseas. The United \nStates remains a leader in innovation and technology because of our \nstrong protections for intellectual property. The TPP would include the \nhighest standard to date for new innovations.\n  I look forward to advancing TPA and want to give credit to Chairman \nHatch and Leader McConnell for the open amendment process they are \ntrying to get on this bill.\n  I will also mention, briefly, that I oppose expanding TAA--another \ngood acronym--without a closer look at how it mimics and duplicates \nFederal workforce training programs. As the former chairman and ranking \nmember of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, I \nam extremely familiar with the existing Federal programs that Congress \nfunds to improve workforce training. TAA is redundant, and now is not \nthe time to increase spending. As chairman of the Senate Committee on \nthe Budget, I cannot ignore programs that add new spending. That is why \nI intend to vote against expanding it and adding it to the underlying \nbill.\n  I hope we will take a look at the TPA within the amendment process, \nand I hope people will pay attention to an article that appeared in the \nCasper Star Tribune, which is our State newspaper. I assume it appeared \nin many other newspapers. The title of this article is ``The left is so \nwrong on the Trans-Pacific Partnership.'' The article goes into some of \nthe reasons Democrats might be trying to deny this from happening. If \nyou look at the strategy, I think that probably is where a lot of the \namendments are headed--to actually defeating it, not to help it along, \nnot to improve it, and that is wrong.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the article I \njust mentioned.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Casper Star Tribune, May 17, 2015]\n\n         The Left Is so Wrong on the Trans-Pacific Partnership\n\n                           (By Froma Harrop)\n\n       The left's success in denying President Obama fast-track \n     authority to negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is \n     ugly to behold. The case put forth by a showboating U.S. Sen. \n     Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.,--that Obama cannot be trusted to \n     make a deal in the interests of American workers--is almost \n     worse than wrong. It is irrelevant.\n       The Senate Democrats who turned on Obama are playing a 78 \n     rpm record in the age of digital downloads.\n       Did you hear their ally, AFL-CIO head Richard Trumka, the \n     day after the Senate vote? He denounced TPP for being \n     ``patterned after CAFTA and NAFTA.'' That's not so, but never \n     mind.\n       There's this skip on the vinyl record that the North \n     American Free Trade Agreement destroyed American \n     manufacturing. To see how wrong that is, simply walk through \n     any Wal-Mart or Target and look for all those ``made in \n     Mexico'' labels. You won't find many. But you'll see ``made \n     in China'' everywhere.\n       Many of the jobs that did go to Mexico would have otherwise \n     left for low-wage Asian countries. Even Mexico lost \n     manufacturing work to China.\n       And what can you say about the close-to-insane obsession \n     with CAFTA? The partners in the 2005 Central American Free \n     Trade Agreement--five mostly impoverished Central American \n     countries plus the Dominican Republic--had a combined economy \n     equal to that of New Haven, Conn.\n       (By the way, less than 10 percent of the AFL-CIO's \n     membership is now in manufacturing.)\n       It's undeniable that American manufacturing workers have \n     suffered terrible job losses. We could never compete with \n     pennies-an-hour wages. Those low-skilled jobs are not coming \n     back. But we have other things to sell in the global \n     marketplace.\n       In Washington state, for example, exports of everything \n     from apples to airplanes have soared 40 percent over four \n     years to total nearly $91 billion in 2014, according to The \n     Seattle Times. About two in five jobs there are now tied to \n     trade.\n       Small wonder that U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, a liberal Democrat \n     from neighboring Oregon, has strongly supported fast-track \n     authority.\n       Some liberals oddly complain that American efforts to \n     strengthen intellectual property laws in trade deals protect \n     the profits of U.S. entertainment and tech companies. What's \n     wrong with that? Should the fruits of America's creativity \n     (that's labor, too) be open to plundering and piracy?\n       One of TPP's main goals is to help the higher-wage partners \n     compete with China. (The 12 countries taking part include the \n     likes of Japan, Australia, Canada, Chile, Mexico and New \n     Zealand.) In any case, Congress would get to vote the \n     finished product up or down, so it isn't as if the public \n     wouldn't get a say.\n       But then we have Warren stating with a straight face that \n     handing negotiating authority to Obama would ``give \n     Republicans the very tool they need to dismantle Dodd-\n     Frank.''\n       Huh? Obama swatted down the remark as wild, hypothetical \n     speculation, noting he engaged in a ``massive'' fight with \n     Wall Street to get the reforms passed. ``And then I sign a \n     provision that would unravel it?'' he told political writer \n     Matt Bai.\n       ``This is not a partisan issue,'' Warren insisted. Yes, in \n     a twisted way, the hard left's fixation over big corporations \n     has joined the right's determination to undermine Obama at \n     every pass.\n       Trade agreements have a thousand moving parts. The United \n     States can't negotiate with the other countries if various \n     domestic interests are pouncing on the details. That's why \n     every president has been given fast-track authority over the \n     past 80 years or so.\n       Except Obama.\n       It sure is hard to be an intelligent leader in this \n     country.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time until \n8 p.m. today be equally divided in the usual form; that upon the use or \nyielding back of that time, the Senate vote in relation to the \namendments listed: No. 1312, Inhofe-Coons, as further modified; No. \n1227, Shaheen; No. 1327, Warren; No. 1251, Brown; I further ask that no \nsecond-degree amendments be in order to these amendments and that the \nInhofe amendment be subject to a 60-affirmative-vote threshold for \nadoption. I further ask that it be in order to offer the following \nfirst-degree amendments during today's session of the Senate: No. 1252, \nBrown-Portman, the level playing field amendment; No. 1385, Hatch-\nWyden, the currency amendment; No. 1384, Cruz-Grassley, the immigration \namendment; No. 1410, Menendez, the child labor amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BROWN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I would like to speak first on the request. \nI thank Chairman Hatch for his work on this, especially on the level \nthe playing field. He knows this amendment is a top priority for me. It \nis also a top priority for steelworkers and steel facilities throughout \nthe country.\n  I would like to ask Chairman Hatch if he would take the same \ncollaborative spirit he has shown toward me and ask him to modify his \nrequest, if I could. This is my request, Mr. President.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following first-degree amendments be \nin order to be offered during today's session: Brown-Portman No. 1252; \nHatch-Wyden No. 1385; Cruz-Grassley No. 1384; Menendez-Wyden No. 1410; \nCantwell No. 1248; Casey No. 1334; Baldwin No. 1317; Murphy No. 1333; \nCardin No. 1230; Blumenthal No. 1297; Sanders No. 1343; Markey No. \n1308; Peters No. 1353; Whitehouse No. 1387; Boxer No. 1361; Franken No. \n1390; Durbin No. 1244; Merkley No. 1401; that the time until 8 p.m. \ntoday be equally divided in the usual form and that at 8 p.m. the \nSenate proceed to vote in relation to the following amendments in the \norder listed: Inhofe-Coons No. 1312, as modified with the changes that \nare at the desk; Shaheen No. 1227; Warren No. 1327; McCain-Shaheen No. \n1226; Brown No. 1251; Hatch-Wyden No. 1385; Portman-Stabenow No. 1299; \nBrown-Portman No. 1252; and Cantwell No. 1248. Further, I ask that no \nsecond-degree amendments be in order to these\n\n[[Page S3049]]\n\namendments prior to the votes and that the following amendments be \nsubject to a 60-affirmative-vote threshold for adoption: Inhofe-Coons \nNo. 1312; Brown-Portman No. 1252; McCain-Shaheen No. 1226; and Cantwell \nNo. 1248; finally, I ask unanimous consent that it not be in order for \ncloture to be filed on the Hatch substitute or the underlying bill \nduring today's session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Utah so modify his \nrequest?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, of course I haven't seen all that, so I \nwill have to enter an objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection to the modification is heard.\n  Is there objection to the original request?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Before Senator Peters speaks, I again would like to thank \nSenator Hatch for the work he has done on this. I appreciate how he \nwants to move forward. There are many things here we agree with to move \nforward on.\n  The reason for the unanimous consent request I made was that we saw \ntoday a whole host of Senators come to the floor. We saw Senator \nBaldwin come down, Senator Merkley has come down, Senator Peters is \nhere, Senator Blumenthal came earlier, Senator Warren, Senator \nWhitehouse, Senator Casey--and I am leaving some out--Senators Boxer \nand Franken all came to the floor with amendments because they want, as \nSenator McConnell promised, a full and open process. So my unanimous \nconsent request was to take the generous offer of Senator Hatch and \nmake it broader and wider so those Senators who have shown the interest \nto come to the floor today would be able to offer those amendments.\n  The reason I asked that cloture not be filed today is that it just \nsimply doesn't seem right to me--and I know to a number of Members of \nmy caucus--that literally 24 hours after we start this process we \nalready are talking about cloture.\n  Thirteen years ago, the last time we did fast-track here, this debate \nwent for 3 weeks. I am not asking for 3 weeks. I think that would be a \nbridge too far for most of us. But I am saying that 13 years ago there \nwere 50 amendments that were considered. Today, we have considered 6 \nand there have been 149 filed. That is 4 percent of the amendments that \nwere filed. Again, Senator Hatch's generous offer gets us not even to \n10 percent of those offered amendments.\n  So invoking cloture this quickly really does stifle the process, and \nI think this is too big a deal for that. This fast-track debate \nencompasses the largest trade debate, the largest trade agreement in \nthe history of the country--I guess in the history of the world, for \nthat matter. It involves 40 percent of the world's GDP, these 12 TPP \ncountries. Adding in the European countries in the next round, also \nunder TPA, is another 20 percent of the world's GDP. So that would be \n60 percent of the world's GDP. You don't file cloture within 24 hours \nand begin to shut down debate.\n  That was the reason for my unanimous consent request. Again, I thank \nSenator Hatch for his patience in working together on the level the \nplaying field amendment, one of the major enforcement issues, but I \nhave at least 15 Members of my caucus, as many as 20, who want to offer \namendments. There have been 149 amendments filed on both sides, and to \ncut off debate with fewer than 10 percent of them in order or even a \nfew more than that is simply not the way this Senate should operate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from the Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague, and I am trying \nto accommodate him. I always try to accommodate my colleagues. On the \nother hand, his side has stonewalled this since last Wednesday. \nThursday was a full day we lost. We are going to be here Friday. We did \nnot do very much yesterday; today, nothing. I am very concerned that we \nare not moving ahead. We are not doing what we should do. This is an \nimportant matter. It is an important bill.\n  I chatted with the President earlier today. He indicated how \nimportant it is to him personally, what this bill means to our country, \nhow important it is to get it passed and to pass it in a form the House \nwill accept, which is what I am trying to do.\n  I do not think it has been this side that has slowed this down, \nalthough I do not want to pick on either side. The Senators are \ncertainly within their rights to slow-walk this all they want to. On \nthe other hand, it is very difficult for me to sit here, having sat \nhere all day and yesterday and would have been Thursday and Friday as \nwell and Saturday if necessary. It strikes me as interesting that now \nthey want all these amendments when they have had all this time to \nbring up their amendments and nobody was going to stop them.\n  All I can say is that I hope we come here tomorrow prepared to do \namendments or do them tonight. I am prepared to stay if we have to. But \nthe fact is that we are not going anywhere on this right now. This is \nan extremely important bill not only for the Congress but for the \nPresident of the United States and for the world at large when you stop \nand think about it, certainly the world over in Asia.\n  We are talking about having an agreement with Japan. It is the first \ntime we have been able to do that. We have a new Prime Minister who is \nwilling to work with us, and we are willing to work with him. That is a \nmajor achievement by this administration--not only that but 10 other \ncountries. There is a high percentage of trade in this area, and what \nare we going to do--just leave it all to China to take over or are we \ngoing to take this more seriously and get this job done?\n  We have a number of poison pills that people have wanted to bring up \nthat naturally would mean the end of this particular bill. I would like \nto prevent that if we can because we are talking about a bipartisan \nbill that has plenty of bipartisan support that really is crucial to \nthis country at this time and crucial to that region. That could be a \nvery difficult region for us if we do not do this.\n  If we do not do this and do it right, as we are trying to do and as \nthe President is trying to do, then we will be just turning that whole \narea over to China. They are going to step right in and make the \ndifference. Right now, these people want to deal with us, and there is \na good reason they want to deal with us. But if we cannot even get our \nact in order to deal with them, then I can understand why they might go \nanother route. They might be forced to go another route.\n  We all saw the new bank that has been established over there. At \nfirst, there were very few countries that went with it. The last time I \nheard--I may be wrong on this--there were up to 60 countries, including \nsome of the European countries, some of the greatest countries in the \nworld now.\n  What are we going to do--just cede the whole area to China or are we \ngoing to compete? This bill is for competitive purposes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the distinguished chairman yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I appreciate that, and I appreciate the chairman's work. I \nwant to ask a question about where, in effect, we are. The two of us \nworked together on the list----\n  Mr. HATCH. That is right. Forgive me, I did not mean to indicate I \nwas the only one doing this. I had an excellent partner.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Not at all. The question is, Mr. Chairman, we worked \ntogether to put together this list, and it was based on the proposition \nthat we were going to be fair to both sides.\n  Mr. HATCH. Right.\n  Mr. WYDEN. On my side of the aisle, my colleagues on the Democratic \nside of the aisle felt strongly about the currency issue. Senator \nStabenow, for example, and many others felt very strongly about the \namendment Senator Warren sought to offer. We were able, working \ntogether, to in effect get an equal number for each side.\n\n[[Page S3050]]\n\n  My understanding is that we continue to be interested--and you just, \nI think, made another gracious offer. We are going to stay here \ntonight. You are still interested in putting together a list that gives \nall sides a fair chance at their major amendments. Is that a fair \nrecitation of where we are now, Mr. Chairman?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes. I think both of us literally have tried to be fair to \nboth sides. There are some amendments that I wish we did not have to \nput up with, to be perfectly frank with you, but that is always the \ncase. Why should we not be fair to both sides?\n  There comes a limit to what you can do in these matters. As I said, \nthis is probably the most important bill in many respects, outside of \nObamaCare, in this President's 8 years. It is an extremely important \nbill for our country. It is an extremely important bill for our \neconomy. It is an extremely important bill for our allies over in those \nareas. It is an extremely important bill that helps to set the stage \nfor TTIP, the 28 countries in Europe.\n  All this bill does basically is provide a procedural mechanism \nwhereby Congress has some control, if not total control, over what \nagreements are negotiated. This is not the TPP. It is not TTIP. It is \nnot the final decisions on that. That will be made pursuant to this \nbill, which will be a very important bill for the purpose of saying \nthat the White House and the administration follow certain protocols \nand recognize that the Congress of the United States is important in \nthese trade matters, too.\n  I want to thank my colleague from Oregon for the hard work he has \ndone on this bill. He has been a wonderful partner to work with today, \nand I really appreciate him. I hope we can resolve these problems, but \nas of right now, I had to object to the unanimous consent request by \nthe distinguished Senator from Ohio, for whom I have a lot of respect. \nI do not agree with him, but I know he is sincere, and I know he is \nworking very hard for what he believes is proper.\n  With that, I do not know what else to do other than just say I object \nto that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I, too, like the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, have been here all day, and I empathize with the dilemma \nthat he faces, along with the ranking member, on how to move forward \nwith this legislation.\n  This is a discussion which has been going on for months and months, \nif not years, which is, what are we going to do, as we deal with trade \nissues, about the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, which \nexpires at the end of June?\n  While I appreciate my colleagues on the Finance Committee and the \nmovement of trade legislation, I have had many discussions with them \nover the last several months about this very issue and the fact that \nthis issue has to get resolved. I know no Member gets to have their way \nabout what legislation gets an amendment. The list that was just given \ndoes nothing to guarantee that we would ever see a vote on the \nauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank.\n  While the other side wants to protect what they think are the \nopportunities to pass this legislation in the House, which I respect, I \ndo not think the House has to dictate to the U.S. Senate how we are \ngoing to proceed when the majority of people in both the House and \nSenate support the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank. Right \nnow, it has deals of $18 billion and more pending before it. If the \nBank expires June 30, all of those trade deals, which are jobs for U.S. \ncompanies, disappear and go away. So, yes, in my opinion, there is no \nmore important amendment than one that saves $18 billion of U.S. \ncompany sales to overseas markets.\n  So I and my colleagues who support the Ex-Im Bank reauthorization, \nwhich is the majority in both the House and Senate, have lost our \npatience with the ability to get this Bank before the Senate and before \nthe House before that June 30 deadline. So I have no compulsion at this \nmoment to say that I do not support moving forward on the cloture \nmotion until we get an understanding of how this Bank is going to be \nreauthorized.\n  I know people are proud of the work that has been done on TPA, but it \nis silly to say to the American people that we are moving forward on \nopening up trade opportunities but we are going to let expire the tool \nthat small businesses and individuals use to export their products--as \na credit agency. It makes no sense to open up Cambodia if then you \ncannot get a bank in Cambodia to have the sales of a product from my \ncolleague from South Carolina to that country. If somebody wants to \ntell me that one of these New York Wall Street banks will give us that \nkind of financing, then maybe we will come up with a different \nsolution, but one does not exist.\n  Until our colleagues give us an answer about something we have been \nclear about for more than a year, we are going to continue to object \nbecause we are not going to let this Bank expire--the credit agency--\nwithout a fight.\n  I know my colleague from South Carolina is here on the floor. I \nappreciate his support of the Ex-Im Bank.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I want to echo what my colleague from \nWashington said. To those who negotiated this trade package, well done. \nI am going to vote for the Portman amendment because I think currency \nmanipulation should be addressed more forcefully.\n  If trade deals in the future are going to be like trade deals in the \npast, we need to look at what we are doing because some of the trade \ndeals in the past have not worked out so well.\n  On this currency issue, I want to vote. On the bank, I am telling my \nleadership the following: I have talked with you and talked with you. I \nhave forgone taking votes on the Ex-Im Bank because I did not want to \nrock the boat on the budget and other things. I am tired of talking. \nYou are not going to get my vote for cloture or anything else this year \nuntil I get a vote--we get a vote--on the Ex-Im Bank. There are over 60 \nvotes in this body.\n  To the chairman, whom I admire greatly, you mentioned China. Let me \nmention China. China makes wide-body jets. They are getting into the \nwide-body jets business big time. China makes about everything we make. \nBoeing makes 787s in South Carolina and Washington. GE makes gas \nturbines in Greenville, SC, mostly sold through Ex-Im financing to the \ndeveloping world.\n  If you are worried about China stepping in if we do not have this \ngreat trade deal, here is what I am worried about: If our Bank expires, \nthen the market share we have today because we have competitive \nfinancing goes away, and the biggest beneficiary of closing down the \nBank will be China.\n  I am not going to subject American manufacturers to trying to sell \ntheir products overseas without ex-im financing while all their \ncompetitors have an ex-im bank. As a matter of fact, China's bank is \nbigger than the banks of the United States, France, England, and \nGermany combined.\n  Airbus is a great airplane. France and Germany have an ex-im bank. An \nAmerican manufacturer, when it comes to a wide-body aircraft or any \nother product trying to be sold overseas in the developing world--this \nBank makes money for the taxpayers and makes them competitive.\n  To all of those who really do believe in trade, the fact that you \nwould let the Bank expire because of some ideological jihad on our side \nmakes absolutely no sense to me. I will not be a part of that anymore.\n  To the people who are trying to make this the scalp for conservatism, \nI think you lost your way. This Bank makes money for the taxpayers. \nThis Bank doesn't lose money. This Bank allows American manufacturers \nwho are doing business in the developing world to have a competitive \nfoothold against their competitors in China and throughout Europe and \nhave access to Ex-Im financing. All we are talking about is an \nAmerican-made product sold in the developing world where they cannot \nget traditional financing.\n  The Ex-Im Bank has been around for decades. Ronald Reagan was for the \nEx-Im Bank. The Ex-Im Bank is directly responsible for helping to sell \nBoeing aircraft made in South Carolina. Seventy percent of the \nproduction in South Carolina is eligible for Ex-Im financing. There are \nthousands of small businesses which benefit from manufactured products \nsold in the developing world through Ex-Im financing.\n\n[[Page S3051]]\n\n  Would I like to live in a world where there were no ex-im banks? \nSure, but the world I am not going to live in is where we shut our Ex-\nIm Bank down and China keeps theirs open. I am not doing that. That is \nnot trade. That is just idiotic. That is unilateral surrender.\n  Come to South Carolina and tell the people at Boeing and all of their \nsuppliers--and go to the Greenville GE plant that hires thousands of \nSouth Carolinians and all of their small business suppliers--why it is \na good idea for America to shut down a bank that makes money for the \ntaxpayers that allows us to be competitive. Tell them how you think \nthat is a good way to grow our economy. Tell those people who have good \njobs in South Carolina--and who will surely lose market share because \nwe closed our Bank down--how proud they should be of your ideological \npurity.\n  I welcome this debate in South Carolina down the road. But I promised \nmy leadership and friends on the other side that I am a reasonable guy. \nI vote for issues give-and-take, but the one thing I will not do is \nallow the Bank to expire without a vote. If my colleagues can beat me \non the floor, that is fine. I am not asking anyone to vote for the \nBank. I am asking them to allow me to vote for the Bank because it is \ncritical to the economy in my State and I think the Nation as a whole.\n  The only reason we are having this debate is because some outside \ngroups have made this the conservative cause celebre--in my view, \nwithout any rational reason.\n  I have no problem helping the chairman and ranking member move this \nbill because they talk about how it will make it harder on China to \ntake market share in Asia. The only thing I ask of this body is to \nallow me and my colleagues who care about the Ex-Im Bank--it is a small \npiece of the puzzle that has a gigantic impact. It made over $3 billion \nfor the American taxpayers.\n  This Bank is essential for American manufacturers to be competitive \nin the developing world, and I will not let this Bank expire without a \nvote. I will not give market share to China or the Europeans. I will \nnot do that.\n  I am willing to work with my colleagues, but they have to be willing \nto work with me. And if they are not willing to honor their word that \nthey have been giving me for the last 6 months, then they have nobody \nto blame but themselves.\n  To the Senator from Washington, all we are asking for is a vote on \nthe Ex-Im Bank--that has been around for decades, that Ronald Reagan \nsaid was a good idea and that has overwhelming bipartisan support--\nbefore June 30 on a vehicle that must become law if we can pass that \namendment. I ask the Senator from Washington, is that correct?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, the Senator from South Carolina is \ncorrect. That is all we have been asking for, and we have talked to our \ncolleagues about various vehicles and various opportunities for those \nvotes. And, yes, that is exactly what has been promised.\n  We are here today because, as the Senator from South Carolina has \ndescribed, the failure of us to reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank will mean \nhuge opportunities for foreign competitors at the very time when we are \ntrying to open up markets for our U.S. companies. All we are asking is \nfor the opportunity to have this vote. As the majority leader said, let \nthe will of the Senate be done.\n  The Senator from South Carolina is right. People who have extreme \nviews on this have decided that this is something they can hold up. \nWell, I don't think we are here today to try to ultimately say how \nindividual people should vote. They should vote their conscience.\n  The fact that this Bank is about to expire and the fact that these \njobs would be lost because we didn't do our job by reauthorizing the \nBank is a failure. It is an imminent threat of $18 billion. These are \nproposed deals for export that will not get approved and will not get \ndone because we won't have a bank. I think the Senate can do better \nthan that.\n  I thank my colleague for being here tonight and going into detail \nabout the Ex-Im Bank.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, reclaiming my time, and I will wrap it up.\n  To my colleagues who have been raising money off of this, you can \nraise all the money you want to, but you will have to debate your ideas \nagainst my ideas. You will not be able to shut this Bank down without a \nvote. If you feel that good about your position, let's have a vote on \nthe floor of the Senate and on the floor of the House.\n  The one thing we will not do is let the Bank die without a debate and \na vote, and that debate and vote must come before June 30 because the \ndamage will have been done.\n  I will not sit on the sidelines and watch jobs in my State be lost \nbecause of some ideological crusade, the biggest beneficiaries of which \nwould be China and our European competitors. If you really do care \nabout China's effect in the world marketplace, shutting the Ex-Im Bank \ndown in America and allowing China to keep theirs open is a deathblow \nto American manufacturers that sell in the developing world.\n  With that, I yield the floor and look forward to a positive outcome \nso my colleagues can have their bill passed and have votes on \namendments they care about and get the bill up and passed if the votes \nare there, as long as I get a chance, along with the Senator from \nWashington, to vote on what I care about and what I think is essential \nto the economy--and not just to South Carolina but to the manufacturing \ncommunity that sells in the developing world.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I think we are all aware that Chairman \nHatch and Senator Wyden have been working in good faith over the last \nseveral days to set up both debates and votes on amendments from both \nsides of the aisle. The bill managers have had some success in working \ntogether on the votes that we have had, and so far we have worked to \nget an additional seven amendments pending.\n  Sadly, there is an objection from the other side of the aisle on \ngetting additional amendments pending regardless of which party offers \nthe amendment.\n  Senator Hatch and his colleague have been down here for days trying \nto get amendments up, and obviously it is possible in the Senate to \nprevent others from getting amendments. Now we have the whole process \nstymied because we cannot seem to get agreements for any additional \namendments.\n  I think we all know this is a body that requires at least some level \nof cooperation, and that just has not been happening here on this \nbipartisan bill.\n  I will point out that while I will file cloture on the bill this \nevening, that is not the end of the story. I will repeat that: That is \nnot the end of the story. The bill managers will continue to work \ntogether to get more amendments available for votes before the cloture \nvote. And with a little cooperation from our friends on the other side \nof the aisle, I still think we can get that done.\n  It is my hope that we will be able to process a number of amendments, \nparticularly those which are critical to Members on both sides, and \nthen move forward, and we will have a couple of days to accomplish \nthat.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send to the desk a cloture motion to \nthe Hatch amendment No. 1221 to H.R. 1314.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1299\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I call for regular order with respect to \nPortman amendment No. 1299.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1411\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk to the text \nproposed to be stricken.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1411 to the language proposed to be stricken by \n     amendment No. 1299.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In lieu of the text proposed to be stricken, insert the \n     following:\n       (11) Foreign currency manipulation.--The principal \n     negotiating objective of the United States with respect to \n     unfair currency practices is to seek to establish \n     accountability through enforceable rules, transparency, \n     reporting, monitoring, cooperative mechanisms, or other means \n     to address exchange rate manipulation involving protracted \n     large scale intervention in one direction in the exchange \n     markets and a persistently undervalued foreign exchange rate \n     to gain an unfair competitive advantage in trade over other \n     parties to a trade agreement, consistent, with existing \n     obligations of the United States as a member of the \n     International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, first off, I agree with Senator Brown and \nSenator Hatch on how important this debate before us is. In fact, \nbecause it is so important, I certainly hope we have an opportunity to \ndebate fully its ramifications, especially with issues such as the Ex-\nIm Bank, which I heard two of my colleagues discuss with some vigor \njust a few moments ago.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1251\n\n  At this time I wish to talk about an amendment that I am offering \nwith Senator Brown to require approval of Congress before any \nadditional countries may join the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n  The 12 countries currently participating in TPP negotiations \nencompass about 40 percent of the global gross domestic Product. This \nwould be the largest free-trade agreement since NAFTA, and Members \nshould know that this agreement has the potential to expand to a number \nof additional countries without congressional approval.\n  The administration has said that they would welcome interest from \nother nations, including China, in joining TPP. Given the impact that \ntrade deals, such as NAFTA, have had on American businesses and \nworkers, I would argue that it is important that Congress not only be \nnotified of new negotiations but also have the opportunity to vote on \nwhether to move forward with bringing on additional countries into \nmultinational trade negotiations.\n  If Congress were to approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership, it should \nnot and must not be a blank check to bring in additional nations \nwithout congressional approval.\n  I am particularly concerned about countries that manipulate the value \nof their currency and gain an unfair advantage over U.S. workers, steal \nintellectual property from American innovators, engage in unfair labor \npractices, damage the environment, and do not abide by existing trade \ndeals.\n  Just yesterday, a Federal grand jury indicted six Chinese citizens \nfor stealing trade secrets. Last year, five Chinese military officers \nwere caught stealing intellectual property from U.S. companies. The \nUnited States has brought 16 claims against China at the World Trade \nOrganization, and the Chinese Government has consistently manipulated \ntheir currency against our dollar.\n  Despite these serious problems, the administration has said that they \nwould welcome interest from China in joining TPP. If providing fast-\ntrack authority makes it easier for countries such as China to join the \nTPP, robust congressional oversight is critical.\n  Senator Brown and I have offered an amendment to explicitly ensure \nthat this oversight is available and that Congress has the opportunity \nto vote on the addition of any new countries to TPP negotiations. Our \namendment will require the President to notify Congress before entering \nnegotiations with another country seeking to join the TPP. It provides \n90 days for Congress to conduct hearings and investigations and \nultimately hold any potential new entrant accountable for unfair trade \npractices.\n  The House and Senate will need to affirmatively pass a resolution of \napproval for any new country to join TPP negotiations.\n  Nations such as China will not be able to join through unilateral \naction by a future White House. I urge my colleagues to support the \nBrown-Peters amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1299\n\n  I would also like to urge my colleagues to support the Portman-\nStabenow amendment on currency manipulation. A study by the Center for \nAutomotive Research found that the TPP, as currently negotiated, will \nallow Japan to manipulate its currency, and this practice will likely \nlead to the elimination of over 25,000 American auto industry jobs.\n  Our workers and manufacturers can compete with anyone in the world, \nbut they deserve a level playing field. Currency manipulation is the \nmost significant trade barrier of our time, and it must be stopped. \nThat is why I am supporting the Portman-Stabenow currency amendment, \nand I hope my colleagues will join me in standing up for American \nworkers and fighting back against unfair currency manipulation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, trade is a major issue for a \nmanufacturing State such as Wisconsin. I am very proud of the fact that \nthe State I represent has had a rich history of making things. In fact, \nI don't think we can have an economy that is built to last that doesn't \nmake things as a key part, a key sector of the overall economy. So this \ndebate on trade promotion authority and the trade bills that may follow \nto the floor of the Senate and the House take on a particular \ndisproportionate impact in a State such as Wisconsin that makes things.\n  We have lost a lot of those manufacturing jobs in recent years. We \ncan't lay the entire blame on trade policies, but certainly some of our \npast trade deals have had a significant impact. It is hard to find \nfolks in the State of Wisconsin who don't recall that in a negative \nway, who haven't suffered the results of mistakes we have made in the \npast.\n  That brings me to this debate we are having this evening and I hope \ntomorrow and beyond on trade promotion authority. What trade promotion \nauthority asks us to do as Senators in the United States and \nRepresentatives over in the House is to cede some of our usual powers--\nour usual powers to amend bills to make them stronger, to make them \nmore informed, to improve them, to perfect them--fast-track trade \npromotion authority asks us to relinquish those powers and to take a \nsimple up-or-down, yes-or-no vote on a future trade deal that comes \nbefore us under this fast-track authority.\n\n[[Page S3053]]\n\n  Now, that may bring up the question of why would one ever support \nceding those powers and relinquishing those powers, and I think that, \nultimately, one hypothetically can do that because what we can do is \ntake the time in the fast-track debate to set the conditions, to set \nthe negotiating principles that have to be met in order to be able to \nrelinquish that power later.\n  That is where we get into this issue of process right now. It is so \ncritical that we take the time to debate the conditions that we need to \nsee present as representatives of people from States across this \ncountry, that we take the time to debate thoroughly these amendments so \nthat we know the trade deals that will come before us later will be \nfair--not just free but fair. So I hope we take the time to debate all \nof these provisions because they matter in people's lives. They matter \nto middle-class, working Wisconsinites, some who have lost jobs in \nrecent years and decades because of mistakes we have made in prior \ntrade deals.\n  I come to the floor this evening to share with my colleagues that I \nhave filed nine separate amendments to this trade promotion authority. \nI know we won't have the chance to fully debate and vote on all of \nthem, but I think it is important that we try to have a thorough and \ncomprehensive consideration. So far, we have only voted on two \namendments, and there are only a handful that are pending for \nconsideration. So on that point, I wish to take a few moments to \naddress just four of the amendments that I think are crucial to my \nState of Wisconsin and the middle-class workers whom I have the honor \nof representing.\n  My first amendment is No. 1317. It is cosponsored by my colleagues \nSenator Franken and Senator Blumenthal. It strengthens the principle \nnegotiating objective with respect to trade-remedy laws. This is \ntalking about enforcement and having teeth in that enforcement. These \ntrade remedies ensure that American manufacturers and their workers \nwould compete on a level playing field globally.\n  American manufacturers fight an uphill battle to keep their prices \nlow while foreign companies sell goods in the United States often at \nsubsidized prices. U.S. manufacturing has already suffered financial \nlosses--and thousands of jobs, I might add--as a result of unfair trade \npractices. My amendment would strengthen our ability to fight on behalf \nof our American manufacturing workers.\n  A second amendment I have offered is No. 1365, and I am proud to have \njoined forces with Senator Blumenthal. It would restrict trade \npromotion authority for any trade agreement that includes a country \nthat criminalizes individuals based on sexual orientation or otherwise \npersecutes or punishes individuals based on their sexual orientation or \ngender identity. These countries are identified for us in the State \nDepartment's annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices.\n  At least 75 countries across the globe continue to criminalize \nhomosexuality, subjecting lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender \npeople to imprisonment, various forms of corporal punishment and, in \nsome countries, the death penalty. For example, in Brunei, a newly \nadopted law provides for execution by stoning for homosexuality. As we \nall know, Brunei is part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership free-trade \nagreement that is now under negotiation.\n  Senators voting here on this legislation should know and understand \nthis. If we do not adopt my amendment, we will be granting our highest \ntrading status to a country that executes people based on whom they \nlove. This is not hyperbole. This is a fact. The United States should \nnot reward countries that deny the fundamental humanity of LGBT people \nby subjecting them to harsh penalties and even death simply because of \nwho they are or whom they love.\n  My third amendment, No. 1320, would add a principal negotiating \nobjective to ensure that any trade agreement actually increases \nmanufacturing jobs and wages in the United States. Many Wisconsin \ncommunities, as I mentioned earlier, bear the scars of NAFTA and other \nflawed so-called free-trade agreements. From closed factories to \nforeclosed homes to devastated communities, Wisconsinites know all too \nwell what happens when politicians in Washington tell them that they \nknow what is best for them in Wisconsin.\n  Let me give a few numbers on trade from Wisconsin's perspective.\n  On jobs, according to the Economic Policy Institute, NAFTA has led to \nthe loss of more than 680,000 jobs, most--60 percent of them--\nmanufacturing jobs in the United States as a whole.\n  Since China joined the WTO in the year 2000, there has been a net \nloss of over 2.7 million U.S. jobs. Of that amount, Wisconsin has lost \naround 68,000 jobs between the years 2001 and 2013 because of our trade \ndeficit with China and their currency manipulation.\n  Now, in 2011 we passed the South Korea Free Trade Agreement. In the \nyears since, the growth of the U.S. trade deficit with South Korea has \ncost us more than 75,000 U.S. jobs.\n  On wages, competing with workers in China and other low-wage \ncountries, it has reduced wages of 100 million U.S. workers without a \ncollege degree, a total loss of about $180 billion each year.\n  Since China joined the WTO, U.S. workers who lost their jobs because \nof trade with China have lost more than $37 billion in wages as a \nresult of accepting lower-waged jobs.\n  The final amendment I wish to describe is amendment No. 1319, \ncosponsored by my colleague Senator Merkley, who was speaking with all \nof us earlier this evening. This amendment would require the \nadministration to notify the public when it waives ``Buy American'' \nrequirements. Wisconsin workers make things, and we have been one of \nthe top manufacturing States in the Nation for generations. Now, if we \nhope to continue making things, we think we should continue to have our \nown government as a customer. Or, put another way, U.S. taxpayer \ndollars should support U.S. jobs. That is why I am a strong supporter \nof ``Buy American'' provisions that require Federal agencies to \npurchase American-made products. Free-trade agreements have \nhistorically allowed foreign nations way too much leeway when bidding \nfor our government projects and contracts while not affording American \ncompanies the same access.\n  Now, I believe the issues I have brought up this evening and these \nfour amendments are really important issues--important to our country, \nimportant to our standing in the world, and important to my State of \nWisconsin. These are issues that the Senate should debate. I urge the \nmajority leader to allow an open and robust amendment process so that \nwe can vote on these critical provisions.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1411, as Modified\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have a modification to my amendment No. \n1411 at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       In the language proposed to be stricken on page 27, lines 6 \n     & 7 strike ``appropriate.'' and insert:\n     appropriate.\n       (12) Foreign Currency Manipulation.--The principal \n     negotiating objective of the United States with respect to \n     unfair currency practices is to seek to establish \n     accountability through enforceable rules, transparency, \n     reporting, monitoring, cooperative mechanisms, or other means \n     to address exchange rate manipulation involving protracted \n     large scale intervention in one direction in the exchange \n     markets and a persistently undervalued foreign exchange rate \n     to gain an unfair competitive advantage in trade over other \n     parties to a trade agreement, consistent with existing \n     obligations of the United States as a member of the \n     International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/19/senate-section/article/S3053-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3053-S3054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, in the closing days of last Congress, I \nwas proud to see this body include a provision in the Carl Levin and \nHoward P. ``Buck'' McKeon National Defense Authorization Act, P.L. 113-\n291, to transfer a parcel of land at the former Badger Army Ammunition \nPlant near Baraboo, WI, from the Department of Defense to the \nDepartment of the Interior. I worked throughout the drafting of this \nlegislation to include this provision, which is of great importance to \nWisconsin.\n  During discussions on the specific legislative text to be included in \nthe bill, a question was raised as to how the language might apply to \nDepartment of Defense contractors, particularly any Badger Army \nAmmunition Plant operators. I understand the legislative language that \nrefers to ``activities of the Department of Defense'' to include \nactivities undertaken by the officers and agents employed or contracted \nby the Department of Defense, meaning that under the terms of this \nprovision, the Army retains responsibility for remediation of \nenvironmental contamination resulting from activities undertaken by the \nDepartment of Defense and its contractors. This clarification is \ncritical because Badger Army Ammunition Plant was operated by the \nDepartment of Defense contractors, and contamination at the site was \ncaused as a direct result of their activities.\n  I wrote to the Department of Defense to request their clarification \non this matter, and I ask unanimous consent that my letter and their \nresponse be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 12, 2015.\n     Mr. John Conger,\n     Deputy Under Secretary of Defense, Installations & \n         Environment, Department of Defense, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Conger: The National Defense Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 2015 (PL 113-291) includes a provision (Section \n     3078) transferring administrative jurisdiction, from the \n     Secretary of the Army to the Secretary of the Interior, of \n     property located on the site of the former Badger Army \n     Ammunition Plant (BAAP) near Baraboo, Wisconsin. I worked \n     throughout the drafting of this legislation to include this \n     provision, and would like to thank you for the assistance \n     provided by your staff in drafting the legislative language \n     that became part of the final bill.\n       During discussions on the specific legislative text to be \n     included in the bill, a question was raised as to how the \n     language might apply to Department of Defense contractors, \n     particularly any BAAP operators. I understand the legislative \n     language that refers to ``activities of the Department of \n     Defense'' to include activities undertaken by the officers \n     and agents employed or contracted by the Department of \n     Defense, meaning that under the terms of this provision, the \n     Army retains responsibility for remediation of environmental \n     contamination resulting from activities undertaken by DOD and \n     its contractors. This clarification is critical because BAAP \n     was operated by DOD contractors, and contamination at the \n     site was caused as a direct result of their activities. I \n     would appreciate your views on this matter.\n       I have worked on this project for 16 years, and I am \n     extremely grateful for the assistance provided by DOD and the \n     Army to help craft a legislative solution. Thank you for your \n     consideration of this request and for all that you do in \n     support of the men and women of our Armed Forces.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Tammy Baldwin,\n     United States Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           Office of the Assistant\n\n\n                                         Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Tammy Baldwin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Baldwin: Thank you for your January 12, 2015, \n     letter requesting clarification of section 3078 of the Carl \n     Levin and Howard P. ``Buck'' McKeon National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (Pub. L. 113-291), \n     transfer of administrative jurisdiction, from the Secretary \n     of the Army to the Secretary of the Interior, of the property \n     at the former Badger Army Ammunition Plant (BAAP) near \n     Baraboo, Wisconsin. You asked how the act applies to the \n     former Department of Defense operating contractors at BAAP.\n       The operating contractor for BAAP would have been \n     responsible for operating the plant in accordance with the \n     terms of the contract. Such an operating status would not \n     change the underlying responsibility of the United States \n     Army for the activities at the plant simply because they were \n     performed by its contractor. This is not to say that the \n     contractor would be absolved of responsibility for its \n     activities while performing under the contract, but that \n     responsibility would be governed by the terms of the contract \n     as between the contractor and the United States Army.\n       To the extent that the contractor's activities were \n     performed pursuant to and in accordance with the contract, \n     the United States Army would retain responsibility for the \n     activities that occurred in the operation of the plant. \n     During those periods you appear to be most interested in, the \n     Army was the owner of the plant for purposes of the \n     environmental laws. We cannot prejudge any actual issue \n     relating to who would be responsible for actions that \n     occurred at the plant. Such responsibility would be \n     determined after a careful review of the law and its \n     application to the specific facts.\n       I hope you find this information helpful, please let me \n     know if I can be of any further assistance in this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                  John Conger,\n\n                                      Performing the Duties of the\n     Assistant Secretary of Defense.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/19/senate-section/article/S3054-3", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3054-S3055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL R. MARTIN UMBARGER\n\n Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, today I recognize and honor the \nextraordinary service of MG R. Martin Umbarger, the Adjutant General of \nIndiana, and to wish him well upon his retirement. A dedicated and \nloyal public servant, Major General Umbarger has served the people of \nIndiana and the United States in the Indiana Army National Guard for \nmore than 45 years.\n  A native of Bargersville, IN, Major General Umbarger enlisted in the \nIndiana Army National Guard in 1969 after graduating from the \nUniversity of Evansville. Shortly thereafter, in June 1971, he was \ncommissioned as a second lieutenant, Infantry Branch, following his \ngraduation from the Indiana Military Academy as a Distinguished \nMilitary Graduate. Since then, he has dedicated more than four decades \nto serving his State and his country. Some of his notable assignments \ninclude serving as Commanding General of the 76th Infantry Brigade; the \nAssistant Division Commander for Training, 38th Infantry Division; and \nthe Deputy Commanding General, Reserve Component, U.S. Forces Command. \nOn March 11, 2004, Gov. Joseph Kernan appointed Major General Umbarger \nto lead the Nation's fourth-largest National Guard contingent as the \nAdjutant General of Indiana, a position he was reappointed to by Gov. \nMitch Daniels on December 1, 2004, and further reappointed by Gov. Mike \nPence on December 13, 2012.\n  During the past 11 years as the Adjutant General, Major General \nUmbarger has led the Indiana Army and Air National Guard, as well as \nthe more than 15,800 Indiana Guard, Reserve, and State employees, \nchallenging them to embody the National Guard's motto, ``Always Ready, \nAlways There.'' He has directed the training and deployment of nearly \nevery unit of the Indiana Army and Air National Guard in support of the \nglobal war on terror and helped establish and oversee the well-\nrespected J9 Resilience Program to support Guard members and their \nfamilies during predeployment, deployment, and postdeployment. He also \nserved as a member of the Secretary of the Army's Reserve Forces Policy \nCommittee and the Secretary of Defense's Reserve Forces Policy Board.\n\n[[Page S3055]]\n\n  Major General Umbarger has earned numerous awards and decorations, \nincluding: the Legion of Merit, Oak Leaf Cluster; Meritorious Service \nMedal, Oak Leaf Cluster; Army Commendation Medal Army; Achievement \nMedal; Armed Forces Reserve Medal, with two gold hourglass devices; \nIndiana Long Service Medal, and Indiana Distinguished Service Medal, \nBronze Oak Leaf Cluster.\n  In addition to his service in the Indiana National Guard, Major \nGeneral Umbarger has given his time and efforts to serving his \ncommunity through many local and national organizations, including the \nIndiana Feed and Grain Association, the board of trustees of Johnson \nMemorial Hospital, the board of trustees of Franklin College, the \nJohnson County Animal Shelter, the Bargersville Masonic Lodge, the \nNational Guard Association of the United States, the National Guard \nAssociation of Indiana, and the Association of the United States Army.\n  We thank Major General Umbarger for his service, dedication, and \ncommitment to protecting Hoosiers and our Nation. Indiana has a long \nand proud tradition of serving our country, and Major General \nUmbarger's leadership has played a critical role in ensuring that our \nbrave men and women have the training and support they need. General \nUmbarger has made the Indiana National Guard a national model and has \nleft a strong Indiana National Guard. On behalf of Hoosiers, we wish \nMajor General Umbarger and his wife Rowana the best in the years \nahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/19/senate-section/article/S3055-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING A. ALFRED TAUBMAN\n\n Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the remarkable \nlegacy of A. Alfred Taubman, an innovator whose work shaped the modern \nretail process for Americans and whose philanthropic endeavors have \nmade an immeasurable impact across metro Detroit.\n  Mr. Taubman's story is an embodiment of the American dream. A first \ngeneration American, and the son of immigrants who fled Europe in the \nGreat Depression looking for a chance to build a better life, Mr. \nTaubman came from humble beginnings. From this foundation, Mr. Taubman \nsought to follow his father into a career as a builder and quickly \nbecame a visionary by setting new trends in the retail shopping \nindustry, which made him one of the most successful businessmen in the \nState of Michigan.\n  Despite entering the building trade without much formal higher \neducation, he quickly honed his skills and by the age of 25 started his \nown business. In the wake of World War II, as the construction industry \nfocused on suburban homes and industrial facilities, Mr. Taubman saw \nanother dimension to America's burgeoning middle class, the opportunity \nfor a new type of retail hub for suburban America: the shopping mall.\n  Mr. Taubman was a student of life, and took to heart the adage that \nlearning is a lifelong experience; a principle which was integrated \ninto his work. When he saw the opportunity to change and improve the \nretail shopping experience, he delved into understanding every facet \nand physiological component. This was a body of knowledge that he built \ninto a formidable retail acumen. With this knowledge, he became a \ntrendsetter, identifying untapped potential in developing communities \nand he led many successful endeavors.\n  While renowned for his groundbreaking work in the retail shopping \nindustry, Mr. Taubman was an equally avid and passionate \nphilanthropist, with a deep appreciation for the State of Michigan and \nthe arts. His own work as a watercolorist inspired him to make gifts \nand donations to the Detroit Institute of Arts worth hundreds of \nmillions of dollars. His charitable giving also extended to the \nUniversity of Michigan's School of Medicine, where his donations have \nbeen used to fund stem cell research, holding the promise to cure \ndegenerative diseases including ALS, as well as the College for \nCreative Studies and Lawrence Technological University, which are \nshaping the next generation of artists and innovators. Having suffered \nfrom the effects of dyslexia, he also generously supported programs to \npromote adult literacy, which led to him being recognized as an \nhonorary chair for Reading Works.\n  A. Alfred Taubman's reach was both deep and broad in every endeavor \nhe pursued. From his work in the commercial retail industry to his \nphilanthropic endeavors, Mr. Taubman has left a legacy that will last \nfor generations. His passion, knowledge, and leadership will be greatly \nmissed, but I know they will inspire future entrepreneurs, creative \nthinkers, and community activists to succeed and make a difference in \ntheir communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/19/senate-section/article/S3055-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3055-S3056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO DURWARD ``BUTCH'' WADDILL\n\n Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Durward C. \n``Butch'' Waddill, a veteran of the Vietnam war. On behalf of all \nMontanans and all Americans, I say ``thank you'' to Butch for his \nservice to our Nation.\n  It is my honor to share the story of Butch's service in Vietnam, \nbecause no story of bravery should ever be forgotten. Butch was born on \nNovember 20, 1946 in Battle Creek, MI. Butch's parents were both in the \nArmy: his mother was an Army nurse and his father was in the Medical \nService Corps. Butch spent most of his childhood traveling among Army \nbases before settling in California.\n  In 1964, Butch enlisted in the Marine Corps during his senior year of \nhigh school. Butch joined the infantry and attended training at the \nMarine Corps Recruit Depot in San Diego and Camp Pendleton. Butch was \nassigned to the 1st Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment and was deployed to \nOkinawa for a 13-month assignment. After 1 month of training, Butch was \nsent as one of the first units to Vietnam in July 1965. His unit made a \ntactical landing on the beach in Da Nang.\n  Butch spent the next 13 months in Vietnam before he was reassigned to \nCamp Lejeune in North Carolina. Butch joined the 2nd Reconnaissance \nBattalion for a Caribbean cruise until he volunteered to return to \nVietnam for a second tour. Back in Vietnam, Butch served with Company \nD, 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion, 3rd Marine Division.\n  On November 9, 1967, Butch was monitoring his battalion's radio net \nfrom a base at Phu Bai when he heard his reconnaissance team had been \nambushed and was having trouble evacuating casualties. Butch hadn't \nbeen assigned to patrol because he was preparing to attend Navy diving \nschool in the Philippines. Butch rushed to board a helicopter that was \ngoing to attempt to extract the team and insisted on joining the rescue \neffort. At the team's location, the thick jungle extended for miles and \nthere were no available clearings that were suitable for the helicopter \nto land. Butch requested to be lowered by cable through the jungle \ncanopy. Without regard for his own safety, Butch immediately organized \nthe evacuation of the two most seriously wounded. Then continuing his \nbrave mission he helped rescue the remaining team members. He \nadministered first aid while directing fire to protect the team's \nescape.\n  Butch was left on the ground because there was no additional room for \nhim on the chopper. Alone in the jungle, Butch gathered the team's \nrifles and radios. Butch didn't know if they would be able to return \nfor him because it was getting dark and he might have to stay the night \nand risk getting shot or taken prisoner. When a helicopter returned to \nhoist him out, Butch was dragged through heavy underbrush for hundreds \nof yards which caused multiple injuries. Once inside the helicopter, \nButch had blood on his face, hat, and all the way to his boots. Butch \nhad 3 rifles slung over each shoulder and a giant load of radio and \nother gear. Maj. Bobby Thatcher says he will never forget the look on \nButch's bloody face--a huge smile and big white teeth.\n  Butch's unmatched bravery resulted in the rescue of all the members \nof the reconnaissance team while under extreme combat conditions. Maj. \nBobby Thatcher says Butch's actions were the single bravest thing he \nhas ever seen, before or since. Butch's bold initiative, undaunted \ncourage, and complete dedication to duty display the true meaning of \nselfless service.\n  Butch finished his second tour of Vietnam in August 1968 and returned \nto\n\n[[Page S3056]]\n\nthe U.S. where he was promoted to second lieutenant while stationed in \nHawaii. After 9 months in Hawaii, Butch volunteered, yet again, to \nreturn to Vietnam. Butch began his third tour of Vietnam in August 1969 \nand was assigned to the 1st Reconnaissance Battalion. Butch was \neventually reassigned to the 3rd battalion, 5th Marine Regiment as \nplatoon commander and promoted to company commander. After his third \ntour, Butch continued his service until August 1988. His distinguished \n24 years of military service included serving as an instructor at \nQuantico, to the staff of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon.\n  Butch retired to Nice, France for 7 years where he served as a body \nguard for a Saudi Arabian Princess and as security officer for the \nAmerican International School. In 1995, Butch returned to the United \nStates and lived in Colorado for a year. After visiting a friend \nMontana, Butch decided to move there in 1996. Butch served in the \nMontana Legislature in the early 2000s. Butch and his life partner \nMarilyn Wolff are members of the Montana Wilderness Association where \nthey work to protect our state's public lands.\n  It is my privilege to honor Butch Waddill's true heroism, sacrifice, \nand dedication to service by presenting him with the Silver Star Medal. \nThank you, Butch.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/19/senate-section/article/S3056-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/19/senate-section/article/S3056-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The message received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/19/senate-section/article/S3056-3", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS \n  ORIGINALLY DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13303 OF MAY 22, 2003, WITH \n              RESPECT TO THE STABILIZATION OF IRAQ--PM 18\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nwithin 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the \nPresident publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date.

S. 1369. A bill to allow funds under title II of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act of 1965 to be used to provide training to \nschool personnel regarding how to recognize child sexual abuse; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and \nSenator Blunt, to introduce bipartisan legislation that would expand \napproved uses for the Elementary and Secondary Education Acts \nprofessional development funding to include training for teachers and \nschool personnel on how to recognize signs of sexual abuse in students.\n  According to the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System, \n865,643 children were victims of maltreatment in 2013. Approximately 7 \npercent, or 60,956 children, were victims of sexual abuse.\n  The vast majority of States require that teachers report suspicions \nof child abuse, but most teachers do not receive any training on how to \nsee the signs.\n  According to the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System, 61 \npercent of all reports of child abuse and neglect are made by \nprofessionals, yet only 17.5 percent of abuse and neglect is reported \nby education personnel.\n  Given the amount of time teachers and school personnel spend with \nchildren, it is critical that the warning signs of child sexual abuse \nare identified and reported and that action is taken. Students must \nalso be provided appropriate resources and support if they have been \nabused.\n  The Helping Schools Protect Our Children Act of 2015 expands the list \nof allowable uses for Elementary and Secondary Education Act, ESEA, \nTitle II funding to permit States to use this funding to provide \ntraining for teachers, principals, Specialized Instructional Support \nPersonnel and paraprofessionals on how to recognize the signs of sexual \nabuse and handle the situation if sexual abuse is identified. Under \ncurrent law, Title II provides grants to states for a variety of \npurposes related to recruitment, retention, and professional \ndevelopment of K-12 teachers and principals. Our bill would simply \nallow professional development funds to be used to provide school \npersonnel with this important training.\n  I am proud that Senator Roy Blunt has joined me as original cosponsor \non this bill.\n  It is essential that as mandated reporters, school personnel have \naccess to the proper training to recognize abuse. When no one steps in \nto stop abuse, children can be scarred for their entire lives. If we \nlearn to recognize the signs of abuse or neglect, we will be better \nable to foster a safe environment for young people to learn and grow.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1369\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to repeal the crude oil export ban, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce today, with my \ngood friend from Alaska, Senator Murkowski, a bill that will wipe an \noutdated policy from our books while providing a boost to our domestic \noil development and production industry. I am also pleased to have my \ngreat friends from West Virginia, Senator Manchin, and Tennessee, \nSenator Corker, join us in introducing this bill today. This bill would \nallow U.S. crude oil producers to compete on equal footing with most \nother major oil producing nations, helping to remove current barriers \nthat prevent U.S. producers from receiving a fair price for their \ncommodity on the world market.\n  Just last week, I joined Senator Murkowski as she introduced her \nbill, The Energy Supply and Distribution Act, that looks to address the \nbuild-out of critical energy infrastructure and opening up access to \nnew markets for our energy commodities, while also looking to make it \neasier to distribute our energy to our neighbors in Mexico and Canada. \nA provision in that bill also looks to repeal the current crude oil \nexport ban. I will continue to advocate for that bill as well, and look \nforward to Senator Murkowski bringing that bill before her Senate \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources. I view this bill as not only \ncomplimentary to the bill introduced last week, but also a way to keep \nthe conversation going as I look to bring this bill up for debate in \nanother Committee, before a different audience. Senator Murkowski and I \nhave been working on this effort for some time and we both felt it was \ntime to show our cards and let our colleagues and others see where we \nare in this process. The language may be different, but the goal is the \nsame.\n  Some people may wonder how we even got here, and why would we want to \nremove a policy that has brought little public or Congressional \nscrutiny for almost forty years. Well, in 1973, President Richard Nixon \nplaced crude oil under price controls after the price of oil continued \nto rise. He created a ban on oil exports as an enforcement tool for his \nprice controls, restricting sales outside the U.S. When President \nRonald Reagan lifted those price controls, the accompanying export ban \nwas retained. So basically, the current restricted trade environment \nfor U.S. crude oil is an unintended consequence of a 1970's price \ncontrol policy.\n  While certain exemptions were added over the years allowing for the \nexport of some U.S. oil from California and Alaska, repeal of the \noverall prohibition on U.S. crude oil exports was never really seen as \na major policy priority. All of that changed with the new oil \nproduction renaissance in the U.S, brought about by technological \ninnovations that have allowed for pin-point accurate horizontal \ndrilling and continued advances in hydraulic fracturing. These, and \nother advances, have allowed for exploration and production of shale in \nplaces like North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Texas, Colorado, and New \nMexico. These shale oil and natural gas plays across the country have \nmade the U.S. the number one combined crude oil and natural gas \nproducer in the world. The situation on the ground has certainly \nchanged and it is time to make sure our export policies are finally \nupdated to reflect those changes.\n  This issue is of particular importance to North Dakota. Due to \ntransportation and infrastructure constraints, producers in the Bakken \nare already selling their crude oil at an even steeper discount than \nU.S. producers in other plays. Combined with the recent downturn in the \nprice of a barrel of oil, static or declining current global demand, \nand stable production from OPEC nations--U.S. crude producers in North \nDakota and elsewhere have begun to feel the pinch. While other nations, \nincluding Iran and Russia, are able to sell their crude oil into the \nworld market for the best price and can continue to maintain or pick up \nmarket share during this downturn, U.S. producers are constrained from \ncompeting on equal footing.\n  As recently as 2007, North Dakota ranked eight among U.S. oil \nproducing states. However, due to the shale oil boom in the Bakken, \nNorth Dakota has been the number two oil producing state in the country \nsince 2012--behind only Texas. While North Dakota continues to remain \nin that spot, there has been a steep downturn since September 2014. The \nstate has over one hundred less drilling rigs then at the same time in \nSeptember 2014, the number of wells awaiting completion are at near \nhistoric highs, capital expenditures in the U.S. are way down for oil \ncompanies, and we continue to see layoffs and reduced hours in the oil \nand oilfield services industries. North Dakota crude oil producers need \naccess to the world market to maintain and continue to develop the \nvaluable natural resource in the State.\n  Numerous studies in the past year including one by the non-partisan \nU.S. Government Accountability Office have found that repealing the ban \non crude oil exports will lower U.S. gasoline prices. These studies \nconcluded that we should export crude oil in the same manner that we \nexport millions of barrels of gasoline and diesel every day. As a \nmatter of fact, while some people continue to say that we need to keep \nour crude oil locked in or retail gasoline prices will rise--they fail \nto mention the fact that the U.S. is the number exporter in the world \nof refined petroleum products, including gasoline. So the facts just do \nnot add up for their argument. Additionally, at a time of growing \nthreats to international security, hardworking Americans in the energy \nsector are helping our nation become more secure, prosperous, and \nresilient to crises overseas. The administration's own National \nSecurity Strategy recognizes that energy abundance at home can \ntranslate to a strengthened geopolitical position on the global stage.\n  Unrestricted exports of U.S. crude oil is key to the long-term \nstability of consumer prices, continued investment and growth in U.S. \ndevelopment and production, resumption of job growth in the energy \nsector and supporting industries, and continued reduction in the U.S. \ntrade deficit, while also providing national energy security. I hope \nour colleagues will join us in supporting this important effort to \nremove an outdated policy and put our U.S. crude oil on equal footing \nwith crude oil from around the world.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Cassidy):\n  S. 1374.

A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to clarify and \nexpand Federal criminal jurisdiction over Federal contractors and \nemployees outside the United States, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I reintroduce the Civilian \nExtraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, CEJA. The U.S. has huge numbers of \nGovernment employees and contractors working overseas, but the legal \nframework governing them is unclear and outdated. To promote \naccountability, Congress must make sure that our criminal laws reach \nserious misconduct by U.S. Government employees and contractors \nwherever they act. The Civilian Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act \naccomplishes this important and common sense goal by allowing U.S. \ncontractors and employees working overseas who commit specific crimes \nto be tried and sentenced under U.S. law.\n  Tragic events in Iraq and Afghanistan highlight the need to \nstrengthen the laws providing for jurisdiction over American government \nemployees and contractors working abroad. In September 2007, Blackwater \nsecurity contractors working for the State Department shot more than 20 \nunarmed civilians on the streets of Baghdad, killing at least 14 of \nthem, and causing a rift in our relations with the Iraqi government. \nEfforts to prosecute those responsible for these shootings were fraught \nwith difficulties. The Blackwater trial has now concluded, eight years \nafter this tragedy, with one former security contractor receiving a \nlife sentence and three others receiving sentences of 30 years for \ntheir role. The trial was significantly delayed, however, as defendants \nargued in court that the U.S. Government did not have jurisdiction to \nprosecute them.\n  I worked with Senator Sessions and others in 2000 to pass the \nMilitary Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, MEJA, and then, again, to \namend it in 2004, so that U.S. criminal laws would extend to all \nmembers of the U.S. military, to those who accompany them, and to \ncontractors who work with the military. That law provides criminal \njurisdiction over Defense Department employees and contractors, but it \ndoes not cover people working for other Federal agencies unless they \nare supporting a Defense Department mission. Although prosecutors were \nable to demonstrate that the Blackwater contractors met this criteria, \nhad jurisdiction in that tragic incident been clear from the outset, it \ncould have prevented some of the problems that delayed the case.\n  Other incidents have made it all too clear that the Blackwater case \nwas not an isolated incident. Private security contractors have been \ninvolved in violent incidents and serious misconduct in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, including other shooting incidents in which civilians have \nbeen seriously injured or killed. MEJA does not cover many of the \nthousands of U.S. contractors and employees who are working abroad. The \nlegislation I introduce today fills this gap.\n  Ensuring criminal accountability will also improve our national \nsecurity and protect Americans overseas. Importantly, in those \ninstances where the local justice system may be less than fair, this \nexplicit jurisdiction will also protect Americans by providing the \noption of prosecuting them in the United States, rather than leaving \nthem subject to potentially hostile and unpredictable local courts. Our \nallies, including those countries most essential to our \ncounterterrorism and national security efforts, work best with us when \nwe hold our own accountable.\n  The legislation I propose today has been carefully crafted to ensure \nthat the intelligence community can continue its authorized activities \nunimpeded. This bill would also provide greater protection to American \nvictims of crime, as it would lead to more accountability for crimes \ncommitted by U.S. Government contractors and employees against \nAmericans working abroad.\n  This legislation provides another important benefit: It will lay the \ngroundwork to expand U.S. preclearance operations in Canada--thereby \nenhancing national security and facilitating commerce and tourism with \nour largest trading partner. The U.S. currently stations U.S. Customs \nand Border Protection, CBP, Officers in select locations in Canada to \ninspect passengers and cargo bound for the United States before they \nleave Canada. These operations relieve congestion at U.S. airports, \nimprove commerce, save money, and provide national security benefits. \nEarlier this year, Secretary Johnson was joined in Washington by \nCanada's Minister of Public Safety, Steven Blaney, for the signing of a \nnew preclearance agreement that was negotiated under the Beyond the \nBorder Action Plan. That agreement sets the stage for expansion of \npreclearance capacity for traffic in the marine, land, air and rail \nsectors between the United States and Canada. But one barrier in these \ndiscussions is that the United States lacks legal authority to \nprosecute U.S. officials engaged in preclearance operations if they \ncommit crimes while stationed in Canada. CEJA would ensure that the \nU.S. has legal authority to hold our own officials accountable if they \nengage in wrongdoing, and thereby help pave the way to fully \nimplementing the expanded Canada preclearance agreement.\n  In the past, legislation in this area has been bipartisan. I hope \nSenators of both parties will work together to pass this important \nreform.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1377\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 180\n\n       Whereas the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) \n     tested nuclear weapons on three separate occasions, in \n     October 2006, in May 2009, and in February 2013;\n       Whereas nuclear experts have reported that the DPRK may \n     currently have as many as 20 nuclear warheads and has the \n     potential to possess as many as 100 warheads within the next \n     5 years;\n       Whereas, according to the 2014 Department of Defense (DoD) \n     report, ``Military and Security Developments Involving the \n     Democratic People's Republic of Korea'', the DPRK has \n     proliferated nuclear technology to Libya via the \n     proliferation network of Pakistani scientist A.Q. Khan;\n       Whereas, according to the 2014 DoD report, ``North Korea \n     also provided Syria with nuclear reactor technology until \n     2007.'';\n       Whereas, on September 6, 2007, as part of ``Operation \n     Orchard'', the Israeli Air Force destroyed the suspected \n     nuclear facility in Syria;\n       Whereas, according to the 2014 DoD report, ``North Korea \n     has exported conventional and ballistic missile-related \n     equipment, components, materials, and technical assistance to \n     countries in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.'';\n       Whereas, on November 29, 1987, DPRK agents planted \n     explosive devices onboard Korean Air flight 858, which killed \n     all 115 passengers and crew on board;\n       Whereas, on March 26, 2010, the DPRK fired upon and sank \n     the South Korean warship Cheonan, killing 46 of her crew;\n       Whereas, on November 23, 2010, the DPRK shelled South \n     Korea's Yeonpyeong Island, killing 4 South Korean citizens;\n       Whereas, on February 7, 2014, the United Nations \n     ``Commission of Inquiry on human rights in DPRK (`Commission \n     of Inquiry')'' released a report detailing the atrocious \n     human rights record of the DPRK;\n       Whereas Dr. Michael Kirby, Chair of the Commission, stated \n     on March 17, 2014, ``The Commission of Inquiry has found \n     systematic, widespread, and grave human rights violations \n     occurring in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. It \n     has also found a disturbing array of crimes against humanity. \n     These crimes are committed against inmates of political and \n     other prison camps; against starving populations; against \n     religious believers; against persons who try to flee the \n     country--including those forcibly repatriated by China.'';\n       Whereas Dr. Michael Kirby also stated, ``These crimes arise \n     from policies established at the highest level of the State. \n     They have been committed, and continue to take place in the \n     Democratic People's Republic of Korea, because the policies, \n     institutions, and patterns of impunity that lie at their \n     heart remain in place. The gravity, scale, duration, and \n     nature of the unspeakable atrocities committed in the country \n     reveal a totalitarian State that does not have any parallel \n     in the contemporary world.'';\n       Whereas the Commission of Inquiry also notes, ``Since 1950, \n     the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has engaged in the \n     systematic abduction, denial of repatriation, and subsequent \n     enforced disappearance of persons from other countries on a \n     large scale and as a matter of State policy. Well over \n     200,000 persons, including children, who were brought from \n     other countries to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea \n     may have become victims of enforced disappearance,'' and \n     states that the DPRK has failed to account or address this \n     injustice in any way;\n       Whereas, according to reports and analysis from \n     organizations such as the International Network for the Human \n     Rights of North Korean Overseas Labor, the Korea Policy \n     Research Center, NK Watch, the Asan Institute for Policy \n     Studies, the Center for International and Strategic Studies \n     (CSIS), and the George W. Bush Institute, there may currently \n     be as many as 100,000 North Korean overseas laborers in \n     various nations around the world;\n       Whereas these forced North Korean laborers are often \n     subjected to harsh working conditions under the direct \n     supervision of DPRK officials, and their salaries contribute \n     to anywhere from $150,000,000 to $230,000,000 a year to the \n     DPRK state coffers;\n       Whereas, according to the Director of National \n     Intelligence's (DNI) 2015 Worldwide Threat Assessment, \n     ``North Korea's nuclear weapons and missile programs pose a \n     serious threat to the United States and to the security \n     environment in East Asia.'';\n       Whereas the 2015 DNI report states, ``North Korea has also \n     expanded the size and sophistication of its ballistic missile \n     forces, ranging from close-range ballistic missiles to ICBMs, \n     while continuing to conduct test launches. In 2014, North \n     Korea launched an unprecedented number of ballistic \n     missiles.'';\n       Whereas, on December 19, 2015, the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation (FBI) declared that the DPRK was responsible \n     for a cyberattack on Sony Pictures conducted on November 24, \n     2014;\n       Whereas, from 1998 to 2008, the DPRK was designated by the \n     United States Government as a state sponsor of terrorism;\n       Whereas the DPRK is currently in violation of United \n     Nations Security Council Resolutions 1695 (2006), 1718 \n     (2006), 1874 (2009), 2087 (2013), and 2094 (2013);\n       Whereas the DPRK repeatedly violated agreements with the \n     United States and the other so-called Six-Party Talks \n     partners (the Republic of Korea, Japan, the Russian \n     Federation, and the People's Republic of China) designed to \n     halt its nuclear weapons program, while receiving significant \n     concessions, including fuel, oil, and food aid;\n\n[[Page S3071]]\n\n       Whereas the Six Party talks have not been held since \n     December 2008; and\n       Whereas, on May 9, 2015, the DPRK claimed that it has test-\n     fired a ballistic missile from a submarine: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) finds that the DPRK represents a serious threat to the \n     national security of the United States and United States \n     allies in East Asia and to international peace and stability, \n     and grossly violates the human rights of its own people;\n       (2) urges the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the \n     Treasury to impose additional sanctions against the DPRK, \n     including targeting its financial assets around the world, \n     specific designations relating to human rights abuses, and a \n     redesignation of the DPRK as a state sponsor of terror; and\n       (3) warns the President against resuming the negotiations \n     with the DPRK, either bilaterally or as part of the Six Party \n     talks, without strict pre-conditions, including that the \n     DPRK--\n       (A) adhere to its denuclearization commitments outlined in \n     the 2005 Joint Statement of the Six-Party talks;\n       (B) commit to halting its ballistic missile programs and \n     its proliferation activities;\n       (C) cease military provocations; and\n       (D) measurably and significantly improve its human rights \n     record.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/19/senate-section/article/S3071-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3071]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 181--DESIGNATING MAY 19, 2015, AS ``NATIONAL \n                     SCHIZENCEPHALY AWARENESS DAY''\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN (for himself and Ms. Heitkamp) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.
