Mr. President, from the outset, the new Senate has \nworked to realize a smarter and more inclusive appropriations process. \nThat is why we passed a budget, moving past 6 years of inaction. That \nis why we passed all 12 appropriations bills through committee, moving \npast 6 years of inaction. Nearly all of those bills passed on a \nbipartisan basis. That is why it is so disappointing to see voices on \nthe other side try to tie them up in gridlock.\n  We never lost sight of the goal. We never stopped trying to move the \nSenate forward and our country ahead. Because we kept pushing, we are \nsteadily overcoming the partisan gridlock of the past and steadily \nmoving back to regular order on appropriations. Last week we passed one \nbipartisan appropriations bill--the bill that funds America's veterans. \nToday we will begin to advance another--the bill that funds America's \ntransportation and housing infrastructure.\n  I would like to recognize the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, for \nher work in crafting a bipartisan bill that makes smart investments in \ncritical transportation and infrastructure priorities. This is a \nbipartisan bill that will help ensure our transportation systems are \nreliable, efficient, and safe. This is a bipartisan bill that will \nincrease the efficiency and affordability of Federal housing programs.\n  For example, the expanded Moving to Work Program it contains will \noffer a helping hand to lower income Americans. Moving to Work is one \nof the many success stories of the bipartisan welfare reform effort of \nthe 1990s, and by expanding it from 39 to 339 housing authorities, we \ncan help more Americans achieve the self-sufficiency that is at the \ncore of our national dream.\n  Americans who strive for a better life deserve real opportunity. They \ndeserve serious policies that can make positive differences in their \nlives. That is what Moving to Work aims to achieve. It is just one more \nreason to pass the bipartisan transportation infrastructure bill before \nus.\n  Again, I want to thank our colleague from Maine for her important \nwork across the aisle to craft it. We look forward to debating the bill \ntoday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/18/senate-section/article/S8029-6", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8029]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S. 2288\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

The Democratic leader is recognized.\n\n\n                         Appropriations Process\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I too agree with the distinguished \nRepublican leader that it is good we are moving through the \nappropriations process. The key to getting this done is December 11. I \nhave checked with the subcommittees, I have been in touch with the \nWhite House, and they have made significant progress. I would hope they \nwill be working hard during the recess that we are going to have for \nThanksgiving. By the time we get back here it is going to be time to \nstart making some really difficult decisions, which we have to do. I \nlook forward to the appropriations process succeeding, and next year I \nhope we can move through the bills individually. That would be the best \nthing to happen to the Senate in a long time.\n  Mr. President, on the bill that is before the Senate at this stage, \nthe education bill, we have two of the finest Senators I have had the \npleasure of serving with who are the managers of this legislation, the \ndistinguished senior Senator from the State of Washington, of course, a \nmember of the Senate Democratic leadership, and the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Tennessee, Lamar Alexander. They have worked \ntogether well, and it is easy to work well with either one of them. \nThey understand what a legislator is. A legislator can't get everything \nthey want, but they have to work for the good of the country. These two \nhave done that with this legislation.\n  Had I been writing this legislation and advocating on behalf of this \nlegislation, I probably would have done it a little differently than \nthey did, but it is a fine piece of legislation, put together by two \nvery fine Senators. I look forward to it being completed in the \nimmediate future.\n\n\n                     Surface Transportation Funding\n\n  Mr. President, one of the Founding Fathers, Benjamin Franklin, said: \n``You may delay, but time will not.'' For far too long Republicans have \ndelayed doing anything to address our Nation's insolvent transportation \nsystem or to address other vitally important infrastructure problems. \nAs Paul Ryan said earlier this year on the House floor:\n\n       Instead of fixing the problem, we've dodged it. Five times \n     we've come up with temporary solutions and transferred money \n     from the general fund into the trust fund--which, in English, \n     means we've patched a pothole and not fixed the problem.\n\n  Sadly, that is what has happened, and it looks like it is going to \nhappen again--which is too bad--and we are going to have another short-\nterm extension because the conferees couldn't work out their \ndifferences.\n  My Republican colleagues have delayed, but time has marched on, and \nit has wreaked havoc on our Nation's tens of thousands of roads that \nare in disrepair. This is a problem and a very dangerous one. We have \n61,000 roads and bridges that have been deemed structurally deficient.\n  Just a short distance from where we are here--just a couple of \nmiles--is the Memorial Bridge that connects Arlington National Cemetery \nwith the National Mall. That bridge is corroded and it is failing. They \nhave closed down several lanes of that bridge. Vehicles that pass over \nthis Memorial Bridge are subject to weight restrictions. Why? Because \nof the bad condition of the road and the bridge itself. Construction \nexperts are working now to fix the problem, but here is the kicker: The \nMemorial Bridge is just 1 of 14 structurally deficient bridges in our \nNation's Capital, according to the American Road and Transportation \nBuilders Association. There are 14 structurally deficient bridges in \nour Nation's Capital alone. It is a staggering figure.\n  But around the country, we have about 60,000 others where we have a \nproblem. The problem is bigger than thousands of these decrepit \nbridges. The American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that one-\nthird of all U.S. roads are in poor or mediocre condition. That is 1.3 \nmillion miles of roadway. The former Secretary of the Treasury and an \nacademic said in a steering committee chaired by Senator Klobuchar \nrecently that each year an American motorist who drives a car in effect \nis paying an extra $2,000 in damage to their car. Drive around and feel \nthe crashes as you hit those big potholes.\n  It is not only in Washington, DC. It is all over the country, and \nthat is to say nothing of the time and resources wasted each year \nbecause of our struggling transportation system in other ways. We \nAmericans waste nearly 7 billion hours in our cars due to traffic \ncongestion. We waste 3 billion gallons of fuel. We need real, long-term \ninvestment in America's surface transportation infrastructure.\n  Right now we are spending about $90 billion a year, including State \nand local funds, just to maintain the current poor condition. People \ndon't like to hear this but the fact is that we need to do more.\n  The Federal Highway Administration estimates it will take $170 \nbillion a year to improve the condition of our roads and bridges. If we \ndon't increase that funding, it will only get worse. The American \nSociety of Civil Engineers maintains that by 2020 the United States \nwill need to invest $3.6 trillion in our infrastructure to bring it up \nto par. If Congress continues the current baseline funding, in the next \n6 years our transportation infrastructure will be a disaster, but it \nlooks like that is where we are headed with the new highway bill.\n  Instead of maintaining the status quo, now is the time for Congress \nto increase surface transportation funding. There is no reason for any \nRepublican to balk at spending more money for our Nation's roads and \nbridges. We can be conservative and still support fixing our roads and \nbridges. Think about $2,000 per driver because of the condition of the \nroads and highways.\n\n  We need look no further than the senior Senator from Oklahoma. Is \nthere anybody in the world who could say Jim Inhofe is not a \nconservative? Of course he is. But he has worked hard with liberal \nBarbara Boxer to address this critical need. Their bill is not \neverything I would like--and that is an understatement--but I \nappreciate their efforts. We need other Republicans to step up, as did \nInhofe, and do the right thing. We need a long-term highway bill with \nincreased funding for our roads and our bridges. We shouldn't delay. \nNow is the time to be bold with adequate resources to address our \ninfrastructure needs.\n\n\n          Sarah Winnemucca and Native American Heritage Month\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in the Capitol Visitor Center, there is a \nstatue of a Nevada Paiute woman named Sarah Winnemucca. Each State gets \ntwo statues; one of ours is Sarah Winnemucca. I wish the other one \nwould just go away, but it all has to be done legislatively. That is a \nsubject for another discussion. I am referring to the other one from \nNevada.\n  The statue of Sarah Winnemucca is beautiful. The artist was a 23-\nyear-old young man. When the contest was being held to find out who \nwould get the benefit of being able to sculpt it for Statuary Hall and \nthey brought in his design, the judges gasped. It was so unbelievable. \nHer skirt is blowing in the breeze. He depicted her with a shellflower \nin one hand and her autobiography in the other, her dress blowing in \nthe wind. I admire that statue. In fact, I have a smaller version of \nthat statue in my Capitol office.\n  Think about her accomplishments. She was the first Native American to\n\n[[Page S8031]]\n\npublish an autobiography. She was a scholar who spoke five languages. \nShe was a defender of her people. She even met with the President of \nthe United States, Rutherford B. Hayes, to negotiate settlement for the \nPaiute Tribe.\n  Sarah Winnemucca was courageous and resolute. She was good for her \npeople and good for her country. She is one of Nevada's heroes.\n  November marks Native American Heritage Month. During this month, we \nhonor the contributions of American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native \nHawaiian cultures and their impact on the United States. We honor the \ncontributions of Native Americans such as Sarah Winnemucca.\n  Native American heritage is a pillar of America's foundation and \ncertainly the foundation of so many different States. Nevada has 22 \nseparate tribal organizations. We feel that is an important part of our \nhistory in the State of Nevada. The Native American cultures are \nuniquely embedded within the fabric of our Nation, and their \ncontributions must never be forgotten.\n  Would the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n\n                            Compound Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The compound motion to go to conference on S. \n1177 is the pending business.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the Senator from Washington and I are \nhere to recommend to Members of the Senate that we vote yes on allowing \nthe majority leader and the minority leader to appoint conferees so our \ncommittee can continue its work on a bill to fix No Child Left Behind.\n  The vote we are about to have is not a vote on the merits of the \nbill. The reason it is not a vote on the merits of the bill is because \nthere is no bill.\n  What we are asking for is the usually routine request to permit us to \ntake our legislation, which passed the Senate 81 to 17, and to meet \nwith Members of the House of Representatives, who passed a similar \nbill, and see whether we can come up with a bill that the conference \nwould recommend to the House and the Senate to approve. When that \noccurs--and it could occur this week--then Senators would have at least \na week to consider whether to vote for or against the bill.\n  I emphasize to Senators and their staffs who may be watching that \nthis is a routine request. This is the kind of request that the Senate \nshould almost always approve, giving our leaders a chance to allow us \nto continue our committee work, especially given this bill.\n  Newsweek magazine recently reminded us what everybody knows. \nEverybody knows this law needs to be fixed. We are 7 years overdue.\n  The Senator from Washington and I spent an entire year working with \nour committee, which is as diverse as any committee in the Senate, to \nproduce a result. The process allowed numerous amendments. Everybody \nwho wanted an amendment got one in committee. As a result of the \nprocess, all 22 voted to report the bill to the Senate. It was a \nremarkable event considering the diversity of views on our committee. \nThen we came to the floor of the Senate. We had a full debate. We \nconsidered more than 70 amendments. The vote was 81 to 17--a remarkable \nevent. This is a bill which has alligators lurking in every part of the \npond, and the Senate is about to get a result on something that affects \n100,000 public schools, 3.5 million teachers, and 50 million students.\n  Since the Senate passed its bill and the House passed its bill, the \nSenator from Washington and I have been meeting with our counterparts, \nthe chairman and ranking member of the House education committee. Our \nstaffs have been talking, and we have been trying to take the two \nbills, which are very similar, and see if we could suggest to the \nconference a way that we could get a result. We don't have the result \nbecause we haven't had a meeting of the conference. We can't have a \nmeeting of the conference until the leaders are allowed to appoint the \nMembers of the conference.\n  On Monday evening, the Rules Committee of the House of \nRepresentatives reported a rule to allow the leader to appoint members \nof the conference, and they did it yesterday, Tuesday, by voice vote. \nWe should be able to do this by consent.\n  I would think everybody in the Senate would want us to go to work to \nsee if we can produce a result on this bill. We will have a chance, \napparently, in a few minutes to vote yes, we want to allow our leaders \nto appoint conferees so that we can see if we can get a result. This is \nnot a vote on the merits of the bill. Almost everybody voted for the \nbill in the Senate last time, but even if you didn't, this is not a \nvote on the merits of the bill. If you want to vote ``no'' later--which \nI hope you don't; I hope we will come up with something you will \nsupport--you will have a chance to do that and you will have a week to \ndo it.\n  We have 22 members of our committee. That is about a quarter of the \nSenate. We have been talking for years. We have offered amendments. The \nmembers of the committee have had the staff draft for the last several \ndays. They have been briefed for the last several days. No amendments \ncan be offered, no bill can be offered until the conference actually \nmeets. So this is a vote to allow leaders to appoint conferees so that \nwe can move ahead on the urgent business of seeing whether we can \nproduce a bill that we will recommend to the House and to the Senate \nthat we will fix No Child Left Behind.\n  I thank the Senator from Washington for her leadership. It was her \nadvice that led us down this path which so far has produced a good \nresult. I thank the majority leader for making time to put this bill on \nthe floor. I also thank the Democratic leader, Senator Reid, who has \nworked to make this easy for us to do during this process.\n  We have had excellent cooperation from Senators. I think everybody \nwants a result, and we hope we can go to work to do it. So vote yes to \ngive us a chance to finish our work, and then take a look at our work. \nYou will have a week to read it. We will be pleased to visit with you \nabout it. And then I hope you vote yes again, but that will be the vote \non the merit. This is a vote simply on whether you trust the leaders to \nappoint conferees to allow the committees to finish our work.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the last 5 minutes before the debates ends \nfor any additional comments I might make.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are all in agreement that Congress \nabsolutely needs to work together to finally fix the broken No Child \nLeft Behind law for our students, our teachers, our parents, and the \ncommunities in my home State of Washington and across the country. \nToday we will have the chance to take another step forward toward that \ngoal.\n  As the Presiding Officer heard from our chairman, Senator Alexander, \nsince February of this year, he and I have worked together on a \nbipartisan education bill that would remove the harmful one-size-fits-\nall mandates of No Child Left Behind, while also including Federal \nguardrails to make sure all of our students have access to a quality \neducation.\n  We improved on our bipartisan bill in the HELP Committee with the \nhelp of our colleagues and a number of amendments that were agreed to, \nand in July the Senate voted to pass that bipartisan bill with a vote \nof 81 to 17. The House also passed their bill in July.\n  Since then, Chairman Alexander and I--as he just mentioned--have been \nworking with House Education and the Workforce Committee Chairman Kline \nand Ranking Member Scott. The four of us have had very good \nconversations about making sure the conference is successful, and I \nhope we will be able to continue our bipartisan work in the conference, \ncontinue to bring in the priorities and ideas of our fellow Senators \nand Members of the House, and make sure that the final product we will \nbring forward is something that can pass both Chambers and that \nPresident Obama can sign into law. But first we need to take the next \nstep in the legislative process by approving this compound motion to \nname conferees and allow the Senate to proceed to conference with the \nHouse.\n  In the Senate, we want to appoint every member of the HELP Committee. \nOur committee members have worked very hard to craft the Senate bill, \nand we want to make sure their voices are heard in the conference \nmeeting.\n  I urge our Members to support this compound motion in a few minutes \nso\n\n[[Page S8032]]\n\nwe can continue this incredibly important work to finally fix No Child \nLeft Behind.\n  I once again thank Chairman Alexander for the tremendous job he has \ndone in moving the legislation to this point.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, shortly the Senate will vote on the motion to \nappoint conferees--or what is often called the motion to go to \nconference--for a bill that reauthorizes the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, the ESEA, which is the legislation governing our Federal \nK-12 education policy. Because most Americans have probably never heard \nof this obscure parliamentary procedure--the motion to appoint \nconferees, that is--I wish to take just a moment to explain how it \nworks or at least how it should work.\n  When the House and the Senate each pass separate but similar bills, \nthe two Chambers have the ability to convene what is called a \nconference, a conference committee. A conference is essentially a \nmeeting where delegates from each Chamber come together to iron out any \ndifferences between their respective--similar but somewhat different--\nbills and then put together what is called a conference report, which \nis a single piece of legislation that reconciles any disparities \nbetween the House-passed bill and the Senate-passed counterpart to that \nbill. Once the delegates to the conference--the conferees, as they are \nsometimes known--agree on a conference report, they bring it back to \ntheir respective Chambers, to the House and the Senate, for a final \nvote.\n  It is important to note that once the conference report is sent to \nthe House and the Senate for a final vote, there is no opportunity to \namend the legislation. It is an up-or-down vote. Each Chamber can \neither approve or reject the conference report in its entirety. If each \nChamber votes to approve the conference report, then it is sent to the \nPresident, who can either sign it into law or veto it. So what we are \ndoing today is voting on the motion to appoint conferees for the \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n\n  Earlier this year, both the House and the Senate passed their own \nESEA reauthorizations and now we are voting to proceed to the \nconference process and to appoint certain Senators to participate in \nthat process as conferees. Historically, and according to the way the \nconference process is supposed to work, this vote is not that big of a \ndeal. Voting on the motion to appoint conferees is usually, and mostly, \na matter of routine, but it is not a vote that should be rushed through \non a moment's notice because it is the last opportunity for Senators \nand Representatives who are not conferees, such as I, to influence the \noutcome of the conference process.\n  We can do that by offering what are called motions to instruct the \nconferees. For example, let's say I was not chosen to be a conferee on \na particular bill, but there was an issue related to the bill that was \nimportant to me and to the people I represent. In that case I could ask \nthe Senate to vote on a set of instructions that would be sent to the \nconference to inform the conference's deliberations and influence the \nsubstance of the conference report.\n  This is how the conference process is supposed to work, but it is not \nhow the conference process has been conducted with respect to this \nbill--the Elementary and Secondary Education Act reauthorization. Sure, \nwe are still voting to appoint conferees and those conferees will still \nconvene a conference and that conference will still produce a \nconference report. So from the surface it will still look like the \nconference process is happening, is unfolding in the manner in which it \nis supposed to, but beneath the surface we know that all of this has \nalready been prearranged, precooked, predetermined by a select few \nMembers of Congress working behind closed doors free from scrutiny, and \nwe know this vote was scheduled on extremely short notice so it would \nbe difficult, if not impossible, for the rest of us to influence the \nsubstance of the conference report through motions to instruct.\n  Why does this matter? We know the American people care deeply about \nK-12 education policy, but why should they care about this obscure \nparliamentary procedure in the Senate? They should care, and we know \nthey do care, because the process influences the policy. In this case, \nthe process expedites the passage of policies we know don't work, \npolicies to which the American people are strongly opposed. For \ninstance, it is my understanding this bill would authorize $250 million \nin new spending on Federal pre-K programs--what amounts to a \ndownpayment on the kind of universal, federally run pre-K programs \nadvocated by President Obama. This would be a disaster not only for \nAmerican children and American families but for our 21st century \neconomy that increasingly requires investments in human capital.\n  We know a good education starting at a young age is an essential \ningredient for upward economic mobility later in life. A mountain of \nrecent social science research proves what experience and intuition \nhave been teaching mankind for millennia; that a child's first few \nyears of life are critical in their cognitive and emotional \ndevelopment. Yet we also know that too many of America's public \nschools, especially those public schools in low-income and \ndisadvantaged neighborhoods, often fail to prepare their students to \nsucceed. Nowhere has the top-down, centrally planned model of public \neducation failed more emphatically than in our Nation's public pre-K \nprograms. The epitome of Federal preschool programs is Head Start, \nwhich has consistently failed to improve the lives and educational \nachievements of the children it ostensibly serves.\n  According to a 2012 study by President Obama's own Department of \nHealth and Human Services, whatever benefits children gain from the \nprogram disappear by the time they reach the third grade, but because \nbureaucracies invariably measure success in terms of inputs instead of \non the basis of actual outcomes, Head Start and its $8 billion annual \nbudget is the model for Democrats as they seek to expand Federal \ncontrol over childcare programs in communities all across this country.\n  This bill also doubles down on the discredited common-core approach \nto elementary and secondary education the American people have roundly \nand consistently rejected. Parents and teachers across America are \nfrustrated by the heavy-handed, overly prescriptive approach to \neducation policy by Washington, DC. I have heard from countless moms \nand dads in Utah who feel as though anonymous government officials \nliving and working 2,000 miles away have a greater say in the education \nof their own children than they do. The only way to improve our K-12 \neducation system in America is to empower parents, educators and local \npolicymakers to meet the unique needs of their communities and serve \nthe low-income families the status quo is leaving behind.\n  With early childhood education, we could start block-granting the \nHead Start budget to the States. This would allow those closest to the \nchildren and families being served to design their own programs rather \nthan spending all their time complying with onerous, one-size-fits-all \nmandates and designate eligible public and private preschools to \nreceive grants. We know this works because many States are already \ndoing it. In my home State of Utah, for instance, the United Way of \nSalt Lake has partnered with two private financial institutions, \nGoldman Sachs and J.B. Pritzker, to provide first-rate early education \nprograms to thousands of Utah children. They call it a pay-for-success \nloan. With no upfront cost or risk to the taxpayers, private capital is \ninvested in the Utah High Quality Preschool Program, which is \nimplemented and overseen by the United Way. If, as expected, the \npreschool program results in increased school readiness and improved \nacademic performance, the State of Utah repays the private investors \nwith the public funds it would have spent on remedial services the \nchildren would have needed between kindergarten and the 12th grade had \nthey not participated in the program.\n\n[[Page S8033]]\n\n  Washington policymakers should not look at Utah's pay-for-success \ninitiatives and other local success stories like them as potential \nFederal programs but rather as a testament to the power of State and \nlocal control, of State and local ingenuity. We should not expand \nWashington's control over America's schools and pre-K programs. \nInstead, Congress must advance reforms that empower parents with \nflexibility and with choice to do what is in the best interests of \ntheir children. The policies in this bill, as I understand them, move \nin the opposite direction.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I know there are a number of Senators \nwho have important appointments. I know the Senator from Oklahoma has a \nmilitary funeral he wants to attend, so I intend to make about 3 or 4 \nminutes of concluding remarks and then yield back the rest of the \nRepublican time.\n  I would say this to my friend from Utah. Critics of this body say we \nare not able to get a result. We are often able to get a result, and \nthis vote is about whether we are able to get a result. That is what \nthis vote is about.\n  We have big differences. That is why we are sent here--to resolve our \nbig differences. If all we want to do is announce our differences, we \ncould stay home and speak on a street corner. After we announce our \ndifferences, our job is to get a result. We are not the Iraqi \nParliament, we are the United States Senate. Under our rules, after we \nhave had a full process, our leaders--the Republican leader and the \nDemocratic leader--appoint Members of the Senate to work with Members \nof the House and see if we can get a result--see if we can get a \nresult.\n  As I said earlier, this went through committee--22 members on the \ncommittee. As diverse a committee as we have, unanimously they \nrecommended a result, with many amendments. This came to the floor, we \nhad more than 70 amendments, and with a vote of 81 to 17 we got a \nresult. We have our instructions. It came from this Senate--81 to 17. \nWe have our instructions.\n  We will work with Members of the House of Representatives, if given \npermission, and see if we can get a final bill. All 22 members of our \ncommittee will be on that conference. There will be more Members than \nthat on the conference. So all of the education committee members will \nbe continuing our work to get a result. Why would we slow this down \nwhen the American people have waited 7 years for us to get a result on \nfixing No Child Left Behind?\n  So, Mr. President, however you voted on the bill earlier--and almost \neveryone voted for it--I hope you will support Senator McConnell, \nSenator Reid, Senator Murray and me and our committee and our efforts \nto continue our work to get a result. This is not a vote on the merits \nof the bill because there is no bill. We are asking for permission to \ngo write a bill and then we will bring it back here and Senators will \nhave at least a week to consider it and then they can vote yes or no. \nWe need a result. I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  I yield back our time.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield back all time on the Democratic side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to yielding back all time?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Reserving the right to object, I ask unanimous consent \nto speak for 1 more minute following his comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I thank my friend and distinguished colleague \nfrom Tennessee for his remarks.\n  In light of the fact that this bill does involve a complicated \nprocess, in light of the fact that this bill--the original Senate \nbill--was many hundreds of pages long, in light of the fact that the \nconference report is likely to be lengthy, I would hope and I would \nurge my colleagues to have a say in the matter. I hope we will all work \ntoward a process that can result in at least allowing the American \npeople to see this bill before it comes back in conference report \nform--at least a week or so before we actually have a vote on the \nconference report. I think the American people deserve to see what is \nin it before their representatives in the House and in the Senate have \nan opportunity to vote on it. I hope that will be the case and I hope \nmy colleagues will agree to that.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, as the Senator from Utah knows, that is \nthe case. I said that to him yesterday and I just said it on the floor. \nWe hope to complete our work this week. We may or we may not, but the \nbill will be out for at least a week for Members of this body to \nconsider it.\n  We considered it in committee with many amendments, on the floor with \nmany amendments, and 22 Members of the Senate are reading the staff \nrecommendations right now. We hope to get a bill. We will get a result. \nAnd, yes, all Members--I am glad we are having this discussion. We \nhaven't had conferences in years around here. Senator Mikulski has \nmentioned that. Maybe this discussion will help us understand how to \nget a result in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor, and I call for a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending \ncloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     disagree to the amendment of the House, agree to the request \n     from the House for a conference, and authorize the Presiding \n     Officer to appoint conferees with respect to S. 1177, an \n     original bill to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 to ensure that every child achieves.\n         Mitch McConnell, David Perdue, Shelley Moore Capito, \n           Daniel Coats, John Cornyn, John Barrasso, John Hoeven, \n           Cory Gardner, Johnny Isakson, Lamar Alexander, Michael \n           B.

After disposition \n     of any multifamily property described under this section, the \n     contract and allowable rent levels on such properties shall \n     be subject to the requirements under section 524 of MAHRAA.\n       Sec. 216.  The commitment authority funded by fees as \n     provided under the heading ``Community Development Loan \n     Guarantees Program Account'' may be used to guarantee, or \n     make commitments to guarantee, notes, or other obligations \n     issued by any State on behalf of non-entitlement communities \n     in the State in accordance with the requirements of section \n     108 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974:  \n     Provided, That any State receiving such a guarantee or \n     commitment shall distribute all funds subject to such \n     guarantee to the units of general local government in non-\n     entitlement areas that received the commitment.\n       Sec. 217.

The Secretary may agree to extend the \n     term of the agreement and to make any necessary changes to \n     accommodate regionalization. A Moving-to-Work agency may be \n     selected as a regional agency if the Secretary determines\n\n[[Page S8052]]\n\n     that unified administration of assistance under sections 8 \n     and 9 by that agency across multiple jurisdictions will lead \n     to efficiencies and to greater housing choice for low-income \n     persons in the region. For purposes of this expansion, in \n     addition to the provisions of the Act retained in section \n     204, section 8(r)(1) of the Act shall continue to apply \n     unless the Secretary determines that waiver of this section \n     is necessary to implement comprehensive rent reform and \n     occupancy policies subject to evaluation by the Secretary, \n     and the waiver contains, at a minimum, exceptions for \n     requests to port due to employment, education, health and \n     safety. No public housing agency granted this designation \n     through this section shall receive more funding under \n     sections 8 or 9 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 than \n     it otherwise would have received absent this designation. The \n     Secretary shall extend the current Moving-to-Work agreements \n     of previously designated participating agencies until the end \n     of each such agency's fiscal year 2028 under the same terms \n     and conditions of such current agreements, except for any \n     changes to such terms or conditions otherwise mutually agreed \n     upon by the Secretary and any such agency and such extension \n     agreements shall prohibit any statutory offset of any reserve \n     balances equal to four months of operating expenses. Any such \n     reserve balances that exceed such amount shall remain \n     available to any such agency for all permissible purposes \n     under such agreement unless subject to a statutory offset. In \n     addition to other reporting requirements, all Moving-to-Work \n     agencies shall report financial data to the Department of \n     Housing and Urban Development as specified by the Secretary, \n     so that the effect of Moving-to-Work policy changes can be \n     measured.\n       Sec. 240.

Mr. President, I am pleased to begin the floor \nconsideration of the fiscal year 2016 appropriations bill for \nTransportation, Housing and Urban Development, and related agencies. \nThis bill funds programs that are essential to the American people. Our \nbill provides $18.5 billion for the Department of Transportation and \n$38.5 billion for the Department of Housing and Urban Development to \nmeet the housing needs of low-income, disabled, and older Americans, to \nshelter the homeless and to boost our economy and to create jobs \nthrough much-needed investments in our roads, bridges, seaports, \nrailroads, transit systems, and airports.\n  Let me begin my remarks by thanking the chairman of the full \ncommittee, Senator Cochran, and the vice chairman, Senator Mikulski, \nfor their leadership in advancing these appropriations bills. As \nChairman Cochran has previously noted, this is the first time in 6 \nyears that the Appropriations Committee has approved all 12 of the \nfunding bills, and I will point out that we did so months ago. I also \nwish to thank and acknowledge the hard work of the ranking member of \nthe subcommittee, Senator Jack Reed. I am very pleased that he is \ncosponsoring this legislation and that we are offering these substitute \namendments that have just been filed together. The two of us have \nworked very closely in drafting this bill, and we have listened to the \nrecommendations from Members on both sides of the aisle. Through \nconsiderable negotiation and compromise, we have crafted a bipartisan \nbill that targets limited resources to those programs that meet our \nmost essential transportation and housing needs.\n  As a result of hard work and compromise by many of our colleagues and \nthe administration, the recent bipartisan budget bill allows the \nlegislation before us today to be made even more effective. As I \nmentioned, I have offered on behalf of Senator Reed and myself a \nsubstitute that reflects the new allocation made possible by the budget \nagreement. This additional funding has allowed for further investments \nin key programs, such as increasing the HOME Program by $830 million \nfor a total of $900 million, increasing the Community Development Block \nGrant Program by $100 million for a total of $3 billion. I must note \nthat those are the current funding levels.\n  The bill also provides $255 million in additional funds for the FAA's \nfacilities and equipment account for a total of $2.8 billion, which is \nthe budget-requested level to ensure that critical aviation programs \nare not delayed. These programs offer a wide range of support, from \nspace-based surveillance, data communications, to everyday basic needs, \nensuring that power systems are fully supplied to support the aviation \nand air traffic systems that operate 24 hours, 7 days a week.\n  We have also allocated an additional $100 million for the TIGER \nProgram for a total of $600 million for this important and much-in-\ndemand program that supports infrastructure, economic development, and \njob creation throughout the Nation. In fact, every State in the Nation \nhas benefited from the TIGER Program.\n  We are bringing the Maritime Security Program up by $24 million for a \ntotal of $210 million to match the recently passed authorized level.\n  Finally, we are providing an additional $311 million for FTA's \nCapital Investment Grants Program, for a total of approximately $1.9 \nbillion, which supports transit systems across the country.\n  This bill is critical to meeting the vast needs of our Nation's \ncrumbling infrastructure. We have all heard of the low grades that the \nAmerican Association of Civil Engineers has given to our bridges and \nhighways. Many of us--particularly those of us who represent large \nrural States--know about the deplorable conditions of far too many of \nour roads and highways and the need for the State departments of \ntransportation to post bridges that are no longer able to accommodate \nweight loads and modern traffic.\n  The TIGER Program will help us meet the needs of our crumbling \ninfrastructure. This highly competitive program creates jobs and \nsupports economic growth in every one of our States. The need for the \nprogram is demonstrated by the statistics. Listen to this, my \ncolleagues: The Department of Transportation has received 627 eligible \napplications requesting more than $10 billion for fiscal year 2015 from \nall over the country, but only 39 of those 627 eligible applications \nwere able to be funded. Only $500 million of the more than $10.1 \nbillion in requested funds could be granted. This is a successful \nprogram with an overwhelming demand, and I am happy that the new \nallocation allows us to give it a modest increase. It doesn't begin to \nmatch the application level for this program, which, again, is a \nreflection of our infrastructure needs in this country.\n  Turning to air travel, the aviation investments will continue to \nmodernize our Nation's air traffic system and help to keep rural \ncommunities connected to the transportation network. These investments \nare creating safer skies and a more efficient airspace to move the \nflying public.\n  I have been very troubled by the devastating rail accidents that have \noccurred in recent years. In 2013, the runaway train near the Maine \nborder in the Province of Quebec, Canada, devastated the community of \nLac-Megantic, and the inferno killed 47 people. First responders from \nMaine responded to the calls for help from their Canadian counterparts \nand helped to put out that terrible fire. More recently, we saw an \nAmtrak train in Pennsylvania derail, killing eight passengers. We have \nseen case after case of railcars turning over and spilling hazardous \nsubstances. This is a real problem, and it is one this bill addresses. \nTo improve rail safety, our legislation provides $50 million in new \nfunding for infrastructure improvements, rail grade crossings, and \npositive train control safety technology.\n  In addition to rail, we have included several important provisions to \nenhance truck safety on our Nation's\n\n[[Page S8056]]\n\nhighways. For example, our bill requires the Department of \nTransportation to finalize a rule mandating electronic logging devices \nwithin 60 days of enactment. This rule is critical to ensuring that bad \nactors will not be able to falsify their records. It will bring greater \naccountability to the industry. It helps those good truck drivers, the \nvast majority of our truck drivers. It separates them from the bad \napples who are falsifying their logs.\n  The bill also requires the Department of Transportation to publish a \nproposed rule on speed governors, which limit the speed at which trucks \ncan operate. The Department has delayed this important rulemaking 22 \ntimes since 2011. It is far past time to get this important safety rule \ncompleted and to implement it. It isn't just the ranking member and I \nwho think so, this is also supported by the trucking industry itself.\n  We need to make progress in both the areas of electronic logs and \nspeed governors, and our bill will ensure that that occurs.\n  We also provide funding for the Office of Defects Investigation at \nthe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to analyze \nconsumers' complaints and trends related to vehicle safety defects. The \nPresiding Officer may recall that this agency came under scrutiny this \npast year for failing to discover and act on defective airbags, as well \nas faulty ignition safety switches. We must ensure that remedies are \nimplemented promptly and make certain the public is better informed of \ncritical defects.\n  Our bill also provides for critical housing programs. It preserves \nexisting rental assistance for vulnerable families and individuals, and \nit improves the Federal response to the problem of youth homelessness. \nBoth of these were priorities for me. I wanted to make sure that those \nvulnerable, low-income families, our disabled citizens, and low-income \nseniors did not lose the subsidized housing to which they are entitled \nand in which they are already living. So that is a very important \nprovision. I would note, when we look at the budget of the Department \nof Housing and Urban Development, that more than 83 percent of the \nbudget is devoted to these programs that are so vital to ensuring safe \nand affordable housing for some of the most vulnerable Americans.\n\n  Improving the Federal response to homelessness is also an important \npriority for me. That is why we placed a special emphasis in this bill \non the growing problem of youth homelessness, and we have funded \nadditional vouchers for what is known as the VASH Program that is aimed \nat our homeless veterans. Sufficient funding is provided to keep pace \nwith the rising cost of housing vulnerable families. I will note that \ndoing so this year has been especially challenging, given the \nadministration's decision to lower mortgage insurance premiums, because \nthat reduced FHA receipts by nearly $1.1 billion, but despite this \nchallenge, this bill, by setting priorities, ensures that the more than \n4.7 million individuals and families currently housed will not have to \nworry about losing their assistance. Again, let me emphasize, without \nthis assistance, many of these families, many of our disabled \nAmericans, and many of our low-income seniors could become homeless. We \nare preventing that.\n  The increase in youth homelessness is especially troubling and \nwarrants more attention. Reflecting this concern, $40 million is \nprovided to expand efforts to reduce youth homelessness. In addition, \nthe bill includes funding for more than 2,500 family unification \nvouchers to assist our young people who are exiting the foster care \nsystem, and it extends the amount of time these youth can use their \nvouchers.\n  I am sure if the Presiding Officer talked to foster youth in his \nState, the situation would be the same as mine. He would find that when \nthey reach a certain age, they are no longer eligible for care by \nfoster families and they have nowhere to go. Oftentimes, they end up in \nshelters. That is not an acceptable situation. So by expanding these \nfamily unification vouchers, we are hoping to ensure that these youth \nare not homeless or forced to live in shelters.\n  These efforts build on our success in reducing veterans' \nhomelessness. We have had real success in this area. VASH is a program \nthat actually works. We have reduced the number of homeless veterans by \none-third, but the job is not done. We have a goal in this country of \nending homelessness among our veterans who have served our country. We \nprovide an additional 10,000 vouchers for our homeless veterans so we \ncan complete our work and reach that goal.\n  Our bill is also an important source for local development. We worked \nhard to provide $3 billion for the Community Development Block Grant \nPrograms. This is an extremely popular program with the States and \ncommunities because it allows them to tailor Federal funds to support \nlocal economic and job creation projects. In fact, in my State, it is \none of the most popular economic development programs--and I think that \nis true across America--because it isn't a top-down Federal Government \ndictating how the funds are used; instead, there is great flexibility \nin providing funds to States and communities, and they decide what is \nneeded. They match the funds. There is often private sector money \ninvolved as well which may be used to revitalize the downtown to build \naffordable housing or whatever that particular community decides will \nspur economic development and create jobs. This is a job creation \nprogram, and it is one that is flexible and recognizes that those at \nthe local and State level know best what their economic development and \njob creation priorities are.\n  The bill before us does not solve all of the problems facing housing \nand transportation in this country. We simply do not have the money to \ndo that, even with the higher allocation, in this era where we are \nfacing a $17 trillion debt. This is a fiscally responsible bill. It \nreflects priorities. We cannot fund every good program out there. We \nhave to make choices. We certainly don't want to fund programs that are \nnot effective. We have put our money on our priority programs that will \nmake a real difference.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to present our appropriations bill to \nthis Chamber. Again, I want to thank my ranking member, Senator Jack \nReed, with whom we have worked very closely on the substitute \namendment.\n  As we begin debate on the Transportation-HUD appropriations bill, I \nurge my colleagues to consider the careful balance struck by the \ncompromise that our subcommittee and our full committee worked so hard \nto achieve.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise with my colleague Senator Collins in \nsupport of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development \nappropriations bill before us.\n  I begin first by commending the chairman for her extraordinary work, \nher thoughtful, careful consideration of all of these issues, and her \nwillingness to include priorities of members on both sides. As always, \nshe did this in a fair, considerate, and transparent manner, along with \nthe staff who also did a remarkable job. So I thank her for her \nleadership and for her consideration.\n  As a result of the budget agreement, we have a higher allocation--an \nallocation that will allow us to make more responsible investments in \nkey transportation and housing initiatives that will help grow our \neconomy, create jobs, strengthen neighborhoods, and better meet our \naffordable housing goals throughout the country. We need to improve \nhousing stability for our most vulnerable citizens, and this allocation \nwill allow us to preserve HUD's housing and homeless assistance \nprograms, which are vital to our Nation's security and the progress and \nopportunity for all of our people.\n  Over half of HUD's rental assistance goes to support someone who is \nelderly or disabled or both, so these programs are particularly \nimportant for seniors and for Americans with disabilities who need the \nkind of security that only adequate housing can give. Without these \nprograms, frankly, many of these individuals would be homeless or \npaying more than half of their income in rent alone and, as a result, \nunable to support the other basics of life, including food and clothing \nand just basically getting around.\n  Overall, this bill makes important contributions toward improving the \nsafety of our roads--another area of our responsibility is \ntransportation--in helping people better connect to jobs and \nopportunities. It is often overlooked that housing is critical in every\n\n[[Page S8057]]\n\naspect, particularly in being able to get and maintain a job, and that \ncertainly is something we want to encourage. Also, these investments \ncan serve as a catalyst for economic development, enhancing the \ncommunity, preserving community assets, allowing Federal resources to \nleverage--many times over, in some cases--private resources and local \nresources.\n  Among the critical transportation investments that this bill provides \nis $16 billion to the Federal Aviation Administration, fully funding \nthe agency's budget request for air traffic control, safety oversight, \nand its facilities and equipment. Again, so much of our commercial \nactivity depends upon a solid aviation infrastructure. We are fully \nfunding their request, ensuring that they have adequate infrastructure, \nparticularly when it comes to air traffic control in an age in which \nthere are technological revolutions, causing them to reinvest \nconstantly in better equipment and better preparation. For the past 3 \nyears, in fact, maintenance on the agency's basic infrastructure has \nbeen deferred so the air traffic control challenges could be met and \ncould be fully funded, but that is not a sustainable long-term \nstrategy. The bill in front of us today, under the leadership of the \nchairman, puts the FAA back on track, and we want to keep it on track.\n  As the chairman has pointed out, in the transportation area, $600 \nmillion is allocated for the TIGER Program, which fully funds local \nsolutions to transportation problems. One of the commendable aspects--\nand there are many in this program--is these are localities coming to \nthe Department of Transportation with specific requests that they know \nwill help their economy, that will help move people and goods and \nservices and improve the competitiveness of not only the locality but \nthe Nation.\n  In addition to that, $41 billion in highway grants and another $8.6 \nbillion in transit formula grants are allocated that States and local \ngovernment rely on every year.\n  In addition to these provisions, the bill makes strong investments in \nAmtrak and rail safety, providing $50 million for rail safety grants \nand targeted new investments along the Northeast corridor, which is one \nof the major thoroughfares of commerce and travel in our country.\n  It also allows the Federal Railroad Administration to hire 84 new \ninspectors and safety staff to address the safe transportation of \npassengers and energy products. We have seen repeated incidents of \ntragic accidents caused by outdated equipment and caused by many \nfactors. We hope that with this legislation, we will not only reduce \nthem but eliminate them.\n  We have also seen accidents in the center of the United States, in \nthe far West, where products were being transported by rail and there \nwere problems there too. Again, these energy products are necessary for \nthe whole economy, and we need to be on the job inspecting, to ensure \nthat they are moving safely through all of our communities.\n  These investments are necessary. They are necessary for safety, they \nare necessary for efficiency, and they are necessary to build the kind \nof transportation system that supports jobs and economic growth. I \nthink most people--and most people back home, certainly--understand the \nconnection between good infrastructure, good jobs, and a prosperous \neconomy. They get it, and this legislation gets it also.\n  At the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the bill makes \nimportant investments in our communities. Again, as the chairman has \npointed out, the Community Development Block Grant Program--CDBG--is an \nextraordinarily effective tool for local governments to spur innovation \nand economic investment. Again, as the chairman indicated, it comes \nfrom the bottom up, not the top down. It allows mayors and city \ncouncils and local planning agencies that are able to utilize this \nmoney in combination with other resources to fund projects that make \ntheir communities more effective and more efficient. It is based upon \ntheir perspective, not our perspective, and it is a very efficient and \nvery helpful program. It gives communities the tools to address their \nailing infrastructure problems, and it brings critical services to many \nwho need them the most.\n  The legislation also includes additional resources for affordable \nhousing production through the HOME Program--an investment we know is \nnecessary as our Nation faces a lack of affordable housing nationwide.\n  The bill also protects some of our most vulnerable citizens by \nproviding critical resources to prevent and end homelessness, among \nveterans and youth in particular. This bill provides an additional \n10,000 vouchers to move us closer to eliminating homelessness among our \nNation's veterans. Just a few days ago we celebrated Veterans Day, but \nwe can't celebrate it 1 day a year, we have to celebrate it every day. \nOne way we can do that is to put the resources where they need to be so \nevery veteran, we hope, can achieve affordable, decent, and safe \nhousing. In that way, we celebrate their service every day, and this \nbill tries to do that. We have already seen success in this regard--\nabout a 33-percent reduction in veterans' homelessness since 2009--but \nit is not good enough. There is still work to be done. That is a \ncommitment that Senator Collins and I share, and her leadership has \nhelped us move forward to achieve that objective.\n  Youth experiences in homelessness is another phenomenon, and the \nchairman spoke very eloquently about the fact that we are able to \ntarget resources to help some of these programs for young people to \nfind homes. In particular, the chairman made the point about young \npeople who are aging out of foster care. We have a fairly substantial \nsystem to help young people until they reach their adulthood, and after \nthat it seems to go away. And so with resources we are helping children \nthrough foster homes and suddenly they have to go and they are on their \nown. This legislation is going to help them make a transition, at least \nto have the housing they need so they can use their skills productively \nfor the benefit of everyone.\n\n  It also helps us improve coordination across the government so that \nthese young people don't fall through the cracks. Some of it is \nresources and some of it is just working together cooperatively in a \ngovernmentwide approach and the legislation helps encourage that.\n  As I said and as I am repeating what the chairman said so well, \nhomelessness is a barrier to education, employment, and opportunity. If \nyou have to move three or four times a year and you are a young child, \nyour education is going to be very challenging from school to school to \nschool. If you are a person who doesn't have an address or moves \nfrequently, how do you get that callback for the job interview if they \ncan't find you and you can't find them? All of this instability can be \nsignificantly reduced and opportunity better achieved if we have \ndependable housing, and that is at the essence of our proposal today. \nSo it applies to youth, families, and it applies to a whole span of \nAmericans. Again, let me thank the Senator for her leadership in \ncrafting this bill. On the whole it achieves a balanced compromise that \nresponds to the priorities of the Members of this Chamber within the \nallocation we received.\n  We don't have unlimited resources so we had to figure out innovative \nways to deliver better results with what we have, and I think we have \ngone a long way in doing that. We also have to continue to look to the \nfuture: making smart investments today that will help us build a much \nbetter tomorrow with a better transportation system, better housing \noptions and, again, this legislation does that.\n  As with any legislative proposal, there are aspects of the \nlegislation that could be improved. I hope we can improve them going \nforward. There are provisions, for example, with respect to addressing \nthe safety of double 33 trailers which already passed the Senate on a \nbipartisan basis. Those are issues that we can and must work on to go \nforward, but overall this proposal does a great deal to respond to the \nneeds of the American public.\n  Again, let me thank the chairman. It has been very challenging, but \nit is very enjoyable to work with her. We also have quickly an omnibus \nwe must prepare. So we are literally going from the floor to meet with \nour colleagues, so hopefully we can pull this all together so we will \nhave the opportunity to present to the full Senate a bill that is \nthoughtful and achieves the needs of our people.\n\n[[Page S8058]]\n\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 315, submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 315) expressing support for the goals \n     of both National Adoption Day and National Adoption Month by \n     promoting national awareness of adoption and the children \n     awaiting families, celebrating children and families involved \n     in adoption, and encouraging the people of the United States \n     to secure safety, permanency, and well-being for all \n     children.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 315) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  (The resolution, with its preamble, is printed in today's Record \nunder ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, before I start my remarks, let me say how \npleased I am to see Senator Reed and Senator Collins here with this \nimportant bill, the opportunity to amend the bill and do the business \nwe should be doing.\n  This Senator is also glad to be here with Senator Klobuchar. She and \nI cochair the Senate side of the congressional caucus on adoption, and \nthe resolution that was just agreed to adopts November as National \nAdoption Month, and November 21 as National Adoption Day. While we are \nhere talking about this, all of our States have kids who need to be \nadopted.\n  If you went to the Missouri Department of Social Services Web site \ntoday, you would find 114 foster youth who are ready and waiting to be \nadopted. If you looked around the country today, you would find that \nthere are 415,000 children in the U.S. foster care system and 108,000 \nof those kids are waiting to be adopted. Last year 22,000 young men and \nwomen aged out of the foster care system and they never got that \nopportunity for the permanent home, the forever home that could make \nsuch a difference in their lives, not only as a kid but their lives as \nan adult.\n  I have two or three kids I want to talk about. Austin is 12. He is \nfull of energy. He has a great smile. He is extremely active, as lots \nof 12-year-old boys are. He loves to be outside. He enjoys, as he would \nphrase it, ``going on adventures.'' He likes animals. He would like to \nlive on a farm one day. He likes basketball. He likes being on his \nbasketball team, but mostly he would like to have a family. Mostly his \ndream is the dream that he would have a family to encourage him and \nsupport him.\n  There are two other young brothers, aged 11 and 7. When you first \nmeet Mykez, you can tell he is relaxed. He is laid back. He is an easy \nguy to be with. In his free time he likes being active. He likes to be \non his bike. He likes to play football. If it is possible being \noutdoors, he would like to be outdoors, but he is also happy with a \nvideo game or with the TV. At school he likes history class the best, \nbut his best grade in school is art. His brother Jameer appears to be \npretty shy and quiet, but once he gets to know you, he easily turns on \nthe charm. He is a football and basketball guy as well, but he enjoys \nquiet activities such as drawing, reading, and coloring. He loves being \nwith his brother. He loves video games. His favorite class is math, \nearning his highest grade there. But what they would like is a family. \nThey would like a family that would allow them to keep in contact with \ntheir siblings but would also give them some structure, some attention, \nand some consistency that has been missing in their life.\n  Marissa is 5. She has some challenges. She is a sweet, loving girl. \nShe is happy, curious, and loves to laugh. She has a hard time right \nnow expressing herself in lots of other ways. She is working on \nbuilding her vowels and consonant sounds. She works on her sign \nlanguage vocabulary. She has a spunky attitude, but she would melt the \nheart of a future family if those things ever become connected.\n  There are tens of thousands of children all over the country just \nlike them who just need a family--tens of thousands of children where a \nfamily could make all the difference in the world, not only when they \nare growing up but when they are adults and they have that family to \nturn back to.\n  Nobody is better to work with on these issues than Senator Klobuchar. \nI ask unanimous consent to enter into a colloquy with her and then come \nback to me in a little bit after she has had a chance to talk about the \nimportance of National Adoption Month and National Adoption Day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I actually would have a question, \nfirst, of Senator Blunt, because I know he is the parent of an adopted \nchild from Russia.\n  I heard a rumor they are traveling to every State in the Union; is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. BLUNT. We are trying.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. OK, good. I wanted to get that on the record because I \nknow he wanted to come to North Dakota, which is everyone's dream, and \nso Senator Blunt asked for some advice from me to go to the great State \nof North Dakota.\n  Your child whom you adopted is Russian, and we have so many issues \nwith some of these countries, from Russia to the Congo. I know families \nin Minnesota who have adopted children from Russia, and they were just \nready to adopt the sibling. They met the brother or sister--and of \ncourse the kids know the brother or sister--and then the curtain was \nbrought down, and those kids were literally pawns in a political game \nwhen Russia stopped all adoptions.\n  Senator Blunt is hosting a meeting with the people involved in \nadoptions in the Congo. We have had a similar situation where the visas \nwere pulled and the parents who visited these kids and are ready to \nadopt these kids haven't been able to do that.\n  I wondered if Senator Blunt could comment on the situation with these \ncountries and what the Senator thinks we can do.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I think this is a problem, and there are lots of families \nin the United States who would love to\n\n[[Page S8059]]\n\nhave kids from wherever in the world kids are who need families. The \ntwo examples you have just given are some of the frustrations of \ninternational adoption in just the last few years, where thousands of \nkids were coming to the United States from other countries such as \nChina, Ethiopia, Guatemala, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and \ncertainly from Russia.\n  The tragedy of so many of these stories is that the child has \nsuddenly seen that opportunity, they have bonded with families, and \nthey have gone through the whole process. Many people, when Russia \nstopped Russian adoptions, were ready to go to court, had been to \nRussia multiple times and had exchanged visits and photos. Not only is \nit that the family is ready for the adoption to occur, but, more \nimportantly, the person who is to be adopted is ready for the adoption \nto occur.\n  Just to show what can happen, in the case of Russia, the kids who \nwere closest to being adopted by American families, the Russian \nGovernment suddenly created incentives to put them at the top of a list \nthat doesn't get much attention, which gave special incentives to \nRussian families to adopt these kids before the American families who \nwere ready to welcome them could adopt them.\n  We are having a meeting today with the Ambassador from the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo, and I am grateful the Ambassador would come. Our \nreal concern there is that there are many kids in the Congo who had \nactually been adopted. There was a commission that had been put in \nplace to study the question of why they can't get their exit visas now \nto leave with the families the courts in the Democratic Republic of the \nCongo have said could adopt these kids and that group has been \ndisbanded. All that is necessary there is the exit opportunity--the \nexit permission--to leave the country to go with the families who have \nalready legally adopted them.\n  The Senator and I and several of our colleagues are going to meet \nwith the Ambassador today. We are glad he is coming. We would like to \nsee that meeting result in going back and looking at cases where their \ngovernment has already decided this is a great match for these kids and \nthese families and figure out how to let those families get their kids \nto the United States.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Thank you. This is also very important in my State. As \nI mentioned, we have the highest rate of international adoptions in the \ncountry. We have families who have opened their hearts and their homes \nto kids from every country, including Vietnam, Guatemala, Nepal, and \nHaiti.\n  In my background as county attorney, for 8 years I oversaw the \nlawyers who worked with foster care and adoptions. We made it a huge \npriority to try to speed up the process for kids to be adopted from \nfoster care. Right now in our country nearly 400,000 children are \nliving without permanent families in the foster care system. Over \n100,000 of these children are eligible for adoption, but too many of \nthem will languish for years in foster care--oftentimes with very good \nfamilies for them, but obviously a permanent home is what you want.\n  We talked about international adoptions around the world. There are \nestimated to be nearly 18 million orphans who have lost both parents \nand are living in orphanages or on the streets who want, again, a \npermanent home.\n  Senator Blunt talked about some examples from his own State. One \nexample is the Hatch family. Emerson Hatch was one of these orphaned \nchildren. They started the process to adopt her from India in 2000. \nEmerson was one of 300 kids living in an orphanage built to house 34 \nchildren.\n  The Indian Government refused to release her, and the family had to \nendure a 2-year wait, an earthquake, and a contested election in India \nbefore they were finally able to get her out of India with 1 minute to \nspare before her passport expired. She was malnourished, 2 years old \nbut only weighed 14 pounds and was in poor health.\n  But with a lot of love and the help of the Adoption Medicine Clinic \nat the University of Minnesota, Emerson and the Hatch family are \nthriving. She is in high school, and the family is passionate about \ngiving orphans permanent, loving homes.\n  There are many things that this Senate can do. The first, as Senator \nBlunt explained, is leading efforts when countries put up barriers for \nno good reason. Obviously, sometimes you will have legal issues in \ncountries with corruption or other reasons why there is a pause in \nadoptions. But when countries are putting up barriers for no good \nreasons and for reasons that are fairly transparent, we must lead and \nwork with other Senators across the aisle to get this done.\n  The second is legislation. We have had a number of successful bills \npassed in the Senate. The bill I am probably proudest of is something \nthat I did with Senator Sessions and Senator Inhofe, which was to allow \nolder siblings to come in internationally when a younger sibling had \nbeen adopted. What was happening is kids would turn 17 after holding \nthe family together as the oldest sibling, and then they would no \nlonger be eligible for adoption.\n  We had a family out of the Philippines with nine children, and the \noldest two kids helped hold them together in an orphanage and then they \nturned too old to be adopted. That family I will never forget. The \nMerkourises came to me and said: Well, we have these choices. We can \nadopt the seven kids and leave the two behind--it was like a ``Sophie's \nChoice''--or we can leave them all there because we want them to stay \ntogether or you can change the law. That was the discussion.\n  So I worked with my colleagues. I will never forget. The Merkourises \ncame with pictures of these children on their iPads and went around to \nthe offices of House Members and Senators who were holding up the bill \nand showed them to their staff members. The staff members would call \nour staff crying and said: OK, well, we won't hold it up anymore. And \nwe were able to get that passed.\n  To Senator Blunt, I was able to be with that family in their home, a \nfarmhouse that they have expanded. It was like a Philippine version of \n``The Sound of Music.'' They are an incredible family. I just talked to \nthem a few months ago, and they are doing very well.\n  This is, I would argue to our colleagues, a bipartisan area in \nCongress. It is something we can do across the aisle, but it is also \nsomething where we can make significant difference--not just in one \nfamily's life but in many, many families' lives.\n  I thank the Senator for his work and his continued leadership in this \narea.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I would say in this regard that there are several things \nwe are trying to do that we are still working on with Senator Klobuchar \nand others together. Clearly, there are great stories to be told.\n  One thing we don't want to forget with National Adoption Month and \nNational Adoption Day is the many families and the many individuals who \nbenefit from adoptions. It is very easy to talk about the frustrations \nof trying to make things work better--the foster kids who aren't \nadopted, the international kids who should be here who have families \nwho want them to be here.\n  We also want to talk about the many success stories. We had an Angels \nin Adoption event just a few weeks ago and recognized from virtually \nevery State a family that had done something extraordinary, such as the \nfamily who took a family from the Philippines. Expanding the farmhouse \nis probably job one if you are going to bring nine more people into \nyour house.\n  The Supporting Adoptive Families Act, the Timely Mental Health for \nFoster Youth Act, and the Adoption Tax Credit Refundability Act all \nneed attention to make adoption work and to make it easier. It is life \nchanging for everybody involved and, in most cases, it is life changing \nnot just for the family but for anybody who really knows the family and \nsees what happens when people are able to reach out, become a family, \nand make a difference in the moment but also to make a difference \nforever.\n  I will let Senator Klobuchar finish, but working on these issues is \nimportant, and it is bipartisan. You are never going to find anybody \nwho says: Well, we don't need that. But we do need to be sure we are \npaying the kind of attention that we need to make this work better, to \nmake it easier, and to increase the chances that adoptive families not \nonly are able to become adoptive families but that they are\n\n[[Page S8060]]\n\nalso able and more likely to be successful adoptive families.\n  Again, I thank Senator Klobuchar for her leadership and for her work.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Thank you.\n  As you know, our work is never done. We have a number of bills out \nthere for which we have bipartisan support and that we are going to \nwork on.\n  I think my last statement would be that our kids deserve so much more \nthan just a roof over their heads and a bed to sleep in. Each and every \nchild deserves a loving home, a nurturing family, and a brighter \nfuture. That is what National Adoption Month is all about, and that is \nwhy Senator Blunt and I are on the floor today. That is why all of us \nhave a responsibility to carry on this torch and to keep fighting for \nthese children.\n  I thank Senator Blunt.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/18/senate-section/article/S8060-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8060-S8075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES \n                  APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2016--Continued\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask to speak on one other subject \nbriefly for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n           Department of Veterans Affairs Performance Bonuses\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern that \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs chose to issue performance bonuses \nto senior executives, including the director of the St. Paul Regional \nOffice of the Veterans Benefits Administration, despite recent \nrevelations of improper and dishonest conduct.\n  According to a report released by the VA's Office of the Inspector \nGeneral in September, two VBA executives used their positions to assign \nthemselves to different jobs that involve fewer responsibilities while \nmaintaining their higher salaries. They actually assigned themselves to \na different job where they had to work less and then kept their high \nsalaries.\n  One of them was a woman named Kim Graves, the director of the \nVeterans Benefits Administration St. Paul Regional Office since October \n2014. The inspector general found that Ms. Graves used her influence as \ndirector of the VBA's Eastern Area Office to compel the relocation of \nthe previous St. Paul office director. So she moved that person and \nthen moved herself into the job. She then proceeded to submit her own \nname for consideration and fill the vacancy that she had just created.\n  Taking on the job of directing the St. Paul Regional Office was \nactually a step down in responsibility for Ms. Graves. In the inspector \ngeneral's words, she ``went from being responsible for oversight of 16 \n[regional offices] to being responsible for only 1 [regional office],'' \nbut she kept her Senior Executive Service salary of $173,949 per year. \nShe also received over $129,000 in relocation expenses.\n  In spite of this behavior, Ms. Graves received an $8,687 performance \nbonus this year. The St. Cloud VA health care system chief of staff, \nSusan Markstrom, received a performance bonus as well the same year she \nwas reported with some mismanagement issues.\n  A chief of staff collecting bonuses while running off nurses and \ndoctors and a senior executive using her position to push out one of \nher colleagues and give herself a plum assignment with fewer \nresponsibilities but the same high salary are the kinds of actions that \ncreate a breach of trust. I am generally proud of Veterans Affairs. We \nobviously have issues in our health system with backlogs and other \nproblems, but there are a lot of hard-working people who work in \nVeterans Affairs who should be lauded for that work because our \nveterans deserve nothing but the best.\n  But in this case, I thank the inspector general for being willing to \nlook into this difficult case and shedding light on what has been \nhappening. The conduct is unacceptable and further erodes trust.\n  It is commendable that the VA inspector general took action by \nreferring these two cases to the U.S. attorney for possible criminal \nprosecution. The VA needs to do right by our veterans and taxpayers by \nholding bad actors accountable and implementing reforms to prevent \nexploitation such as this from ever happening again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 310\n\n  Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 310, the \nEliminating Government-funded Oil-painting Act, or the EGO Act. I would \nlike to thank my colleagues, Chairman Ron Johnson and Ranking Member \nTom Carper of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs. Their committee considered the EGO Act in its business meeting \nof June 24, 2015, and reported it favorably without amendment.\n  The Eliminating Government-funded Oil-painting Act is commonsense \nlegislation that bans the Federal Government from spending taxpayer \ndollars on oil paintings of Presidents, Vice Presidents, Cabinet \nSecretaries, or Members of Congress. These paintings can cost as much \nas $40,000 and are often placed in a back hall of a government \nbureaucracy, never to be seen by the public.\n  I will note that $40,000 is the same as the average annual wage of a \nworker in Louisiana. Think about it--that worker worked a whole year, \nand what she earned is what the Federal Government will spend on the \npainting of a Cabinet Secretary who serves for 6 months, and then the \npainting is put in the back of a building, never to be seen.\n  With trillions in debt, there is more to do in our obligation to \nspend taxpayers' money wisely, but this is a start.\n  I offer my strong support for the EGO Act and urge its passage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 165, S. 310; I further ask that \nthe bill be read a third time and passed and that the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I have no clue why the esteemed \nDemocratic leader objects. All I can say is that is an incredible \ninsensitivity to working families. I have no clue.\n  There is a family out there right now struggling, not sure if they \ncan pay their rent or their mortgage. They are going to lose their car. \nTheir children will go to school in old clothes and maybe hungry \nbecause the amount of money they earn per year is not enough. They look \nat people in Washington like a new version of ``The Hunger Games''--it \nis the Capital of this country, and all the riches of this country are \nbrought here to the Capital for paintings of government officials, to \nbe hidden away, while they struggle to make their mortgage, their car \nnote, and to make sure their child is properly fed.\n  That people in government would be insensitive to those families \nshows the problem. That people in Washington would be insufficiently \naware that the average family is making $40,000 a year--the same as \nwhat one of these paintings can cost--and not care is an indictment of \nthose who do not care.\n  I regret that there is objection to this, but we will bring it up \nlater.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here to speak in what is probably \nmy 119th ``Time to Wake Up'' speech related to climate change.\n\n[[Page S8061]]\n\n  I would like to take this occasion to express my appreciation to a \nperson whom the TV cameras can probably see behind me sitting on the \nstaff bench, Joseph Majkut, who has been a fellow on my staff for over \na year now. He has been very instrumental in helping me prepare these \nspeeches. I am grateful to him.\n  Today, I ask that we imagine a dark castle with looming ramparts and \ntall towers. It is strongly built, and it is well defended. Its \ndefenders are determined and implacable. They patrol those ramparts and \nfrom their castle battlements attack and harass their opponents. The \ncastle's thick walls are built to keep out unwelcome things. In this \ncastle, those unwelcome things are science--the science of climate \nchange; truth--the truth of what carbon pollution does to our \natmosphere and oceans; and decency--the human decency, in the face of \nthat information, to try to do the right thing.\n  This is Denial Castle, the fortress of climate denial constructed by \nthe big polluters. Like many castles, this castle is built on elements \nthat date back to earlier wars. Some parts date back to tobacco \ncompanies denying that smoking causes cancer. Some parts of it date \nback to the lead industries denying that lead paint poisons children. \nSome parts go back to denial of what acid rain was doing to our New \nEngland lakes and denial of what pollution was doing to our \natmosphere's ozone layer. There might even be a few bits dating back to \ndenial that seatbelts and airbags were a good idea. But now it is the \nbig carbon polluters who command Denial Castle. They now enjoy the \npower to pollute for free, so they attack climate science. They send \nout trolls to disrupt Web sites and blogs. They harass climate \nscientists. One minion became attorney general of Virginia and so \nharassed a University of Virginia scientist that Mr. Jefferson's \nuniversity had to use university lawyers and the State supreme court to \nget the harassment stopped.\n  This castle has within it its own little stable of scientists to trot \nout like trained ponies to create false doubt and uncertainty about the \nharm carbon pollution causes. Of course, the polluters have \nmouthpieces, such as the Wall Street Journal editorial page, to help \nspread their fog of doubt and denial. Most of all, they have weaponry. \nThe weaponry on these dark ramparts is not just pointed outward at \nscience and at the public; those polluter weapons point in, as well, at \nthe Members of Congress who are held hostage inside the castle. This is \nnot just a fortress; it is also a prison. Members know that if they try \nto escape, the full force of the polluters' political weaponry will \nfall on them. Many of the hostages are restless, but escape is \nhazardous. Some are actually happy to help man the ramparts. Look at \nthe effort by Senate Republicans this week to override the Obama \nadministration's Clean Power Plan--our Nation's most significant effort \nyet to assert global leadership in staving off the worst effects of \nclimate change.\n\n  For those Republican Senators who want out of Denial Castle, escape \nis hazardous because Citizens United, that shameful Supreme Court \ndecision, armed the polluters on the ramparts with a terrifying new \nweapon: the threat of massive, sudden, anonymous, unlimited political \nspending. A Republican in a primary has virtually no defense against \nthat. One minute you are on course to reelection; the next moment a \nprimary opponent has millions of dollars, pounding you with negative \nads, and the polluter-funded attack machine has turned on you.\n  One polluter front group actually warned that anyone who crossed them \nwould be ``at a severe disadvantage,'' and that addressing carbon \npollution with a price on carbon would be a ``political loser.'' From a \ngroup backed by billionaires now threatening to wield, just in this \nelection, $750 million in political spending, that is not a very subtle \nthreat.\n  Of course, a threatened attack doesn't actually have to happen to \nhave its political effect. A threat, a quiet threat, a secret threat \ncan be enough. We will never see those threats unless we are in the \nbackroom where they are made. That is the unacknowledged danger of \nCitizens United.\n  What were the five Republican judges thinking when their Citizens \nUnited decision unleashed unlimited political spending and its dark \ntwin, the silent threat of that unlimited political spending? This is \nnot an idle concern. By 2 to 1, Americans think the Justices often let \npolitical considerations and personal views influence their decisions. \nAmericans massively oppose the Citizens United decision--80 percent \nagainst, with 71 percent strongly opposed. Most tellingly, by a ratio \nof 9 to 1, Americans now believe our Supreme Court treats corporations \nmore favorably than individuals. Even self-identified conservative \nRepublicans by a 4-to-1 margin now believe the Court treats \ncorporations more favorably than individuals.\n  Linda Greenhouse, who long resisted drawing such a conclusion, has \nwritten that she finds it ``impossible to avoid the conclusion that the \nRepublican-appointed majority is committed to harnessing the Supreme \nCourt to an ideological agenda.'' Other noted Court watchers such as \nNorm Ornstein at the conservative American Enterprise Institute and \nJeffrey Toobin long ago reached a similar conclusion.\n  Let's look carefully at what those five Justices did in their 5-to-4 \nCitizens United decision. Let's start where they started, with the \nFirst Amendment to the Constitution. The First Amendment protects \nhonest elections by allowing limitations on the influence of money. The \nFirst Amendment allows limitations on election spending when they \nreflect a reasonable concern about corruption.\n  If you are a judge who wants to unleash unlimited corporate money \ninto elections, you need to get around that problem, which they did by \nmaking the factual finding that all this corporate money will not \npresent even a risk of corruption, not a chance. That is obviously \nfalse, but they said it anyway, which is interesting. But wait, it gets \nmore interesting still. To make that factual finding, they had to break \na venerable rule--the rule that appellate courts don't do factfinding. \nThey broke that rule.\n  They did something else, too. Every time Congress or the Supreme \nCourt had examined corporate corruption in elections, they found a \nrich, sordid record of corporate corruption of elections. That is \nAmerican history. The five Justices knew a record like that in the case \nwould have made it pretty hard to find no risk of corporate corruption \nof elections. All the evidence would go the other way.\n  How did the five Justices make sure the case had no good evidentiary \nrecord on corporate corruption of elections? Very cleverly. They \nchanged the question in the case--what the Court calls the question \npresented. They changed the question late in the case, after there was \nany chance to develop a factual record on that new question presented. \nIt is very unusual, but it is exactly what they did. Then they \noverruled a hundred years of practice and precedent of earlier Courts.\n  One could argue that each one of these different steps was wrong. \nCertainly, the ultimate factual finding, that corporate money can't \ncorrupt an election, is way wrong. But the worst wrong is that these \nsteps are linked together in a chain of necessity you must follow to \nget that result.\n  What is the chance that these conservative Justices just happened to \nchange the question presented, which just happened to prevent there \nbeing a robust factual record on the very question where they just \nhappened to need to make false factual findings about corruption; which \njust happened, this of all times, to be the time they broke the rule \nagainst appellate fact finding; all of which just happened to provide \nthe exact findings of fact necessary to get around that First Amendment \nleash on corporate political spending?\n  Put all those steps together, and what you see is Justices behaving \nnot like an umpire evenly calling balls and strikes, but like a \nlocksmith carefully manufacturing a key, each of whose parts is \nprecisely assembled to fit the tumblers and turn a particular lock. The \nresult was amazing new weaponry for the corporate polluter apparatus, \npolitical Gatling guns in a field of muskets, which the polluters have \ndeployed very effectively to silence debate about climate change.\n  Before Citizens United, Republicans regularly stood up to address \nclimate change. A Republican nominee campaigning for President had a \nstrong climate change platform. A Republican\n\n[[Page S8062]]\n\nPresident spoke of its urgency. Republican Senators authored and \nsponsored big climate change bills. Republican Congressmen voted for \nthe Waxman-Markey bill in the House or wrote articles favoring a carbon \ntax and then came over and became Senators.\n  But after Citizens United, there was virtual silence. The polluters \nused Citizens United's new political artillery to shut debate down.\n  Money can be speech, but it isn't always. Money can also be bribery, \nbullying, intimidation, harassment, shouting down, and drowning out. \nThe legendary turn-of-the-century political fixer Mark Hanna once said:\n\n       There are two things that are important in politics. The \n     first is money, and I can't remember what the second one is.\n\n  He didn't say that because money is free speech. Money is political \nartillery. Look at the munitions. My gosh, most dark money political \nads in the last election were negative ads. At times, virtually all on \nthe air have been negative ads. Many ads have been reviewed and deemed \nfalse or misleading. At times, a majority of the ads running were \ndeemed false or misleading. That is not debate; that is artillery.\n  The power to fire that artillery opens the way for secret threats and \npromises to use or not use that artillery. It does cause corruption \nwhen a politician will not vote his conscience because he hears those \nwhispered threats and fears that new artillery. But even with all this \nnew political artillery, the Denier Castle is not as secure as it \nlooks. It is built on a foundation of lies--lies that the science of \nclimate change is unsettled, lies that there is no urgency to this, \nlies that there will be economic harm if we fix the problem. The truth \nis exactly the opposite. The effects of carbon pollution are deadly \nreal in our atmosphere and oceans. Time is running out to avoid the \nworst of the peril, and a sensible political response to climate change \nactually yields broad economic gains.\n  The Denier Castle's foundation of lies is slowly crumbling. The \ncracks are already beginning to appear. Twelve Republican House Members \nescaped from the castle--far enough to sponsor a climate resolution. \nYoung Republicans--under 35--by a majority think climate denial is \nignorant, out of touch, or crazy. Conservative heartland farmers see \nunprecedented weather in their fields and coastal fishermen see \nunfamiliar fish in their nets. Corporate climate leadership grows, from \nWalmart, Coke and Pepsi, Ford and GM, Mars and Unilever, General Mills \nand many others, and whole industries like the property casualty \ninsurance industry. Of course, well-respected military leaders warn of \nclimate change as danger, a catalyst of conflict. With all that comes \nthe economic tide of lower and lower cost clean energy--energy which is \nprobably cheaper already than fossil fuel, if the energy market weren't \nrigged by the polluters to favor their dirty product.\n  The blocks of the Denier Castle are loosening and beginning to fall. \nMortar sifts down. The whole structure of deceit and denial is creaking \nand crumbling. Fear is starting to spread within the castle about what \nwill happen when the lies are exposed and all the bullying revealed. \nWill there really be no price to pay for all that deceit and denial in \na world of justice and consequences?\n  The Wall Street Journal editorial page has gotten so anxious that it \naccuses me of ``treat[ing] [climate] heretics like Cromwell did \nCatholics,'' all because I, the junior Senator of the smallest State, \nhad the temerity to say that mighty ExxonMobil, one of the biggest \ncorporations in the history of the world and a Goliath if there ever \nwere one, should maybe have to tell the truth in the place we trust in \nAmerica to find the truth--an American courtroom. Exxon has gotten so \nfrantic that their public relations people are starting to use bad \nlanguage, things I can't even say on the Senate floor.\n  Even this week's Clean Power Plan challenge has an air of \ndesperation--a last-ditch effort to show the fossil fuel industry that \nfolks have done all they could before they stand down and evacuate the \ncastle. The dark castle will fall, and it will fall abruptly. It will \ncollapse. More hostages will break free, and a torrent will follow. \nWhen the lies and political influence are all exposed, there will come \na day of reckoning. For all faithful stewards of God's Earth, and for \nour American democracy, that will be a day of joy, a day of honor, and \na day of liberation. Each one of us can push a little harder to make \nthat day come a little sooner. Let us lean into our tasks and to our \nduty.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I want to commend Senators Collins and \nReed for their hard work on this bill. The Senators worked closely \ntogether, continuing a great tradition of the Appropriations Committee.\n  The Transportation, Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and Related \nAgencies bill has two critical missions. It is Congress' annual \ninfrastructure bill, creating jobs in construction, and it meets \ncompelling human needs by strengthening communities. While I support \nthis bill, I also reaffirm my continued commitment to getting a 12-bill \nomnibus done by December 11--leaving no bill behind and no Christmas \ncrisis.\n  This bill keeps Americans on the move, delivering Federal formula \nfunding to every State for highways, byways, and mass transit. Thanks \nto the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, which increased the discretionary \ncaps by $50 billion, we are here today to take up the Collins and Reed \namendment, adding nearly $1.6 billion to the Senate Committee bill.\n  The Collins-Reed amendment increases funding for the Federal Aviation \nAdministration, the Federal Transit Administration's New Starts \nprogram, and competitive TIGER grants. It recognizes the importance of \nthe U.S. flag fleet and merchant marines to our national security by \nincreasing funding for the Maritime Security Program. The amendment \nalso restores funding to HUD's Community Development Block Grant and \nHOME programs. These are programs that every county executive and mayor \ntalk to me about.\n  For my home State of Maryland, this bill fully funds the Washington \nMetropolitan Area Transit Authority. I am beyond frustrated with Metro, \nbut will not waver in my support for Federal funding to improve the \nsafety and operational reliability of the system because many of my \nconstituents rely upon Metro every day. I included bill and report \nlanguage requiring strict U.S. Department of Transportation, DOT, \noversight of how these taxpayer dollars are spent. And I appreciate the \nsupport of Senators Collins and Reed for my amendment to give DOT the \npower to appoint and oversee Metro's Federal board members, instead of \nthe General Services Administration.\n  The bill provides funding for an important Maryland jobs corridor--\nthe Purple Line, which is a new light rail system to be constructed in \nMontgomery and Prince George's Counties. HUD's Office of Healthy Homes \nand Lead Hazard Control also receives strong funding, which is \ncritically important to my hometown of Baltimore. Like many older \ncities in the Northeast, Baltimore has a significant lead paint \nproblem.\n  This is a good bill. I urge my colleagues to offer only germane \namendments, so we can complete our work before Thanksgiving and keep \nmomentum going to complete a 12-bill omnibus before December 11.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to report that the ranking \nmember and I have two amendments that have been cleared by both sides.\n  Mr. President, it appears that I am premature by a couple of moments, \nso I will suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Epilepsy Awareness Month\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I wish to speak for 5 minutes on \nEpilepsy Awareness Month. If the matter for which Senator Wicker is \nwaiting comes to the floor, I will interrupt my speech immediately so I \ndon't slow down his business at all. I know he has been waiting here \nfor a while, but as long as we were in a quorum call, I will speak in \nrecognition of November as Epilepsy Awareness Month.\n\n[[Page S8063]]\n\n  Epilepsy is a chronic, debilitating condition that can produce \nviolent, unpredictable seizures. It can be caused by traumatic events \nsuch as strokes, tumors, or brain injuries, but for a lot of patients \nthe cause remains unknown. It is no easy thing to live with epilepsy. \nYet millions of Americans do so every day, including an estimated \n10,000 Rhode Islanders. They include Sawyer, a 12-year-old Warwick \nresident who recently started seventh grade. I think we all remember \nwhat it was like to be a young person in school. I am sure we all know \nsomeone who for one reason or another was labeled as different and had \na harder time than most. Well, imagine how hard it must be to navigate \nthat world while also struggling with the daily symptoms of epilepsy. \nIt takes a brave person to confront that challenge head-on, and I think \nwe can all admire Sawyer's courage every day as he goes to school and \npursues his education amid challenging circumstances.\n  One reason Sawyer and his mom moved to Rhode Island was to take \nadvantage of the support services provided by the Matty Fund, a local \norganization dedicated to helping those living with epilepsy and \nraising awareness of the condition. The organization was founded in \n2003 by Richard and Deb Siravo in honor of their son Matty, whom they \nlost to epilepsy that same year. The group provides services to local \nfamilies, including Camp Matty, a day camp designed for kids with \nepilepsy.\n  Sawyer recently attended Camp Matty and spent time with other kids \nlike him, as well as older camp counselors, who are living with \nepilepsy and thriving. According to the Matty Fund, Sawyer flourished \nduring his time at the camp. The group's executive director, Marisol \nGarcies, tells me that Sawyer ``could see in these teenagers and \nvolunteers a glimpse of himself in a few short years, and it comforted \nhim.''\n  I am proud of the work the Matty Fund is doing to support Rhode \nIsland kids like Sawyer, and I would also like to see us in Congress do \nmore to give hope to him and millions of other Americans living with \nepilepsy.\n  Federal funding for epilepsy research through the National Institutes \nof Health was cut $27 million from fiscal year 2012 to fiscal year 2013 \nas a result of the recent budget battles. Funding has been restored in \nthe years since, but until we provide the kind of year-to-year funding \ncertainty that big research initiatives need, there will continue to be \ntrouble.\n  The researchers developing the next generation of medical treatments \nfor epilepsy and countless other conditions shouldn't have to worry \nthat their funding is at risk because Congress is having another \npolitical fight. That is why I am proud to be a cosponsor of Senator \nDurbin's American Cures Act, which would create a trust fund dedicated \nto sustaining and expanding funding for health research at the NIH, \nCDC, Department of Defense, and Department of Veterans Affairs. In \naddition, I am currently working with my colleagues on the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee to make NIH funding a mandatory \npart of our annual budget, ensuring that a baseline of Federal research \ndollars will be available year in and year out. I hope we can get it \ndone.\n  In the meantime, let's all keep sending our thoughts and prayers to \npeople like Sawyer, and to help to lift the stigma that is too often \nassociated with epilepsy. These brave individuals fight every day to \nlive a normal life against some very real obstacles, and we can help by \ngiving them our admiration and encouragement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the ranking member and I have two \namendments that have been cleared by both sides.\n\n\n          Amendments Nos. 2809 and 2817 to Amendment No. 2812\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments be called up \nand agreed to en bloc: Senator McCain's amendment No. 2809 and Senator \nMikulski's amendment No. 2817.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendments en bloc by number.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins], for Mr. McCain, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2809 to amendment No. 2812.\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed], for Ms. Mikulski, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2817 to amendment No. 2812.\n\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2809\n\n    (Purpose: To require the Administrator of the Federal Aviation \n    Administration to review certain decisions to grant categorical \n exclusions for Next Generation flight procedures and to consult with \n       the airports at which such procedures will be implemented)\n\n       After section 119C, insert the following:\n       Sec. 119D.  Section 213(c) of the FAA Modernization and \n     Reform Act of 2012 (Public Law 112-95; 49 U.S.C. 40101 note) \n     is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(3) Notifications and consultations.--Not less than 90 \n     days before applying a categorical exclusion under this \n     subsection to a new procedure at an OEP airport, the \n     Administrator shall--\n       ``(A) notify and consult with the operator of the airport \n     at which the procedure would be implemented; and\n       ``(B) consider consultations or other engagement with the \n     community in the which the airport is located to inform the \n     public of the procedure.\n       ``(4) Review of certain categorical exclusions.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The Administrator shall review a \n     decision of the Administrator made on or after February 14, \n     2012, and before the date of the enactment of this paragraph \n     to grant a categorical exclusion under this subsection with \n     respect to a procedure to be implemented at an OEP airport \n     that was a material change from procedures previously in \n     effect at the airport to determine if the implementation of \n     the procedure had a significant effect on the human \n     environment in the community in which the airport is located \n     if the operator of that airport requests such a review and \n     demonstrates that there is good cause to believe that the \n     implementation of the procedure had such an effect.\n       ``(B) Content of review.--If, in conducting a review under \n     subparagraph (A) with respect to a procedure implemented at \n     an OEP airport, the Administrator, in consultation with the \n     operator of the airport, determines that implementing the \n     procedure had a significant effect on the human environment \n     in the community in which the airport is located, the \n     Administrator shall--\n       ``(i) consult with the operator of the airport to identify \n     measures to mitigate the effect of the procedure on the human \n     environment; and\n       ``(ii) in conducting such consultations, consider the use \n     of alternative flight paths.\n       ``(C) Human environment defined.--In this paragraph, the \n     term `human environment' has the meaning given that term in \n     section 1508.14 of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (as \n     in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of this \n     paragraph).''.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2817\n\n (Purpose: To provide that the Secretary of Transportation shall have \n sole authority to appoint Federal Directors to the Board of Directors \n         of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __.

Under the previous order, the amendments (Nos. \n2809 and 2817) are agreed to.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, just a very brief explanation on both of these \namendments. Senator Mikulski's amendment simply allows the Secretary of \nTransportation to select the Federal appointees for the Washington \nmetro system. That is done by the head of GSA right now, and obviously \nGSA is an agency with no transportation policy expertise, so this \nsimply makes sense. It is noncontroversial and has already been passed \nout of the Senate committee of jurisdiction.\n\n[[Page S8064]]\n\n  Senator Mikulski has been very concerned, as have many of us, about \nthe safety and operational issues with Metro, and I believe this \namendment is an excellent one, and I am proud to lend my support.\n  Senator McCain's amendment ensures that the Federal Aviation \nAdministration reviews its procedures when there are complaints from a \ncommunity about the noise of airplanes that are landing in a particular \narea and that they do a report.\n  I think both of these amendments make a great deal of sense, and I am \npleased that we were able to clear them and get them adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2815 to Amendment No. 2812\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up my amendment No. 2815.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Wicker] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2815 to amendment No. 2812.\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To authorize the Secretary of Transportation to increase the \n   minimum length limitation for a truck tractor-semitrailer-trailer \n  combination from 28 to 33 feet if such change would not negatively \n                         impact public safety)\n\n       Beginning on page 45, strike line 16 and all that follows \n     through line a on page 46 and insert the following:\n       Sec. 137.  The Secretary of Transportation may promulgate a \n     rulemaking to increase the minimum length limitation that a \n     State may prescribe for a truck tractor-semitrailer-trailer \n     combination under section 31111(b)(1)(A) of title 49, United \n     States Code, from 28 feet to 33 feet if the Secretary makes a \n     statistically significant finding, based on the final \n     Comprehensive Truck Size and Weight Limits Study required \n     under section 32801 of the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety \n     Enhancement Act of 2012 (title II of division C of Public Law \n     112-141), that such change would not have a net negative \n     impact on public safety.\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I thank the chair and ranking member of \nthe committee and, of course, the staff for working with us on this \nissue. This is an amendment that should be familiar to Members because \nessentially the same language was voted on in the form of a motion to \ninstruct conferees last week. The essence of both that motion, which \nwas adopted on a vote of 56 to 31, and this amendment today is to \nprevent a Federal mandate which has been contained in the committee \nversion of this bill. That mandate would have required all 50 States to \nallow twin 33 tandem tractor-trailer rigs in each State. Some 12 States \nallow these twin 33 tandem tractor-trailer trucks and some 38 States \nprevent them. If the language were to remain in the appropriations \nbill, all 50 States, including the 38 States that have chosen not to \naccept these trucks, would be mandated.\n  I think the vote of the Senate was clear last week. I will simply \npoint out that this will remove a Federal mandate and will assist small \nbusiness truckers who don't have the capital to move to these new \nlonger double trucks. It will promote public safety and, I would \nsubmit, save lives and save $1.2 to $1.8 billion every year in \nmaintenance and repair because of the damage caused by these twin 33 \ntrailers.\n  I appreciate the committee working with me to get a vote, and at this \npoint I ask that the amendment be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, we are now prepared to have a voice vote \non Senator Wicker's amendment; therefore, I know of no further debate \non the Wicker amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2815) was agreed to.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that we are making progress, and I \nencourage other Members to come to the floor and share their proposals \nwith us so we can continue to dispense with amendments.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  ISIS\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, yesterday I spoke about the horrific \nterror attacks in Paris last week and why they were a stark reminder of \ntwo things: first, that the threat of ISIS stretches well beyond Syria \nand Iraq, and, second, that this terror army has grown in power. It has \ngrown in influence and certainly has grown in territory.\n  Unfortunately, the administration and the Commander in Chief, in \nparticular, have effectively stood by as spectators without developing \nan effective strategy to degrade and destroy ISIS as the President \nclaims is his goal. Instead, we have seen airstrikes, which are \nnecessary but not sufficient to deal with the threat of ISIS in Syria \nand in Iraq.\n  So more than a year ago, I, among others, called on the President to \ndiscuss with the Congress his strategy. My thought is that anytime \nAmericans are sent into harm's way--and there are Americans in harm's \nway both in Iraq and perhaps throughout the region--there ought to be a \nclear purpose articulated by the Commander in Chief. It ought to be a \njoint undertaking between the Congress and the Executive because our \nmen and women in uniform deserve the unqualified support of all \nAmericans, and I think that can best be demonstrated and accomplished \nby building consensus for this action in Congress.\n  But what we have seen instead are speeches, interviews, and \nassurances that have really attempted to hide the fact that the \nPresident's so-called strategy against ISIS has been nothing more and \nnothing less than an abject failure. The picture painted by the \nadministration on the perceived success of this strategy has been \noverstated at best and disingenuous at worst. Between referring to \nISIS, now numbering as many as 30,000 strong, as the ``JV team'' and \njust hours before the Paris attacks proclaiming in an interview with \nABC that they were ``contained,'' the President has simply not shot \nstraight with the American people.\n  The American people can take the truth; they just haven't heard it \nyet about the nature of the threat and about an effective strategy to \ndeal with that threat. As we have learned and as the 9/11 Commission \nobserved, one of the worst things we could do for our own national \nsecurity is allow safe havens for terrorists to develop in places such \nas Syria and Iraq, places where they can train, arm, and then they can \nexport their attacks, and given the unique capability of ISIS, they can \ncommunicate by social media and over the Internet and radicalize people \nhere in the United States, just as they apparently did with people in \nFrance.\n  Criticism of the President's lack of a strategy is not a partisan \nissue. It is not limited to members of my political party. On Monday, \nin an interview on MSNBC, the ranking member on the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, the senior Senator from California, said: ``ISIL is not \ncontained,'' adding, ``I have never been more concerned.'' That is \nSenator Feinstein the ranking member--I believe they call them vice \nchair--of the Intelligence Committee. I couldn't agree with my \nDemocratic colleague from California more. ISIL, ISIS, Daesh--whatever \nyou want to call it--has not been contained. I agree with her. I have \nnever been more concerned about a terrorist threat, particularly since \n9/11.\n  It is very clear that in the wake of the tragic events in Paris, what \nthe administration is doing to combat ISIS is failing. It is not \nworking. In Iraq, ISIS has captured city after city over the last 2 \nyears where Americans have shed their blood, where Americans spent \ntheir treasure and took years to bring relative peace preceding \nPresident Obama's precipitous withdrawal from Iraq.\n  I can only imagine how hard it is for some of our veterans who served \nin\n\n[[Page S8065]]\n\nIraq to hear the laundry list of familiar places that have been taken \nby ISIS almost overnight. Sadly, of course, this includes cities where \nthe precious lives of American heroes were lost, places such as Mosul, \nFallujah, and Ramadi. I can only imagine what an American veteran, \nhaving lost a limb or suffered other grievous injury, must feel, the \nrage they must have after seeing those hard-fought gains squandered. \nAnd I can't help but think of the Gold Star Mothers, moms who have lost \nservice men and women in combat and in service to our country. What a \nterrible squandering of hard-fought-for gains. But that is what laid \nthe predicate and created the vacuum for the threat we see today.\n  From where we stand today, Iraq is undeniably worse than when \nPresident Obama took office. He said he wanted to end the war in Iraq \nand Afghanistan, only to see, because of bad judgment and bad strategy, \nthe war proliferate and get that much more serious--at least the war \nbeing conducted against us, our American interests, and our allies. As \nI said, the result of that bad policy and bad judgment is not one less \nwar, it is a safe haven for ISIS that has been carved out of Syria and \nIraq. The border between those two previously separated countries has \nbeen completely erased, as 30,000 fighters continue to plunge the \nregion deeper into chaos.\n  I was struck by the comments of the Director of the Central \nIntelligence Agency, who spoke at the Center for Strategic and \nInternational Studies on Monday. He said that before the current \nadministration, there were probably about 700 adherents left. That is \nthe origin of this problem today which is known as Al Qaeda--700 or so \nadherents left. And as I have already alluded to, according to news \nreports, there are between 20,000 and 31,500 fighters across Iraq and \nSyria. Those are the numbers of troops ISIS can now muster as a result \nof our failed policies in Iraq and Syria. So according to the CIA \nDirector's own estimate, that means there has been an increase, just \nduring the seven years of the Obama administration, of between 2,700 \nand 4,400 percent.\n  Mr. President, your strategy is not working.\n  As we all know, this is not just about a fight over there; this is \nabout a fight that is coming here, to a neighborhood, to a city near \nyou. According to the media reports on Monday, the CIA Director also \nwarned that ISIS was likely planning additional attacks. On that same \nday, a new propaganda video popped up online in which ISIS issued a \nfresh threat to target Washington, DC.\n  Perhaps most concerning--and it is all concerning--is a serious \nthreat we face at home from a jihadist who is already living here on \nU.S. soil. Most of the people who carried out the attacks in France \nwere born and grew up in Belgium. Some of them immigrated, one under a \nfake Syrian passport, apparently. But we need to be concerned about \nhomegrown radicalized terrorists, radicalized by ISIS or like-minded \ngroups via the Internet. In Texas, we have seen this firsthand--the so-\ncalled homegrown threats that occurred at Fort Hood in 2009 and in \nGarland, TX, earlier this year.\n  But in the face of all of this--the President's own CIA Director \ntalking about the huge increase in the threat over the last 7 years of \nthis failed strategy--and given what has happened in Paris, given the \nthreat against the United States and Washington, DC, in this propaganda \nvideo, why in the world would any reasonable person say ``We don't need \nto change a thing; we need to stay the course''--which is apparently \nwhat the President is saying. No rational person would say ``Hey, this \nis working out just the way I had it planned.'' You would reconsider \nand you would reevaluate in light of the evidence and the experience. \nThat is what a reasonable person would do.\n  Well, the Washington Post, on November 16--I guess that was 2 days \nago--issued an editorial called ``President Obama's false choice \nagainst the Islamic State.'' In the first paragraph, they used a word \nto describe the President that I thought I understood the meaning of \nand I think I did, but I looked it up anyway. It is the word \n``petulant.'' This is what they said:\n\n       Pressed about his strategy for fighting the Islamic State, \n     a petulant-sounding President Obama insisted Monday, as he \n     has before, that his critics have offered no concrete \n     alternatives for action in Syria and Iraq, other than \n     ``putting large numbers of U.S. troops on the ground.''\n\n  Well, ``petulant''--I did look it up. ``Childishly sulky or bad-\ntempered'' is one definition. So apparently the Washington Post wasn't \nimpressed with the President's response either.\n  They went on to say that the President's claim was faulty in a number \nof respects. First, nobody has proposed putting large numbers of U.S. \ntroops on the ground--no one. So this is a straw man the President \nerects just so he can knock it down to try to discredit anybody who \ndoesn't drink the same Kool-Aid he does on this topic.\n  The Washington Post went on to say that a number of military experts \nhave proposed a number of constructive ideas that would help us make \nbetter progress against this enemy, things such as deploying more \nSpecial Operations forces, including forward air controllers who can \ndirect munitions, airstrikes, and bombing raids with much more accuracy \nthan without them.\n  We could also make sure that we have more Americans to advise the \nIraqis' moderate Syrian forces and other people with similar interests \non battlefield tactics to make them more effective. The President could \nsend in more advisers to Iraqi battalions and more U.S. specialized \nassets. There is no one in the world who has a technological advantage \non the United States when it comes to our military and our specialized \nassets, such as drones, for example, among other things.\n  Then there is the issue of the Kurds. The Peshmerga have been an \nimpressive fighting force. They have been boots-on-the-ground in a \nlarge portion of Iraq, and they have been crying out for the sorts of \nweapons that they need in order to be more effective. The \nadministration has decided: Well, let's send everything through \nBaghdad. Sadly, most of those weapons don't end up making their way \ninto the hands of the Kurds and the Peshmerga because of political \ndifferences between them.\n  So there is a lot we could do, and the President's straw man that he \ncontinually erects so he can just knock it down as he tries to ridicule \nand criticize anybody who has the temerity to question this failed \nstrategy--it is just not working. It is not working for him, and people \nincreasingly are losing confidence in his judgment.\n  To eradicate ISIS abroad and neutralize the threat this terror army \nposes at home, we need a proactive, multifaceted strategy. The \nPresident's approach, characterized by ineffectual airstrikes and half \nmeasures, has resulted in a tactical stalemate that has kept ISIS's \nmorale high and recruitment steady.\n  We are blessed with some of the most elite military forces in the \nworld, incredible human beings and great patriots. But not even they \ncan hold on to territory after it is bombed because there simply are \nnot enough of them. That is why, as the Washington Post suggested, it \nis so important to send in American advisers on tactics and people who \nwill allow the boots on the ground, such as the Kurds, the Peshmerga, \nto be more effective. They can be the boots on the ground. They are the \nones with the most direct interest in the outcome.\n  It doesn't take an expert military strategist to see that airpower \nalone will not defeat ISIS. Perhaps the greatest military leader we \nhave had, and certainly in my adult lifetime, GEN David Petraeus, has \nsaid that. The President's own military advisers have told him that, \nbut he simply won't listen to them--preferring, it seems to me, to sort \nof run out the clock on his administration and then have to hand off \nthis terrible mess to his successor. But Heaven help us if in the \nmeantime, as a result of this ineffective strategy and an emboldened \nISIS, we see more attacks not over there but over here.\n  We already have U.S. boots on the ground in Iraq and Syria. I would \njust remind everyone that there are about 3,500 U.S. troops in Iraq and \nabout 50 U.S. special operators in Syria, as the Obama administration \nhas publicly stated. So if the President is going to put American boots \non the ground, why not come up with a strategy, working together with \nour allies and those with aligned interests, to make them more \neffective and actually crush ISIS before ISIS hits us here in the \nhomeland?\n  We know the White House has sought to micromanage the military \ncampaign\n\n[[Page S8066]]\n\nand impose unreasonable restrictions on what the troops who are there \nare allowed to do--so-called caveats. Our warfighters literally have \nhad one arm tied behind their back. This is simply just another recipe \nfor continued failure, and it has to stop, it has to change.\n  We know that ISIS cannot be dislodged from territory it now holds \nunless we have effective partners on the ground. That means working \nclosely, as I indicated, with partners such as Iraqi security forces, \nthe Kurdish Peshmerga, the Sunni tribal forces, and supporting them \nwith U.S. airpower and intelligence. To further bolster these ground \npartners, the President needs to consider embedding American troops as \nmilitary advisers, as I just said. By employing U.S. troops as joint \ntactical air controllers, as I mentioned earlier from the Washington \nPost editorial--that was one of their suggestions--in support of those \nground partners, we would make our airstrikes more precise and more \nlethal.\n  This is the type of thing that will be needed to clear and to hold \nterritory after recapturing it from ISIS. It doesn't accomplish very \nmuch to bomb the living daylights out of some ISIS stronghold and not \nfollow on with troops to hold that territory. We end up doing the same \nthing over and over again--bombing the same territory, they leave, and \nthen they come back--because there is nothing there to hold that \nterritory.\n  In the long run, the overall effort to dislodge ISIS from key tribal \nareas and population centers has to be undergirded by a political \nframework as well that will sustain the lasting rejection of ISIS's \nbankrupt ideology. No one is suggesting that military combat alone is \ngoing to solve this problem, but in order to bring the people who can--\nthe so-called reconcilables, the people who are willing to try and work \ntoward a long-lasting solution and eradicate the ones who will not--it \nwill take a military strategy and a political framework.\n  I will just close on this. There has been a lot of concern about \nrefugees. I have heard it in my office and we have all heard it from \nour constituents back home. Whose heart doesn't break for people who \nhave been run out of their own homeland, who have seen family members \nmurdered by a butcher like Assad in Syria? But this is not a new \nphenomenon. We have known since the Syrian civil war started, following \nthe Arab Spring in 2011, that hundreds of thousands, indeed millions of \nSyrians have fled their country, have been dislocated within the \ncountry, have moved into refugee camps in Turkey and Jordan, in \nLebanon, and now they are going to Europe and some of them are showing \nup here in the United States.\n  I would bet, if you ask every single one of them or most of the \nrefugees, would you prefer to live in safety and security in your own \nland or do you want to go somewhere else, they would say: I want to \nstay here. So we need a policy that will actually allow Syrians to stay \nin Syria and Iraqis to stay in Iraq, but in the absence of any kind of \nmilitary strategy, no political framework, and no solution from the \nCommander in Chief, these poor people have nowhere else to go. So we \nneed to create safe zones in Syria.\n  We can do that. We can create a no-fly zone in cooperation with our \npartners there in the Middle East. We need to create safe zones in \nSyria, where tens of thousands of refugees who are now trying to flee \nSyria could actually live, with our help. This means areas where \ninnocent men, women, and children can be protected from attacks both \nfrom the air and from the ground, zones where they don't have to worry \nabout being murdered 24 hours a day by ISIS or by the bloodthirsty \nregime of Bashar al-Assad.\n  Congress should not have to tell the Commander in Chief how to \nconduct a successful military campaign or what a strategy looks like. \nBut you know what. It takes the Washington Post editorial to tell the \nPresident that what he is saying is the alternative is just not true \nand that there are constructive ways we can turn the tide against ISIS \nand provide more stability and safety to people who prefer to stay home \nand not flee to distant shores and create consternation here in the \nUnited States about whether we are adequately screening these refugees \nto make sure they are not a threat to us here.\n  It is my hope the President will consider thoughtful options that are \nbeing proposed by Members of Congress. I will bet there are thoughtful \noptions being proposed by the President's own military advisers, but he \nis just simply not listening to them and stubbornly resisting \nreconsidering his failed strategy--petulant is what the Washington Post \ncalled it. Childishly sulky or bad temper, that is what they called the \nPresident's attitude.\n  The American people have seen some of their own countrymen and \ncountrywomen murdered by ISIS in barbaric and horrific fashion in \nimages transmitted around the globe. They are understandably \napprehensive about our security as a nation and our receding leadership \nrole in the world. What is basically happening is, as America retreats, \nthe tyrants, the thugs, the terrorists, the bullies fill that void. In \nthis case, just like before 9/11, that void is filled by bad people who \nwant to not only harm the people nearby but the West--meaning the \nUnited States and our allies over here.\n  So the American people deserve a clear, credible strategy from the \nPresident, one that will combat this terror threat before the violence \nwe saw last week in Paris shows up here on our own doorstep. More than \never our Nation needs strong leadership, and I hope the President will \nfinally rise to the challenge.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              NIH Research\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, as my colleagues know, we are in the \nprocess of discussing an appropriations bill--called an omnibus bill. \nFor the first time in a long time we have passed an appropriations bill \nin the Senate. That is progress. We are working on a second one today \nas well. As we debate the priorities and spending levels for this final \nappropriations bill for this year, I want to highlight an opportunity \nwe have to deliver on a promise to provide strong support for the \nNational Institutes of Health and for the lifesaving biomedical \nresearch that results in that spending.\n  I would also mention that we have the opportunity to assist in \nfinancial support, in providing resources to advance the efforts of a \ncouple of agencies that are greatly allied with NIH; that being the \nFood and Drug Administration, the Department of Defense and its medical \nresearch as it finds cures and treatments for our military men and \nwomen and the consequences of their service, as well as the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention.\n  What I want to highlight is that if we fulfill a promise in regard to \nmedical and biomedical research, we can position our country to provide \nsteady, predictable growth to NIH, the largest supporter of medical \nresearch in the world. This sustained commitment, which has been absent \nfor so long, will benefit our Nation many times over and bring hope to \nmany patients in today's generation and those that follow.\n  Unfortunately, we have not adequately and we have not always upheld \nour responsibility in this regard. The purchasing power of the National \nInstitutes of Health has diminished dramatically. If you account for \ninflation, NIH receives 22 percent less funding than it did in 2003. \nThis has negatively impacted our research capacity.\n  In the best of times, NIH research proposals were funded one out of \nthree times. So if there were three proposals, one of them was accepted \nfor funding. That ratio has now fallen to one in six, the lowest level \nin history.\n  The challenge is ours, and the moment to act is now for our moms, our \ndads, our family members, our friends, for people we don't even know, \nand for the fiscal condition of our country. If you care about people, \nyou will be supportive of medical research; and if you care about the \nfiscal condition of our country, you will be caring about medical \nresearch.\n  I am a member of the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human \nServices, Education, and Related Agencies of the Committee on \nAppropriations, which is responsible for the funding of NIH and\n\n[[Page S8067]]\n\nthese other agencies. Earlier this year, under the leadership of my \ncolleague and friend from Missouri, the chairman, Senator Blunt, my \nSenate appropriations colleagues and I were successful in significantly \nboosting NIH's budget in the Senate's fiscal year 2016 appropriations \nbill. We achieved more than a $2 billion increase in NIH. This is an \namount around $1.95 billion more than the President's request and more \nthan $880 million above the number contained in the House's version of \nthis legislation. This $2 billion increase would be the greatest \nbaseline boost to NIH since 2003. It bothers me when I say it is a \nboost to NIH because what it is a boost to is not a Federal agency but \nrather a boost to the results, the consequences of that investment in \nresearch.\n  With the recent 2-year budget deal that became law recently, it \npresents a path by which we are able to deliver a much needed budget \nincrease to NIH and to prioritize important research that saves and \nimproves lives, reduces health care costs, and fuels economic growth. \nThis boost would be a tremendous step in putting NIH back on a sound \npath of predictable, sustainable growth, demonstrating to our Nation's \nbest and brightest researchers, medical doctors, scientists, and \nstudents that Congress supports their work and will make sure they have \nthe resources needed to carry out their important research.\n  The time to achieve this objective is now. If the United States is to \ncontinue providing leadership in medical breakthroughs, to develop \ncures and treat disease, we must commit significantly to supporting \nthis effort. If we fail to lead, researchers will not be able to rely \nupon that consistency, we will jeopardize our current progress, stunt \nour Nation's competitiveness, and lose a generation of young \nresearchers to other careers or to other countries' research.\n  Whenever Congress crafts appropriations bills we face a challenge. We \nall face this issue of balancing our priorities with the concern about \nmaking certain our Nation's fiscal course is on a better path than it \nhas been. Therefore, it is extremely important for us to find those \nprograms that are worthy of funding, that actually work, that are \neffective, that serve the American people and demonstrate a significant \nreturn to the taxpayer who actually pays the bill. Congress should set \nspending priorities and focus our resources on initiatives that have \nproven outcomes.\n  No initiative I know meets these criteria better than biomedical \nresearch conducted at the National Institutes of Health and our other \nFederal allied agencies. NIH-supported research has raised life \nexpectancy, improved quality of life, lowered overall health care \ncosts, and is that economic engine our country so desperately needs as \nwe try to compete in a global economy.\n  Today we are living longer and we are living healthier lives thanks \nto NIH research. Deaths from heart disease and stroke have dropped 70 \npercent in the last half century. U.S. cancer death rates are following \nabout 1 percent each year, but as we know, much work remains. Diseases \nsuch as cancer, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and mental illness touch \nall of us, touch all of our communities, touch all of our States, and \ndramatically affect our country.\n  Half of the men and one-third of all women in the United States will \ndevelop cancer in their lifetime. One in three Medicare dollars is \nspent caring for an individual with diabetes. Nearly one in five \nMedicare dollars is spent on people with Alzheimer's or other \ndementias. In 2050, it will be one in every three dollars. In other \nwords, the cost of dementia and Alzheimer's grows dramatically over \ntime.\n  New scientific findings are what yield the breakthroughs that enable \nus to confront these staggering financial challenges of these diseases \nand others. Therefore, in order to advance lifesaving medical research \nfor patients around the world, balance our Federal budget, control \nMedicare and Medicaid spending, let's prioritize biomedical research \nand lead in science and in discovery.\n  I appreciate the opportunity, as we work to fashion this final \nappropriations bill before the deadline of December 11, to work with my \ncolleagues across the Senate to make sure that biomedical research, \nNIH, and its allied agencies receive the necessary financial support \nthat benefits all Americans today and in the future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Global Security Crisis\n\n  Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about our persistent \nglobal security crisis, but I also want to connect how our national \ndebt crisis affects that.\n  Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the victims of \nthese tragic events of the last 3 weeks. This week the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee hosted the French Ambassador to the United States. \nIn that meeting we shared that our thoughts and prayers are with them \nand with the people of France. But, more than that, we stand in \nsolidarity with them against these evil forces that manifested \nthemselves in the streets of Paris this past week. The horrific ISIS \nattacks in Paris--killing more than 130 and injuring more than 350 men, \nwomen, and some children--serve as a chilling reminder of the threat we \ncontinue to face from international terrorism every day.\n  Earlier this week, Russia confirmed that it was indeed a terrorist \nbomb that took down a Russian airliner over the Sinai Peninsula, \nkilling all 224 people onboard. Just last night, we saw two aircraft--\nthank God, under a false alarm--grounded because of fear of a terrorist \nattack. In addition, ISIS claimed responsibility for twin suicide \nattacks in Beirut last week, killing 43 more people. This makes three \ninternational attacks in three short weeks.\n  ISIS continues to be a persistent threat to the West and to the \nsecurity and stability of the Middle East. Unfortunately, as they have \nalready said several times, these attacks only confirm what ISIS has in \nmind for the future. ISIS has been very clear about their intention to \nbring their version of terrorism to our own backyard, here in America. \nIndeed, ISIS even threatened Paris-styled attacks on our Nation's \nCapital in a recent video this week.\n  Earlier this week, CIA Director John Brennan said he would not \nconsider the Paris attacks a one-off event. Director Brennan went on to \nsay:\n\n       It's clear to me that ISIL has an external agenda, that \n     they are determined to carry out these types of attacks. I \n     would anticipate that this is not the only operation that \n     ISIL has in the pipeline.\n\n  In light of the latest attacks by ISIS--beyond Iraq and Syria--I \ncould not disagree more with our President, who says that his policies \nare indeed containing ISIS. The President and his administration \ncontinue to underestimate this threat. He even called them the JV team \nnot too long ago. Despite the fact that ISIS has demonstrated its \nability to perpetrate large-scale attacks beyond the borders of its so-\ncalled Caliphate, President Obama refuses to change his failed \nstrategy.\n  Beyond the fault of the President, however, fault lies here in \nCongress as well. Washington is entirely too often focused on the \ncrisis of the day instead of getting at the true underlying problems \nand solving them directly. It shouldn't take a tragedy like this for \nWashington to pay attention. Again, the latest terrorist attacks only \nunderscore that we are facing a global security crisis of increasing \nmagnitude, and this is inextricably linked to our own national debt \ncrisis.\n  As a matter of fact, the biggest threat to our global security is \nstill our Nation's own Federal debt. This is as true today as it was \nwhen Admiral Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in 2012, \nsaid the same thing.\n  In the past 6 years, Washington has spent $21.5 trillion running the \nFederal Government. That is so large, I have a hard time even grasping \nhow significant that is. But what I can understand is this: Of that \n$21.5 trillion we spent running the Federal Government, we have \nactually borrowed $8 trillion of that $21.5 trillion. With over $100 \ntrillion of future unfunded liabilities, on top of the $18.5 trillion \nwe have already built up, this is about $1 million for every household \nin America. Every family in America today shares in this responsibility \nof about $1 million per family.\n\n[[Page S8068]]\n\n  We are so far past the tipping point, it may be at a point of being \nunmanageable. If interest rates alone were at their 30-year average of \n5.5 percent, we would already be paying over $1 trillion in interest. \nThat is unmanageable. That is twice what we spend on our defense \ninvestment, and it is twice what we spend on our discretionary \nnondefense investment. It is unmanageable, and we are well past that \ntipping point.\n  Yet, Washington's own dysfunction and gridlock is keeping us from \ncompleting the budget process, as I speak today, and passing \nappropriations bills in the Senate. I might even argue, we may have \nseen the last truly voted-upon and approved appropriations in the \nSenate because of the abuses of the rules that we have seen both sides \nplay in recent years. Shockingly, in the last 40 years, only 4 times \nhas the budget process worked the way it was designed, as it was \nwritten into law in 1974.\n  For example, this year we have tried to get onto the defense \nappropriations bill. That means we are trying to take the \nappropriations bill that would fund the defense so we can defend \nAmericans abroad and we can defend our interests here at home against \nthreats like ISIS, and we are being blocked from even getting that \nbill--which passed with a vast majority of votes in committee--from \ngetting to the floor for a vote. No less than three times have the \npeople on the other side of the aisle blocked it from going to the \nfloor for debate, amendment process, and a vote; and three times the \nDemocrats have voted against allowing us to get the defense \nappropriations bill on the floor, thus making it a political football. \nIt is something I don't understand, not being of the political process \nhere. We have recent attacks from ISIS, and yet we can't even find \nconsensus here in this body to fund our Defense Department. William \nFew, the very first Senator from Georgia, in whose seat I serve today, \nwould absolutely be appalled. He would remind us of the United States \nConstitution. There are only 6 reasons why 13 colonies, of which \nGeorgia was one, came together to form this miracle called the United \nStates. One of those was to ``provide for the common defense.'' And \nhere we are, through dysfunction and partisan politics, not acting \nappropriately to fund the ability to provide for the common defense.\n  I hope we can learn from recent events and get serious about tackling \nthis debt problem so we can use that resource to fund our strong \nforeign policy. We need a strong foreign policy to fight these threats \nabroad. But to have a strong foreign policy, we have to have a strong \nmilitary. We proved that in the 1980s, when we brought down the Soviet \nUnion with the strength of our economy and the power of our ideas. We \nare at risk today because of our own intransigence and national debt. \nTo have a strong military, as we proved, we have to have a strong \neconomy. That is in jeopardy because of this growing debt crisis.\n  To confront this global debt crisis, we have to get serious today. We \nhave to break through. We have to get shoulder to shoulder and defend \nour country, which means we have to do the hard work on the floor of \nthe Senate and pass the funding so we can defend ourselves against \nthese new threats. Now is the time to solve this debt crisis so we can \nlead as a country again, to deal with this global security crisis, and \nto provide for the safety of Americans, wherever they are in the world.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         Transportation Funding\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, let me start by congratulating our \ncolleagues on the Environment and Public Works Committee on which I \nserve, as well as the banking, commerce, and finance committees, where \nI also serve, on the recent appointment of a House-Senate conference to \nattempt to produce a final product for a multiyear transportation plan \nfor our country.\n  I am a strong supporter, as are many of my colleagues, of investments \nin our Nation's roads, highways, bridges, and transit systems. I have \nbeen so for 15 years as a Senator, for 8 years before that as a \nGovernor, and for years before that as someone who focused an economic \ndevelopment and job creation within the State of Delaware.\n  I am pleased on one hand that after too many years of short-term \nextensions in transportation funding, we are set to make rebuilding and \nmodernizing our country's transportation system a long-term national \npriority again, and God knows we need to. However, I regret that I \nstill have deep concerns for how Congress has decided to pay for these \ninvestments. For decades we have paid for our transportation systems--\nroads, highways, bridges, and transit systems--through the use of user \nfees in the form of Federal excise taxes and, in some cases, on \ngasoline and diesel fuel to support the funding of our Nation's \ntransportation system for over a half century--over 50 years. I believe \nthat approach remains the fairest and most efficient way to fund \ntransportation projects. However, since 2008, we have strayed from a \nuser-pays approach. Instead, we rely on $75 billion worth of budget \ngimmicks, unrelated offsets, and debt to prop up our transportation \ntrust fund to pay for transportation investments. Rather than right our \ncourse, both the House and Senate transportation proposals rely on tens \nof billions of dollars in additional budget gimmicks and unrelated \noffsets to fund this bill over the next 6 years. That is not the right \nway to pay for our infrastructure. I think it is the wrong way. It is \nnot unfair, in my view, to ask the businesses and people who use our \nroads, highways, and bridges to help pay for them. We have done that \nfor 50 years, we know how to do it, it is a reasonably simple system, \nand I think it is a fair system. We can adjust the earned-income tax \ncredit in order to offset any increase in the user-fee cost that would \nhave an impact on lower income families because this kind of increase \nin the tax could be seen as not progressive. Having said that, that is \nnot what we are going to do, and what we are going to do instead is do \nwhat we have done for the last 7 years and use gimmicks and things that \nhave nothing to do with transportation to ostensibly pay for \ntransportation funding.\n  All that being said, this is a course that Congress has voted for, \nand despite my misgivings over the funding, there is still much to \ncommend in both the House and Senate legislation, particularly on the \nauthorization side that comes out of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee and out of the Transportation Infrastructure Committee in the \nHouse.\n  Among the areas that I believe should be supported and should \ncertainly be preserved in Congress is a robustly funded freight \nprogram, competitive grants for major projects, funding to reduce \ndangerous diesel pollution, and research grants to explore alternatives \nto user fees--the gas and diesel tax. I hope these provisions are \nretained in whatever bill emerges from the conference committee. Other \nprovisions, such as caps on investment of freight funding in rail, \nport, and water transportation projects and cuts to public transit \nfunding in Northeastern States should also be dropped.\n  Finally, Congress will face the question of how to balance the \nbenefits of long-term investment predictability with the urgent project \ninvestment needs around our country. While the long-term predictability \nis certainly important, we must consider the significant unmet \ninvestment needs around our country and the huge economic benefits that \ntransportation investments offer to America's businesses and families.\n  This legislation would best serve our country by maximizing annual \ninvestment levels for all service transportation programs over a \nshorter authorization period, and instead of having an inadequate \namount of money to go to pay for transportation improvements over 6 \nyears, I would hope our conferees would consider maybe using that same \namount of money and just spread it over 5 years or even 4 years. We \ncould use every dime of it, and then some, for the transportation needs \nof our country.\n  This may be the last talk I give on the Senate floor. I have given a \nbunch\n\n[[Page S8069]]\n\nof speeches on transportation, not so much on the authorization side of \nit, but mostly about finding a way to pay for it. Writing the \ntransportation authorization legislation--while not easy--is the easy \npart of the job. The hard part is figuring out how to pay for stuff. \nFor a long time we have used a user-fee approach, such as the gas and \ndiesel tax. We have done that since Dwight Eisenhower was President and \nwhen we were building the Interstate Highway System.\n  We last raised the gas and diesel taxes in 1993, so it has been 22 \nyears. The gas tax today is 18 cents, and after inflation it is worth \nabout a dime. The diesel tax was raised about 22 years ago and is about \n23 cents, and today it is worth less than 15 cents.\n  A couple of days ago, I bought gasoline in Dover, and I think we paid \njust a tad over $2 a gallon. Last week I was told there are 30,000 gas \nstations across America where people filled up and paid less than $2 a \ngallon for gasoline.\n  Senator Durbin, Senator Feinstein, and I in the Senate, and others in \nthe House, have offered legislation to restore the purchasing power of \nthe gas and diesel tax. We are not looking to increase it by 25 cents, \n50 cents or $1, as some have suggested, but to simply raise it 4 cents \na year for 4 years, and at the end of 4 years in 2020, index it to the \nrate of inflation. If we did that, we would generate something like \n$220 billion that would be used for our roads, highways, bridges, and \ntransit systems over the next 10 years.\n  Instead, we are not going to do that. We are going to take money from \nthe increase in TSA fees, which ostensibly was to be used to protect \npeople when they fly on airplanes, and instead we will use it for \nroads, highways, and bridges. We are taking the money that should go to \nbolster the strength of our borders so we can make sure we are able to \ndetect drugs and other things that shouldn't be going across our \nborders--particularly the border crossings where we have huge amounts \nof commerce moving in and out of our country into Mexico or into \nCanada--and instead we are going to take that money and ostensibly put \nit in roads, highways, and bridges.\n  I found a new way to avoid paying for roads, highways, bridges, and \ntransit systems, and it is kind of a novel way, by saying to the \nFederal Reserve that we are going to reduce their reserves by $60 \nbillion. The Federal Reserve, or central bank, turns out to have a \nlarge portfolio of investments, and a lot of the investments they have \nare actually Treasury security. During the course of the year, the \nFederal Reserve, from all of their investments, earns a lot of money, \nand after they deduct their expenses from all the money they earned--\nthrough the interest income that they earn--they turn what is left over \nto Treasury. They actually remit money during the course of the year--\nnot all at once but during the course of the year.\n  Last year, the Federal Reserve remitted something like a one-half \ntrillion dollars in net interest and income to the Treasury. That is \nrevenue that enables the Treasury to reduce our deficit. The House came \nup with the idea of just reaching in and taking $60 billion out of the \nFederal Reserve and use that for roads, highways, and bridges instead \nof it being taken and turned over in due course to the Treasury to \nreduce the deficit.\n  Some people ask: What is wrong with doing this for transportation? \nWhat is wrong with doing this for homeland security? What is wrong with \ndoing this for defense? What is wrong with doing this for agriculture \nor doing it for anything? I think this sets a terrible precedent and \ninvites future Congresses to do the same thing. Instead of adhering to \na policy that has served us well for many years and having those who \nuse our roads, highways, and bridges pay for them, we are resorting to \ngimmicks and the kind of things we should not deign to do.\n  Having said that, there is a good deal to like, especially in the \nauthorization language. I applaud those who have worked on this \nlegislation, and I appreciate the chance to help shape and reform some \nof it, but I wish we had taken a different course with respect to \nactually paying for this work that needs to be done.\n  The last thing I will say is this: Our friends at McKinsey consulting \nfirm, an international consulting firm, have an arm of McKinsey \nconsulting called Global Institute. That arm of McKinsey reached out a \nyear or so ago, and they tried to figure out if we were to invest \nrobustly in our roads, highways, bridges, and transit systems, what \nkind of effect it would have on the unemployment in this country. What \nkind of effect it would have on the gross domestic product in this \ncountry. If we were to truly make the kind of robust investments that \nare needed--not just the limp-along-level funding, which is woefully \ninadequate--they calculated that we would add 1.8 million jobs in \nAmerica.\n  A lot of the long-term unemployed folks wish they could be hired back \nagain to do construction projects and build roads, highways, bridges, \nand transit systems. Instead, they are sitting on the sidelines because \nwe don't have the money to pay to hire them to build these projects.\n  The Global Institute of McKinsey also tells us that robust \ntransportation investments would enable us to grow GDP annually by 1.5 \npercent. Think about that. We are lucky if we can get GDP up 3 percent \nper year in this country and so are most developed nations. Simply by \nmaking robust investments in our transportation systems--rebuilding \nAmerica's transportation systems again--we could expect to grow GDP by \nas much as 1.5 percent per year. The level of funding that is in the \nlegislation before us doesn't come even close to that. I think we \nmissed an opportunity here.\n  At one of my hearings today, Patty, one of our witnesses, had a funny \nquote by Yogi Berra, who died earlier this year. She said one of my \nfavorite Yogi Berra quotes: ``When you come to the fork in the road, \ntake it.'' We have come to the fork in the road with respect to \ntransportation funding, and with apologies to Yogi Berra, I think we \nhave taken the wrong fork in that road.\n  With that, I will call it a day and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  ISIL\n\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, the attacks in Paris were an \nunconscionable act of terrorism. America stands with the people of \nFrance and people of Paris, as we support those grieving and those \nworking to deliver justice to the people involved. Make no mistake; the \nheinous terrorist attacks in Paris were an act of war. ISIL has \nbarbarically killed and tortured innocent civilians, including \nAmericans, not just in Paris but also recently in Beirut and routinely \nin Iraq. They operate around the globe, are well funded, well armed, \nand have no intention of stopping until their radical goals are \nrealized. They continue to prey upon the innocent and manipulate the \nvulnerable. In some areas ISIL operates freely because of the \ninstability created by persistent ethnic, sectarian, and religious \nconflicts in Iraq and Syria. But this crisis is not limited to Iraq and \nSyria, and the world's powers and their interests are quickly aligning \nin the urgent need to wipe the map clean of ISIL and its affiliates.\n  To be clear, there are smart ways that we can destroy this barbaric \nterrorist organization without entangling American troops in another \nendless and bloody ground war in the Middle East. America has a \ncritical role to play in that effort, but it must be part of a larger \nstrategy and coalition, employing a full range of military might, as \nwell as economic and diplomatic power.\n  We can further engage in this fight in the following ways. First, we \nmust relentlessly target ISIL headquarters in Raqqa and Mosul through \nair power and destroy ISIL's large oil infrastructure and refineries. \nSecond, we must strangle the flow of foreign fighters on Syria's \nnorthern border. Third, we must compel Russia and other governments to \nreach a political end to the Syrian civil war so that we can unify and \nfocus on fighting the Islamic State. Fourth, we need new measures to \ncrack down on those who finance this terrorism and this extremism. \nFinally, it is time to drive a much harder bargain with an Iraqi \nleadership that\n\n[[Page S8070]]\n\nstill refuses to build a state that is politically inclusive and \ndecentralized.\n  Defeating ISIL cannot be solely an American solution nor should \nAmerican ground troops be on the frontlines. It is past time that our \nArab allies began focusing their efforts, with our support, on ISIL, \nmilitarily and economically. Ultimately, local Arab ground forces are \nthe only lasting solution to defeating ISIL because they will be the \nones left to ensure peace and stability once the more immediate \nmilitary operations are concluded.\n  Some say that we should deploy 10,000 American troops to Syria. \nHowever, we know that this strategy would require significantly more \ntroops and would not permanently eliminate ISIL or kill their ideology. \nInstead, doing so may well exacerbate the conflict and further ISIL's \nrecruitment efforts. We can say this because we have a historical \nreference, and that historical reference is not from some distant land \nor from another century.\n  For nearly a decade, our brave men and women in uniform were deployed \nin Iraq and were asked to clear and hold multiple large cities. At the \npeak, in 2007, nearly 170,000 Americans were deployed on the ground, \nproviding security in communities all across Iraq. Nearly 4,500--4,494 \nto be exact--gave their lives. More than 32,000 were wounded.\n  These tragic losses happened in the very same area where ISIL now \noccupies a major city in Iraq, Mosul, and a major city in Syria across \nthe border, Raqqa. The point of my bringing up the Iraq war is not to \nrelitigate the past but to keep in mind a very important lesson--that \neven when deploying nearly 200,000 American men and women to stabilize \none country, the strategy of clearing and holding large territory is \nonly a bandaid. It is not the permanent solution.\n  This is especially true when the political leadership in these \ncountries is unwilling to create an inclusive representative \ngovernment. The calls for sending 10,000 American troops to fight ISIL \nand to provide security both in Iraq and Syria would mean asking our \nsons and daughters to remain in these countries fighting year after \nyear for decades into the future.\n  We know that when American forces are placed in the heart of these \nregional conflicts, it will only further delay the more lasting \nsolution of having local partners on the ground and our allies in the \nPersian Gulf taking responsibility for this region, economically and \nmilitarily.\n\n\n                         Syrian Refugee Crisis\n\n  Lastly, I wish to talk a little bit about the issue of the Syrian \nrefugee crisis.\n  Every single Syrian refugee must be subject to the highest levels of \nvetting and scrutiny, including repeated biometric screenings, before \never entering the United States of America. Syria is a war zone, and we \nhave a duty to ensure that our own homeland security is intact.\n  The real priority, however, should be addressing the real security \ngaps that currently exist under the Visa Waiver Program--something on \nwhich Democrats and Republicans agree. Currently the Visa Waiver \nProgram allows citizens of countries that qualify--38 countries, \nincluding 31 from Europe--to travel freely and stay in the United \nStates for up to 90 days. Individuals who have purposefully traveled to \nIraq or Syria, who have joined training camps or sympathized with \nISIL's cause--that is where the real risk to the homeland lies.\n  The victims who have suffered at the hands of ISIL are not the \nproblem, and we should instead be working to close the loopholes that \nallow dangerous individuals with violent intentions to potentially \nenter our country today.\n  In the coming days, I will be calling for reforms to our Visa Waiver \nProgram so that we can focus on the real threats to our homeland. There \nis a difference between terrorists and victims of terrorism. The \nimplicit assumption that Syrian refugees--many of whom have suffered \nbrutally at the hands of ISIL--are a threat because of their country of \norigin is a rejection of American values and represents giving into our \nworst ethnic and religious prejudices.\n  I am grateful that when my own father and my grandparents fled \nGermany in the years leading up to World War II, this country chose to \nsee them for what they were--enthusiastic American immigrants seeking \nto escape the dangerous politics gripping their former nation. Had this \nbrand of twisted anti-immigrant logic been applied to them, I can only \nwonder how very different my life would be today.\n  Let's remember that the enemy in this current scenario is ISIL, not \nthe refugees who flee from their destruction. We simply will not have \nthe moral standing as a nation to lead this international scenario if \nwe ignore those who have lost everything at the hands of these barbaric \nterrorists.\n  ISIL has killed and tortured many innocent civilians and is actively \nplotting to do more harm. We should all agree that ISIL must be \neliminated from this Earth, but let's learn from our past mistakes and \nset to this work in a way that is both strategic and effective.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Terrorist Attacks Against France\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart to \nexpress my condolences to the people of France for the tragedy they \nhave experienced. No words can describe the barbaric and senseless acts \nof terrorism committed against the innocent victims in Paris, people \nwho are simply going about their lives, people who are just enjoying a \nmeal with their family or attending a concert with friends. These \nbarbaric acts were an affront to the people of France and to all \nhumanity.\n  This is a time for solidarity with France and with all victims of \nterrorism. The world has rightly come together to condemn these \nbarbaric acts. Now we have to work together and redouble our efforts to \ndefeat ISIS and other terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq and elsewhere.\n\n\n                         Syrian Refugee Crisis\n\n  As we remember the victims of the attacks in Paris, we cannot forget \nall those who are fleeing the terror in Syria. The ongoing conflict in \nthat country has created 4 million refugees. These are people who are \nfleeing Assad's barrel bombs, his brutal assault on them on the ground, \nand they are fleeing murderous terrorist attacks committed by ISIS and \nother groups. Of those 4 million refugees, 1.9 million are in Turkey; \n650,000 are in Jordan, a country of 6.5 million people; and 1.2 million \nare in Lebanon, making up a fifth of Lebanon's entire population.\n  The White House has a very modest plan to bring 10,000 Syrian \nrefugees into the United States over the next year. It is a tiny number \ncompared to what other countries are doing. Even France--the country \nthat just suffered the terrorist attacks--is going to honor its \ncommitment to take 30,000 refugees over the next 2 years. Each one of \nthe 10,000 refugees we are accepting is important because it could be \nthe difference between life and death for those individuals. That is \nwhy I was proud to join Senator Durbin and other Members to urge the \nWhite House to do more--because we can and we should do more.\n  The United States has always been a refuge for the vulnerable, for \nthose who are fleeing political repression or those who are persecuted \nsimply because of their religion. The Syrian refugees the \nadministration is prioritizing for entry are, in fact, the most \nvulnerable. These are survivors of violence and torture, people with \nmedical conditions, and women and children.\n  The news site BuzzFeed has published a series of images of children, \nof young Syrian refugees. I encourage everyone to look at these images \nbecause they capture the vulnerability and desperation of the people we \nare trying to help, children like Ahmed, who is sleeping in this \npicture I have in the Chamber. As the BuzzFeed story says, Ahmed is a \n6-year-old who carries his own bag over the long stretches his family \nwalks by foot. His uncle says: ``He is brave and only cries sometimes \nin the evenings.'' His uncle has taken care of Ahmed since his father \nwas killed in their hometown in northern Syria.\n  There are children like Maram. Maram is an 8-year-old, and the story \ndescribes how her house was hit by a rocket. A piece of the roof landed \nright on top of her, and the head trauma\n\n[[Page S8071]]\n\ncaused her brain hemorrhage. She is no longer in a coma but has a \nbroken jaw and cannot speak.\n  We can only hope these children won't share the fate of Aylan Kurdi, \nwhose image I can't get out of my mind. He is the drowned 3-year-old \nboy whose photograph on that beach galvanized the world. He was part of \na group of 23 who had set out in two boats to reach the Greek island of \nKos, but the vessels capsized. Aylan drowned, as did his 5-year-old \nbrother Galip, and so did the boys' mother, Rehan.\n  In the aftermath of the gruesome terrorist attacks in Paris, some \nhave taken the view that we should turn our backs on these people, the \nvery people who are fleeing from the terrorists. Some argue that we \ncannot both help these vulnerable men, women, and children and keep our \ncountry safe, but they paint a false choice. We can do both and we \nshould do both.\n  I wish to take just a minute to describe the stringent and very \nextensive security screening procedures these individuals go through \nbefore they can even enter the country, procedures so extensive that it \ncan take up to 2 years--usually between 1\\1/2\\ years and 2 years--for \nthem to be cleared to come here.\n  These refugees are subject to the highest levels of security checks \nof any category of traveler entering the country. Those screenings \ninclude the involvement of our security and intelligence agencies, such \nas the National Counterterrorism Center, the FBI's Terrorist Screening \nCenter, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State, \nand the Department of Defense.\n  All available biographic and biometric information of these refugees \nis vetted against law enforcement and intelligence community databases \nso that the identity of the individual can be confirmed. Every single \nrefugee is interviewed by a trained official from the Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  Finally, the screening process accounts for the unique conditions of \nthe Syria crisis and subjects these refugees to additional security \nscreening measures.\n  We absolutely need to make sure these security measures are as \nstringent and as thorough as possible, and if there are ways to enhance \nthese screening protocols, we should make sure we are doing that.\n  Each year the United States accepts tens of thousands of refugees \nfrom around the world, and there is no reason why some of those can't \nbe Syrian refugees who are the most vulnerable. We can strike the right \nbalance. We can protect our security and do our part to address the \nlargest refugee crisis since World War II. But rather than showing \ncompassion and standing up for American values, many of my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle want to close the door to people who are \nfleeing the most horrendous forms of persecution. I believe that would \nbetray our core values, and it would send a dangerous message to the \nworld that we judge people based on the country they come from or from \ntheir religion, and that would make us less safe by feeding into ISIS's \nown propaganda that we are at war with Islam.\n  We are better than this. Remember the closing lines of the poem that \nis inscribed on the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty, the gift from \nFrance to the United States that is a symbol of freedom and of generous \nwelcome to foreigners. The poem, ``The New Colossus,'' was written by \nEmma Lazarus, who was involved in charitable work for refugees and \ndeeply moved by the plight of Russian Jews--like my grandfather--who \nhad fled to the United States. These are the closing lines of her poem:\n\n     Give me your tired, your poor,\n     Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,\n     The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.\n     Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,\n     I lift my lamp beside the golden door!\n\n  There should always be a place in this country for men, women, and \nchildren who are fleeing horror--the same kind of horror that befell so \nmany innocent people in Paris last week. This is not the time to score \npolitical points; this is the time when we come together and show \nleadership. This is the time--this is now the time--when we uphold the \nvalues of the United States of America.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Kentucky for \nthe purposes of describing an amendment that he has filed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, make no mistake, we have been attacked in \nthe past by refugees or by people posing as refugees. The two Boston \nbombers were here as refugees. They didn't take very kindly to what we \ngave them--education, food, clothing--and they chose to attack our \ncountry. In Bowling Green, KY, we had two Iraqi refugees who came \nthrough the refugee program, posing as refugees, and then promptly \ndecided to buy Stinger missiles. Fortunately, they bought them from an \nFBI agent, and we caught them. But when we caught them, we discovered \ntheir fingerprints were already on bomb fragments in Iraq in our \ndatabase, yet we had no clue and admitted them anyway.\n  I think we have an insufficient process for knowing who is here \nlegally and illegally. We have 11 million people in our country \nillegally, and 40 percent of them have overstayed their visa. Do we \nknow who they are? Do we know where they are? If we extrapolate those \nstatistics to those who are visiting our country from the Middle East, \ndo we know where the 150,000 students are who say they are going to \nschool in our country from the Middle East? I don't think we do.\n  I don't think we should continue adding people to the rolls of those \ncoming from the Middle East until we absolutely know who is in our \ncountry and what their intentions are. So my bill says this--my \namendment says this: We are not going to bring them here and put them \non government assistance.\n  When the poem beneath the Statute of Liberty said give me your tired, \ngive me your poor, it didn't say come to our country and we will put \nyou on welfare. In those days you came for opportunity. Many Christian \nchurches have supported refugees. My church has supported refugees \ncoming here. That is charity. But when you put them on welfare, that is \nnot charity.\n  We borrow $1 million a minute. We don't have enough money to do this; \nit is a threat to our national security. My amendment would end the \nhousing assistance for refugees in order to send a message to the \nPresident: The people have spoken. We are unhappy with your program. If \nyou will not listen to the American people, we will take the money from \nthe purse.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Senator's \namendment. All of us recognize that our first obligation as Americans \nis to ensure the security and well-being to the extent we can of our \ncitizens. That is our first priority.\n  There are many flaws in the system for admitting people to this \ncountry. Those flaws go beyond the problem of people sneaking into our \ncountry illegally or overstaying their visas. They extend to the \nprocess we use under the Visa Waiver Program. Indeed, one of our \ncolleagues Senator Coats has introduced a thoughtful bill to have us \ntake a better look at that program and whether it is a way for citizens \nwho have been radicalized to come from Western European countries into \nour country and to do us harm.\n  There are many ways we can improve the process. I am working with \nSenator Cantwell on a bill having to do with biometrics to make sure we \nhave more information. I look at the Senator's amendment, and he lists \n34 countries that would be affected by his prohibition--34 countries. \nThey include countries such as Turkey. Turkey is a NATO ally. Turkey is \nabsolutely vital in the war against ISIS. It includes our strong ally \nJordan. If Jordan and Turkey and Lebanon, countries that have already \ntaken in 4 million refugees who are fleeing from Syria, are \ndestabilized, what does that mean for the stability of that entire \nregion?\n  Mr. President, last month I went on an official trip with several of \nmy colleagues to get a better understanding of the migrant crisis that \nis engulfing Europe. We traveled to the two countries that are the \nentry points for\n\n[[Page S8072]]\n\nmany of the refugees fleeing the conflict in Syria and who also are \ncoming from Afghanistan and Iraq and some countries in Africa as well, \nsuch as Libya. So we went to Italy, and we went to Greece.\n  At that time, in the middle of last month, 710,000 individuals had \ncome in through Greece and to Italy to go on to other countries in \nWestern Europe and in Scandinavia. We talked to the officials there, \nand I was not happy with the responses I received from Greek, Italian, \nand U.N. officials about their screening of refugees. Even though it is \nevident that the vast majority of refugees were people who were fearing \nfor their lives and seeking safety, I was worried that ISIS fighters \nwould embed themselves in this flood of refugees.\n  What the Greeks and the Italians, with help from the U.N. High \nCommissioner for Refugees, were doing was fingerprinting people, taking \ntheir photographs and then essentially sending them on their way. And I \nasked: Are we comparing these fingerprints, these photos, this other \ninformation with our--the American--watch list for terrorists? Are we \nmatching them up against our no-fly list, our TIDE database, which is \nthe larger terrorist watch list? The answer was no, and that needs to \nchange.\n  I also traveled to a shelter in Athens that was run by Doctors of the \nWorld, an organization with which I was previously unfamiliar, and \nthere I met a very young mother with her adorable little girl. They \nwere from Eritrea, and they had been part of the flood of refugees. \nThey pose no harm to our country or to any of the countries in which \nthey might ultimately settle, yet they might need a little bit of \nassistance, a little bit of help, because the mother was so young and \nher daughter only about age 2.\n  I also met two young girls from Afghanistan who both said to me: \nPlease don't take our pictures and put them on Facebook, because we \nfear for our relatives back in Afghanistan.\n  Look what has happened in Afghanistan, as the Taliban has regained \nstrength and now is once again oppressing women and girls, denying them \nan education, forcing them into early marriages.\n  Another country on this list is Nigeria--certainly a country we have \nto be very careful about because this is the country where ISIS has a \nstronghold and where Boko Haram is located. But it is also the country \nwhere hundreds of girls were kidnapped for trying to get an education.\n  In other words, we can't just list 34 countries, some of which are \nessential to work with us in the war against terrorism, against ISIS, \nsuch as Jordan and Turkey. We can't just list all these countries and \nsay they are off limits.\n  We can't just automatically say no to an Iraqi interpreter who has \nworked with our special forces and now is in danger of losing his life \nand having his family slaughtered because he helped to save Americans' \nlives in Iraq. Are we saying we will not let a single person from 34 \ncountries into our country no matter how many American lives they have \nsaved, no matter whether they pose a threat to us?\n  Now, I want to make very clear that I do not think our process for \nscreening people to come into this country is good enough. It is not. \nIf it were good enough, we would not have people who could cause us \nharm in this country. But, you know, perhaps we should be focusing on \nthose Americans--yes, even Americans--who have become radicalized and \nhave traveled to Syria and Iraq and been trained to plot attacks here \nin this country: lone-wolf attacks, such as Major Hasan at Fort Hood, \nan American citizen who was radicalized online by an extremist Islamic \ncleric.\n  We can't apply a one-size-fits-all to 34 countries that include a \nNATO ally and other allies that have been helpful in the war against \nterrorism or countries that include individuals who have helped the \ncause, who have saved American lives or who pose no threats to us, such \nas those two young Afghan girls I met at the shelter or the very young \nmother with her very young little girl.\n  We do need to tighten our process. We need to do more. You know, I \nwould think that Members of this body who voted just months ago to \nweaken our ability, even under court orders, to provide surveillance of \nthose who we suspect would do us harm would think again about what they \nhave done in this time when the threats coming at us have never been \ngreater. But this is a meat ax approach. It is too broad, and it does \nnot really address the problem that we face today. We do need to \naddress that problem. Perhaps we need a pause to redo our processes. \nBut this is not the answer.\n\n  Finally, as I read this language, the way it is written, it may apply \nto refugees who already have been legally admitted to this country. Do \nwe want to do that? We need to think about this. We need to get this \nright, and Senator Paul's amendment is far too broad and is not the \nright answer to what is a real problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I associate myself with the comments of \nSenator Collins, who described the amendment extremely well. I, too, \nrise in opposition to the proposed amendment for all the reasons she \nlisted. She was quite vivid and quite concrete in numerous examples: \nindividuals in Afghanistan who have assisted us who are in jeopardy if \nthey don't get an opportunity to come to the United States and people \nin Jordan who fight with us each day. Who can fail to recall the \nhorrific scene of the young Jordanian pilot who was burned by ISIS? \nThat was a Jordanian patriot fighting with the United States of America \nagainst the common enemy, ISIL. Unfortunately, he is deceased. But to \ntell his family members and his fellow countrymen that they can't come \nhere as they qualify through rigorous procedures as a refugee and are \ngranted asylum--all these reasons have been so well spoken by Senator \nCollins. So I won't go on, but I want to make clear that I, too, oppose \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Crude Oil Export Ban\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise today to make the case for lifting \nthe 40-year-old ban on exporting crude oil. Lifting the ban is a smart \nmove and it is long overdue. It will benefit not only my home State of \nNorth Dakota but also our Nation and our allies. That is why I am \nproposing to include legislation lifting the ban in the new highway \nbill that Congress is on track to pass this month.\n  The highway bill is must-pass legislation, and the benefits of \nallowing crude oil exports are multiple. Taken together, they make a \npowerful case for allowing our producers to market their product on the \nworld markets. Doing so would enhance domestic production, increase the \nglobal supply of crude oil, grow our economy, create good-paying jobs \nfor our people, and make our Nation more secure. So let's look at these \nbenefits one by one.\n  First and foremost, crude oil exports will benefit American \nconsumers. The price of oil is based on supply and demand--the more oil \non the market, the lower the price. The volatility and the global price \nof crude oil are felt right down to the consumer level. More global \nsupply means lower prices for gasoline and other fuels and more money \nin consumers' pockets. Those facts are backed up by studies at both the \nU.S. Energy Information Administration and the nonpartisan Brookings \nInstitution.\n  This spring, EIA Administrator Adam Sieminski confirmed these \nfindings in testimony before the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, on which I serve, as does the Presiding Officer. In \nSeptember, the EIA released a new report that reaffirms the benefits to \nconsumers and businesses that would result from lifting the decades-old \ncrude oil export ban.\n  Second, in addition to benefiting consumers, crude oil exports will \nbenefit the American economy. Crude oil exports will increase revenues \nand boost overall economic growth. It will help increase wages, create \njobs, and improve our balance of trade.\n  The one area of our economy that currently enjoys a favorable balance \nof trade is agriculture. That is because our farmers and ranchers \nsuccessfully market their products around the globe.\n  Our crude oil producers should be allowed to do the same. Local \neconomies\n\n[[Page S8073]]\n\nalso benefit. Service industries, retail, and other businesses in \ncommunities centered on oil development would see more economic \nactivity and growth if this antiquated ban is lifted.\n  Crude oil exports will also benefit the U.S. energy industry. The \nEIA's latest study concluded that lifting the ban will reduce the \ndiscount for light sweet crude oil produced in States such as my State \nof North Dakota, as well as Texas and other States, and encourage more \ninvestment in domestic energy production.\n  The drop in the price of oil this year has slowed domestic \nproduction, but we continue to produce oil. Today my State of North \nDakota produces about 1.16 million barrels of oil a day, only down \nslightly from our peak of more than 1.2 million barrels of oil a day. \nThe reason is that our producers are resilient and innovative. They are \ndeveloping new technologies and new techniques to become more cost \neffective and efficient all the time. The American energy industry is \nhere to stay.\n  The energy sector, moreover, provides high-paying jobs for our \npeople. We know that from experience in North Dakota, which has had the \nfastest growing rate of per capita personal income in the country among \nall the States in recent years.\n  On a national level, crude oil exports will help to bring our energy \npolicy into the 21st century. The crude oil export ban is an economic \nstrategy implemented in the 1970s, and the world has changed \ndramatically since then. Back then, conventional wisdom was that there \nwas a finite quantity of oil in the world and we pretty much knew where \nit was. Nobody envisioned the kind of energy revolution we are seeing \nin States such as North Dakota, Texas, Colorado, and many others. \nConsequently, the model has shifted from scarcity to abundance, and we \nneed to have a comprehensive approach to energy that reflects the new \nreality. That means we need additional investments in technology, \ntransportation, and energy infrastructure, such as pipelines, rail, \nroads, and other industry needs. By leveraging our natural resources \nand American innovation, the United States is in a position to \ndemonstrate real global energy leadership.\n  Last but not least, crude oil exports will strengthen national \nsecurity. U.S. crude oil will provide strategic geopolitical benefits, \nnot only for us but also for our friends around the globe. It will \nprovide our allies with alternative sources of oil and free them from \ntheir reliance on energy from Russia, Venezuela, Iran, and other \nunstable parts of the world.\n  As a further security advantage, adding more supply would add a \nbuffer against volatile events in the Middle East and elsewhere in the \nworld. We finally have an opportunity to curb the disproportionate \ninfluence OPEC has had on the world oil market for 5 decades, and we \nneed to do it. The President's deal with Iran lifts sanctions against \nIranian oil, bringing 1 million barrels a day of their product on to \nglobal markets. Clearly, it is inconsistent for us to maintain a ban on \nU.S. oil exports while the President lifts a ban on Iranian exports, \nsending jobs, revenues, and economic growth to places such as Iran \nwhile blocking the same benefits for American citizens.\n  The ban on crude oil exports has long outlived its usefulness, and \nrepealing it is long overdue. For consumers, jobs, the economy, and \nnational security, we need to come together and lift the ban. We can do \nthat by including legislation lifting the crude oil ban in the \nbipartisan highway bill set to pass Congress this month.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n     James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Reauthorization Act\n\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, 14 years ago on November 17, 2001, \nfamilies across New Jersey were still struggling with the grief of \nempty seats at dinner tables and closets full of clothes never to be \nworn again. It was 14 years ago that the news headlines were reflecting \non one of the greatest tragedies our country had ever witnessed, which \nwere the attacks on 9/11 of the World Trade Center, at the Pentagon, \nand in Pennsylvania.\n  Today, the trauma for that is no longer as raw as it once was, yet we \nare still affected forever, and much still tries the soul of our \nNation. While the Sun still rises, the seasons still change, the wounds \nof that day may never heal. There are so many families across New \nJersey who are still struggling with the aftermath of this terror, with \nthe illnesses of loved ones who survived and who served as first \nresponders in the 9/11 attacks.\n  While the debris has long been cleared and new towers now stand at \nthe World Trade Center site, many of the thousands of brave first \nresponders who sacrificed their safety for the good of our country are \nstill battling very serious health issues. The exposure to debris, to \ndust, to other hazardous materials and chemicals on September 11 and \nthe weeks and months that followed have caused countless chronic \nmedical problems for tens of thousands of Americans, including many New \nJerseyans. They and their families are still burdened every single day \nwith the physical, emotional, and financial costs of the attacks on 9/\n11.\n  For too long in the wake of the attacks, there were significant gaps \nin the access and quality of care for survivors. One such survivor, \nJames Zadroga, an NYPD officer and former Ocean County, NJ, resident, \nstruggled with accessing care to treat his severe and chronic \nrespiratory problems after serving as first responder in the wake of \nSeptember 11, where we believe he acquired those serious health \nproblems. James passed away just over 4 years after the attacks at the \nage of 34.\n  Thanks to the advocacy of the Zadroga family and the State and \nFederal lawmakers--people like Senator Lautenberg and Senator \nMenendez--a bill was passed into law to provide health care, treatment, \nand compensation for survivors like James Zadroga who are dealing with \nthe aftermath and effects of the 9/11 attacks. Because of the James \nZadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010, over 70,000 first \nresponders and survivors are now enrolled in the World Trade Center \nHealth Program and receiving quality care.\n  Over 5,000 survivors and first responders still require medical \ntreatment because of their exposure and/or their service as first \nresponders and because of the Zadroga act, they have had access. \nBecause Congress failed to act, the World Trade Center Health Program \nexpired in September 2015, and without congressional action, funding \nfor the program will run out by next year. Additionally, funding for \nthe September 11th Victim Compensation Fund will likely expire around \nthe same time next year as well.\n  Earlier this month, the editorial board of one New Jersey newspaper, \nthe Star-Ledger, had this to say about this body's failure to act:\n\n       The bill has overwhelming support from both parties. They \n     understand this is an American problem, with victims from all \n     50 states, and they know this legislative solution is not \n     radical. We take care of workers with dangerous jobs . . . \n     especially heroes who risked their lives to help humanity \n     while most of us watched from home, paralyzed by grief.\n\n  We have not just a patriotic responsibility but a moral obligation to \nensure that the Americans who sacrificed so much for the good of our \ncountry in the wake of September 11, 2001, are treated with the respect \nand care they deserve. They are our heroes. They are our champions. \nThey stood up and worked when many ran.\n  It is incumbent upon this Congress to follow the lead of Senator \nGillibrand and heed the calls coming from our constituents to pass the \nJames Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Reauthorization Act. I am \nproud to stand with Senator Gillibrand and our colleagues in the Senate \nand in the House, advocates, and first responders who are urgently \ncalling for the passage of this necessary legislation that reflects our \nvalues and our ideals.\n  I wish to close with the words of a courageous Newark Fire Department \ncaptain who responded to the 9/11 attacks at great personal risk and \nhad the following to share with my office about the renewal of the \nZadroga act:\n\n       As a member of New Jersey Task Force I, I responded on 9/\n     11. This volunteer State Police team, participated in \n     numerous search\n\n[[Page S8074]]\n\n     and rescue operations on that day. The thousands of \n     firefighters that worked that day, developed medical issues \n     thereafter, including myself. I have had three surgeries for \n     thyroid cancer. I also developed the 9/11 cough, and have \n     developed side effects from radiation treatment. . . . We are \n     not looking to get rich. We just want to be able to continue \n     serving as firefighters, without worrying about our health \n     because of 9/11.\n\n  Those in this Chamber who somehow, remarkably, oppose this bill need \nto hear this man's words and my own as well. We cannot fail to act. By \nwhat we do here now, we not only take care of those heroes from 9/11 \nbut we send a message to all Americans about how we stand up for those \nwho stood for us, who fought for us. When the most perilous times came \nto be, they were there for us. This country is a nation that takes care \nof its heroes.\n  What we do here with this legislation will forever highlight this \nideal and celebrate its truth or it will cast a dark shadow over it. I \nhope today and in the coming days that we move this legislation forward \nand be the light upon the great men and women who are so patriotically \ndedicated to our Nation.\n  Mr. President, before I yield the floor, I would like to also talk \nbriefly about the Transportation appropriations bill this Chamber is \nconsidering.\n  I truly appreciate the hard work that Senator Reed and Senator \nCollins have done to get this bill to a place that makes critical \ninvestments in transportation and housing and, in particular, for some \nof our most vulnerable citizens. Their work has been tireless, and I am \nhappy to see much of the progress they are making.\n  However, this appropriations bill as it currently stands includes \nsome provisions that would weaken highway safety. At a time when 4,000 \npeople are losing their lives annually on American highways and 100,000 \nare injured due to large truck crashes, it is paramount that Congress \ndo more to improve safety, not remove evidence-based safety policies.\n  New Jersey alone has some 38,000 miles of public roads that connect \npeople of our State and get them where they need to be. It drives much \nof the commerce and economy of our State every day. New Jersey is \nstrategically placed, which makes it a very important path through the \nState and for goods up and down the east coast as well. These roads \nalso see a tremendous amount of truck traffic at all times of the day \nand night. If you have ever driven on the New Jersey Turnpike, you know \nwhat I mean.\n  I am concerned that we saw an increase in truck accidents from 2009 \nto 2012, an increase in crash injuries by 40 percent, and truck crash \nfatalities during this time have increased 16 percent. This is data. \nThese are numbers. But they are also human lives; they are fellow \nAmericans who have had their lives shattered by horrific accidents.\n  Truckdriver fatigue is a leading cause of these major truck \naccidents. These drivers who work extremely long days delivering the \ngoods we depend upon deserve basic protections allowing them to get \nsufficient rest to do their job.\n  I filed an amendment on the hours of service rules, which were put in \nplace to prevent truckdriver fatigue and ensure that the rules put in \nplace after years of study and robust stakeholder feedback would still \nbe enforceable. Some people believe we should suspend these rules, \nthese commonsense policies, by calling for even more study. My \namendment ensures the rules will remain enforceable while further study \nis conducted so that we don't see more lives put at risk as a result of \nthese delay tactics. What we should be doing is ensuring that safety is \nfirst. If it proves not necessary, then pull back.\n  There are other provisions in this bill that I believe could \njeopardize highway safety as well. I am pleased, though, that earlier \ntoday we were able to work together and pass an amendment to further \nstudy a proposal to allow heavier trucks, longer trucks on the road. \nHeavier trucks could cause greater damage and destruction to human life \nand property when these accidents occur. I am grateful to my colleagues \nfor working together on this.\n  A final example of a commonsense provision we in Congress should \naddress as we work to improve highway safety is the minimum level of \ninsurance required by truckdrivers. When truck crashes do occur and the \ninsurance doesn't cover the cost of these accidents, taxpayers are left \nto front the bill. We should look to the decades-old minimum levels of \ninsurance and assess whether those minimum insurance standards need to \nbe raised so that families torn apart by truck crashes aren't then \nthrust into debt because of medical bills.\n  I have met with some of these families. I have sat with them and \nheard their stories about how low levels of minimum insurance have left \nthem in dire straits. As taxpayers, we should not be left without the \nfunding to rebuild damaged roads and bridges in the aftermath of such \nsignificant crashes. It is time to modernize a minimum level of \ninsurance for truckdrivers so that we are all better equipped in the \naftermath of an accident.\n  Again, I have sat with far too many survivors and their family \nmembers. I have seen, talked, and engaged with them, hearing the truth \nof their stories. We cannot sit silently while truck accidents are \nincreasing in our country and allow commonsense safety to be rolled \nback in these spending bills. Where there are meaningful and practical \nsolutions to pressing highway safety challenges, these are discussions \nwe need to have. This is a fight worth having, and I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with my colleagues to improve the safety on our \nNation's highways. We have the capability, we have the know-how, and we \nhave the science to help us to begin to reduce these tragic accidents \nand fatalities on our highways.\n  I believe we should show greater urgency in protecting human life and \nprotecting Americans as they ride along our roads.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, very shortly we are going to be \nadjourning for a very important briefing, but first I feel I should \njust briefly respond to my friend from New Jersey on a few of the \npoints he raised. I recognize that he is not a member of the \nAppropriations Committee, and I doubt he was hanging on my every word \nwhen I described what was in the bill earlier today, but the fact is we \nhave some very important truck safety provisions that are in the bill. \nFor example, we require the Department to issue long-delayed \nregulations that deal with requiring speed governors that limit the \nspeed at which trucks can travel. That rulemaking has been delayed an \nastonishing 22 times. We require the Department to proceed to issue \nthose rules within 60 days of the enactment of this bill. That is a \nvery important provision.\n  If my colleague is worried about truckdrivers exceeding the speed \nlimit and causing an accident, he should be applauding this bill, which \nsays to the Department, in no uncertain terms: Stop delaying. It is \npast time to issue this regulation.\n  Another very important safety provision that is in this bill has to \ndo with requiring electronic logs. This is an important safety \nprovision because it will prevent those few bad actors in the trucking \nindustry from falsifying their paper logs. We will know for certain how \nlong they were behind the wheel and on the road, and we will know \nwhether they are complying with the hours of service provisions. Those \nare just two of the very important provisions my friend from New Jersey \nmay not be aware of given that he does not serve on the committee and \nmay not have heard my speech this morning.\n  The Senator from New Jersey also mentioned other issues, such as the \ninsurance requirements. I want to make it very clear to my colleagues \nthat our bill does not prohibit the Department from proceeding with a \nrulemaking that might increase the minimum insurance requirement, but \nwhat it says, in a very logical way, is it should assess the impact--\nthe impact on the insurance market, the impact on the truckdrivers, and \nthe impact on the insurance industry. The fact is that approximately \nonly 1 percent of crashes that occur exceed what is now the minimum \ninsurance requirement. I still think it is worth looking at because it \nhas been many years since this issue has been reviewed. We don't block \nthe rulemaking. We just make sure there is a report that assesses what \nthe impact is before the Department imposes what\n\n[[Page S8075]]\n\ncould be a huge and unnecessary financial burden.\n  I did feel it was important to clarify those three points. There is \nmuch else I could say about this issue, but I recognize that \nundoubtedly the Presiding Officer and others are eager to get to the \nbriefing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/18/senate-section/article/S8075-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I wish to speak about an amendment I \nplan on offering tomorrow to the Transportation bill we are working on \nright now on the Senate floor. It is a commonsense amendment. It is an \namendment about safety. It is an amendment about protecting our \ncitizens. It is an amendment about cutting through redtape. It is an \namendment about what the vast majority of Americans want us to do in \nthe Senate, which is to start to get things done in this body. It is a \nsimple amendment.\n  This is what my amendment does. It would allow States and communities \nthroughout this country of ours the ability to expedite the Federal \npermitting process, the regulatory process on the construction and \nrebuilding of bridges. It is pretty simple. It doesn't get much more \nsimple than that.\n  Everybody needs infrastructure. Every community in America needs \nbridges. It would only apply to bridges--critical pieces of \ninfrastructure--bridges that are built in the same place, the same \nsize, bridges that in the United States are falling apart.\n  We have talked about this on the Senate floor for the last several \nmonths. Our Nation's infrastructure is crumbling. The American Society \nof Civil Engineers gives America's infrastructure a D-plus. We are \nfailing. For our infrastructure, in the classroom, we are the D-plus \nstudents.\n  This is, of course, bad for our Nation's economy. There is nothing \nmore central to a country that wants to grow its economy, that wants to \ncompete globally, than sound infrastructure for transportation. In a \ncountry of our size facing economic challenges, America's \ninfrastructure can either drive growth and opportunity or it can slow \ndown growth and opportunity and undermine it. Right now, that is what \nwe are doing. We are slowing it down. We are undermining it. It is \nworse than that. It is worse than just undermining our own economic \nopportunity. The state of our infrastructure is actually dangerous for \nour citizens.\n  I agree that we must have stable funding for infrastructure. That is \nwhy I have been a strong supporter of the DRIVE Act and this bill, in \nterms of a 6-year highway bill, under the DRIVE Act. But we also need \nto focus on something else that is driving up the cost of our Nation's \ninfrastructure: redtape that is stopping critical projects in America \nfrom moving forward. Like so many construction projects in this \ncountry, the environmental review process our bridges face is deathly \nslow and cumbersome and enormously expensive. We live in a redtape \nnation, particularly when it comes to infrastructure. We can't build \nthe way we used to in this country.\n  Consider just a few statistics. The average time for environmental \nreviews for a major transportation project in the United States in 2011 \nwas 8 years. That is up from 3\\1/2\\ years just 10 years earlier. The \naverage environmental impact statement when NEPA was written was 22 \npages. Now the average environmental impact statement is over 1,000 \npages.\n  Let me give one example that came up in the Commerce Committee. We \nwere talking about airport infrastructure--again, critical to the \ncountry. Seattle had built a new runway. When I asked the witness who \nwas in charge of that runway how long it took to build, he said 3 \nyears. That is a pretty long time, but it is a big runway, kind of \ncomplicated. Then I asked how long it took to get the Federal permits \nand regulatory permission from the Federal Government to build that new \nrunway. The answer: 15 years. Fifteen years. The entire room gasped.\n  No American wants this. We need to do a lot more to get back to \ncommonsense permitting and regulatory reform for America's \ninfrastructure.\n  So we are starting on critical pieces of infrastructure that \neverybody can agree with. That is what this amendment does. It focuses \nsolely on bridges. Our bridges are an increasingly important issue. One \nin 10 of our Nation's bridges--roughly 607,000 bridges in the United \nStates--is structurally insufficient. Let me repeat that in a different \nway. In the United States, there are more than 600,000 bridges in need \nof repair. The average age of our bridges is 42 years old. So we need \nto repair them. We need to rebuild them. But what we don't need is the \nFederal Government taking 6 to 7 or 8 to 9 years to give us permission \nto rebuild bridges. There is not one American who thinks that would be \na good idea. Yet, if we keep the law the same, that is exactly what is \ngoing to happen.\n  Communities need to rebuild bridges, and it is going to take several \nyears to get permission from agencies in this town to allow them to do \nit. To do what? To build on the same land, to just build a bridge. We \nneed to change that.\n  Thousands of communities across the country are simply keeping their \nfingers crossed when Americans cross structurally deficient bridges 215 \nmillion times a day. Let me repeat that. In this great country, \nAmericans cross structurally deficient bridges 215 million times a day. \nSo we need to fix them. They are being crossed by our trucks, carrying \nour Nation's commerce, our children in schoolbuses, parents trying to \nget home in time for dinner. These are people we should be protecting.\n\n[[Page S8076]]\n\n  That is what my amendment does. It says that we are going to work to \nfix this infrastructure with the bill that we are working on, that my \ncolleague from Maine is leading on with the DRIVE Act. But we are also \ngoing to be smart. We are not going to require Americans to take half a \ndecade to get permission from the Federal Government to rebuild a \nbridge.\n  These bridges sustain our economy, they connect our communities, they \nconnect us, they keep us safe, and we need to expedite the ability to \nfix our infrastructure in this country, starting with our bridges. That \nis all this amendment does. It is simple. It is common sense. I hope \nthat if I can bring this to the floor, we will get a unanimous vote in \nfavor of this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, let me commend my colleague from Alaska \nfor raising this important issue.\n  First, it is important to understand that his amendment only applies \nto structurally deficient bridges. These are bridges that are \ndeteriorating and that need extensive renovation or replacement. And it \nis important that we address the problem of structurally deficient \nbridges before they become unsafe to use. That is the risk, and that is \nwhat my colleague from Alaska is attempting to address with his \namendment. He is proposing that if we are replacing a structurally \ndeficient bridge in exactly the same place, that we do not need to \nstart all over again with an environmental impact statement that may \ndelay the replacement of this structurally deficient bridge for \nliterally years, not to mention the enormous cost that is undertaken \nwhen with an environmental impact statement and all the attendant \nstudies are done. He is correct that the amount of time to do this kind \nof analysis, as well as the length of these studies, has grown \nenormously in recent years, and that, too, is a problem when we are \ndealing with a structurally deficient bridge.\n  I believe this is a commonsense amendment. I would not want to waive \nenvironmental impact studies if the bridge were going to be built in a \nnew location. Then we would need to do that kind of careful \nenvironmental analysis and review to make sure the environmental impact \nis well understood. But that is not what Senator Sullivan is proposing. \nHe is proposing that for this one category of bridges, we would not \nhave to do the environmental impact statement if it is being rebuilt in \nexactly the same place. I think this makes sense. I think this is the \nkind of common sense that my colleague from Alaska has brought to \nWashington, and I commend him for his amendment.\n  I do know there are some concerns, I believe, on the other side of \nthe aisle, and I appreciate the Senator from Alaska working with us. \nBut I, for one, believe his amendment does make sense. It is narrowly \ntailored, and I believe it should be adopted by this body.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague from Maine \nfor her comments. I very much appreciate her support. We will work with \nthe others if they have questions.\n  I have worked on a number of issues now in my first year in the \nSenate with my colleague from Rhode Island, and I certainly want to \nmake sure he is comfortable with this commonsense amendment. But I \nguarantee my colleagues, whether it is in Maine or Alaska or Rhode \nIsland, if our citizens look--it doesn't matter; Democrat or \nRepublican--at an amendment like this, I think the vast majority of \nthem would say: Of course. Of course that is what we should be doing--\nprotecting our citizens, building infrastructure, protecting the \nenvironment, but not making things take forever. That is what we are \ntrying to do.\n  So I appreciate the kind words of the Senator from Maine about the \namendment, and I am hoping we can move forward on this tomorrow.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/18/senate-section/article/S8076-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8076]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Mr. President, section 251 of the Balanced Budget and \nEmergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 establishes statutory limits on \ndiscretionary spending and allows for various adjustments to those \nlimits, while sections 302 and 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act \nof 1974 allow the chairman of the Budget Committee to establish and \nmake revisions to allocations, aggregates, and levels consistent with \nthose adjustments. Today the Senate agreed to consider H.R. 2577, the \nTransportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act, 2016, as reported by the Committee on \nAppropriations. The bill includes a provision related to the Department \nof Housing and Urban Development's administrative costs for disaster \nrelief activities that results in $1 million in outlays. This provision \nis designated as an emergency pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(i) of \nthe Balanced Budget and Deficit Control Act of 1985. The inclusion of \nthis designation makes this spending eligible for an adjustment under \nthe Congressional Budget Act.\n  As a result, I am increasing the budgetary aggregate for 2016 by $1 \nmillion in outlays. I am also increasing the 2016 allocations to the \nAppropriations Committee by $1 million in outlays.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables, which provide \ndetails about the adjustment, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    REVISION TO BUDGETARY AGGREGATES\n (Pursuant to Section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and S.\n  Con.

Mr. President, we acted on a measure I cosponsored to \nprovide new authorities to the President to extend the wide array of \nexisting U.S. sanctions on Hezbollah to any international banks \ndetermined by the Treasury Department to facilitate its activities. I \ncommend my colleagues Senators Shaheen and Rubio for introducing an \nearlier form of this measure and for pressing to ensure Senate action \non it.\n  The bill also requires that a range of new policymaking information \nbe provided to Congress from the administration on Hezbollah's malign \nactivities, including its narcotics trafficking and other criminal \nactivity and its terrorism-related and propaganda activity throughout \nthe Middle East.\n  Especially in the wake of the Iran nuclear agreement, which I \nsupported and which is now being implemented, it is critical that we \ncontinue to do everything we can to shut down Iran's terrorist proxies \nlike Hezbollah, and to impose powerful financial and other sanctions on \nthose who enable its operational or financial networks.\n  Hezbollah clearly has the potential to continue to threaten Israel, \nand this must continue to be an important focus of our efforts to \nconfront it directly and to confront those who would finance and \nsupport its efforts wherever they may be.\n  In addition, with regional and international spillover effects of the \ncivil war in Syria, we must also keep in mind the damage being done by \nHezbollah's extensive support of the dictatorial Assad government.\n  The Assad government's violent suppression of the Syrian people's \ncourageous campaign in early 2011 to secure their universal rights \nresulted in the murder of countless innocent Syrians. The violent \ncrackdown of peaceful protesters and the denial of their legitimate \ndemocratic aspirations directly led to fledgling armed opposition \ngroups throughout Syria. Since then, Hezbollah has provided training, \nlogistics, and direct personnel to the Government of Syria's ruthless \nand criminal efforts to violently crush the opposition, driving many \ninto the arms of extremist groups like ISIL and the Nusra Front.\n  For years, Iran has provided Hezbollah with training, weapons, and \nexplosives as well as political, diplomatic, monetary, and \norganizational aid. However, Hezbollah has been enterprising in \nsupplementing its revenue stream through criminal activities like drug \ntrafficking, money laundering, and counterfeiting among others.\n  The Iran nuclear agreement was necessarily focused exclusively on \npreventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. That is because a \nnuclear-armed Iran would pose an exponentially greater danger to the \nsecurity of the United States, our ally Israel, and the entire world. \nIn my view, the agreement was the only viable option to prevent such a \ndisastrous scenario.\n  But now we must do more to confront Hezbollah, as part of our broader \nefforts to strengthen regional security and antiterrorism efforts in \nthe Middle East. Our goal here is simple: to shut down Hezbollah's \nfunding networks which support its terrorist, narco-trafficking, and \nother criminal activities.\n  This bill gives the administration new tools to more aggressively \npursue foreign banks that finance Hezbollah and requires key reporting \nto Congress on whether current efforts by other countries to combat \nHezbollah's activities are adequate so that we might reassess our \npolicy on an ongoing basis. In addition, it requires the administration \nto provide regular briefings for Congress on Hezbollah's narco-\ntrafficking activities and other criminal activities, including \nprospects for explicit designation under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin \nDesignation Act or as a transnational criminal organization.\n  The bill imposes tough, targeted new sanctions measures on Hezbollah \nand its financiers, while minimizing unintended consequences against \ninnocent third-party banks or countries that have worked hard to combat \nHezbollah's reach. I am confident, for example, after consulting with \nState Department and Treasury officials, that the bill will be \nimplemented to avoid overcompliance by U.S., European, and other \nfinancial institutions that could otherwise inadvertently damage \nLebanon's banking sector, a key bulwark of its economy. That is \nespecially important as Lebanon's economy is already under pressure, \nburdened with the highest number of refugees per capita in the world.\n  I commend this bipartisan legislation to my colleagues. I thank \nSenators Shaheen and Rubio and Chairman Shelby for working with me to \nensure its passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/18/senate-section/article/S8077-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8077]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING La'DARIOUS WYLIE\n\n  Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the life and \nremarkable heroism of La'Darious Wylie, an 11-year-old boy from \nChester, SC, who showed his love for his younger sister by saving her \nlife.\n  On October 27, La'Darious was standing at a schoolbus stop in Chester \nwhen he realized a car was heading toward his sister, Sha'Vonta \nMcCrorey. His love for his sister led him to immediately jump in front \nof the moving car and push his sister out of the way. At that moment, \nLa'Darious saved his sister's life.\n  La'Darious sacrificed his life in order to save his sister's. This \ntruly touched my heart and moved people across our Nation. La'Darious \nwas brave and selfless during a dangerous situation, and his heroic act \nsays a lot about who he was, even at such a young age: fearless, \ncompassionate, and a leader.\n  I had an opportunity to speak with La'Darious's mother, Liz McCrorey, \nand my heart aches for her, La'Darious's sister Sha'Vonta, and his \nbrother Carlos Wylie. My prayers are with them. I ask that everyone \nwill keep them in their thoughts as they continue to heal and grieve.\n  I am positive La'Darious is in a better place. He was a true hero, \nand his family should be proud of that.\n  Today I ask that we honor and celebrate his life. His courage and \nultimate sacrifice should never be forgotten.\n  God bless.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/18/senate-section/article/S8077-3", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8077-S8078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JIM HARRIGER\n\n Mr. BLUNT.

Since starting his work at the mission, Jim has \nfaithfully dedicated his life to addressing the needs of the most \nvulnerable members of the Springfield community.\n  Jim is truly an icon of the philanthropic community in my hometown of \nSpringfield, MO. From the beginning, he has said he felt called by God \nto serve Springfield in this way. He exemplifies what it means to put \nfaith into action.\n  At the beginning of his service in 1993, the mission consisted of \njust two small buildings on Commercial Street. Under Jim's effective \nleadership, the mission grew to include some of its most well-known \nprograms including the culinary arts school; Victory Trade School; and \na student-run restaurant, Cook's Kettle.\n  The mission has been a place of help and hope for lives affected by \npoverty and addiction. In the mission's service to those in need, Jim \nhas promoted the idea that we should see a person's God-given \npotential, rather than defining them by their circumstances.\n  Lives have been changed, the hungry have been fed, the homeless have \ngained shelter, and the hopeless have found hope. The work of Victory \nMission will continue, and both the mission and Springfield are better \nbecause of the work of Jim Harriger.\n  Jim is set to officially retire on January 31, 2016. There is no \ndoubt that\n\n[[Page S8078]]\n\nJim will continue his exceptional work in the next chapter of his life. \nI join countless individuals in the Springfield community in expressing \nmy gratitude for his many years of faithful service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/18/senate-section/article/S8078-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO GREGG AND PEGGY NIBERT\n\n Mr. SCOTT.

The couple's very first child was a victim of \nshaken baby syndrome and blunt force trauma, and after 2 years in their \ncare, the Niberts successfully advocated the child's adoption, \nresulting in placement with an amazing family.\n  Dedicating their lives to loving each child that has been placed in \ntheir home and extending their support toward fighting for political \nreform, the Niberts have been working toward providing foster care \nchildren with a voice and more rights within the legal system. The \nNiberts have been working on behalf of foster care children for years \nand have shown that love and care for others can change lives.\n  Gregg and Peggy Nibert are an outstanding example of foster parents \nwho have a burning passion and desire not just to provide a home for \nthese children but to love unconditionally and fight relentlessly for \nthem as well.

The funds made available under NAHASDA for \n     Native Alaskans under the heading ``Indian Block Grants'' in \n     title II of this Act shall be allocated to the same Native \n     Alaskan housing block grant recipients that received funds in \n     fiscal year 2005.\n       Sec. 214.

The Secretary shall also \n     take appropriate steps to ensure that project-based contracts \n     remain in effect prior to foreclosure, subject to the \n     exercise of contractual abatement remedies to assist \n     relocation of tenants for imminent major threats to health \n     and safety after written notice to and informed consent of \n     the affected tenants and use of other available remedies, \n     such as partial abatements or receivership. After disposition \n     of any multifamily property described under this section, the \n     contract and allowable rent levels on such properties shall \n     be subject to the requirements under section 524 of MAHRAA.\n       Sec. 216.  The commitment authority funded by fees as \n     provided under the heading ``Community Development Loan \n     Guarantees Program Account'' may be used to guarantee, or \n     make commitments to guarantee, notes, or other obligations \n     issued by any State on behalf of non-entitlement communities \n     in the State in accordance with the requirements of section \n     108 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974:  \n     Provided, That any State receiving such a guarantee or \n     commitment shall distribute all funds subject to such \n     guarantee to the units of general local government in non-\n     entitlement areas that received the commitment.\n       Sec. 217.

No public housing agency shall be \n     granted this designation through this section that \n     administers in excess of 22,000 aggregate housing vouchers \n     and public housing units. Of the agencies selected under this \n     section, no less than 150 shall administer 600 or fewer \n     aggregate housing voucher and public housing units, no less \n     than 125 shall administer 601-5,000 aggregate housing voucher \n     and public housing units, and no more than 20 shall \n     administer 5,001-22,000 aggregate housing voucher and public \n     housing units.

The Secretary may, at \n     the request of a Moving-to-Work agency and one or more \n     adjacent public housing agencies in the same area, designate \n     that Moving-to-Work agency as a regional agency. A regional \n     Moving-to-Work agency may administer the assistance under \n     sections 8 and 9 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 \n     U.S.C. 1437f and g) for the participating agencies within its \n     region pursuant to the terms of its Moving-to-Work agreement \n     with the Secretary. The Secretary may agree to extend the \n     term of the agreement and to make any necessary changes to \n     accommodate regionalization. A Moving-to-Work agency may be \n     selected as a regional agency if the Secretary determines \n     that unified administration of assistance under sections 8 \n     and 9 by that agency across multiple jurisdictions will lead \n     to efficiencies and to greater housing choice for low-income \n     persons in the region. For purposes of this expansion, in \n     addition to the provisions of the Act retained in section \n     204, section 8(r)(1) of the Act shall continue to apply \n     unless the Secretary determines that waiver of this section \n     is necessary to implement comprehensive rent reform and \n     occupancy policies subject to evaluation by the Secretary, \n     and the waiver contains, at a minimum, exceptions for \n     requests to port due to employment, education, health and \n     safety. No public housing agency granted this designation \n     through this section shall receive more funding under \n     sections 8 or 9 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 than \n     it otherwise would have received absent this designation. The \n     Secretary shall extend the current Moving-to-Work agreements \n     of previously designated participating agencies until the end \n     of each such agency's fiscal year 2028 under the same terms \n     and conditions of such current agreements, except for any \n     changes to such terms or conditions otherwise mutually agreed \n     upon by the Secretary and any such agency and such extension \n     agreements shall prohibit any statutory offset of any reserve \n     balances equal to four months of operating expenses. Any such \n     reserve balances that exceed such amount shall remain \n     available to any such agency for all permissible purposes \n     under such agreement unless subject to a statutory offset. In \n     addition to other reporting requirements, all Moving-to-Work \n     agencies shall report financial data to the Department of \n     Housing and Urban Development as specified by the Secretary, \n     so that the effect of Moving-to-Work policy changes can be \n     measured.\n       Sec. 240.
