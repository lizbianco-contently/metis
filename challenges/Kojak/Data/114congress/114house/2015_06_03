The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Denham) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to acknowledge and honor the \nlife of a personal friend and Gold Star Father Brent Winn Layton. The \nbeloved father, son, brother, and uncle died unexpectedly at the age of \n47 on Saturday, May 23, 2015, in Longmont, Colorado.\n  Brent was born on October 23, 1967, in Berkeley, California, to \nShirley Hughes and A. Winn Layton. Although Brent lived in many cities \nthroughout his life, he was a longtime resident of the Escalon area and \nconsidered it home.\n  Brent was a very gifted man with many levels. He served as a deputy \nsheriff in Kern County, California, and Clark County, Arkansas. He also \nserved as a peace officer for the Escalon Police Department. In \naddition to his commitment to law enforcement, Brent was committed to \nGod. He was a very spiritual man and found great comfort in his faith.\n  Unfortunately, in 2009, Brent became a Gold Star Father when his \nfirstborn son, James, was killed in action in Kunar province, \nAfghanistan, serving during Operation Enduring Freedom. Since then, \nBrent's mission in life was to embrace other Gold Star families and \nhelp them through the grieving process.\n  Brent had many friends that loved him, and he had a heart full of \nlove for them. His laugh, his sense of humor, and his big bear hugs \nwill be missed forever. In addition, his friends and family admired his \nhonest pride in his Cherokee Nation citizenship and will miss listening \nto him play guitar. There is peace in knowing that he is now with his \nson as well as the family and friends that have gone before him.\n  Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring and recognizing Brent for his \nfriendship, faith, and unwavering support for other military families. \nHe had a genuine love for people, community, and country and will be \nmissed by many. God bless him always.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/03/house-section/article/H3763-5", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3763-H3764]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRANSPORTATION FUNDING\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, this week, we started the 33rd extension \nof the highway spending program. The 33rd time that we failed to deal \nmeaningfully with the crisis in funding our transportation system. It \nis a symbol of Congress' failure to deal with a country that is falling \napart and falling behind.\n  No country became great building its infrastructure 7 months at a \ntime.\n  It prompts silly ideas. One recently, an op-ed page of The Wall \nStreet Journal, talks about ``Taxing for Highways, Paying for Bike \nLanes'' as the problem. Well, as is pointed out in letters to the \neditor today, it is not spending on bike paths which Dr. Pete Ruane, \nhead of the American Road & Transportation Builders Association, \npointed out is about 1 percent of the total Federal transportation \nhighway budget, if you include sidewalks as well.\n  No, the problem is that we are paying for 2015 infrastructure with \n1993 dollars. We have not raised the gas tax in 22 years. Now, I would \nsuggest that what we ought to do is to look at the broad coalition that \nis represented by the authors on that page from the roadbuilders and \nthe cyclists--they are representative of the broadest coalition on any \nissue in American politics today--from the AFL-CIO to the U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce, the truckers--represented eloquently by Governor Bill \nGraves, who is not just president of the American Trucking \nAssociations, he was the Republican Governor of Kansas who raised the \ngas tax not once, but twice.\n  There is an opportunity for us to break the logjam. I would suggest \nthat maybe the House Ways and Means Committee could, for the first time \nin the 55 months that the Republicans have been in charge, actually \nmeet to discuss transportation funding. That is our job.\n  Let's dedicate an entire week to solving this problem. Let's invite \nin representatives of that broad coalition: people who build, maintain, \nand use our transportation system. Let's hear from the six Republican \nStates that already this year have raised the gas tax,\n\n[[Page H3764]]\n\nred Republican States: Utah; Georgia; South Dakota; Idaho; Iowa; and, \nmost recently, Nebraska, where the legislature overrode the Governor's \nveto to raise their gas tax.\n  It is time for Congress to do its job and to be in partnership with \nthose States who expect us to maintain the Federal responsibility. \nLet's hear from the broad array of people and then allow the Ways and \nMeans Committee to follow regular order.\n  There is more support for raising the gas tax. The public is already \npaying the price. The bill I have, which would provide 210 billion \nadditional dollars over the next decade, would cost the average \nmotorist just about $90 a year. At a time of declining gas prices, that \nis not that great, but motorists are now paying $350 a year on average \nin damage to their cars. The country paid $125 billion in the cost of \ncongestion.\n  Let's stop beating around the bush. Let's pass the first 6-year \ntransportation reauthorization, the first since 1998. The first step is \nfor the Ways and Means Committee to do its job, bring these people in, \nwork together on a bipartisan basis, raise the gas tax, index the gas \ntax, then abolish the gas tax, replace it with something that is \nsustainable.\n  In the meantime, let's rebuild and renew America and put hundreds of \nthousands of people to work at family-wage jobs while we strengthen \ncommunities from coast to coast.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/03/house-section/article/H3764-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3764]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HOLDING THE VA ACCOUNTABLE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about our \nveterans.\n  Memorial Day was just this past weekend, and we honored those who \npaid the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our Nation.\n  This weekend also, veterans from around our great country journeyed \nhere to our Nation's Capital to visit the monuments that were publicly \nerected in their honor. I am so proud that a group of over 60 veterans \nliving in south Florida--including David Millan, Don Lowe, and \nAugustine Fernandez--were able to make the trip on the first-ever Honor \nFlight from Miami International Airport, located in my congressional \ndistrict.\n  They, like all veterans, are true American patriots, courageous and \nbrave, putting others before themselves, willing to stand up and fight \nfor our Nation's ideals and for the spread of freedom, peace, and \nprosperity abroad. That is who they are. It is in their DNA.\n  My family and I, we know the sacrifice and the courage and the \nresolve that is required to dedicate one's life to the service of our \ncountry. My husband, Dexter, proudly served in Vietnam as a U.S. Army \nRanger, earning a Purple Heart. My stepson, Douglas, and his wife, \nLindsay, both served tours of duty as Active Duty Marine Corps aviators \nin Iraq, with Lindsay also having served in Afghanistan. They are still \nserving our Nation as Marine reservists.\n  I could not be prouder of them and their fellow veterans and have the \nhighest respect for the families and caregivers who support our vets \nafter they return home from their missions. I recognize that we can \nnever repay our veterans in full for their contributions, but we must \ncertainly try. I would like to think that all Americans feel the same \nway.\n  A key part of our Nation's commitment to our veterans has always been \nproviding them with quality health care, especially with respect to \ninjuries suffered in the line of duty; but, more than a year after the \nmost recent VA health system scandal rocked this administration and \nforced the replacement of a Cabinet Secretary, the VA's commitment on \nhealth care continues to fall tragically short.\n  A year later, the number of patients facing long wait times is still \nthe same, and somehow, the number of patients waiting more than 90 days \nhas actually doubled. A year later, the VA health system continues to \nfail our veterans. We know that these veterans have the right stuff, \nthe selflessness, the courage, and the pride that they demonstrate in \ndefense of the American way of life; but what must they think of our \ngovernment now?\n  Unconscionably long wait times, bureaucratic mismanagement, top-down \nrationed care are all well below the bare minimum standards any \nAmerican should expect; yet this is exactly what the VA, under this \nadministration, continues to offer our veterans.\n  At least this Congress has pushed for reform, for access, for choice. \nIn the last year, we have passed laws that set out to improve access \nfor veterans seeking medical care and mental health services. Congress \nalso provided the VA with $16 billion to shorten wait times and improve \nhealthcare quality.\n  I have joined many of my colleagues to demand that the VA publicly \nrelease the findings of 140 internal healthcare investigations \nconducted since 2006 to enforce accountability at the VA. I have also \njoined a bipartisan contingent of my House colleagues to offer to help \nthe VA staff focus on providing health care by allowing congressional \nstaff to serve as the primary point of contact for veterans asking \nabout their claims and their long appointment times.\n  Over and over again, Congress' efforts have been met by a stubborn \nbureaucracy that looks to skirt legislative intent on expanding \nveterans access and choice and reforming the way that the VA health \nsystem does its business.\n  I am committed to holding the VA under this administration \nresponsible for the continued failings of our VA health system, and I \nwill continue to fight alongside my colleagues in Congress for the \nreforms that will provide our veterans with the quality health care \nthey deserve.\n  We know that our veterans should not have to wait another year. The \ntime is long past; the time is now. The next time that south Florida \nresidents come to D.C. on Honor Flights to visit their war memorials, \nthey will truly know that our Nation honors their service by providing \nquality health care at all of our VA facilities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/03/house-section/article/H3764-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3764-H3765]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXPORT-IMPORT BANK\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMaryland (Mr. Hoyer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues for allowing me \nto precede them.\n  I want to thank the gentlewoman from Florida. Of course, I am always \nglad to hear her speak on the floor. I wanted her to know that.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are now less than a month from the deadline for \nCongress to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank.\n  In 2012, this House came together under the leadership of the \ngentleman from Virginia, Mr. Cantor, who worked with my office, and we \nput a bill on the floor that reauthorized the Bank and increased its \nlending authority with a bipartisan vote of 330-93. This should not be \nand is not a partisan issue.\n  Helping small- and medium-sized American businesses access new \noverseas markets and compete on a level playing field is something that \nDemocrats and Republicans have long agreed that Congress ought to do.\n  That is why it is deeply concerning to read comments from Majority \nLeader McCarthy that Congress should ``wind down'' the Bank and allow \nits charter to expire. That, in my view, is a minority opinion on the \nfloor of this House, and that would be a profound mistake.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  The Export-Import Bank is a critical tool that helps our businesses \ncompete successfully in global markets. We are going to talk about \ntrade, apparently, next week, but what we need to make sure is that we \ncan export goods that are made in America, that we will make in \nAmerica, and that we will sell abroad. The Export-Import Bank \nfacilitates that effort. It is a critical tool that helps businesses \ncompete successfully in global markets.\n  Last year alone, it supported $27.5 billion in export activity. About \n90 percent of its transactions support thousands of small businesses \nthat otherwise would have difficulty accessing markets.\n  The Ex-Im Bank has supported 1.3 million private sector jobs since \nour economic recovery began, including 164,000 jobs just last year, and \nit does all this without costing the taxpayers\n\n[[Page H3765]]\n\na single cent. In fact, it brought $675 million in profits to the \nTreasury last year and more than $2 billion over the past two decades. \nWe cannot afford, Mr. Speaker, to let the bank expire.\n  Even more than just preventing a lapse, we ought to be providing \nexporters and potential exporters with certainty by enacting a \nmultiyear reauthorization.\n  With the Export-Import Bank's future uncertain, businesses that could \nbe reaching new customers abroad have been holding back making \ninvestments in growth that would create more jobs here at home. We are \ngoing to hear a lot about jobs here at home next week as we debate the \nfast-track authority. This deals with jobs here in America. With the \nExport-Import Bank's future uncertain, we are seeing uncertainty in the \nmarketplace.\n  A multiyear extension and an increase in the bank's lending authority \nwould give a green light to these businesses that it is time to invest \nand expand.\n  We all talk about investing. We all talk about expanding jobs. I want \nto quote: ``There are thousands of jobs on the line that would \ndisappear pretty quickly if the Ex-Im Bank were to disappear.'' Let me \nrepeat that for my colleagues. ``There are thousands of jobs on the \nline that would disappear pretty quickly if the Ex-Im Bank were to \ndisappear.'' Those are not my words. That is a quote. They are the \nwords of Speaker John Boehner on April 30 of this year, just a few \nweeks ago.\n  He is not the only Republican who wants to save the bank. \nRepresentative Stephen Fincher, Republican of Tennessee, has said that \n``a majority of RSC members support the bank's reauthorization.'' RSC \nmembers are amongst the most conservative members of their party in \nthis House. In fact, there are 59 cosponsors on Mr. Fincher's bill. \nThey are Republicans.\n  All of my party, the last time we reauthorized it and this time, will \nvote to create jobs in America by voting for the Export-Import Bank. \nNow, we have 188 members. You don't have to be much of a mathematician \nto know if you have 188 and 60, that is 248. All you need is 218 to \npass the bill.\n  The Speaker has said he wants to let the House work its will. He said \nthat in 2011 when he became Speaker. And he said the House works best \nwhen the House can work its will. If we bring the Export-Import Bank \nbill to the floor, it will pass. Together with 180 Democrats, or 188--\n180 who have sponsored the 7-year reauthorization bill introduced by \nMs. Waters, Ms. Moore, Mr. Heck, and myself--it is clear that a \nmajority of the House supports a long-term reauthorization of the \nExport-Import Bank.\n  Mr. Speaker, we should act. We should act now before we find \nourselves at the eleventh hour, before the June 30 deadline. Now, we \nhave just seen shutting down the security apparatus to protect America \nfor a couple of days. Let's not put at risk the economic security of \nour country.\n  Governors of both parties from across the country have written in \nsupport of taking action. Business leaders, the Chamber of Commerce, \nand organizations like the National Association of Manufacturers have \nall asked Congress to reauthorize the bank. There are now just 13 \nlegislative days until the deadline by which we must do so.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask our Speaker, I ask our majority leader, let the \nHouse work its will and vote on a multiyear reauthorization that will \nrestore certainty for thousands of small businesses. Help them compete \nin new markets. Support the growth of good jobs here in our country, \nand contribute to deficit reduction. There will be a lot of debate next \nweek about jobs. The Speaker believes that we will lose jobs if we \ndon't pass the Export-Import Bank reauthorization.\n  Mr. Speaker, Mr. Leader, bring the Export-Import Bank reauthorization \nbill to the floor. It will pass. It will be good for America. It will \nbe good for Americans. It will be good for our economy. Pass this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/03/house-section/article/H3765-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3765-H3766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               REFOCUSING ON THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nAlabama (Mrs. Roby) for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, this week marks 1 year since the Veterans \nAffairs Secretary, Eric Shinseki, resigned amid a scandal that shook \nthis country to its core. When President Obama reluctantly accepted \nSecretary Shinseki's resignation, he had a lot to say about his \ncommitment to fix the VA and where the buck stops. He said: ``We're \ngoing to do right by our veterans across the board, as along as it \ntakes.'' And then: ``This is my administration. I always take \nresponsibility for whatever happens.''\n  Well, Mr. Speaker, a lot has happened over the past year, and here \nare some of the highlights:\n  Last June, reports emerged that patient scheduling manipulation had \nbeen particularly egregious inside the central Alabama VA. During a \nmeeting to discuss these findings, the director of the central Alabama \nVA led me to believe that appropriate action had been taken to remove \nthe employees that were responsible for this. That wasn't true.\n  So I began to dig a little bit deeper into the problems, working with \nvery courageous whistleblowers and the press to uncover major instances \nof misconduct, negligence, and mismanagement inside the central Alabama \nVA. What we were able to expose was more than 1,000 patient x rays, \nsome showing problems, went missing for months and years. A \npulmonologist was called, not once but twice, for falsifying more than \n1,200 patient records but somehow given a satisfactory review. An \nemployee took a recovering veteran to a crack house, bought him drugs \nand prostitutes, all to extort his veteran's benefits. When caught, \nthat employee, as extraordinary as this is, was never fired. Not until \na year and a half later, when it was reported in the press and exposed \npublicly, did the VA take action.\n  What else happened last year? Congress passed a historic VA reform \nlaw providing unprecedented authority for holding employees \naccountable. The director of the central Alabama VA who lied to me \nbecame the first manager fired under the new reform law. Other managers \nwere also removed, and the southeast regional director quietly retired \nwhen an investigation into central Alabama VA was expanded at my \nrequest to include him.\n  So again, a lot has happened over the past year. But, Mr. Speaker, \nthere is a lot that hasn't happened over the past year.\n  Improvement to access for patient care, the one thing that we really \nneed for our veterans, hasn't happened. It really hasn't happened \nnationally, and certainly it hasn't happened in central Alabama. In \nfact, VA medical centers in Montgomery and Tuskegee were recently \nidentified number one and number two, respectively, the worst hospitals \nin the Nation for extended delays in patient appointment completions. \nThe first and the second worst hospitals in the country are in the \ncentral Alabama VA.\n  A workload report at the end of April showed that more than 6,500 \nconsults over 90 days were still pending, including more than half \nawaiting approval for non-VA care. So not enough improvement has \nhappened where it matters most for our veterans.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I didn't mention some of the \nprogress the central Alabama VA has made. What was a major staff \nshortage is beginning to be filled, and that includes the mental health \nside. I appreciate very much the new acting director of the region, Tom \nSmith, keeping me updated on the latest. I am grateful for him stepping \ninto this important role in a difficult situation, trying to rebuild, \ntrying to rebuild some of the trust that has been lost.\n  As I have told him, the progress isn't enough. One reason I believe \nit isn't enough is that Washington has demonstrated something of a \nshort attention span when it comes to these problems. We got their \nattention last year and a lot of nice promises have been made in terms \nof the national VA's commitment to improve in central Alabama, but once \nour problems leave the front page, there hasn't been sufficient follow-\nup. Mr. Speaker, maybe that is because we are depending on a broken \nbureaucracy to fix itself. Maybe it is because we have been asking VA \nleaders to intervene rather than requiring them to intervene. Maybe it \nis time that we change that.\n  You know, when a public school continues to fail to meet basic \nstandards, what happens? The State Department of Education comes in to \ntake over and\n\n[[Page H3766]]\n\nstart to turn the place around. It is a process that isn't pleasant, \nbut everyone from principals to teachers to students to parents, they \nunderstand the consequences of the failure of that school system to \nimprove. I believe that we need a similar mechanism at the VA when \nmedical centers continue to fail our veterans. That is why I am \npreparing legislation that will allow the Washington VA to do that.\n  My constituents, my veterans in Alabama, are getting the worst \nhealthcare services that this country could provide. They deserve \nbetter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/03/house-section/article/H3766-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TEXAS AND THE IMMIGRATION DEBATE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Gutierrez) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. What does that bumper sticker say? ``Don't mess with \nTexas.'' Well, I am about to not follow that advice.\n  You see, Texas has put itself front and center in the national debate \nover immigration and is leading the way among the 26 States suing the \nFederal Government to stop the lawful and sensible executive actions \nintroduced by the President. The court case that has gotten so much \nnational attention is Texas v. The United States.\n  The 25 other States with Republican Governors and attorneys general \nwho are suing the country play second fiddle to Texas. A week ago, in \nthe Fifth Circuit in New Orleans, a three-judge panel issued a split \ndecision. They did not issue a stay to the injunction of the \nPresident's executive actions imposed by a lower court, you guessed it, \nin Texas. Two out of three judges ruled that Texas would likely be \nfound to have standing to bring the lawsuit because Texas would have to \nissue more driver's licenses to long-term Texas residents.\n  Now, please note that we are not talking about free driver's \nlicenses. We are talking about driver's licenses at the same cost \neveryone else pays. As a matter of fact, they could raise the price of \nthe driver's licenses. Somehow, having more licensed drivers who can \ndrive legally in Texas and across the country and who know the rules of \nthe road is an unreasonable burden on the State of Texas, according to \nthe politicians who run the State.\n  So Texas is holding up the implementation of the program around the \ncountry for as many as 4 million people who live in American families. \nWho would these licensed drivers be? They would be immigrants who have \nU.S. citizen children. They would have lived and worked in American \nneighborhoods for years, shopped at the same grocery stores, and taken \ntheir kids to the same parks and schools as citizens do. They would \nhave submitted their fingerprints for a criminal background check at \ntheir own expense.\n  So while most Americans no longer believe we should be trying to \ndeport all 11 million undocumented immigrants, and especially not those \nwith deep roots in the U.S. with families, the politicians who run the \nState of Texas believe we should.\n  Lived in the U.S. for 5 years or more? 10? 15? Driving to work \nanyway? Own a business that employs citizens? Too bad. The Republican \nleaders in Texas do not want you to be able to work on the books, pay \nyour full share of local and Federal taxes, and pay for a driver's \nlicense so you could drive legally. No. That would be a burden.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  Reality and Texas should really get to know one another.\n  Now, let's remember that this is the same set of Texas politicians--\nincluding the Governor and some Republican Members of Congress--who are \nreluctant to tell some of their voters that no, in fact, President \nObama does not have a secret plan to use Walmart department stores as \ninternment camps for gunowners, which is the latest conspiracy theory \npromoted by Chuck Norris.\n  We can all get a chuckle about Operation Jade Helm--the alleged U.S. \nmilitary invasion of Texas--but it is not as funny when we begin to \nrealize that for many Republicans in the Republican Party in Texas, \ncrazy is a constituency that must be dealt with delicately.\n  So I want to end by speaking directly to the millions of families who \nare waiting for Texas politicians and judges to stop the delay tactics.\n  And I will use the language many of them speak and which God \nunderstands as well, or at least I assume he speaks Spanish because he \nnamed his only son Jesus.\n  I will summarize my remarks first in English.\n  The message is that we will not give up hope and cannot stop pushing \nfor the implementation of the President's executive actions just \nbecause politicians have prevented something important from happening--\nagain.\n  That is why I am inviting people in Chicago to join me on Saturday in \nLittle Village so we can renew our commitment to prepare ourselves for \nDACA and DAPA.\n  (English translation of the statement made in Spanish is as follows:)\n  Don't give up.\n  There are Republican politicians in Texas and elsewhere trying to \nblock our way towards implementation of DACA and DAPA and they want us \nto lose heart, lose patience, and lose our resolve.\n  But we must stay strong and prepare ourselves and our brothers and \nsisters and our neighbors to be ready when--eventually--the court rules \nin favor of America's immigrants.\n  I will continue fighting and I need your help. If you live in Chicago \ncome join us on Saturday morning in Little Village at Iglesia Santa \nInez de Bohemia.\n  And wherever you live, continue fighting and preparing your neighbors \nand yourselves to keep our families together and make sure we are not \ndeporting those who are assets to our country.\n  No se rinden!\n  Hay politicos republicanos en Tejas y en otros lugares tratando de \nbloquear nuestro camino hacia la implementacion de DACA y DAPA y \nquieren hacernos perder la esperanza, perder la paciencia y perder \nnuestra determinacion.\n  Pero hay que permanecer fuertes y preparandonos a nosotros mismos, a \nnuestros hermanos y hermanas y a nuestros vecinos para estar listos \ncuando la corte finalmente resuelva a favor del Presidente y de los \ninmigrantes en Estados Unidos.\n  Voy a seguir luchando y necesito su ayuda. Si usted vive en Chicago \nvenga y unase a nosotros el sabado en la manana en la Iglesia de Santa \nInes de Bohemia en La Villita.\n  Y dondequiera que ustedes vivan, sigan luchando y preparando a sus \nvecinos y a ustedes mismos para mantener a nuestras familias unidas y \nasegurarnos de que no estemos deportando aquellos que son un gran valor \na nuestro pais.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, our national military cemeteries are \nhallowed ground. And I ask my colleagues to agree and support my bill, \nH.R. 2490, Bertie's Respect for National Cemeteries Act.\n  On October 15, 1969, in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, a man named George \nEmery Siple shot and killed Bertha Smith, known to everyone as \n``Bertie.'' Siple was convicted of the murder and sentenced to life in \nprison without parole. Thirty years later, he died in prison. Because \nhe was a military veteran, he was buried in Indiantown Gap National \nCemetery in 1999.\n  He was buried there despite a Federal law that was passed in 1997. \nThat law said that veterans convicted of Federal or State capital \ncrimes are not permitted to be buried in Veterans Affairs national \ncemeteries or Arlington National Cemetery.\n  For Bertie Smith's family, this is a heart-wrenching situation that \nhas gone on for three decades. Jackie Katz, Bertie's daughter, has \ncalled it ``hell'' and a ``horror'' to live with the fact that George \nSiple was memorialized and buried with full military honors.\n  When I first began to look into this issue, it was clear to me that \nit was as frustrating as it was heartbreaking.\n  Back in 1997, led by our Pennsylvania Senators, Congress passed a law \nthat\n\n[[Page H3767]]\n\nsaid that veterans found guilty of capital crimes could not be buried \nin our national veterans cemeteries. At the time, you may remember, the \ncountry was still reeling from the Oklahoma City bombing. And veterans \neverywhere were justifiably appalled that Timothy McVeigh, a military \nveteran, could be buried with full military honors.\n  Now, McVeigh did not receive that burial. But a major problem we \ndiscovered was that the law was not actively enforced for others until \n2006.\n  Since then, the VA has relied on an ``honor system,'' which requires \nfamily members to willingly report their relative's criminal record.\n  In 2013, Congress once again sought to protect our VA national \ncemeteries by passing a law to explicitly allow the VA to remove \nveterans from cemeteries if they had been convicted of a Federal or \nState capital crime. However, this law does not extend to veterans \nburied between 1997 and 2013, a time period that includes George Emery \nSiple.\n  That is why I have introduced Bertie's Respect for National \nCemeteries Act. What this law will do is require Veterans Affairs to \ntake every reasonable action to ensure that a veteran is eligible to be \nburied, including searching public criminal records. It will clarify \nCongress' original intent by providing Veterans Affairs the explicit \nauthority to remove veterans convicted of capital crimes who were \nwrongly buried after 1997. And it will specifically provide for the \nremoval of George Emery Siple from Indiantown Gap National Cemetery.\n  This bill really only reaffirms what Congress intended in the first \nplace. And it enjoys the support of the Veterans of Foreign Wars.\n  There were precedents for the removal of convicted murderers from \nveterans cemeteries--from Arlington National Cemetery and VA cemeteries \nin Michigan and Oregon, to name just a few.\n  Additionally, nothing in the bill would withdraw previous military \nhonors, such as Purple Hearts or medals for valor, otherwise earned by \nthe deceased veterans.\n  The discussion of military veterans who have been convicted of murder \noften raises the issue of mental health treatment and posttraumatic \nstress disorder. There is no question that PTSD is a real condition \naffecting many servicemen and -women, and I have always stood for \nfunding the evaluation and treatment of those who may be afflicted.\n  That said, those who have been convicted of capital murder by our \njudicial system have been declared guilty of the worst offense \npossible, and any mitigating factors would have been considered at \ntrial and sentencing.\n  I don't think it is too much to say that murderers should not be \nburied next to true American heroes. And the memories of victims like \nBertie Smith should not be disregarded.\n  I ask my colleagues for their support in saying that real, true honor \nreally means something in our national military cemeteries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/03/house-section/article/H3767-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   HONORING OFFICER GREGG BENNER OF THE RIO RANCHO POLICE DEPARTMENT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New \nMexico (Mr. Ben Ray Lujan) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BEN RAY LUJAN of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor \nOfficer Gregg Benner of the Rio Rancho Police Department, who was \nkilled in the line of duty on May 25.\n  I offer my heartfelt condolences to the family and loved ones of \nOfficer Benner as they mourn the loss of a husband, father, \ngrandfather, and friend who was taken from them far too soon.\n  Officer Benner dedicated his life to protecting his community and his \ncountry. From his career in the United States Air Force to his last 4 \nyears serving as a member of the Rio Rancho Police Department, Officer \nBenner put his health and safety on the line to make us safer.\n  The same was true last week. When most of us were settling down after \na long Memorial Day weekend with family and friends, Officer Benner was \ndoing his duty to protect the people of Rio Rancho. When he didn't \nreturn that evening, Officer Benner left behind a legacy of valor of \nservice.\n  The loss of any police officer is a painful reminder of the dangers \nthat they face each and every day. While we are shaken by Officer \nBenner's loss, we can take comfort in the memories that he left behind \nfor all who knew him and the example that he set for all those in the \ncommunity.\n  Rio Rancho is a tight-knit community, and while a tragedy such as \nthis is unexpected and shocking, the response has brought out the best \nof its residents, who have displayed an outpouring of support and \nsympathy. My thoughts and prayers are with Officer Benner's family, \nfriends, fellow officers, and the entire Rio Rancho community, and I \nhope that they find peace in this most difficult time.\n  Officer Benner, thank you for your service, and may you rest in \npeace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/03/house-section/article/H3767-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3767-H3768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           STUDENT LOAN DEBT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTennessee (Mr. Duncan) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, costs simply explode on \nanything that the Federal Government subsidizes because there are \nsimply not the same incentives or pressures to hold down costs as there \nare in the private sector.\n  Over the last several weeks, many thousands of young people have \ngraduated from our colleges and universities burdened with sizable \nstudent loan debts.\n  It shocks the students of today when I tell them that tuition cost \nonly $90 a quarter my freshman year at the University of Tennessee in \n1965-66--$270 for a whole school year. I once heard House Minority Whip \nSteny Hoyer say it cost only $87 a semester when he started at the \nUniversity of Maryland.\n  Students today think the Federal student loan program is one of the \nbest things that ever happened to them. Actually, it may be one of the \nworst. Until that program started in the mid-1960s, college tuition and \nfees went up very slowly, roughly at the rate of inflation.\n  After the Federal Government decided to ``help'' students and start \nsubsidizing these costs, tuition and fees started going up three or \nfour times the rate of inflation almost every year.\n  Last year, columnist Kathleen Parker wrote in The Washington Post \nthat since 1985, the cost of higher education has increased 538 \npercent, while the Consumer Price Index--inflation--over the same \nperiod has gone up 121 percent.\n  Colleges and universities were able to tamp down opposition to fee \nincreases by telling students not to worry, they could just borrow the \nmoney.\n  When I was an undergraduate at UT and later in law school at George \nWashington, students could work part time, as I always did, and pay all \ntheir college expenses. No one got out of school with a debt because of \ntuition and fees. Now almost everyone does.\n  Now, 40 million Americans owe money on student loans. Outstanding \nstudent loan debts now total over $1.3 trillion. Some analysts think it \nmay be a bubble about to burst.\n  Floyd Norris, writing in the International New York Times, said: \n``Student loans are creating large problems that may persist for \ndecades. They will impoverish some borrowers and serve as a drain on \neconomic activity.''\n  Hedge fund manager James Altucher wrote that ``we're graduating a \ngeneration of indentured students.''\n  Ohio University economist Richard Vedder several years ago wrote a \nbook entitled, ``Going Broke by Degree.''\n  Richard Vedder, in an article last August, wrote that ``a political \nstorm is brewing in Washington over the consequences of rising college \ncosts.'' He added that ``the biggest single cause of this financial \nproblem, and a contributor to many other weaknesses in our economy, is \nthe dysfunctional, Byzantine system of Federal financial assistance for \ncollege students.''\n  Mr. Vedder pointed out that before the late 1970s, Federal financial \naid programs for colleges were modest in size, and tuition went up an \naverage of only 1 percent above the inflation rate.\n  ``Since 1978,'' he wrote, ``in an era of rapidly growing Federal \nfinancial assistance programs, annual tuition increases have been 3 to \n4 percent a year beyond the inflation rate.''\n  In 1987, William Bennett, the Secretary of Education, said: \n``Increases in\n\n[[Page H3768]]\n\nfinancial aid have enabled colleges and universities to raise their \ntuition, confident that Federal loan subsidies will help cushion the \nincrease.''\n  From 1939-1964, Federal student aid--mainly the GI bill--averaged \njust 2.5 percent of university spending.\n  From 2002-2014, Federal student loan aid spending averaged a whopping \n33 percent of university spending.\n  Several things, Mr. Speaker, could and should be done to start \nhelping solve this problem.\n  First, Federal and State legislators, parents, and even students \nthemselves should speak out against tuition increases higher than the \nrate of inflation.\n  Secondly, colleges and universities that hold these increases down, \nor hopefully someday even lower their costs, should be given priority \nand rewarded in Federal and State grants and appropriations.\n  Third, the Congress and State legislatures should hold hearings that \nfeature people who have been victimized by taking on heavy student loan \ndebts at the start of their careers.\n  Fourth, every college or university that receives Federal money--99.9 \npercent--should be required to give financial counseling or at least \nsome type of simple, easy-to-understand document to every person \nreceiving a student loan warning about potential problems.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  Lastly, but most important of all, Federal and State governments \nshould give incentives to schools that require professors to teach \nclasses rather than writing for obscure journals or doing esoteric \nresearch that produces no tangible results.\n  Too many professors have lost their desire to teach. They seem to \nthink 6 hours a week is heavy load. The result is that too many \nstudents cannot get the classes they need to graduate, and it is now \ntaking 5 or 6 years to get a 4-year degree.\n  This is a very serious, fast-growing problem, Mr. Speaker, that needs \nmajor reforms sooner rather than later.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/03/house-section/article/H3768-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PRIORITIZING ONLINE THREAT ENFORCEMENT ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nMassachusetts (Ms. Clark) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, imagine waking up every \nmorning with the dread that you will face hundreds of violent threats \nas soon as you get to work.\n  Imagine that, while you are in your office, people threaten to \nsexually assault you, and they know where you live, when you are home, \nand who your family members are. Maybe they even show you the weapon \nthey will use in the future to harm you. We would never tolerate this \nin our offices, but this is a daily reality for women online.\n  Right now, millions of women and girls are online, navigating their \npersonal and professional lives; yet women will be targeted with the \nmost severe types of online threats and harassment at a rate 27 times \nhigher than that of men. Although these threats occur online, there is \nnothing virtual about their devastating impacts on women's lives.\n  Meet Jessica Valenti, a journalist who founded a site that features \ntopics like women in the media, women's health, and LGBT rights. The \nprice Jessica pays for creating this forum and expressing a feminist \npoint of view on the Internet is an unrelenting barrage of rape and \ndeath threats.\n  After threats forced her to leave her home, to change her bank \naccounts, and to change her phone number, she contacted the FBI. The \nFBI advised her to never walk outside by herself and to leave her home \nuntil the threats blow over. The threats continue today, 4 years later.\n  In Pennsylvania, a women described her terror after her abuser \nannounced on Facebook that he planned to tie her up, put her in a \ntrunk, pull out her teeth one by one, and then her nails, chop her into \npieces, but keep her alive long enough to feel the pain.\n  Then there is the story of my constituent, Brianna Wu, a video game \ndeveloper who had to flee her home with her family in the middle of the \nnight after specific threats to rape and to kill her and her husband. \nHer online attackers released her home address and described in graphic \ndetail the acts of violence they were planning.\n  Another woman moved nine times in an 18-month period out of fear of \nonline threats. She moved across the country and changed her job four \ntimes just to stay safe.\n  None of the people who made these threats has been prosecuted, and \nmost of the examples I have of online threats that women, including \nmyself, have received are too vile and obscene to share on the House \nfloor. In Jessica Valenti's words: ``When people say you should be \nraped and killed for years on end, it takes a toll on your soul.''\n  For Jessica and Brianna and other victims of severe threats online, \nthere are huge financial and professional impacts. They have lost work \nopportunities and have spent money on legal advice, protective \nservices, and temporary housing.\n  They have had to pay to have their personal information scrubbed from \nWeb sites. This is a significant price to pay just to remain an active \nparticipant of an online economy.\n  What has been our response? In a 3-year period, of an estimated 2.5 \nmillion cyber stalking cases, only 10 were federally prosecuted. A \njudge in Massachusetts recently told one victim who works in technology \nand has suffered terrifying threats from an ex-boyfriend to simply go \noffline.\n  When I asked the FBI about the investigation and prosecution of \nonline violence against women, they told me it is not a priority. By \nfailing to address the realities of changing technology and a changing \neconomy, we are failing these women.\n  It is not okay to call this an Internet problem. It is not okay to \nsay to women that this is just the way things are. It is not okay to \ntell women to change their behavior, to withhold their opinions, and to \nstay off the Internet altogether, just to avoid severe threats.\n  For decades, women who have been victims of sexual assault and abuse \nhave been told they have provoked their abusers by what they wore or \nwhat they have said. We have worked hard to change that culture; yet, \nby not taking these cases seriously, we send a clear message that, when \nwomen express opinions online, they are asking for it.\n  That is why I am calling on the Department of Justice to enforce the \nlaws that are already on the books and take these investigations and \nprosecutions seriously. The Prioritizing Online Threat Enforcement Act \nwould give the Department of Justice and the FBI the resources and the \nmandate to investigate and enforce the Federal laws on cyber threats.\n  It is not Congress' job to police the Internet, but we have a \nresponsibility to make sure that women are able to fully participate in \nour economy. I urge my colleagues to support this crucial bill.\n  Let's keep the Internet open and safe for all voices.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/03/house-section/article/H3768-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3768-H3769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  FUNDING THE STRATOSPHERIC OBSERVATORY FOR INFRARED ASTRONOMY PROGRAM\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Knight) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KNIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I want to first thank the House \nAppropriations Committee for fully funding the Stratospheric \nObservatory for Infrared Astronomy, SOFIA, program.\n  The SOFIA program is something that is stationed in my district. It \nis a 747 airplane with a 100-inch telescope in the back. Some people \nask why we would need this or why this is something that NASA is so \nexcited about. It is because we have certain programs that are in the \natmosphere, and on the ground today, many of them have restrictions, \nbut SOFIA doesn't. SOFIA does things that other telescopes just can't \ndo.\n  First, it flies at 40,000 feet, so it gets above the water vapor. \nThat is something that we just can't do from the ground. We can't do \nthat type of science, those observations--we just can't do it--yet \nSOFIA does something that many other telescopes can't do.\n  It does something that the Hubble can't do. It does something that \nour beloved James Webb Space Telescope, which is going to be launched \nin the next couple of years, cannot do. It\n\n[[Page H3769]]\n\nlands, and we can upgrade it. If there is something new in 2015, we can \nput it on SOFIA. SOFIA can take off. We can do our projects, and we can \ndo our experiments. It can land. If we have something new in 2016, we \ncan do the same thing and so on and so forth.\n  For the next 20 years, we will be flying SOFIA if this Congress \ncontinues to fund it. Last year, SOFIA was on the chopping block, and \nwithout the good leadership of our majority leader, it might have gone \naway.\n  What I wanted to bring to everyone's attention is, if we are going to \nfund NASA, if we are going to fund projects for our new generation, if \nwe are going to explore, if we are going to do all of the things that \nmake America great and that make America the exploration country that \nwe have been for the last 100-plus years, then we have to invest a \nlittle bit.\n  When the administration threatened to shut down SOFIA in fiscal year \n2015, Congress showed strong support to make sure that SOFIA would \ncontinue; but, as we move forward, we understand what these types of \nprojects bring.\n  As I look into the crowd, I see an awful lot of young folks who have \neither visited Washington, D.C., or they are on a tour, or they are \ndoing something. That is what SOFIA brings. Every year, we put fifth \nand sixth and seventh grade teachers in SOFIA for a 9- or 10-hour \nmission.\n  They get to work with NASA. They get to work with scientists from \nAmerica and from Germany because this is a joint project, and they get \nto see what projects and what experiments NASA is doing. They also get \nto work with NASA hand in hand.\n  They get to bring that back to the classroom, and they get to teach \ntheir fifth through seventh grade students about astronomy, about \nlearning, about new planets, about new stars, about dying stars, about \nnew solar systems. They take that at a practical level not just what is \nin the book, but what they learn, what they see, and what they do with \nNASA itself.\n  Also, I greatly appreciate the language that the committee included \nin the report accompanying the fiscal year 2016 Commerce, Justice, \nScience Appropriations bill, which reaffirms our support for SOFIA and \nrejects NASA's plan to conduct a senior review of the mission at such a \npremature stage.\n  If we are going to look at what SOFIA and other projects from NASA \ndo, we have to allow them to bring us some real data. That data takes \ntime. If we are going to do that on a 1- or 2-year status and then, \nmaybe, cancel a project, then all of the money that we have injected \ninto this project will be for naught.\n  Given that SOFIA achieved full operating status just this last year, \nin 2014, it has been designed for a lifespan of up to, like I said, 20 \nyears. A senior review should not be at a 2-year stand, but it should \ngo to a 5- or an 8-year stand so that we can collect the data and make \nsure that this program is worth the money the taxpayers spend on it.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nbecause they have supported this project just like they have supported \nmany projects for NASA and for our experiment community.\n  Without the support from both sides of the aisle, it is really going \nto be difficult for America to continue to be the leader in space \nexploration and exploration abroad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/03/house-section/article/H3769-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n IMPROVING TREATMENT OF U.S. TERRITORIES UNDER FEDERAL HEALTH PROGRAMS \n                                  ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPuerto Rico (Mr. Pierluisi) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PIERLUISI. Mr. Speaker, today, I am introducing a comprehensive \nbill to improve the treatment of Puerto Rico and the other territories \nunder Medicaid, traditional Medicare, and Medicare Advantage.\n  This is the first time that a Member of Congress has filed \nlegislation to address the range of challenges that patients, \nphysicians, hospitals, and insurance providers in the territories face \nas a result of the unequal treatment the territories receive under \nFederal health programs.\n  The bill serves as a blueprint for policymakers in identifying the \nvarious problems that exist under current Federal law and in proposing \nfair, realistic, and technically precise solutions to each problem.\n  Based on my conversations with congressional leaders and officials in \nthe Obama administration, I believe there is bipartisan recognition \nthat Federal health laws do not do justice to American citizens living \nin the territories.\n  I recognize that Republicans and Democrats have different opinions \nregarding the virtues of the Affordable Care Act, but it is my hope \nthat policymakers can agree that it is in the national interest to take \nconcrete steps to eliminate or reduce the numerous disparities that the \nterritories confront under Medicaid and Medicare. These inequalities \nwere enshrined in law long before 2010 and remain in place today.\n  Stated simply, if the will exists among officials in the legislative \nand executive branches to improve the treatment of the territories \nunder Federal health programs, as I believe it does, then my bill \nprovides a way forward. After today, no Federal policymaker can say: I \nwant to help, but I don't know how.\n  Rather than summarizing the bill's 16 sections, I will highlight the \nprovisions relating to Medicaid, the program for low-income \nindividuals, which is jointly funded by the Federal Government and each \nState or territory government.\n  In the States, there is no limit on Federal funding for Medicaid as \nlong as the State provides its share of matching funds. The Federal \ncontribution, known as an FMAP, can range from 50 percent for the \nwealthiest States to over 80 percent for the poorest States.\n  By contrast, the funding that the Federal Government provides for \nMedicaid in each territory is capped. When I took office in 2009, \nPuerto Rico's cap was only $260 million a year, and the Federal \nGovernment was covering less than 20 percent of the cost of the \nterritory's Medicaid Program.\n  During my tenure, the Federal Government has increased Medicaid \nfunding for the territories, but that funding remains capped. \nEspecially in the case of Puerto Rico, it is still profoundly \ninequitable. Most problematic, this funding expires in 2019, and in \nPuerto Rico, it will be depleted well before then.\n  This funding cliff is unique to the territories. The bill I am filing \ntoday would avert this cliff and provide a more stable and equitable \nlevel of Medicaid funding for the territories. Starting in fiscal year \n2017, the bill would provide the territories with State-like treatment \nwithin well-defined parameters.\n\n                              {time}  1100\n\n  Specifically, each territory's Medicaid program could cover \nindividuals whose family income is at or below the Federal poverty \nlevel. As long as a territory covers individuals within these income \nlimits, the Federal Government would fund the territory's Medicaid \nprogram as if it were a State Medicaid program. The annual funding caps \nwould be eliminated, and each territory would receive an FMAP based on \nits per capita income. However, the limiting principle is that if a \nterritory wants to cover individuals earning above the Federal poverty \nlevel, it will generally be required to use territory dollars, not \nFederal dollars.\n  The rationale behind this new proposal is simple. Residents of the \nterritories are American citizens. At the very least, the Federal \nGovernment should provide each territory with the funding necessary to \nprovide health coverage to their residents who live at or below the \nFederal poverty level. Anything less is unacceptable from a moral and \npublic policy standpoint.\n  I invite my colleagues to support this comprehensive bill and to work \nwith me to enact its provisions into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/03/house-section/article/H3769-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3769-H3770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      RECOGNIZING JESSE HILL AND DELAWARE VALLEY VIETNAM VETERANS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, for decades Vietnam veteran and \nLevittown, Bucks County, resident Jesse Hill has dedicated himself to \npreserving the memory of those lost in Vietnam and bringing awareness \nto those still missing.\n\n[[Page H3770]]\n\n  In Vietnam, Jesse served with distinction with the Army 1st Cavalry \nDivision for two tours of duty between 1967 and 1969, when he earned a \nPurple Heart for his service and his personal sacrifice. Upon returning \nhome, he became a founding member of the Delaware Valley Vietnam \nVeterans, or DV3, as they call themselves.\n  Today, Jesse continues to recognize the service and sacrifice of all \nwho fought and fell in that war and others since, especially Iraq and \nAfghanistan, through the Donald W. Jones Flag Memorial. Named after a \nfellow cofounder, Jesse's leadership has sustained this impressive \ndisplay for 30 years. The Flag Memorial has been located in various \nsites across Bucks County over the years, including the Washington \nCrossing Historic Park, Core Creek Park, Silver Lake Park, and now at \nFalls Township Community Park, where it draws an annual crowd of \nthousands of veterans and grateful community members.\n  Having participated in planting flags at this powerful memorial with \nmembers of my staff for several years, I am always humbled by the \nsacrifice that each flag represents and grateful for Jesse's commitment \nto remembering those we have lost in conflict.\n  I thank Jesse and all the members of the Delaware Valley Vietnam \nVeterans for their continued work and support of the veterans in our \nregion and their service to our Nation and our community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/03/house-section/article/H3770-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        WATERS OF THE U.S. RULE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Iowa \n(Mr. Young) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in opposition \nto the recently finalized waters of the U.S. rule.\n  Documents show that the EPA crafted the waters of the U.S. rule \nbehind closed doors, leaving no seat at the table for farmers, business \nleaders, county and State officials, homebuilders, livestock producers, \nranchers, and many others who are concerned by this Federal overreach, \nand it affects their lives.\n  Everybody wants clean water--let's all be on the record for that--but \nwe need to respect this process. Stakeholders should have been \nconsulted. The people whose lives are affected by this rule should have \nbeen consulted. The EPA's final rule is flawed, and despite attempts by \nCongress, it is not an improvement over the proposed rule.\n  The rule still requires farmers and ranchers to get permits for \nactivities on their own land. On their own land. The rule still expands \nthe waters under the EPA's jurisdiction. The rule still hurts \nmanufacturers and States and counties looking to expand economic \ndevelopment projects and looking to expand opportunity.\n  This rule remains flawed and should be thrown out. I urge Members of \nCongress to support efforts to stop this job-killing, farm-killing rule \nthat invites lawsuits instead of real solutions. I urge my colleagues \nin the House and Senate to support efforts to create a new rule that \nwill truly improve water quality for all Americans and put stakeholders \nin the process and respect private property.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/03/house-section/article/H3770-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRAGIC FLOODING IN CENTRAL TEXAS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Fitzpatrick). The Chair recognizes the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Farenthold) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, over the Memorial Day weekend, the \ncommunities of central Texas suffered a terrible tragedy after heavy \nrains and powerful storms hit the Lone Star State, resulting in the \ndeaths of 24 people, including a number from Corpus Christi and the \ndistrict that I represent.\n  Though I don't represent Hays County, where some of the major \nflooding happened and one of the hardest hit parts of the State, nearby \nCaldwell and Bastrop Counties are in the 27th District of Texas, and I \nhave pledged my help to the entire area in every way possible.\n  Immediately after the floods, I visited the Bastrop County Emergency \nOperations Center and have been in contact with leaders throughout the \ndistrict to help in the recovery and aid efforts and to make sure that \nthe resources are available and that we are looking for ways to improve \nour response and readiness in the future.\n  But, you know, it wasn't just tragedy that I saw during this. It was \nnot just devastation. I also saw the hope and spirit of a community \nthat came together in aid and rescue efforts. I was moved, touched, and \ninspired by what I saw.\n  Hundreds of volunteers, including my wife Debbie, joined emergency \npersonnel and law enforcement folks to help however possible. Debbie \ncame home with stories of hundreds of people who drove over 3 hours \nfrom Corpus Christi to search for some of the victims who were from \nCorpus Christi, including my daughter's elementary and middle school \ntutor, who perished in the flood.\n  Despite this tragedy, it is amazing how people came together in the \nspirit of America and how it showed through. This gives me hope for the \nentire country, and it makes me proud to be an American.\n  At the request of a constituent, I will also be working with local \nofficials to investigate how we can make our emergency notification \nsystems better and how it can make sure people have access to accurate \nand timely disaster information so we can prevent tragedies like this \nin the future.\n  Obviously, we can't stop Mother Nature, but we can be prepared. We \ncan make sure the public has the information they need to keep \nthemselves safe, and we can help those devastated by these sorts of \ntragedies.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and everyone join me in continuing to \npray for the victims of these floods and these tragedies, their \nfriends, their families, and the volunteers who gave so selflessly of \ntheir time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/03/house-section/article/H3770-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

But we owe every veteran from D-day to today \nmore.\n  We should remove the expiration dates in the GI bill so that veterans \nhave access to education and training at any point in their career. We \nshould pass an infrastructure plan with a preference for hiring \nveterans in the building and construction trades. We should help \nveterans keep medical appointments by providing child care at the VA \nclinics. And we should make sure that our veterans hospitals are state-\nof-the-art facilities.\n  Mr. Speaker, this weekend I will join all Americans and remember our \nsoldiers who fought on D-day.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to remember and celebrate a \nwonderful public servant from Bloomington, Minnesota, Arlene Bush.\n  Arlene Bush served on the Bloomington School Board for 33 years and \nvolunteered for many more. But the longevity of Arlene's service is \njust part of the story. Arlene was known for the kindness she showed to \neveryone whom she interacted with.\n  Superintendent of Bloomington Public Schools Les Fujitake remembered \nhow Arlene always approached decisions that the school board faced by \nasking, ``What is best for the children?'' Arlene was a fixture at \nschool events and at the annual Congressional Art Competition in \nBloomington. In fact, she often took the time to tag along with me when \nI visited schools.\n  Arlene's positive, kind, and supportive spirit was contagious to \nthose around her. Her legacy will be remembered far beyond the \nBloomington School Board meeting room and the Minnesota School Boards \nAssociation award that bears her name.\n  My condolences go out to Arlene's family, to the Bloomington Public \nSchools, and to the entire Bloomington community who mourn the loss of \nArlene but who celebrate a wonderful public servant.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/03/house-section/article/H3772-5", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            HIRE A HERO ACT\n\n  (Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to \nsupport an important initiative.\n  We celebrate and show honor to our veterans, fallen servicemembers, \nand those in the Armed Forces during Memorial Day and Veterans Day, and \nthen in some respects we go on about our business.\n  Those veterans and the men and women in the National Guard and Ready \nReserve need our continued support. We do that through health care, \neducational initiatives, and other ways. We must do it as well to \nsupport them economically with jobs.\n  Too many American servicemembers remain unemployed. Although the \noverall veteran unemployment rate has dropped in recent years, the rate \nof unemployment among our post-9/11 veterans is 7.2 percent.\n  As our economy continues to improve, we must be sure that those who \nfight to defend this country are not left behind. The men and women who \nserve in the National Guard and Reserve are highly trained, well-\nqualified individuals who add tremendous value to our employer's \nworkforce.\n  Let's make it easier for those employers--and even incentivize them--\nto bring the men and women who continue to serve in the National Guard \nand Reserve on their payroll. Through the Hire A Hero Act, H.R. 2457, \nemployers would receive a tax incentive to hire our National Guardsmen \nand Reservists. This would support small businesses by providing them \nwith highly skilled workers and assist our great men and women.\n  Please join me in supporting the Hire A Hero Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/03/house-section/article/H3772-6", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3772-H3773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ENDING ALZHEIMER'S\n\n  (Mr. GUINTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. GUINTA.

These facilities are a \nplace of comfort and familiarity for thousands of men and women and \ntheir families.\n  The Veteran Wellness Act will expand upon what these organizations \nare currently doing and create a greater number of opportunities for \nveterans to access wellness programs and therapies.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is our responsibility to be there for our Nation's \nheroes as they begin transitioning back to civilian life.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and Congressman Ryan in supporting \nthis bipartisan bill.

Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, the Rules Committee met and \nreported a rule, H. Res. 288, providing for the consideration of a very \nimportant piece of legislation, H.R. 2289, the Commodity End-User \nRelief Act.\n  The rule provides for the consideration of H.R. 2289 under a \nstructured rule and makes five amendments in order--two Democrat and \ntwo Republican, as well as one bipartisan amendment--allowing for a \nbalanced debate on these important issues.\n  H.R. 2289 is essential to the smooth functioning of the American \neconomy and is long overdue for an enactment into law. This important \nlegislation will reauthorize the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, \nalso known as the CFTC, which had its statutory authority lapse in \nSeptember of 2013.\n  The House passed, with strong bipartisan support, a very similar \nversion of this legislation on June 24 of last year. Unfortunately, the \nSenate failed to take up the House-passed bill despite its strong \nbipartisan support in the House, leading us to reconsider this \nlegislation again today.\n  After the financial crisis of 2008, almost everyone agreed that \nchanges needed to be made to our financial services sector in order to \nprotect our economy and prevent another crisis in the future. Like many \nof my colleagues, I have concerns with some of the reforms that were \ninstituted in response to this financial calamity because they have put \noverly burdensome restrictions on our business communities.\n  However, it is important to note that this legislation keeps intact \nthe overarching reforms made in title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act. Every \nwitness who appeared in front of the Agriculture Committee was \nsupportive of the clearing, margining, and execution requirements that \nare the heart of title VII; yet, like every major comprehensive law--\nand this was very comprehensive--there are always unintended \nconsequences that need to be addressed, and H.R. 2289 does just that.\n  For example, the authors of Dodd-Frank would likely argue the law's \nmain purpose is to reduce systemic risk to the economy. However, I \ndon't think anyone would argue that farmers, who are simply trying to \nlock in a good price for their corn or for their wheat, are a systemic \nrisk to our economy.\n  It is just as restaurant chains that are looking to make sure they \nhave enough beef or pork or potatoes to sell to their patrons also do \nnot pose a systemic risk. Utility companies that are seeking to ensure \nthat they have enough power to meet the needs and demands of their \ncustomers did not cause the financial crisis.\n  Unfortunately, though, the current law imposes rules that treat all \nof these entities as major risks to our economy, and it imposes overly \nburdensome capital and paperwork requirements on them.\n  Mr. Speaker, critics may claim this bill undermines consumer \nprotections. However, this could not be further from the truth. Title I \nof H.R. 2289 puts in place greater consumer protections, like requiring \nbrokerage firms to notify investors before moving funds from one \naccount to another in order to prevent abuses like those that occurred \nat MF Global prior to its bankruptcy.\n  It would also require firms that become undercapitalized to \nimmediately report to regulators and work with them to restore adequate \ncapital and financial security. These title I provisions are \ncommonsense reforms that will protect consumers.\n  Title II would make reforms to the CFTC itself, such as strengthening \nthe cost-benefit analysis the CFTC must perform when considering the \nimpacts of its rules and appointing a chief economist to assist with \ncompiling and analyzing financial data.\n  Critics may claim that requiring cost-benefit analyses will open up \nthe CFTC to lawsuits, which could be costly. However, such critics also \nignore the endless cycle of the proposal and reproposals of rules that \nare rushed, poorly conceived, and unworkable.\n  This work requires the CFTC to waste staff time and Commission funds \nto redraft rules or to provide workarounds for impacted parties. This \nrequirement merely gives the CFTC a standard for writing good rules the \nfirst time that will benefit our economy and the users.\n  Title II would also require the CFTC to take steps to invest in IT to \nprotect sensitive market data against cyber attacks, a very real issue \ngiven the recent breaches we have seen at the IRS and at various \nnational retailers. Most importantly, this section reauthorizes the \nCFTC until 2019, which has been operating without our authorization, to \nspend money for a year and a half.\n  Title III now gets to the heart of what I mentioned earlier, \nproviding relief to the end users or the farmers, the restaurants, the \nmanufacturers, the utilities, and other entities that rely on a steady \nsupply of commodities that have been caught up in the unintended \nconsequences of Dodd-Frank's reforms.\n  These users have a genuine need to use markets to hedge against bad \nweather, natural disasters, inflation, price shocks, and other \nunforeseen circumstances that could jeopardize their ability to serve \ntheir customers. These entities inherently want to avoid risk and, \nthus, shouldn't be subjected to the same requirements as financial and \ninvestment entities.\n  Mr. Speaker, title III of H.R. 2289 makes significant reforms to aid \nthese end users, such as preventing utility companies from being \ninappropriately classified as ``financial entities'' and being treated \nlike banks under the law.\n  It exempts end users who are not otherwise regulated by the CFTC from \nhaving to keep records of every email, phone call, fax, or letter with \nregard to every trade, a huge recordkeeping burden. It would prevent \nnonbank swap dealers from having to hold more capital than banks do, \nwhich would put them at an unfair disadvantage in the market.\n\n[[Page H3775]]\n\n  Additionally, this section would allow end users operating in rarely \ntraded markets not to have to disclose trade data, which can be a \nserious disadvantage if they must publicly show all of their trading \npartners what they are buying and selling.\n  Title III would also require the CFTC to determine if the rules for \nforeign swaps are equivalent to U.S. rules and create a workable system \nof substituted compliance for market participants whose activity \ncrosses multiple jurisdictions. This would ensure that businesses which \ntrade internationally do not have to comply with two sets of divergent \nrules.\n  Mr. Speaker, the most important thing to remember about H.R. 2289 is \nthat the farmer who grows the food that you eat for dinner did not \ncause the financial crisis, neither did the people you buy your \nelectricity from or the people who provided the wood for your desk or \nthe metal used in your car. I do not know of any reason we should \ncontinue to treat them as if they did, which is what the current law \ndoes, and it is what H.R. 2289 is seeking to correct.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a good, straightforward rule, allowing for the \nconsideration of important legislation that will help grow our economy. \nI support its adoption, and I urge my colleagues to support the rule \nand the underlying bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n\n  (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I thank the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Newhouse) \nfor the customary 30 minutes.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this rule and to the \nunderlying legislation.\n  Since my friends on the other side of the aisle have assumed the \nmajority, they have made it their mission to undermine the Dodd-Frank \nAct and hamstring the ability of our regulators to put in place strong \nrules to prevent another financial crisis, and this legislation is no \nexception.\n  H.R. 2289 reauthorizes the Commodity Futures Trading Commission \nthrough 2019 while making substantial changes to the CFTC's internal \noperations and rolling back key Dodd-Frank provisions intended to \nstrengthen our financial regulatory framework.\n  I have specific concerns with the new cost-benefit requirements \nimposed in title II of the legislation. The CFTC already conducts cost-\nbenefit analyses on its rulemakings, and this provision could \nsignificantly slow down the rulemaking process while also creating \nopenings that will put the CFTC at the risk of increased litigation.\n  Title II of H.R. 2289 also proposes several unnecessary changes to \nthe Commission's internal operations that can make it more difficult to \nmanage the agency.\n  According to CFTC Chairman Massad, the provisions contained in title \nII could weaken the Commission's ability to respond in a timely and \neffective manner. For example, if these measures were currently in \nplace, it would have made it more difficult for the agency to \npositively respond over the past 10 months to concerns raised by market \nparticipants. Also included in this bill are substantial changes to \nrulemakings taking place at the Commission under the Dodd-Frank Act.\n  I am particularly concerned by the cross-border language contained in \nthe bill, which will undercut the efforts already underway by the \nCommission to negotiate on an international system of safe and robust \nderivative rules that are necessary to apply to the global derivatives \nmarket.\n  H.R. 2289 requires the CFTC to create a rule that will automatically \nallow U.S. banks and foreign banks conducting business in the U.S. to \ndo so under the rules imposed by foreign jurisdictions, all of which \nare currently more lenient than our own. We have seen this kind of race \nto the bottom before, and we all know how it ends.\n  Worse yet, Mr. Speaker, is that this legislation hamstrings an agency \nthat is already woefully underfunded. The Congressional Budget Office \nestimates that the CFTC will need 30 additional personnel annually to \nhandle the increased workload imposed by both the new cost-benefit \nanalysis requirements and the mandated cross-border rule contained in \nthis legislation.\n  Will my friends on the other side of the aisle provide the necessary \nfunding increases to the CFTC to carry out these requirements? I doubt \nit.\n  Dodd-Frank significantly expanded the CFTC's role in overseeing our \nfinancial markets, and they have already completed over 80 percent of \ntheir required rulemakings, the best rate of any financial regulator. \nThey have done so despite the fact that Congress has not done its part \nto provide the agency with the resources it needs to police these \nincredibly complex markets, populated by highly sophisticated and \nextremely powerful entities.\n  Remember AIG, the insurer brought down by derivatives trades that the \nCFTC is now policing? If that memory is fuzzy, I am sure you will \nremember the funds we provided to bail AIG out, which came to a total \nof $67.8 billion. That would be enough to fund the CFTC at the level \nrequested in the President's budget for over 200 years.\n  The Commission needs a reauthorization, but it certainly doesn't need \none saddled with changes that will hamstring its internal operations, \nprolong its rulemakings through an inflexible cost-benefit analysis \nrequirement that opens it up to litigation risk, and force it to allow \na race to the bottom on international rules governing a global market.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in opposing the rule and the \nunderlying legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would just like to make one comment in response to those of my \ncolleague from Massachusetts in considering the underfunding of CFTC.\n  In the last 5 years, through the reductions of Federal spending and \nthe efforts that have been going on, I think anyone would be hard-\npressed to find another agency that has received an almost 50 percent \nincrease in its budget over that period of time.\n  I will just point out that, certainly, they have received a lot of \nnew responsibilities under Dodd-Frank, but also a large increase in \ntheir available resources.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nConaway), the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule to provide \nfor the consideration of H.R. 2289, the Commodity End-User Relief Act.\n  I want to start by thanking Chairman Sessions and the entire Rules \nCommittee for their time and work in preparing this rule. Yesterday's \nhearing was spirited but fair, and they have produced a rule that \nreflects the tremendous work the Agriculture Committee has put in on \nthis issue.\n  Over the past few years, the Agriculture Committee has heard from \ndozens of witnesses at over 10 hearings. These witnesses, many of whom \nare market participants struggling to comply with the needlessly \nburdensome rules and ambiguous portions of the underlying statute, have \nbeen consistent in their call to action. To address their concerns, \nH.R. 2289 makes targeted reforms that fall into three broad categories: \ncustomer protections, Commission reforms, and end-user relief.\n  Title I of the bill protects customers and the margin funds they \ndeposit at their FCMs by codifying critical changes made in the wake of \nthe collapses and bankruptcies of MF Global and Peregrine Financial.\n  Title II makes meaningful reforms to the operations of the Commission \nto improve the agency's deliberative process. In doing so, it also \nrequires the Commission to conduct more robust cost-benefit analyses to \nhelp get future rulemakings right the first time and to avoid the \nendless cycle of reproposing and delaying unworkable rules.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  While the CFTC is already required to consider costs and benefits of \nthe rules it proposes, this rule attempts to legitimize that practice, \na practice that has been called into question. The current practice has \nbeen called into question by the Commission's own inspector general, \nwho reported the agency seemed to view the process as more of a legal \none than an economic one.\n  Finally, title III of the bill fixes real problems faced by end users \nwho rely on derivatives markets to manage\n\n[[Page H3776]]\n\ntheir risks. When it is more costly for those who need these markets to \nuse them, it discourages the exact kind of prudent risk management \nactivities Congress intended to protect with the end user exemption in \nDodd-Frank.\n  Accordingly, the bill provides relief to agricultural and commercial \nmarket participants struggling to comply with overreaching and costly \nrecordkeeping requirements and allows utility companies to continue \nusing contracts that allow for a change in the volume of the commodity \ndelivered without the worry of needlessly complying with the swaps \nregulations.\n  H.R. 2289 will preserve end users' ability to hedge against \nanticipated business risk by providing a more workable definition of \nbona fide hedging. The bill also addresses serious concerns regarding \nthe lack of harmony and clarity in global derivatives regulation by \nrequiring the CFTC to publish a rule addressing how the U.S. swaps \nrequirements apply to transactions occurring outside the United States \nand with non-U.S. persons.\n  To be clear, H.R. 2289 makes these meaningful improvements for market \nparticipants without undermining the basic goals of title VII of Dodd-\nFrank, the Holy Grail, to bring clearing, reporting, and electronic \nexecution requirements to swaps transactions.\n  In closing, I would like to thank the members of the Committee on \nAgriculture who have worked hard, including Mr. Newhouse, to advance \nthis important legislation. I am especially appreciative of Mr. Lucas, \nwho worked on reauthorization last year, which was our starting point \nfor this year, as well as some of our newest members. I also owe \nparticular thanks to Mr. Austin Scott and Mr. David Scott, the chairman \nand ranking member of the subcommittee, respectively, that oversees the \nCFTC. Both of these gentlemen have joined me as original sponsors and \nhave held a series of hearings on reauthorization.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman, Mr. \nSpeaker.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. They did outstanding work helming a new subcommittee \nfocused on these issues, and I look forward to their diligent oversight \nwork throughout the rest of the Congress.\n  Similar to the CFTC reauthorization bill passed by the House with \noverwhelming bipartisan support last year, the Commodity End-User \nRelief Act is comprised of narrowly targeted changes to the Commodity \nExchange Act. The committee has again put together a bill that earned \nthe bipartisan support of our members because we brought the right \nrelief to the right people.\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of the rule and support \nfor the underlying act.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I just want to point out to my colleague from Washington \nState with regard to the funding of the CFTC that the agency has never \nreceived the funding that it has requested, and that is just a fact. \nHere we are imposing new requirements, new mandates. CBO, as I \nmentioned in my opening, estimates that the CFTC will need an \nadditional 30 personnel annually to handle the increased workload \nimposed by the new cost-benefit analysis requirements of the mandated \ncross-border rule contained in the provisions in this bill, and so we \nare asking an agency that has never been properly funded to even do \nmore and not provide it with the proper funding. I don't think that is \na smart way to move forward when it comes to an issue so important.\n  I also want to point out to my colleagues that they should have \nreceived a letter from the Consumer Federation of America strongly \nopposing this bill. Let me just read you the first paragraph. It says:\n\n       We are writing on behalf of the Consumer Federation of \n     America to ask you to oppose H.R. 2289, which the House is \n     expected to vote on this month. This legislation would \n     hamstring the Commodity Futures Trading Commission from \n     effectively overseeing and regulating commodities and \n     derivatives markets, leaving consumers exposed to fraud, \n     manipulation, and abusive practices, and putting the safety \n     and stability of the U.S. financial system at risk. The \n     language in this bill largely mirrors the language offered in \n     last year's CFTC reauthorization bill, which the Obama \n     administration strongly opposed because it undermined the \n     efficient functioning of the CFTC and offered no solution to \n     address the persistent inadequacy of the agency's funding. We \n     urge you to resist this relentless attack on the CFTC by \n     voting against this misguided and harmful legislation.\n\n  I would tell my colleagues who are observing this debate that each \none of them received a copy of this letter from the Consumer Federation \nof America strongly opposing this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include the statement for the Record.\n\n                               Consumer Federation of America,\n\n                                                     June 2, 2015.\n     Re Oppose H.R. 2289\n\n       Dear Representative: We are writing on behalf of the \n     Consumer Federation of America (CFA) to ask you to oppose \n     ``The Commodity End User Relief Act'' (H.R. 2289), which the \n     House is expected to vote on this month. This legislation \n     would hamstring the Commodity Futures Trading Commission \n     (CFTC) from effectively overseeing and regulating commodities \n     and derivatives markets, leaving consumers exposed to fraud, \n     manipulation, and abusive practices, and putting the safety \n     and stability of the U.S. financial system at risk. The \n     language in this bill largely mirrors the language offered in \n     last year's CFTC reauthorization bill, which the Obama \n     Administration strongly opposed because it undermined the \n     efficient functioning of the CFTC and offered no solution to \n     address the persistent inadequacy of the agency's funding. We \n     urge you to resist this relentless attack on the CFTC by \n     voting against this misguided and harmful legislation.\n       First, this bill would impose an assortment of new, onerous \n     cost-benefit analysis requirements on the CFTC which are \n     likely to delay and obstruct agency action. Under the \n     Commodity Exchange Act, the CFTC already has a statutory \n     mandate to evaluate the costs and benefits of its actions in \n     light of numerous considerations, including the protection of \n     market participants and the public, efficiency, \n     competitiveness, financial integrity, price discovery, and \n     sound risk management practices. This bill would add seven \n     new considerations for the CFTC to undertake. Included in the \n     new economic analysis regime is a requirement for the \n     Commission to assess available alternatives to direct \n     regulation and to determine whether, in choosing among \n     alternative regulatory approaches, those alternatives to \n     direct regulation maximize the net benefits. The practical \n     effect is a further tilting of the regulatory process in \n     favor of adopting an approach that best benefits industry \n     rather than the public.\n       Essentially, if this bill is adopted, the CFTC will be \n     required to undertake an in-depth, burdensome economic \n     analysis for each regulation it proposes and compare its \n     proposal to every conceivable alternative. Such a framework \n     likely will create insurmountable barriers that cripple the \n     agency from putting forth rule proposals and finalizing them \n     in a timely manner so as to effectively protect market \n     participants and the overall economy. In addition, the CFTC \n     would be required to evaluate the cost to the Commission of \n     implementing the proposed action, including providing a \n     methodology for quantifying the costs. While this provision \n     is clumsily worded, it appears that the practical effect of \n     requiring the CFTC to consider costs to itself and its staff \n     will be to paradoxically add time and costs to the cost side \n     of the equation, thereby hindering rulemaking. It is also \n     disturbing that this legislation would require the CFTC to \n     undertake exhaustive cost-benefit analyses without providing \n     the agency with the necessary resources to fulfill those \n     obligations.\n       The new cost-benefit analysis requirements also are likely \n     to result in increasing opportunities to thwart CFTC \n     regulations through legal challenges. The practical effect of \n     the new heightened requirements will be that any time an \n     industry participant objects to new rules, it will have \n     several new bases for a lawsuit, and it will seek to defeat \n     those rules by claiming that the agency did not undertake a \n     proper economic analysis by considering, and then disposing \n     of, all the possible theoretical alternatives. It is \n     reasonable to believe that armed with such strong ammunition, \n     industry-supported lawsuits seeking to dismantle any new \n     regulations will be successful, a problem again made worse by \n     the agency's lack of funding to effectively defend against \n     such suits.\n       This legislation also subverts the CFTC's authority to \n     regulate foreign derivatives activities that have a direct \n     and significant effect on U.S. commerce. As our nation has \n     learned painfully and repeatedly from the collapses of Long \n     Term Capital Management, AIG, and Lehman Bros., and from the \n     JPMorgan London Whale trading debacle, even when derivatives \n     contracts are booked through a foreign subsidiary of a U.S. \n     financial institution, the risks of those derivatives often \n     flow back to the United States, threatening the U.S. economy \n     and potentially putting U.S. taxpayers on the hook for any \n     resulting losses. That is why Dodd-Frank gave the CFTC broad \n     authority to regulate overseas derivatives when they put our \n     national economic interests in peril.\n       Pursuant to that cross-border framework, the CFTC allows a \n     foreign host country's regulations to substitute for U.S. \n     regulations only after the CFTC has made a finding that the \n     foreign host country's regulations are comparable to U.S. \n     rules. However, this bill\n\n[[Page H3777]]\n\n     would create a presumption that each of the eight foreign \n     jurisdictions with the largest swaps markets automatically \n     have swaps rules that are considered to be comparable to and \n     as comprehensive as U.S. swaps requirements. The bill makes \n     this determination despite the fact that the CFTC has found \n     only six jurisdictions to be comparable for certain entity-\n     level requirements, and has declined to make comparability \n     determinations for transaction-level requirements for \n     jurisdictions other than the European Union and Japan. \n     Switching the presumption will subjugate the CFTC's authority \n     and expertise on the matter. Furthermore, combining the \n     reversed presumption and overwhelming cost-benefit analysis \n     requirements could mean that the CFTC is effectively thwarted \n     from applying the appropriate regulatory safeguards to \n     certain foreign derivatives transactions. As a result, the \n     CFTC's ability to protect the U.S. economy from the dangers \n     resulting from foreign derivatives transactions could be \n     impaired.\n       Derivatives markets affect the U.S. economy in profound \n     ways, and the risks that derivatives pose to the U.S. economy \n     are well-known. The Dodd-Frank Act brought meaningful reforms \n     to increase transparency and accountability in the \n     derivatives markets and provided the CFTC the necessary \n     authority to properly oversee and regulate the market. \n     However, this legislation would put those reforms at risk and \n     hamper the CFTC's ability to adequately protect consumers, \n     market participants, and the U.S. economy. We cannot afford \n     to suffer the grave consequences of another derivatives-laced \n     financial crisis, but this legislation makes it more likely \n     that we will. Accordingly, we urge you to oppose H.R. 2289.\n           Sincerely,\n     Micah Hauptman,\n       Financial Services Counsel.\n     Barbara Roper,\n       Director of Investor Protection.\n\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. \nDavid Scott), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Commodity \nExchanges, Energy, and Credit of the Committee on Agriculture.\n  Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, first of all let me say \nthat, as the gentleman just mentioned, I do serve as the ranking member \nof the jurisdictional committee on commodities and futures and trading \nthat the CFTC comes under. I say that only to say that I have been in \nthe vineyards on this issue and have been struggling with it and \nworking on it over many, many years.\n  The whole derivatives and commodities and futures markets have \nchanged dramatically. We have had a downfall in our economy because of \na lot of activity that was wrong going on on Wall Street and in our \nfinancial community, out of which we are now emerging.\n  Mr. Speaker, what is urgent here is the fact that we cannot delay any \nlonger. It is very important for people to understand that no \nlegislation is perfect. I am the first one to say that. This is a glass \nthat looks to be half empty or maybe half full. I look at it as half \nfull.\n  I look at it as an urgent, urgent issue. We have got to get end-user \nrelief. That is the major component of this reauthorization for the \nCFTC because it is the end users--our manufacturers, our farmers, those \nwho produce the products, those who had nothing to do with the downfall \nof Wall Street, why should they be consistently held to the same \nintrinsic regulations and rules that our financial institutions have? \nWe have got to have those financial institutions under strong \nregulation, but it is important that we move, and it is important meat \nof this bill that we give end-user relief.\n  Now, I share Mr. McGovern's concerns about the financial situation, \nbut let me just assure everyone, this is a reauthorization piece of \nlegislation. It is not a funding mechanism. That is in the bosom, in \nthe hands of the Committee on Appropriations; and nobody, absolutely \nnobody, has been a stronger champion, more consistent about getting the \nCFTC the funding they need. I bring it up all the time. I will still be \na champion, but this isn't the bill in which to address that.\n  The other point is this, Mr. Chairman, once we get the funding out of \nthe way. We talked about the cost-benefit analysis in this. We worked \non it. This bill received bipartisan support in the last session. Mr. \nMcGovern brings up a very good point about possible litigation. We \naddress that by adding a Democratic amendment by Ms. DelBene that \naddresses that issue to make sure that there is no litigation.\n  As far as the cost-benefit analysis is concerned, Mr. Speaker, it is \nimportant that we put the same sort of cost-benefit analysis into this \nagency that the Obama administration has in every one of their \nexecutive agencies. Furthermore, it is not a mandate; it is an \nassessment. It is saying to assess the efficiencies, make sure we do \nit, and it does not put a requirement that any decision on the cost-\nbenefit analysis outweighs one another as a requirement for them to \nmake a decision.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, we must pass this bill, and we need to do it \nquickly because, in section 300 of this bill--I think it is section \n323--we address a crucial issue. The European Union is eating our \nlunch. All across the world, we are losing our stature as the leading \nfinancial industry and system in the world. That affects every ounce of \nour security. We are number one in the world, and it is about time we \nstand up and ensure that by making sure that we address the European \nUnion's harsh discrimination against our financial institutions abroad. \nThis is particularly true when it comes to our clearinghouses, the \nstandards that they are using.\n  Now, Mr. Speaker, yes, we are dealing with eight foreign countries, \nbut they must have similar regimes, what we call equivalency. Now, why \nis that important, Mr. Speaker?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman.\n  Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. It is important because it is the CFTC \nthat must determine if another nation, one of the eight top foreign \nnations, has an equivalency of a strong regulatory regime as does the \nUnited States, then certainly we can do business under their regime, \nbut as long as we don't pass this legislation, the CFTC doesn't have \nthat.\n  Finally, on all the cross-border situations, we need a definition of \nwhat a U.S. person is, and we need to give some backbone to our CFTC \nCommission to say: Look, why should the United States have to treat a \nforeign entity in a manner and with the respect that that foreign \nnation does not treat our industry?\n  Mr. Speaker, this country, the United States, is losing a tremendous \namount of our prestige and our leadership on the world stage, and \nnowhere is that being pronounced more than in our financial system \nbecause for 3 years we have had this laid on the table. I urge a \npositive vote for this rule.\n  I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for yielding me the time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I would just like to thank the gentleman \nfrom Georgia for his many years of hard work on this very complicated \nissue. As you can see, he understands it well and understands the \nimportance of passing this reauthorization legislation. I just want to \nthank him for his comments and hard work.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas), the \nesteemed former chairman of the Committee on Agriculture.\n  Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the underlying \nbill, H.R. 2289, the Commodity End-User Relief Act. This bipartisan \nbill is the result of a series of hearings in which the Committee on \nAgriculture heard from stakeholders that do business with the CFTC as \nwell as every CFTC Commissioner.\n  As chairman of the committee last year, I began the process of CFTC \nreauthorization, which resulted in the House-passed bipartisan bill, \nand I laud our committee chairman, Mr. Conaway, for his efforts in \ntackling the same subject and coming to the full House with another \nbipartisan CFTC reauthorization that passed the committee by a voice \nvote.\n  A chief selling point of this bill is its commitment to good \ngovernance reforms at the CFTC to increase transparency and efficiency. \nFirst, the bill closely follows an executive order by President Obama \nto improve the cost-benefit analysis performed by the Commission prior \nto promulgating rules. In addition, the bill would improve this \noversight of Commissioners over activities which are outside the normal \nrulemaking process that still impact many futures market participants. \nMany of these activities, such as policy statements, guidance, and \ninterpretation rules released by CFTC, would also be subject to public \ncomment under the provisions of the bill when they have\n\n[[Page H3778]]\n\nthe force of law. Furthermore, H.R. 2289 establishes an office of the \nchief economist at the CFTC to provide objective economic data and \nanalysis.\n  The committee also heard from end users during this process and \nincluded several provisions to provide relief to those end users, such \nas a more workable definition of bona fide hedging and relief from \nburdensome recordkeeping rules for many businesses.\n  The CFTC has gone unauthorized since 2013, and it is time many CFTC \nactivities were reformed by Congress. This rule will make possible the \nunderlying bill that will improve the CFTC in many important ways. I \nurge all of my colleagues to support it.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I just want to be clear on one thing. Yes, this is an authorization \nbill. It is not an appropriations bill. But the issue of funding for \nthe CFTC is relevant in the discussion of this authorization bill \nbecause we are essentially proposing that we give additional \nresponsibilities or require additional actions from the CFTC with no \nguarantee that we are going to provide the resources for them to do \ntheir job. We haven't provided them the adequate resources to do what \nthey have been expected to do from the very beginning.\n  I also want to say that most end user relief in this bill is not \nobjectionable, but the CFTC is already addressing them through \nrulemaking. A better way to address these concerns than in statute \nwould be more flexibility for them to do rulemaking, which can be \nadjusted.\n  In addition to end user provisions, this bill also contains all the \nproblems that we have already identified with regard to cost benefit \nand cross border. So there are some significant issues here.\n  The DelBene amendment was mentioned earlier. I want to make it clear \nthat that does not prevent litigation. It just restates the standard of \nreview from the Administrative Procedure Act abuse of discretion.\n  I will also point out to my colleagues that the cost-benefit analysis \nis mandated by section 202.\n  So, again, I would feel better about all of this if we addressed the \nfunding shortfall in the CFTC. We are not doing that. And I don't \nexpect that this majority is going to work with us on that.\n  I also will insert in the Record, Mr. Speaker, a letter that was sent \nto all Members of the House from Americans for Financial Reform \nstrongly opposing H.R. 2289. Let me just read the opening paragraph:\n  ``On behalf of Americans for Financial Reform, we are writing to \nexpress our opposition to H.R. 2289. . . . This legislation would have \na severe negative impact on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission \nand its ability to police commodity and derivatives markets. The new \nrestrictions it places on the CFTC would require additional years of \nbureaucratic red tape prior to agency action, would enable numerous \nindustry lawsuits against the agency, and would create inappropriate \nstatutory restrictions on the agency's ability to properly oversee \nmarkets crucial to the financial system.''\n\n                               Americans for Financial Reform,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 3, 2015.\n       Dear Representative: On behalf of Americans for Financial \n     Reform, we are writing to express our opposition to HR 2289, \n     ``The Commodity End User Relief Act.'' This legislation would \n     have a severe negative impact on the Commodity Futures \n     Trading Commission (CFTC) and its ability to police commodity \n     and derivatives markets. The new restrictions it places on \n     the CFTC would require additional years of bureaucratic red \n     tape prior to agency action, would enable numerous industry \n     lawsuits against the agency, and would create inappropriate \n     statutory restrictions on the agency's ability to properly \n     oversee markets crucial to the financial system.\n       At the same time, this legislation includes no provisions \n     that address the CFTC's most fundamental problem--the lack of \n     resources to accomplish its mission. Due to the agency's \n     massive new responsibilities under the Dodd-Frank Act for \n     hundreds of trillions of dollars in previously unregulated \n     derivatives markets, as well as the growth of traditional \n     commodity markets, the size of CFTC-regulated markets has \n     increased roughly 15-fold over the last decade. But the \n     agency's funding lags far behind. As CFTC chair Tim Massad \n     recently stated:\n       ``The CFTC does not have the resources to fulfill our new \n     responsibilities as well as all the responsibilities it had--\n     and still has--prior to the passage of Dodd Frank in a way \n     that most Americans would expect. Our staff, for example, is \n     no larger than it was when Dodd-Frank was enacted in 2010. . \n     . . Simply stated, without additional resources, our markets \n     cannot be as well supervised; participants and their \n     customers cannot be as well protected; market transparency \n     and efficiency cannot be as fully achieved.''\n       While the CFTC's funding is appropriated, the agency \n     authorization process is an appropriate mechanism for \n     introducing mechanisms that would supplement appropriations \n     with some form of agency self-funding. Such self-funding \n     mechanisms are used by all other financial regulatory \n     agencies and have been endorsed for the CFTC by every \n     administration going back to the Reagan Administration, \n     including the Bush and Obama Administrations.\n       Instead of addressing the pressing problem of funding, HR \n     2289 would instead load down the CFTC with additional \n     mandates that would drain resources and act as a roadblock to \n     necessary oversight and enforcement. Section 202 of HR 2289 \n     would more than double the number of cost benefit analyses \n     the agency must perform prior to taking any action. The CFTC \n     already has a statutory requirement to consider the costs and \n     benefits of its actions, and to evaluate these costs and \n     benefits as applied to a number of significant \n     considerations, including market efficiency, price discovery, \n     and protection of the public.\n       However, Section 202 would massively expand this \n     requirement. The section would enormously expand the number \n     of different factors the CFTC must evaluate in any \n     rulemaking, order, or guidance. It would also change the \n     standard of evaluation from consideration of costs and \n     benefits to a much more extensive and burdensome ``reasoned \n     determination'' of costs and benefits. The section includes a \n     particularly sweeping mandate that would require the agency \n     to assess whether an action ``maximizes net benefits'' \n     compared to all possible regulatory alternatives. This \n     requirement alone, which seems to require comparison of any \n     actual regulation to a potentially vast number of theoretical \n     alternatives, could be read to require dozens of additional \n     agency analyses.\n       Some of this language does replicate cost-benefit \n     instructions from the Office of Management and Budget that \n     already applies to agencies within the executive branch, \n     although not to independent financial regulatory agencies \n     like the CFTC. However, a crucial difference is that HR 2289 \n     would add this language in statute, meaning that each and \n     every additional instruction regarding cost-benefit analysis \n     could become grounds for a Wall Street lawsuit against a CFTC \n     rule. These extensive new cost-benefit requirements amount to \n     a playbook for industry interests to tie up regulations in \n     endless litigation, delays, and red tape. With critical \n     rulemakings such as position limits to control commodity \n     price manipulation still incomplete almost five years after \n     they were passed, the addition of major new barriers to \n     action would be dramatic movement in the wrong direction.\n       Section 314 of the legislation would also greatly weaken \n     the authority of the CFTC to properly regulate derivatives \n     transactions booked in foreign subsidiaries of U.S. banks, \n     even when such transactions have a direct and significant \n     connection to the U.S. economy. We need only look at the \n     example of J.P. Morgan's ``London Whale'' transactions, or \n     the London derivatives transactions of AIG Financial Products \n     which resulted in the largest bailout in U.S. history, to see \n     that derivatives transactions conducted through nominally \n     overseas entities can have a profound impact on the U.S. \n     economy. Over half of Wall Street derivatives transactions \n     are currently booked in nominally foreign subsidiaries, and \n     even more could be transacted in this way if there was an \n     incentive to do so to avoid regulation.\n       Section 314 would force the CFTC to perform burdensome \n     ``determinations'' in order to regulate foreign subsidiary \n     transactions. Its discretion in performing these assessments \n     would be limited in numerous ways by the legislation. To take \n     just one example, the agency would be banned from considering \n     the actual physical location of personnel doing swaps trading \n     in determining whether a transaction was conducted inside the \n     United States for the purposes of applying U.S. law. It \n     defies common sense to impose such extraordinary restrictions \n     on the discretion of a regulatory agency charged with \n     oversight of the multi-trillion dollar derivatives market.\n       HR 2289 also includes many additional changes. Some of \n     them, such as amendments to indemnification requirements for \n     swaps data repositories, are reasonable. However, others \n     create significant statutory loopholes that could permit \n     evasion of derivatives regulations by large banks. For \n     example, Section 301 of the legislation permits large \n     financial institutions affiliated with commercial entities to \n     take advantage of exemptions from key Dodd-Frank risk \n     controls that were intended to apply only to commercial end \n     users. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service has \n     stated that the language included in Section 301 ``could \n     potentially allow large banks to trade swaps with other large \n     banks and not be subject to the clearing or exchange trading \n     requirements as long as one of the banks had a nonfinancial \n     affiliate.''\n       Some of the other problematic parts of the bill expand the \n     definition of ``commercial end user'' to include financial \n     entities (Section 306), create sweeping exemptions from\n\n[[Page H3779]]\n\n     CFTC oversight for broad classes of complex financial \n     instruments (Section 309), weaken Commission authority to \n     require swap dealers to raise equity capital to back up their \n     trades (Section 311), permit marketing of complex \n     institutional commodity pools to retail investors (Section \n     312), and weaken limits on commodity market speculation \n     (Section 313). All of these sections appear significantly \n     overbroad and could enable evasion of appropriate regulatory \n     oversight.\n       In general, the ``end user'' changes in this bill fail to \n     recognize the very substantial administrative exemptions \n     provided to end users by the CFTC. The CFTC has already \n     exempted end users from numerous Dodd-Frank regulations in \n     areas targeted by this bill. By acting through administrative \n     processes the agency has maintained appropriate safeguards as \n     well as the ability to act if market participants use \n     exemptions to evade important risk controls. In contrast, \n     many of the provisions in HR 2289 would provide sweeping \n     statutory exemptions that lack appropriate controls on risk \n     and could easily become dangerous loopholes.\n       But even before considering these issues, the major new \n     restrictions on the agency created by the cost-benefit and \n     cross-border provisions of this bill create overwhelming \n     reasons to reject this legislation as currently written. So \n     long as those provisions are a part of this legislation, \n     supporting appropriate derivatives regulation requires \n     opposing this bill.\n       We urge you to vote against HR 2289 and preserve the CFTC's \n     capacity to properly regulate crucial futures and derivatives \n     markets.

Again, I would urge all my colleagues to look in their \nmail for the letter from the Americans for Financial Reform strongly \nopposed to this, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the good gentleman \nfrom Georgia (Mr. Austin Scott).\n  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of \nthis resolution and the underlying legislation, H.R. 2289, the \nCommodity End-User Relief Act.\n  As chairman of the Agriculture Subcommittee on Commodity Exchanges, \nEnergy, and Credit, I want to thank our chairman, Mr. Conaway, for his \nstrong leadership and for making this reauthorization process a \nproductive one through the full Ag Committee.\n  I also want to thank my colleague from Georgia and the ranking member \nof the Commodity Exchanges, Energy, and Credit Subcommittee, Mr. David \nScott. He has been a tremendous partner throughout this effort, and we \ncertainly continue to work well together. I thank him for that.\n  Derivatives markets exist to meet the risk management needs of \nfarmers, ranchers, utilities, manufacturers, and other end users. To be \nclear, these hedging activities directly benefit the American citizen \nby helping to keep consumer costs low and reducing the risk of \nmanufacturing in the United States.\n  The ability of producers and end users to use the derivatives markets \nto hedge risk has a direct impact on the cost of living in my district, \nGeorgia's Eighth Congressional District, and every other district \naround the country. It is essential that we have strong markets that \nour farmers, ranchers, and end users can utilize to meet their needs \neffectively.\n  Earlier this year, our subcommittee held three very productive \nhearings that built upon the work done in the past two Congresses on \nthis reauthorization effort. In many hours of testimony we heard \ndiverse perspectives from end users, market participants, and \nregulators that were instrumental in drafting this legislation. Their \ntestimony included outlooks on the unintentional impacts that the \nmarket reforms enacted following the 2008 financial crisis were having \non the end user community.\n  Despite congressional attempts to exempt end users from some of the \nmore costly and cumbersome mandates, end users continue to face \nunnecessary regulatory burdens and uncertainty. With this legislation \nwe have the opportunity to erase that.\n  H.R. 2289, the Commodity End-User Relief Act, seeks to clarify \ncongressional intent, minimize regulatory burdens, and most \nimportantly, preserve the ability for those necessary risk management \nmarkets to serve those who need them.\n  I believe we have met these objectives of ensuring that our \nregulatory framework protects the integrity of our markets while not \nlimiting the ability of end users to access these tools to conduct \ntheir business.\n  I am proud to support both this resolution and the underlying \nlegislation, Mr. Speaker, and I urge my colleagues to join me in so \ndoing.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  In closing, I want to call to the attention of my colleagues the \nStatement of Administration Policy on H.R. 2289 and just read a little \nbit of it so that my colleagues understand how strongly the \nadministration is opposed to this:\n  ``The administration strongly opposes the passage of H.R. 2289 \nbecause it undermines the efficient functioning of the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission . . . by imposing a number of organizational \nand procedural changes that would undercut efforts taken by the CFTC \nover the last year to address end user concerns.\n  ``H.R. 2289 also offers no solution to address the persistent \ninadequacy of the agency's funding. The CFTC is one of only two Federal \nfinancial regulators funded through annual discretionary \nappropriations, and the funding that Congress has provided for it over \nthe past 5 years has failed to keep pace with the increasing complexity \nof the Nation's financial markets.\n  ``The changes proposed in H.R. 2289 would hinder the ability of the \nCFTC to operate effectively, thereby threatening the financial security \nof the middle class by encouraging the same kind of risky, \nirresponsible behavior that led to the great recession.''\n  The statement concludes, Mr. Speaker:\n  ``If the President were presented with H.R. 2289, his senior advisers \nwould recommend that he veto the bill.''\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n                H.R. 2289--Commodity End-User Relief Act\n\n                   (Rep. Conaway, R-TX, June 2, 2015)\n\n       The Administration is firmly committed to strengthening the \n     Nation's financial system through the implementation of key \n     reforms to safeguard derivatives markets and ensure a \n     stronger and fairer financial system for investors and \n     consumers. The full benefit to the Nation's citizens and the \n     economy cannot be realized unless the entities charged with \n     establishing and enforcing the rules of the road have the \n     resources to do so.\n       The Administration strongly opposes the passage of H.R. \n     2289 because it undermines the efficient functioning of the \n     Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) by imposing a \n     number of organizational and procedural changes and would \n     undercut efforts taken by the CFTC over the last year to \n     address end-user concerns. H.R. 2289 also offers no solution \n     to address the persistent inadequacy of the agency's funding. \n     The CFTC is one of only two Federal financial regulators \n     funded through annual discretionary appropriations, and the \n     funding the Congress has provided for it over the past five \n     years has failed to keep pace with the increasing complexity \n     of the Nation's financial markets. The changes proposed in \n     H.R. 2289 would hinder the ability of the CFTC to operate \n     effectively, thereby threatening the financial security of \n     the middle class by encouraging the same kind of risky, \n     irresponsible behavior that led to the great recession.\n       Prior to enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and \n     Consumer Protection Act, the derivatives markets were largely \n     unregulated. Losses connected to derivatives rippled through \n     that hidden network, playing a central role in the financial \n     crisis. Wall Street Reform resulted in significant expansion \n     of the CFTC's responsibilities, establishing a framework for \n     standardized over-the-counter derivatives to be traded on \n     regulated platforms and centrally cleared, and for data to be \n     reported to repositories to increase transparency and price \n     discovery. The changes proposed in H.R. 2289 would hinder the \n     CFTC's progress in successfully implementing these critical \n     responsibilities and would unnecessarily disrupt the \n     effective management and operation of the agency without \n     providing the more robust and reliable funding that the \n     agency needs.\n       In order to respond quickly to market events and market \n     participants, the CFTC needs funding commensurate with its \n     evolving oversight framework. The Administration looks \n     forward to working with the Congress to authorize fee funding \n     for the CFTC as proposed in the FY 2016 Budget request, a \n     shift that would directly reduce the deficit. User fees were \n     first proposed in the President's Budget by the Reagan \n     Administration more than 30 years ago and have been supported \n     by every Democratic and Republican Administration since that \n     time. Fee funding would shift CFTC costs from the general \n     taxpayer to the primary beneficiaries of the CFTC's oversight \n     in a manner that maintains the efficiency, competitiveness, \n     and financial integrity of the Nation's futures, options, and \n     swaps markets, and supports market access for smaller market \n     participants hedging or mitigating commercial or agricultural \n     risk.\n       If the President were presented with H.R. 2289, his senior \n     advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.\n\n[[Page H3780]]\n\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I think that basically says it all.\n  While I respect the intentions of my colleagues who drafted this \nbill, I think it is a deeply flawed bill, and it creates hurdles for \nthe CFTC that will not be fully funded and will cause all kinds of \nproblems.\n  I think we ought to make sure that the CFTC can do its job. I don't \nwant a repeat of the financial crisis that resulted in the Great \nRecession. And I think the American people don't want a repeat of that.\n  I get very worried when I see this Congress chipping away at Dodd-\nFrank and the provisions in Dodd-Frank that get us back to what got us \ninto this mess to begin with. I think we can do a lot better.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the rule and vote ``no'' on \nthe underlying bill.\n  With that, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Let me just say I appreciate the good discussion here today over the \npast hour. People on both side of the aisles have made very good \ncomments, very good points.\n  As it relates to the last comment from Mr. McGovern that talked about \nchipping away at Dodd-Frank, everything we're doing around here is \nfine-tuning and improving what has been passed in Congresses--\nlegislation, laws on the books that need improvement--and I see that as \nwhat we are doing here today.\n  So I appreciate very much the comments. And although we may have some \ndifferences, I believe that this rule and the underlying bill are very \nstrong measures that are important to the future of our country.\n  This rule provides for ample debate on the floor, the opportunity to \ndebate and vote on the bill and numerous amendments, which I would note \nare divided evenly between Democratic and Republican Members of this \nChamber. It reflects the balanced deliberation that this rule will \nprovide. This rule will provide for a smooth and deliberative process \nfor sending this bill over to the Senate for their consideration.\n  H.R. 2289 is a solid and substantial measure that will address \nseveral critical issues that the CFTC and end users are facing.\n  Mr. Speaker, no one wants to see the complete deregulation of our \nfinancial services industry and our commodities and derivative markets. \nAnd I appreciate the comments from the gentleman from Massachusetts. \nHowever, it is critical that the regulations put in place are \nappropriate for our economy and as well for the users.\n  These rules have to provide safeguards and prevent systemic risk but \ncannot catch our entire economy in a one-size-fits-all regulation.\n  As we have discussed here today, the current rules place enormous \npaperwork and financial burdens on small businesses. And that cannot go \nunstated. Our small businesses, ranchers, utilities, and manufacturers \nall face these financial burdens. They take these small, risk-averse \nentities and place them under the same regulatory scheme as large \nfinancial institutions and hedge funds. H.R. 2289 will differentiate \nand exempt the end users who are not a cause of systemic risk and \nshould not have been lumped into these rules in the first place.\n  The underlying bill would also make much-needed reforms in the CFTC \nto strengthen their rulemaking process and add commonsense consumer \nprotections.\n  Overall, this is a strong rule that provides for consideration of \nthis important legislation. I urge my colleagues to support House \nResolution 288 and the underlying bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the \nprevious question on the resolution.\n  The previous question was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Loudermilk). The question is on the \nresolution.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 243, \nnays 182, not voting 7, as follows:\n\n

I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used in contravention of section 7606 (``Legitimacy of \n     Industrial Hemp Research'') of the Agricultural Act of 2014 \n     (Public Law 113-79) by the Department of Justice or the Drug \n     Enforcement Administration.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Kentucky and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today with four of my colleagues to \noffer a bipartisan amendment that simply requires the DEA to comply \nwith Federal law.\n  The passage of our amendment to the 2014 farm bill legalized the \ncultivation of industrial hemp for research purposes and has allowed \nfor the establishment of industrial hemp pilot programs in States \nacross the country. In fact, in my home State of Kentucky alone, nearly \n1,800 acres of hemp are projected to be grown this summer in these \npilot programs.\n  However, despite the clear language of our farm bill amendment that \nspecifically states that State agriculture agencies and universities \nwill be growing the industrial hemp for research, the DEA has \ncontinuously ignored the plain text of the Federal statute.\n  The DEA continues to waste valuable time and taxpayer dollars by \nholding up non-psychoactive hemp seeds destined for legitimate hemp \npilot programs.\n  Last year, officials from the State of Kentucky were forced to file a \nlawsuit in Federal court to compel the DEA to release industrial hemp \nseeds for university pilot programs. This year, participants in hemp \npilot programs in Kentucky and other States did not receive their seeds \nuntil just a few weeks before the start of the growing season.\n  The language is clear: State authorities, not the DEA, shall register \nthe sites where hemp will be grown. The DEA's deliberate refusal to \nallow this simple fact has resulted in a broken process where the DEA \nobfuscates and delays.\n  Mr. Chairman, States cannot launch industrial hemp pilot programs if \nthe DEA continues to violate Federal law by seizing and delaying \nshipments of hemp seeds before they reach their destination.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote note on our amendment to require the DEA to \nfollow Federal law, and I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Kentucky \n(Mr. Barr).\n  Mr. BARR. In 2013, the Kentucky General Assembly passed Senate Bill \n50, which exempted industrial hemp from the State's Controlled \nSubstances Act but also mandated that Kentucky follow all Federal rules \nand regulations with respect to industrial hemp.\n  So, last year, I was proud to support an amendment to the 2014 farm \nbill, sponsored by my fellow Kentuckian, Congressman Thomas Massie, \nwhich authorized State departments of agriculture in States where \nindustrial hemp is legal to administer industrial hemp pilot programs \nfor the purposes of research and development.\n  The Kentucky Department of Agriculture Industrial Hemp Pilot Research \nProgram, in collaboration with my constituent, the University of \nKentucky College of Agriculture, has since facilitated through \npermitted farmers the cultivation of nearly 2,000 acres of hemp this \nyear alone in Kentucky.\n  Hemp is an important crop that holds tremendous commercial promise in \nKentucky. In fact, former Speaker of the House Henry Clay was a large \nproducer of industrial hemp. It can be used for food, horse bedding, \nanimal feed, textiles, oils, lotions, cosmetics, rope, pharmaceuticals, \net cetera.\n  Just last week, I met with a very sophisticated partnership of \nentrepreneurs, tobacco farmers, botanists, and even former law \nenforcement officials who have put up their own capital to invest in \npermanent industrial hemp projects, which they believe can spark a very \nprofitable business.\n  This is about jobs.\n  Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition, even though I \nam not actually in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania?\n  Mr. HARRIS. I object. I rise to claim time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Maryland is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Chairman, the job of the DEA is not simple. The job \nof the DEA is to stop drug use and drug abuse in the United States.\n  Sometimes the job isn't easy. When it comes to hemp, the job is not \neasy because, Mr. Chairman, hemp and marijuana are both cannabis, and \nyou can't tell the seeds from one another. And it may be difficult for \nthe DEA to determine because they are supposed to determine that the \nseeds used for hemp are below a certain level of THC--less than 0.3--\nand you can't tell by looking. You have to test and make certain that \nthese seeds are in fact going to be used and qualify for the purposes \nof these pilot hemp programs.\n  The fact of the matter is there really is no evidence that the DEA \ndoes not comply with Federal law. They are fully complying with Federal \nlaw. The author of the amendment himself admitted that the seeds were \nthere in time for planting. The fact of the matter is that this is not \nan easy job.\n  Under section 7606 of the 2014 farm bill, industrial hemp in pilot \nprojects was authorized. Clearly, DEA licenses are not needed if they \nare granted through the State departments of agriculture or academic \ninstitutions. And the programs are proceeding.\n  The fact of the matter is that this amendment obfuscates the \ndistinction between marijuana and hemp. It partially ties the hands of \nDEA to do what they need to do, which is to function as controllers of \ndrugs in this country.\n  I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Fleming).\n  Mr. FLEMING. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I certainly \nagree with Dr. Harris. I rise also in opposition to this amendment.\n  Cultivation of cannabis for industrial purposes is governed by the \nControlled Substances Act, and that includes hemp. It is permitted \npursuant to the registration requirements found in title 21, United \nStates Code.\n  In addition, the Agricultural Act of 2014 permits ``institutions of \nhigher learning and State Departments of Agriculture to grow or \ncultivate industrial hemp.''\n  But let's make one thing clear. The DOJ says they have no intention \nat all of interfering with what has been provided for in this \nDepartment of Agriculture permit. But they still have control, they \nstill have oversight responsibility, and as a result of that, they \nshould do that.\n  Now, if there is any delay along the way, certainly we should help \nwith that. We should facilitate administratively. But the potential for \nabuse here is very significant. The DEA and law enforcement must retain \ncontrol and oversight of hemp, which is a cannabis, just like \nmarijuana.\n  Mr. HARRIS. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time is \nremaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Kentucky has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n\n[[Page H3791]]\n\n  Mr. MASSIE. I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. \nBarr).\n  Mr. BARR. To my good friend from Maryland, Dr. Harris, just a quick \nresponse. We are talking about State-licensed programs where the law \nenforcement officials in Kentucky can identify permitted land where \nthis hemp is grown. If it is on an unpermitted place, whether it is \notherwise legal industrial hemp or marijuana, it would be illegal if it \nis not on a permitted piece of property. So there is no conflict with \nlaw enforcement.\n  But the fact of the matter is that last year the DEA delayed the \nseeds and delayed the planting of this legitimate, lawful, federally \nauthorized industrial hemp project.\n  This is about jobs. This is not about marijuana. In fact, as my \nvoting record just demonstrated in the last series of votes, I voted \nagainst every single amendment that would have decriminalized or \nfacilitated marijuana. This is not about marijuana. This is about low-\nTHC industrial hemp, and it is about jobs.\n  Mr. MASSIE. I yield 1 minute to my colleague from Oregon (Mr. \nBlumenauer).\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy and I \nappreciate his leadership, focused like a laser on something that is \nnot like marijuana.\n  For generations, Americans have used hemp. It has just been recently \nthat it has been compromised. So we have to import hemp from overseas \nto make perfectly legal hemp products that you can buy in any American \ncity.\n  This is an important step forward to be able to allow Kentucky and \nOregon farmers to do something that they have done for generations. It \nis about economic development. It is about being rational. And it is \nabout being able to focus on things that are important.\n  I deeply appreciate the gentleman's focus and patience keeping us on \nmessage here to be able to make sure that we are not having Federal \ninterference for something that is State supervised and where States \naround the country want to allow this for their farmers and their \nranchers.\n  I think it is an important step forward, and I appreciate his \nleadership in permitting me to speak on it.\n  Mr. MASSIE. I certainly thank the gentleman from Oregon, and I would \njust say that these hemp pilot programs have been tremendous in \nKentucky. And they have answered all the questions, like the questions \nlaw enforcement had. They came and visited the fields. They said: ``You \nare right; there is no big deal here. This is okay.''\n  And so that is the important thing about these hemp programs, and we \nneed to keep them going, and we need to take it to the level. We can't \nafford delays. You can't afford a delay when the weather is not always \ncooperating with you. A week, 2 weeks could ruin you.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment. It is just common \nsense. All we are asking is to follow the law. How hard is that?\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HARRIS. May I inquire of the Chair how much time is remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Maryland has 2\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Chairman, let's review what we have. What we have is \na situation where last year it wasn't the DEA that held up the seeds; \nit was getting an import license. And then subsequent to that, \nobviously the DEA had to test those seeds.\n  The U.S. Congress has set out a very clear plan for how we are going \nto increase the use of industrial hemp in this country, and it \ninvolves, first, pilot programs in States where it is legal, like \nKentucky, like Oregon, but subject to the oversight under the \nControlled Substances Act of the DEA.\n  The DEA has to be certain, since all seeds are now imported. \nEventually, under this plan, they won't be. Obviously, at some point we \nwill progress to a point where our industrial hemp seeds are grown here \nin the United States, but they are not now.\n  Importing seeds and testing them is not a quick process, but it is a \nprocess that has to be done. The fact of the matter is hemp and \nmarijuana are both cannabis. They are related. You can't tell the seeds \napart. You have to test these seeds.\n  Our drug problem is serious. I am glad I don't have to do the job the \nDEA does dealing with controlling drugs that destroy lives in this \ncountry. Sure, is it a process that sometimes might take time? Yes. But \nthat time is well worth taking.\n  Down the road, we are going to get to the proper industrial hemp \nproduction. It has got to be done under controlled processes. The DEA \nhas these in place. The Department of Agriculture has these protocols \nin place. State departments of agriculture do.\n  This amendment is just unnecessary. And worse than that, it obscures \nthe fact that it could tie DEA's hands from doing what it needs to do, \nwhich is controlling dangerous substances.\n  I urge the body to reject the amendment, and I yield back the balance \nof my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Massie).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Kentucky \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Massie\n\n  Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to treat ammunition as armor piercing for purposes of \n     chapter 44 of title 18, United States Code, except for \n     ammunition designed and intended for use in a handgun (in \n     accordance with 18 U.S.C. section 921(a)(17)).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Kentucky and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky.\n  Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Chairman, back in March, the ATF backed off on a \ncontroversial proposal to restrict the use of so-called ``green tip'' \nammunition, some of the most popular ammunition in the country. In \nfact, it is used in the popular rifle, the AR-15.\n  The BATFE received over 80,000 comments, primarily from citizens who \nopposed the Bureau's attempt to restrict their Second Amendment rights. \nAnd so the ATF rescinded its proposal.\n  In my opinion, the proposed restriction was based on a flawed \napplication of chapter 44 of title 18 of the United States Code. If you \ngo back and look at the debate that occurred in Congress, you will see \nthat the legislation that was written was clearly meant to cover \nhandgun ammunition. It was never meant to cover rifle ammunition.\n  In fact, there was a debate at the time whether they should limit so-\ncalled ``armor-piercing'' ammunition by its functionality--in other \nwords, its efficacy--or whether they should limit it by its design. And \nthey chose to limit it by its design. Because if you limit it by its \nfunctionality, what you will find out is darn near all rifle \nammunition, unfortunately, will penetrate the common vest. In fact, the \nmost lethal are deer rifles. And so a deer rifle is more lethal in \nterms of penetrating a vest than would be, say, a so-called assault \nrifle that shoots a much smaller caliber.\n  In any case, what happened is one pistol was made and came on the \nmarket--or a few pistols were made, handguns were made--that could be \nchambered with this round, but the round was designed and intended for \nuse in a rifle, not in a handgun.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  The clear text of the statute, in my opinion, excludes rifle rounds, \nbut what has happened is recently, the ATF--now, this is only one \nexample that I have recently--they proposed to ban the green tip \nammunition, otherwise known as M855 or SS109. This is 223, also known \nas 556 ammunition. Well, there was a lot of public backlash, and so \nthey backed off of that.\n  What a lot of people don't know is they already did ban some \nammunition with this flawed interpretation. They banned the 7N6, which \nis a 5.45 by 39 round, and so it was a mistake that happened, and we \nneed to correct this mistake.\n  We need to prevent future mistakes. The best way to do this is to \nwithhold funding for flawed interpretations.\n\n[[Page H3792]]\n\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FATTAH. I was in support of the gentleman's first amendment; but, \nin this instance, we are at a different point of view.\n  I note that the majority has a lot of enthusiasm for gun amendments \non this appropriations bill, and it is making it almost impossible for \nus to deal with the challenges for the subcommittee around spending \nwhen we keep getting mired down in this, these gun policy riders.\n  I would just say that it is obviously the majority's view that this \nsomehow is an appropriate vehicle to express your love for guns of all \ntypes, ammunition of all types.\n  I think that my view would be we should make it permissible for any \ngun that you could bring into the Capitol, you should be able to bring \ninto schools or colleges, or any ammunition you could bring into the \nCapitol, you could use in any weapon. That might be a way to proceed.\n  The majority doesn't have any enthusiasm for the Second Amendment \nwhen it comes to people coming into the United States Capitol because \nwe know that guns can be dangerous. We know that people can be harmed.\n  We know, in fact, that there were Members, when an attack happened \nright here on this floor--that is why we have, on the back of these \nchairs, certain protections--who were shot from this balcony.\n  We know the dangers of guns and ammunition, and it is unfortunate \nthat we would use an appropriations vehicle to move these policy \nmatters, which are controversial.\n  You want to attach them to a must-pass appropriations bill, one that \nis about our economy and about innovation, and an appropriations bill \nthat is dealing with a whole set of issues. You make it challenging for \nMembers who have a different point of view on some of these \ncontroversial policy issues, like guns and the access to them.\n  Some might interpret the Second Amendment that says, if you want a \nbazooka or MX missile or whatever you want to have at your home, that \nsomehow you have a right to have it.\n  There are others of us who think that reasonable regulation might be \na better course of action, like the kind of reasonable regulation we \nhave at the Capitol, which is that you can't bring a gun into this \nfacility, unless you have some lawful reason to do so, and we regulate \nthat very strictly.\n  I am in opposition to this amendment. I have nothing against my \ncolleague, whom I enjoy working with on a whole range of issues. I \nagree with him on hemp, and I disagree with him on guns.\n  I hope that we can move this bill forward, as we have been trying to \ndo since the chairman's mark in the subcommittee, and not get it mired \ndown in unnecessary, controversial items that are not attached to how \nmuch money we are going to spend for these various accounts to move \nthese agencies of our government forward.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. FATTAH. I yield to the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Madam Chair, I thank my good friend from Pennsylvania. \nI do, as he knows, support this amendment because it has become \nnecessary to put restrictions like this on the bill because the ATF, \nunder President Obama, did attempt to prohibit 223 ammunition, which is \nused in one of the most popular and widely available sporting rifles in \nthe United States.\n  The new Director of the ATF, Tom Brandon, I want to thank him and \nprofessional law enforcement officers at the ATF. They came in to see \nme when I was the brand-new chairman of the subcommittee earlier this \nyear.\n  We had a very good visit. We looked at the statute, and Director \nBrandon and his chief counsel understood that the guidelines that they \nhad created went beyond the statute. They recognized that they were \ngoing to have a very difficult budget year if they persisted in this \neffort to interfere with American's lawful, constitutional Second \nAmendment rights.\n  I was very grateful that Director Brandon chose to drop their \nattempted prohibition on 223 ammunition after our meeting and in \nresponse to the 80,000 letters and all the requests from Members of \nCongress. The ATF did the right thing here by dropping their attempt to \nban ammunition.\n  Mr. Massie's amendment is necessary because I think it is important \nto make it clear that we don't want the Obama administration coming \nback and attempting to ban ammunition again.\n  I remember, as a student of American history, that General Gage, in \nBoston, didn't go after the weapons first. They went after the powder \nand the ammunition, I believe, Mr. Massie, in Lexington and Concord.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Reclaiming my time with just a question, Mr. Chairman, \nmaybe you could inform me, but I believe that the restrictions on \narmor-piercing bullets predate the administration that you just named. \nIs that accurate?\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Yes, but the ATF was attempting to use--the statute \nsays you cannot use armor-piercing ammunition that includes depleted \nuranium, beryllium, and it has some very specific things.\n  As Mr. Massie said, the Congress was focused on the content of the \nbullet, rather than what type of weapon it could be used in. In the \nATF's guideline, actually, the ATF created a legal framework for \nanalysis, which is fairly standard for this administration.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mrs. Black). The time of the gentleman from \nPennsylvania has expired.\n  Mr. MASSIE. Madam Chair, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Kentucky has 2\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. MASSIE. I gladly yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nCulberson), the chairman.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Let me say that it is important to have Mr. Massie's \nlanguage in this bill because the ATF, in this instance, just as in the \nEPA's attempt to regulate every square inch of the United States by \nsaying navigable waters include any piece of ground on which the water \ndrains off into a navigable stream, the EPA, the ATF, the Obama \nadministration routinely uses what they call a legal framework for \nanalysis to expand their executive authority far beyond what Congress \nintended.\n  In this instance, I was successful with the help of my colleagues. As \nthe new chairman of the subcommittee, I was successful in persuading \nDirector Brandon and the ATF to drop their attempt to ban 223 \nammunition, and I will be monitoring them closely. I will be exercising \nvery aggressive oversight over the ATF to ensure that they don't try it \nagain.\n  I welcome Mr. Massie's amendment to help drive home the point that \nthe Second Amendment of the United States Constitution is written in \nplain English, and it guarantees, absolutely, the right of Americans to \nkeep and bear arms.\n  I welcome your amendment, Mr. Massie, and encourage Members to \nsupport it.\n  Mr. MASSIE. I appreciate that. I appreciate the effort that the \nchairman put in to making sure that our 556, 223 ammunition did not get \nbanned. I appreciate my colleague from Pennsylvania's comments as well.\n  Let me say something. I am sympathetic to the ATF's job. We write \nsome bad legislation here, okay. It is clear it has got gray areas. \nWhat I am trying to do is to clear up a gray area for them so that, \nwhen they go to work in the morning, they don't have to wonder should \nthis apply to this or should this apply to this or not.\n  Even with the chairman's great efforts, the reason why this is \nnecessary is because the same rationale that they were going to use to \nban 556, they actually used a year or two ago to ban 5.45, which is a \nvery similar round in composition and size and capacity. That is why \nthis amendment is necessary.\n\n  My colleague from Pennsylvania is right. I do love guns; I have an \nenthusiasm, but the reason I am doing this is my respect for the \nConstitution. I understand you have respect for the Constitution as \nwell; I do. We just interpret it a little bit differently.\n  This is not a bazooka amendment. This is just an ammunition \namendment, and I am just trying to make sure this very popular caliber \nand other popular calibers are still able to be bought.\n\n[[Page H3793]]\n\n  I appreciate the efforts that everybody puts in to making sure these \nlaws are enforced. I just want to clear up this law. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Madam Chair, I move to strike the last word.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FATTAH. I am going to yield to the gentleman from New York on \nthis point. I just want to say something.\n  The point I made was that this restriction on armor-piercing bullets \ndid not emanate with this administration, even though some might want \nto suggest somehow that this is President Obama's effort.\n  This dates back to a different period of time, when we had a \nRepublican President, and it was put into place to protect law \nenforcement because the children who have been unfortunate victims of \ngunshots in their schools or in movie theaters and other circumstances \nwhere we have had these mass shootings, they haven't been wearing \nbulletproof vests.\n  Bulletproof vests are used by our law enforcement officials. There \nwas a concern to make sure that they could be protected while they were \nout protecting us, right? I just want to be clear, as we go forward, \nwhat we are doing here and so that everybody who takes an action on \nthis and, however they may vote, understands that they are voting to \nprovide a circumstance in which there won't be any restriction on the \npiercing power of the projectile, right?\n  When it is pointed at a human being, it can be deadly, so I just want \nus to be clear.\n  I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel), and I will keep \ntrack that he doesn't go over 2 minutes.\n  Mr. ENGEL. I thank the gentleman for yielding to me. I must rise and \noppose this amendment.\n  Earlier this year, ATF recognized the threat posed by armor-piercing \nhandguns and tried to limit the sale of the green tip 556 round, which \nis the military-made armor-piercing round that fits into pistols. This \nwould have made sense.\n  When ATF tried to make that change, the industry decried executive \noverreach and hidden administrative agendas and shouted down this \ncommonsense proposal. I supported the ATF's proposal then, and I still \nbelieve that this and other commonsense regulations on armor-piercing \nhandguns are sorely needed.\n  I introduced the APB Act to enact the ATF's proposed change into law \nbecause we have a responsibility to protect our police and our \ncommunities from these unreasonably dangerous weapons.\n  A hunter does not need a Sig Sauer P556 or an Extar EXP or any of the \nother pistols that can fire these armor-piercing rounds. These \nconcealed weapons serve only one purpose: to kill human beings wearing \nbody armor.\n  ATF needs the authority to monitor and regulate firearms and \nammunition. When technology advances, like it did with the green tip, \nATF needs to be able to act to protect our neighborhoods and our law \nenforcement. This amendment, I believe, would needlessly strip ATF's \nauthority to regulate dangerous armor-piercing bullets and put cops, \nkids, and our communities at risk.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I thank the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Text is most helpful when put in context. It is true that \nthe Constitution says that it is a citizen's right to keep and bear \narms, but it says that as part of a well-regulated militia.\n  When we want to focus in on the Second Amendment, it may be helpful \nfor us to have a contextual framework in which the right is connected \nto responsible and regulated activity on behalf of our community.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Madam Chair, I move to strike the last word for a very \nimportant clarification.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. My colleague, Mr. Engel, I think may not have the \nexact amendment in front of him because all Mr. Massie is attempting to \ndo is enforce existing law and make it clear that the ATF has to \nenforce existing law, as written, and that armor-piercing ammunition \ncannot be used in handguns.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  That is what the law says. The law says an armor-piercing round is \none that uses depleted uranium or other materials and is used in a \nhandgun. And that is all this amendment says.\n  So we, by accepting this amendment, are enforcing existing law, which \nis to prevent the use of armor-piercing ammunition in a handgun. So it \nis important that, I think, everyone understand that that is all this \namendment is intended to do. And I will, as subcommittee chairman, make \ncertain that the ATF does not interfere with Americans' Second \nAmendment rights under the Constitution and that the ATF is enforcing \nthe law, as written by Congress, which is precisely what the gentleman \nfrom Kentucky (Mr. Massie) is doing, and I urge Members to support his \namendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Massie).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. MASSIE. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Kentucky be \npostponed.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Massie\n\n  Mr. MASSIE. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk regarding \nthe National Institute of Standards and Technology.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 543.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the National Institute of Standards and Technology \n     to consult with the National Security Agency or the Central \n     Intelligence Agency to alter cryptographic or computer \n     standards, except to improve information security (in \n     accordance with section 20(c)(1)(A) of the National Institute \n     of Standards and Technology Act (15 U.S.C. 278g-3(c)(1)(A))).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Kentucky and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky.\n  Mr. MASSIE. Madam Chair, In December of 2013, news broke--and this \nwas in a Reuters article--that, as a key part of a ``campaign to embed \nencryption software that it could crack into widely used computer \nproducts, the U.S. National Security Agency arranged a secret $10 \nmillion contract with'' a private company--in fact, ``one of the most \ninfluential firms in the computer security industry.''\n  It was further disclosed that ``an algorithm called Dual Elliptic \nCurve . . . was on the road to approval by the National Institute of \nStandards and Technology as one of four acceptable methods for \ngenerating random numbers.''\n  The company adopted this algorithm, knowing that it would be used as \na standard, and it was, as expected, approved by the National Institute \nof Standards and Technology. But ``within a year, major questions were \nraised about Dual Elliptic Curve. Cryptography authority Bruce Schneier \nwrote that the weakness in the formula `can only be described as a back \ndoor.'''\n  This is just one example of the NSA exploiting its relationship with \nNIST to weaken encryption standards.\n  Look, NIST, we would like for them to set the highest standards for \nour country, particularly when it comes to encryption. Weakened \nencryption standards allow the NSA to snoop on Americans without a \nwarrant.\n  So these back doors in encryption products are bad for privacy. It \nmakes it just way too easy to violate our Fourth Amendment.\n  But back doors in encryption software are also bad for security. \nThink about this: Don't you want the best security available that the \nminds in this country can create, produce, to safeguard your health \nrecords, maybe to safeguard your gun records, maybe to safeguard your \nbank accounts and your credit cards.\n\n[[Page H3794]]\n\n  We are more safe when we have better security and better encryption. \nSo it makes no sense for the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology to work with the NSA to weaken our encryption software.\n  Finally, putting back doors in products is bad for business. It is \nbad for privacy. It is bad for security. And it is bad for business.\n  Why is it bad for business? Why would somebody buy a product made in \nAmerica if it is known that the standards in America are weaker than \nthe standards elsewhere? You know, if there are back doors in products, \nit is not just the government that can use them: hackers will find \nthem. In fact, once the weakness was exposed in this Dual Elliptic \nCurve, it made it very easy for people to hack into that, and the \ncompany had to say, Quit using this software. We found a weakness in \nit.\n  So I would urge people to vote for this amendment. What it does is it \nprevents the spending of money at the National Institute of Standards \nand Technology to work with the NSA to weaken our encryption.\n  The amendment does nothing to keep them from making better \nencryption, but they cannot weaken it. They cannot compromise it. They \ncan't spend your tax dollars making American products and our \ngovernment standards worse.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Madam Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, \nalthough I support the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Madam Chair, we accept the amendment, agree with the \nreasoning that the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Massie) has laid forth. \nI believe the amendment is acceptable to the minority as well. So the \namendment is agreed to unanimously.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MASSIE. What is the balance of my time remaining, Madam Chair?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Kentucky has 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. MASSIE. Madam Chair, I will just summarize why this is an \nimportant amendment.\n  We trust the National Institute of Standards and Technology to \nperform their constitutionally mandated responsibilities. That is one \nof the great things about NIST: its authorization is in the \nConstitution, to set the standards of weights and measures. So I \nappreciate the job they do. But we put a lot of trust into them when \nthey set these standards. And a lot of people make business decisions. \nIt is kind of like the Good Housekeeping seal of approval, if I may use \nthat analogy.\n  So, when we stamp something as a government-approved standard, we \nwant to know it is the best in the world, that the United States has \nthe best encryption in their products, the best encryption. We want the \nproducts that our government buys to be safe. So it would be wrong for \nNIST to spend money working to put back doors in our products. That is \nwhy I urge our colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Madam Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Houston, Texas (Mr. Poe), my good friend and \ncolleague.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. I thank the chairman for yielding time to me.\n  Madam Chair, I would like to try to interpret what has been said in a \nsimpler way.\n  Assume that the builders in the United States get together and they \nare given a new requirement: that when they build a new house, the \nFederal Government wants the option to have a master key to a back \ndoor--not only a back door but a secret back door so that at some time \ndown the road, maybe the Federal Government would like to enter that \nsecret back door for some purpose. And that is what this amendment is \npreventing.\n  Just like we wouldn't let the Federal Government have a key to our \nback door or require builders to put a master key in all of the new \nhomes that they build in the country and give the key to the \ngovernment, we would never allow that. That would certainly be in \nviolation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution.\n  All this amendment does is it prevents technology--when technology is \ngrowing at a rapid rate--to prevent the Federal Government from \nrequiring companies that make cell phones, for example, that there be \nan ability of the Federal Government to go in the cell phone and look \naround, even without the knowledge of the person who owns the cell \nphone. This is very similar to the bill that passed unanimously last \nnight. So I urge the adoption to this amendment as well.\n  I thank the chairman for allowing me to speak on the gentleman from \nKentucky's amendment, since he ran out of time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I am glad to do so.\n  Madam Chair, again, the amendment is agreed to unanimously. I \nstrongly support the gentleman from Kentucky's amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Massie).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. MASSIE. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Kentucky \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Gosar\n\n  Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to carry out the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, \n     Firearms, and Explosives Special Advisory entitled ``Test, \n     Examination and Classification of 7N6 5.45x39 Ammunition'', \n     dated April 7, 2014. The limitation described in this section \n     shall not apply in the case of the administration of a tax or \n     tariff.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chair, I rise today to stand with my colleague from \nKentucky (Mr. Massie) and with sportsmen and law-abiding gun owners \nthroughout the country.\n  Over the course of the last year, we have seen numerous misguided \nattempts by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to \nmisclassify ammunition as ``armor-piercing'' and infringe on the Second \nAmendment rights of our citizens.\n  At a forum I held at the end of March in Prescott, Arizona, a large \nnumber of my constituents expressed their outrage about ATF \nreclassifying the imported 7N6, commonly known as the 5.45 x 39 \nammunition, as ``armor-piercing,'' thus preventing this ammo from being \nimported.\n  7N6 ammo is very affordable and has been used for target practice by \nsportsmen for years. The administration--especially the ATF, as we have \nseen with Operation Fast and Furious and recent attempts to ban the \ngreen tip ammo--has a penchant for interpreting the law as it sees fit \nor as it is most convenient for them.\n  Fortunately, we have at least temporarily beaten back the attempt to \nban the .223 green tip ammo after 230 different Members of this body, \nChairman Culberson, and myself encouraged ATF to drop this misguided \nattempt. But the 7N6 ammunition ban is yet another example of Federal \noverreach on the part of the administration.\n  After years of having a sportsmen exemption, 7N6 was reclassified \nafter ATF found an extremely rare and obscure Polish-made pistol that \ncould supposedly use and shoot the 7N6 cartridge.\n  I strongly applaud the committee for including four other commonsense \nprovisions in this bill that protect the Second Amendment.\n  I ask that this body stand with sportsmen throughout this country. I \nask that my colleagues support this additional, commonsense provision \nto protect the Second Amendment and allow the 7N6 ammo to be used for \ntarget practice.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n\n[[Page H3795]]\n\n  Mr. FATTAH. Madam Chair, I guess redundancy has some utility here \nbecause we have been around the rosie a number of times on this same \nissue, both late last night and now early this afternoon, one amendment \nafter another amendment after another amendment, trying to make sure \nthat our fascination with armor-piercing bullets doesn't escape this \ndebate.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  So here we have another one, and maybe there is something different \nabout this one than the one before, but I am not able to discern what \nit is. I am opposed to it.\n  I think that people have a right to weapons under our Constitution. I \nthink common sense suggests people should have a right to weapons, long \nguns, rifles, for both sports activities and for their own protection. \nI also think that it is a responsible thing for those who are governing \nour country to put in place reasonable regulations and restrictions \njust like the regulations and restrictions that we have here on the \nCapitol campus.\n  Not only do we spend hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' \nmoney for our own police force to protect us, we also say that you \ncan't bring a firearm into the buildings that we work in each and every \nday.\n  Now, we do this even though we come to the floor and profess our \nundying love for the unfettered notion of the Second Amendment as \ninterpreted by some that you can have a gun anywhere, in a bar, in a \npark, in a school, in a daycare center, and at church. Take your gun \nand ride off into the wind with it. But we won't allow it here.\n  I am just waiting for a Member of the majority, since we have \nmultiple amendments, to come to the floor and to say that people should \nbe able to exercise their Second Amendment here when they visit the \npeople's House, when they visit their elected Representatives, that \nsomehow we want to welcome them and their guns with their armor-\npiercing bullets, and then I would know that you truly love the Second \nAmendment and that you see it as an unfettered right anywhere, anytime, \nand under any circumstances.\n  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Culberson), the chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Madam Chair, I strongly support the gentleman's \namendment, and it is necessary because the ATF, once again, here \nattempted to ban ammunition that could be used in a handgun that is \notherwise commonly available for rifles. In the statute, the Congress \nintended to prohibit the use of armor-piercing ammunition for handguns. \nSo the gentleman's amendment is necessary, and I strongly support the \namendment as, again, additional protection for Americans' \nconstitutional Second Amendment rights to keep and bear arms.\n  I would point out to my good friend from Pennsylvania that at the \nTexas Capitol, concealed-carry permit holders are actually given a \nseparate line so they can get into the capitol even more rapidly \nbecause law enforcement officers in Texas recognize that a concealed-\ncarry permit holder is their best backup because they have had a \nbackground check and they are trained in the use of the weapon.\n  I coauthored the legislation in Texas in the 1990s to allow Texans to \nget a concealed-carry permit, and we have prevented a lot of crimes and \nsaved a lot of lives. I don't think there has even been a fistfight \namong concealed-carry permit holders in Texas in all these years. They \nare given expedited access to the Texas Capitol because law enforcement \nrecognizes an honest, law-abiding American with a concealed-carry \npermit is their best friend.\n  I support the gentleman's amendment, and I urge its passage.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Massie), my friend.\n  Mr. MASSIE. Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from Arizona's \nleadership on this issue, and my profound gratitude and immense respect \nto Chairman Culberson for making sure that this interpretation that was \napplied to 5.45 ammunition was not applied to 5.56. He has the \ngratitude of millions of gun owners in this country--law-abiding gun \nowners, I should say.\n  This travesty of justice still applies to this other caliber, using \nthe same reasoning. I won't impugn the motives of the ATF. I won't do \nthat. I think they are just trying to enforce the law. There is a gray \narea here, and I think this bill clears up that gray area for the \nbenefit of millions of gun owners--law-abiding gun owners--in this \ncountry, and I thank Representative Gosar for leading on this.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chair, what I would like to do is highlight that \nonly an obscure pistol could use this 7N6 ammunition. So I was going \nout of the way for a very popular round that is used for target \npractice all over this country. So I would ask for support for my \namendment.\n  I thank the gentleman for helping me, and I yield back the balance of \nmy time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Issa\n\n  Mr. ISSA. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, before the short title, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to operate or disseminate a cell-site simulator or \n     IMSI catcher in the United States except pursuant to a court \n     order that identifies an individual, account, address, or \n     personal device\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. ISSA. Madam Chair, I rise today to offer this amendment, and it \nbecomes necessary because selective spying by using these devices \ncommonly called StingRays or cell site simulators or IMSI catchers has \nbecome a reality.\n  These sophisticated, affordable mobile devices in fact spoof or \nconvince your phone that they are a valid cell tower and allow for the \ngathering of communications content, including texts and emails.\n  What is disturbing is that Federal dollars may be being used to \ncapture tens of thousands of Americans' information without a warrant. \nThe Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, the Associated Press, and \nmore have, in fact, uncovered cases of nationwide use by the FBI and \nother agencies working to cover up StingRay use in instances in which \nthey have, among other things, dropped criminal cases to avoid having \nto disclose their use of them. Additionally, they have entered into \nnondisclosure agreements at times in order to not do so.\n  Just a month ago, this House--and the Senate, a few days ago--passed, \noverwhelmingly, a new authorization of the PATRIOT Act. We did so with \na careful balance between what our government can do to us and what \nprotections we have, and particularly the Fourth Amendment.\n  This is a narrowly crafted amendment. It in no way stops the use of \nthese devices when a Federal court has ordered and allowed the use, \neither a FISA court or a common warrant issued by a judge.\n  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition, but I am not \nin opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania \nis recognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Madam Chair, I concur with the gentleman's amendment, and \nI yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ISSA. At this time, Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Farenthold).\n  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Madam Chair, I rise in support of our amendment today \nthat I am working on with Mr. Issa.\n  Madam Chair, the Associated Press reported yesterday that they \nconfirmed reports that the FBI is flying surveillance cameras in \naircraft over the U.S. with these devices. They are operated sometimes \nthrough shell companies that use video and StingRay technology to \ncapture data on Americans\n\n[[Page H3796]]\n\nin bulk both visually and from our cell phones.\n  This flies in the face of every concept of liberty and privacy that \nwe cherish in this country. Our Founding Fathers would be sickened if \nthey found out how far we have slipped. As much as I have been \nencouraged by the fact that both Houses of Congress have passed the USA \nFREEDOM Act to end bulk surveillance under section 215 of the PATRIOT \nAct, reports like this show me we still have a long way to go.\n  This secretive FBI program to hack into our cellphones seems far from \nappropriate and constitutional, and it must be curtailed. This \namendment would ensure that any usage of this program would only happen \nthrough a court order targeting a specific individual and never as a \ndragnet for bulk surveillance.\n  I am happy to hear that there is very little opposition to this, and \nI look forward to working to continue to regain our liberty from mass \nand unconstitutional surveillance.\n  Mr. ISSA. Madam Chair, I have no further speakers. I urge passage, \nand I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Issa).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Flores\n\n  Mr. FLORES. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to further implementation of the coastal and marine \n     spatial planning and ecosystem-based management components of \n     the National Ocean Policy developed under Executive Order \n     13547.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. FATTAH. Madam Chair, I rise to assert a point of order on this \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman will state his point of order.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Madam Chair, I make a point of order against the \namendment because it proposes to change existing law and constitutes \nlegislation in an appropriation bill and, therefore, violates clause 2 \nof rule XXI.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point \nof order?\n  Mr. FLORES. Madam Chair, this amendment does not change existing law. \nIt just removes the funding for an unconstitutional, unstatutory action \nby the President.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  Madam Chair, it seems like I have caused some excitement with the \nParliamentarian this afternoon, so why don't I do this.\n  I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment and go to the \nsecond Flores amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  June 3, 2015, on page H3796, the following appeared: There was \nno objection.

Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. ___. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to implement Executive Order 13547 (75 Fed. Reg. \n     43023, relating to the stewardship of oceans, coasts, and the \n     Great Lakes), including the National Ocean Policy developed \n     under such Executive Order.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. FLORES. Madam Chair, I rise today to offer a simple amendment to \naddress an ongoing overreach by the executive branch of our government.\n  My amendment bans the use of Federal funds for the implementation of \nExecutive Order 13547. That executive order, which was signed in 2010, \nrequires that 60-plus bureaucracies, as shown on this chart, \nessentially zone the oceans and the sources thereof.\n  This amendment addresses a critical executive branch encroachment \ninto the powers of Congress as set forth in our Constitution. The \nactivities being conducted by Executive Order 13547 have not been \nauthorized by Congress, nor have appropriations been made by Congress \nto fund those activities.\n  Madam Chair, since 2010, this body has voted six times in support of \nthis amendment in a bipartisan manner. This language was also included \nin the base text of the fiscal year 2016 Energy and Water Development \nAppropriations bill. Today, I am offering my amendment again because \nconcerns have been raised that the effects of the National Ocean Policy \nextend well beyond restricting ocean activities and encroach into \ninland activities.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Madam Chair, I visited Chicago a few years back for the \ncoastal zone conference to talk about how important it was that this \nadministration has finally put forward, and we support, an ocean \npolicy. There have been since 2012 over 15 different amendments seeking \nto undermine responsible ecosystem-based management of our oceans.\n  As appropriators, we have not been willing to accept these efforts to \nundermine this. We understand we have a responsibility as stewards. In \nfact, as a Nation we have more responsibility for the world's oceans \nthan any other Nation in terms of territorially in the world.\n  We have some challenging circumstances. It is good that we now have a \npolicy going forward. I would ask that the House oppose this amendment.\n  I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. \nCicilline), the former mayor and a great Congressman.\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Chair, I rise in strong opposition to the Flores \namendment, which would prohibit the implementation of the National \nOcean Policy, which permits better coordination among Federal agencies \nresponsible for coastal planning.\n  This amendment, in particular, would undermine NOAA's participation \nin planning, it would hurt States and communities, businesses, and \nwould impede States like Rhode Island from managing their own resources \nin a way that best fits their needs and priorities.\n  This administration has made it clear that the National Ocean Policy \ndoes not create new regulations, supersede current regulations, or \nmodify any agency's established mission, jurisdiction, or authority. \nRather, it helps coordinate the implementation of existing regulations \nby Federal agencies to establish a more efficient and effective \ndecisionmaking process.\n  In the Northeast, our regional ocean council has allowed our State to \npool resources and businesses to have a voice in decisionmaking and has \ncoordinated with Federal partners to ensure all stakeholders have a \nvoice in the process.\n  It is astounding to me that since 2012, 15 riders undermining ocean \nplanning have been introduced to House bills, including riders on two \nprevious CJS appropriations bills.\n  Allowing Federal agencies to coordinate implementation of over 100 \nocean laws and giving States and local governments a voice in the ocean \nplanning process is smart public policy.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this misguided amendment and to \nunderstand and accept our responsibility to be good stewards of our \noceans. That is what the administration's policy does. This is allowing \nagencies to coordinate that work in a thoughtful, strategic, and smart \nway.\n  Mr. FLORES. Madam Chair, I again reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Madam Chair, who has the right to close?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has the right to \nclose.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FLORES. Madam Chair, first of all, I think it is important to set \nthe record straight. The issue here is not whether or not we want to \ntake care of our oceans. All of us want to take care of our oceans. All \nof us believe in managing the ocean economy, the ocean\n\n[[Page H3797]]\n\necology. We also believe in trying to make sure that we have a \ngovernment that adheres to this Constitution. Under article I of that \nConstitution, all legislative powers are reserved to this body, to this \nCongress, not to the President. That is the issue at stake here. The \nPresident has overstepped his constitutional statutory bounds.\n  Now, in the year 2000, Congress did pass something during the 106th \nCongress to create an ocean commission to review and make \nrecommendations. Since then, the 108th, 109th, 110th, and 111th \nCongresses each looked at those recommendations and decided to take no \nlegislative action.\n  That is what caused the President to move forward with his executive \norder to try to go around Congress. There are no appropriations. We \nhave asked the Department for this function specifically. We have asked \nthe Department of Interior specifically to provide their statutory \nsupport for the President's actions. They have provided none. So the \nPresident has gone around Congress by signing these executive orders.\n  There are 67 groups that include fishing, agricultural, farming, \nenergy, and other industries that are concerned about the impact of \nthis Federal overreach--and again, I would say an unconstitutional \nFederal overreach.\n  Again, this is a simple amendment that just stands up for the \nconstitutional rights of this Congress to create the statutes under \nwhich this activity can be conducted and to transparently appropriate \nthe funds for this activity should it so choose.\n  We are not against ocean planning, as I said at the outset of this. \nWhat we are for, though, is for the Constitution and to stand up for \nour congressional rights to enact the statutes related to this activity \nand for the appropriators to be able to transparently appropriate the \nmoney.\n  Again, this amendment has been adopted with bipartisan support six \ntimes over the last 4\\1/2\\ years and is already included in the base \ntext of the fiscal year 2016 Energy and Water Appropriations bill.\n  I want to thank Chairman Culberson for considering this amendment, \nand I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Madam Chair, can I inquire how much time is remaining.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 2\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Farr).\n  Mr. FARR. Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  What selective memory you have. You say that the President is abusing \nhis authority. Do you know who first asked for this? President Bush. He \nis the one that created the Commission and asked for those \nrecommendations.\n  And guess what? Five Republicans authored that bill--Republicans \nGreenwood, Bilbray, Gilchrest, Horn, and Franks. That was in 2000 and \n2004 they introduced it. The bill went to committee, and the committee \nnever heard the bill. So don't say that Congress never had a chance to \nenact this thing. Congress refused, just like Congress refuses to \nrespond to the President's ask that we ought to decide whether we ought \nto go to war in the Middle East.\n  You are very selective. You say, Don't let the President make these \nexecutive orders, and then when he does you want to sue him because it \nis about immigration or issues like that. You criticize this President \nbecause Congress fails to take action, even after Presidents--\nRepublican and Democratic Presidents--have asked Congress to take \naction, and we refused. And now you get up and say, Well, because we \nrefused, you took executive action, therefore, we ought to not allow it \nto be implemented.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Members will address their remarks to the Chair.\n  Mr. FARR. Thank you, Madam Chair. I am referring the remarks to the \nMadam Chair.\n  Look, deleting this ability for the National Ocean Policy--by the \nway, we haven't appropriated money. No money is being spent on it. But \nwe are smart about getting 70 or 80 Federal agencies together to have \none stop to figure out how we can get all these permits. That is why \nthe fishermen support it.\n  I live in a coastal community. The author of this does not. We make \nour living off the ocean. And, by God, we want all the regulatory \nagencies to be in sync. And one of the policies here is, let's have a \nhealthy ocean. What is wrong with that?\n  Mr. FATTAH. Madam Chair, if the oceans die, it is impossible for us \nto live.\n  The Pew Foundation in Philadelphia has put hundreds of millions of \ndollars behind efforts around ocean science. My friend, Gerry Lenfest, \nhas put a lot of his own fortune behind this effort. When I first got \nto the Congress, I was chair of the Friends of the Caribbean Caucus. We \nshould do better by our oceans.\n  I ask that we oppose this, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Flores).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n           Amendment Offered by Mr. Duncan of South Carolina\n\n  Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to prosecute or hold liable any person or corporation \n     for a violation of section 2(a) of the Migratory Bird Treaty \n     Act (16 U.S.C. 703(a)).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom South Carolina and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Madam Chair, the question we should ask \nourselves is, should green energy companies be held liable for \nincidental deaths of birds of prey or migratory birds as a result of \nthem flying into wind turbines or onto solar arrays.\n  As you may know, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 and the Bald \nand Golden Eagle Protection Act, while well-intentioned, are \nsignificantly outdated.\n  Under current law, the accidental death of a protected bird is \npunishable as a misdemeanor; a second offense can be charged as a \nfelony. This includes accidental deaths caused by wind turbines and \nsolar panels.\n  The MBTA covers over 1,000 different species of birds. The Migratory \nBird Treaty Act and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act were \nwritten to target the intentional killing of migratory birds and birds \nof prey. I don't think anybody believes that accidental deaths as a \nresult of solar panels or wind energy production warrants felony \nprosecution.\n  Every year, cars, trucks, skyscrapers, windmills, oil platforms, \nairplanes, and houses with big windows cause the deaths of hundreds of \nthousands of these protected birds, doing things that are otherwise \nwell within the law but that make drivers, pilots, property owners, and \ngreen energy companies potential felons under a strict interpretation \nof an outdated law.\n  As you can imagine, the enforcement of this law is pretty spotty, \nwith bureaucrats selectively enforcing these regulations, creating \nuncertainty in the green energy marketplace.\n  President Obama's Fish and Wildlife Service recently announced plans \nto study the possibility of creating a permitting regime under the \nMBTA, which would allow for incidental and accidental take without \ncriminal penalty, and they have suspended prosecutions until this is \nworked out. I agree with this approach. That is consistent with a bill \nI introduced--my CLEAN Energy Producers Act, H.R. 493.\n  My amendment today to the Commerce-Justice-Science Appropriations \nbill will suspend further prosecutions for incidental avian deaths \nunder the Migratory Bird Treaty Act until this incidental take \npermitting regime is implemented.\n  I believe this is the right step as we move toward permanent reforms \nof the MBTA and the BGEPA as a part of the\n\n[[Page H3798]]\n\nnational all-of-the-above energy independence strategy.\n  I would urge a ``yes'' vote on this important issue, and I reserve \nthe balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  Mr. FARR. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FARR. Madam Chair, what is broken that needs fixing? These are \nlaws that have been in place for 100 years. In fact, they are laws that \nhave been implemented because the United States has signed treaties \nwith other countries that share our migratory fowl, countries like \nCanada, Mexico, Japan, and Russia. These are treaties that require that \nwe be responsible for the wildlife that flies over our air space and \nlands in our soil.\n  Migratory birds are integrated into a healthy, natural system. In \nmany ways, they affect the predators, the prey, the seed dispensers, \nand the pollinators. They are really actively appreciated by millions \nof people. We have a society in America called the National Audubon \nSociety. We make an awful lot of money in my district off watchable \nwildlife.\n  Why would we want to stop the laws that protect that wildlife? I \nthink this is all about responsible management; but to have an \namendment that says that none of the funds may be available to \nprosecute or hold liable any persons who have violated the law, you are \ndismantling law enforcement's ability to enforce the law where people \nhave violated it--violated it.\n  I think the public of this country does appreciate their watchable \nwildlife, whether they are hunting it or whether they are viewing it, \nand a lot of people make money off of it. I don't think this amendment \nis at all constructive. You are upsetting 100 years of law and \ninternational responsibility that we have as a country in this \nhemisphere.\n  I oppose the amendment and ask people to vote against it.\n  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Madam Chair, I am in full support of \nthe Migratory Bird Treaty Act. I am an avid water fowler; I am an avid \nhunter, and I see how the Migratory Bird Treaty Act has benefited the \nspecies from the heyday of the market hunting and what we saw in the \nearly 1900s.\n  I believe that the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Bald and Golden \nEagle Protection Act were designed to talk about the intentional \nkilling or overharvesting of migratory birds and potential killing of \nbirds of prey.\n  Even the Obama administration recognizes that there is something \nwrong with how we prosecute these cases of incidental and accidental \ndeaths. This simply takes what they are already doing and says let's \njust have a pause until we can work this out in permanent law. That is \nall my amendment does.\n  Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FARR. Well, with all due respect, that is not what your law says. \nIt says:\n\n       None of the funds made available by this act may be used to \n     prosecute or hold liable any person or corporation for a \n     violation of the provision of law found in section 703(a) of \n     title 16 of the United States Code.\n\n  There is no language in here about working anything out. There is no \nlanguage about being responsible managers of the land or flyways.\n  Yes, we have a lot of new equipment up in our energy business, our \nwind energy and our solar energy. Those things, obviously way before \nyou build them, you are supposed to take into account whether they are \nbeing built right in a flyway.\n  We have condors in our area that we have obviously spent a lot of \nmoney trying to revive. People actually spend money to come to very \nexpensive hotels so that they can come see a condor. These are things \nthat you want to protect.\n  To say that none of the funds can be made available to hold liable \npeople that are violating the law seems to me just a reckless act to \nupset 100 years of wildlife management.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, if somebody has \nintentionally violated law, absolutely, they ought to be prosecuted. \nThis amendment is in order because we are dealing with justice and how \nthis is prosecuted. We are saying that the Justice Department can't \nexpend any money to prosecute these incidental accidental deaths.\n  We need an interpretation of law. There is no doubt in my mind that \nwe ought to revisit the MBTA and Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, \nand we will. I am on the Natural Resources Committee. I promise you, \nthis issue will come up; but I think it is appropriate to say we are \ngoing to hold off on expending any money by prosecuting these \naccidental incidental deaths.\n  I would urge my colleagues to vote for this. I think it is the right \nplace and the right time.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FARR. Mr. Chair, in closing, to say that the law says that those \nwho are in violation of law--I mean, how many golden eagles do you have \nto kill and tell the law enforcement you can't do anything about it? \nThis isn't about accidental death. This is people violating the law \nwith an intent. You have to have an intent to do wrong.\n  I think this is a reckless amendment. I hope we defeat it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Duncan of Tennessee). The question is on the \namendment offered by the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Duncan).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Lamborn\n\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to collect information about individuals attending \n     gun shows, by means of an automatic license plate reader, or \n     to retain any information so collected.\n\n  Mr. FARR. I reserve a point of order on this issue.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman from Colorado and a \nMember opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, earlier this year, an email uncovered by \nthe ACLU revealed that the Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA, and \nthe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or ATF, \ncollaborated on a plan to use automatic license plate readers to \nmonitor and collect information about law-abiding citizens attending \ngun shows.\n  Under this program, mere attendance at a gun show would have been \nenough to have one's attendance recorded in a massive DEA database. As \nif that weren't bad enough, the primary purpose of this database is \nasset forfeiture, a controversial practice of seizing motorists' \npossessions if police suspect they are criminal proceeds.\n  In response to inquiries about the uncovered document, the DEA has \nsaid that the proposal was rejected by superiors and never implemented. \nKeep in mind that this was taking place in Phoenix in 2009 at about the \ntime of Fast and Furious, and there were, I believe, rogue projects \ngoing on in that part of the country at the time.\n  We have litigated that as a House against the Department of Justice, \nand they have not supplied the documents that they were supposed to \nhave supplied to Congress.\n  We also held former Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of \nCongress for not providing those documents. This was at a time when, \nperhaps, rogue projects were actually going on in Phoenix. I believe \nthat they were, and I believe that this is one of those.\n  However, the DEA never supplied any documents saying that they \nrejected this project. They blamed it on an underling, and they said it \nwas never implemented. While this assurance is welcome, the fact that \nsuch a proposal was even considered raises very serious privacy \nconcerns.\n  My amendment would prohibit any funds from being used to collect or \nretain information about individuals attending gun shows by means of an \nautomatic license plate reader. This\n\n[[Page H3799]]\n\namendment is supported by the NRA, the National Rifle Association; the \nGun Owners of America; and the ACLU.\n  Automatic license plate readers should not be used to target law-\nabiding citizens who are engaged in their constitutionally protected \nrights. Without strong regulations and greater transparency, this new \ntechnology would only increase the threat of illegitimate government \nsurveillance.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment in order to rein \nin the illegal surveillance of Americans and to send a clear message to \nagencies like the DEA and the ATF that automatic license plate readers \nmust not be used to collect information during constitutionally \nprotected activities.\n  This includes Second Amendment activities, like attending gun shows.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. FARR. Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the amendment \nbecause it proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation \nin an appropriation bill and, therefore, violates clause 2 of rule XXI.\n  That rule states in pertinent part: ``An amendment to a general \nappropriation bill shall not be in order if changing existing law''\n  One of the provisions is that it ``requires a new determination.''\n  I ask for a ruling from the Chair.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point \nof order?\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, let me respond to that by saying that The \nWall Street Journal published an article on January 27 of this year \nwhich quotes what the ACLU uncovered through a Freedom of Information \nAct request to the Department of Justice.\n  In pertinent part, this revelation that was obtained by the ACLU \nreads:\n\n       The DEA Phoenix Division Office is working closely with the \n     Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives on \n     attacking the guns going to ``blank''--that is redacted--and \n     the gun shows to include programs-operations with license \n     plate readers at the gun shows.\n\n  At least some agent or agents within the DEA's Phoenix region \nbelieved that they had the authority to go to gun shows and use \nautomatic license plate recognition technology to, basically, throw out \na dragnet and take in the identities of everyone who was attending a \nconstitutionally protected activity.\n  That is what this amendment attacks. At least some elements within \nthe DEA thought that they had this authority. They thought they had \nthis power.\n  I don't think this is creating any new legislation, because it is \ngoing after a power they believed they already had and believed that \nthey had the ability to exercise.\n  So the withdrawal of funding to something they thought they had the \npower to do is not creating a new oversight or provision. I forget the \nword the gentleman used. It is not legislating in the sense of giving \nthem a power they didn't already have. They thought they had this \npower. This amendment would withdraw the funding for that.\n  I would urge the Chair to reject the point of order raised by the \nopposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point \nof order? If not, the Chair is prepared to rule.\n  The Chair finds that this amendment includes language requiring a new \ndetermination by the relevant Federal officials of whether an \nindividual is attending a gun show. The gentleman from Colorado has not \nproven that this determination is required by existing law.\n  The amendment, therefore, constitutes legislation in violation of \nclause 2 of rule XXI.\n  The point of order is sustained, and the amendment is not in order.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Sanford\n\n  Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, before the short title, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  Each amount made available by this Act (other \n     than an amount required to be made available by a provision \n     of law) is hereby reduced by 2.48 percent.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom South Carolina and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina.\n  Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Chairman, this is a very simple and straightforward \namendment, as has been laid out, which is to, in essence, make an \nacross-the-board cut of this particular appropriation by 2.48 percent.\n  I think it is important to do so simply for this reason. I was in a \nBudget hearing this morning, and the new Director of the Congressional \nBudget Office came by.\n  In his testimony, what he talked about was the way in which the \nAmerican civilization and the Federal budget was nearing a tipping \npoint beyond which there would be substantial consequence to that which \nwe can budget here at the Federal level; to the value of the dollar; to \nfuture interest rates; and, ultimately, to the American way of life.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  I think what is interesting is that, indeed, Admiral Mike Mullen, a \nmilitary man, observed the same, because when he was asked what is the \nbiggest threat to the American way of life and to American security, \nhis answer was the American debt.\n  You can look at a long list of different authors who have talked \nabout this theme in different ways. You know, Reinhart and Rogoff \ntalked about it in their book entitled, ``This Time is Different,'' \nwherein, again, you look at economies that get to around 90 percent \ndebt to GDP and, frankly, the wheels start to come off. Bad things \nbegin to happen both to the economy and to the government's ability to \nperpetuate funding for programs that are important.\n  We have gone through a long list of well-discussed programs within \nthis particular appropriation bill that are important, but for our \ngovernment's ability to sustain those programs, we need to look beyond \n10 or 15 years out. We need to look at the long run, and ultimately \nthat is what this bill is about.\n  I think it is interesting from a nonpartisan standpoint that Erskine \nBowles and Alan Simpson said, if you look at our financial picture, it \nis the most predictable financial collapse or calamity in the history \nof man. I could go through a lot of other reasons numerically as to why \nI think it is important, but the short answer is we are nearing that \ntipping point that was talked about in the Budget hearing this morning.\n  I see my colleague standing, so I will reserve the balance of my time \nand come back to a few other points in a moment.\n  Mr. FARR. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to across-the-board \ncuts.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FARR. Mr. Chairman, I respect the gentleman's presentation, but I \nthink we ought to put it in full context. We do have an across-the-\nboard cut. It is a huge cut. It is called sequestration. Although \nAdmiral Mullen did admonish the Congress for the fact that we were \nrunning a deficit and it was a threat to our national security, he also \nopposed sequestration, across-the-board cuts.\n  I think the problem is--and this bill certainly is an across-the-\nboard cut from what we used to spend, with the exception of the \nprotection of one program, but I oppose this. We are on the Committee \non Appropriations. We try to go through these things with a fine-tooth \ncomb to figure out how to adjust the spending of the United States of \nAmerica. The worst thing you can do is just do an across-the-board cut \nbecause that harms good programs, and you aren't necessarily cutting \nenough to really make a big dent in the national debt.\n  Frankly, the spending of America has come down quite dramatically, \nand the economy has improved, and our national debt is, in the recent \nyears, at an all-time low. I think, frankly, we in Congress talk about \nthis debt but don't put it into context.\n  I like to put it in the context that I talk to my constituents about \nthat what we have at the national level, just like you have at the \nlocal level and your own personal life, you have\n\n[[Page H3800]]\n\nsort of two debts. You have a short-term debt, which is that credit \ncard, you spent too much that one month, so you are going to pay it \nslowly off in the next couple months. That is the annual deficit.\n  The long-term debt is that big mortgage that we have on our houses. \nWe don't panic because of a mortgage. We made an agreement over a \nperiod of time--15, 30 years--that we are going to pay off this \nmortgage, and we know what those payments will be.\n  Wall Street doesn't worry about a deficit when we have a plan to pay \nit off. Wall Street worries about when we take a meat-ax approach to \nnot running the government efficiently, not having enough people to \nprocess people when they need permits and they need access to licenses \nand things like that.\n  So I wish Congress would get off this sort of let's just use a meat-\nax approach to solving these problems because we won't spend the time \nto get into the weeds. And although I respect the gentleman and his \napproach, I just don't think this is the proper way to do it, and I \nwould oppose the across-the-board cut.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. FARR. I yield to the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I wish to join in opposition to this \namendment. I share my colleague's concern about government spending, \nbut two-thirds of the problem is in Social Security and Medicare and \nMedicaid, and in ObamaCare, the national debt, the interest on the \ndebt. That is what is drowning us.\n  We, in the appropriations process, handle about a third of Federal \nspending, and we have cut spending here in this bill. We have limited \nresources; and as chairman of the subcommittee, we have prioritized \nthat money to go, first and foremost, to law enforcement.\n  The gentleman's amendment would cut $683 million out of Federal law \nenforcement, which is something I just simply cannot support. The \ngentleman's amendment would cut $212 million out of the FBI and just \neviscerate their ability to deal with cyber espionage and to deal with \nterrorism. The gentleman's amendment would cut $450 million from NASA, \nessentially crippling our efforts to get Americans back into space on \nan American-made rocket, something we simply have to do as quickly as \npossible.\n  We have in our bill prioritized the limited, very precious, and \nscarce, hard-earned tax dollars that our constituents have entrusted us \nwith and made sure that Federal law enforcement is taken care of, \nscientific research is protected, NASA is protected. But first and \nforemost, we protected public safety with the way we have prioritized \nour spending.\n  I have to urge Members to oppose this amendment because we have \nalready followed the Dave Ramsey approach in spending money where it is \nmost needed. We have got to focus on the two-thirds of the problem that \nis drowning us: the mandatory, automatic spending programs--Medicare, \nSocial Security, Medicaid--that are drowning this economy. That is \nwhere the deficit and the debt is coming from. While we continue to do \nour part in Appropriations on the one-third that we have got control \nover, we are continuing to cut and prioritize, let's focus on the two-\nthirds that is actually hurting the American economy. I would urge \nMembers to oppose this amendment and defeat it.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman from California has \nexpired.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FATTAH. It is good to see my good friend on the floor. I, \nunfortunately, can't support his amendment, but I appreciate his work \nhere in the Congress.\n  In the past, unlike those rhetorically who offer notions of support \nfor Simpson-Bowles, I actually supported it and voted for it. I am the \nonly Member of the House that has offered a bill to get rid of the \nincome tax and pay our debts.\n  I wanted to set up a consumption tax, which 150 other countries in \nthe world use. We have got a consumption-based economy. It might be a \ngood notion to find our revenues where the action is.\n  I don't take a backseat to anyone when it comes to fiscal \nresponsibility, but unless we have a global budget deal, it is going to \nbe impossible for us to manage the accounts of what you agree are very \nimportant Federal agencies that have very important responsibilities.\n  We are running the most important, the most powerful country in the \nworld. We can't do it on the cheap and be number one. China builds 100 \nscience-only universities in 5 years. It would take us 20 years to \nbuild one. We don't have the same kind of decisionmaking process, \nobviously, and it takes us a while to formulate our decision package; \nbut even when we get there, we have this debate about whether or not we \nare going to stand up and be the leading country in the world, whether \nin space exploration or in any of the areas of scientific enterprise in \nwhich we have always had the absolute lead. Now we have only a relative \nlead.\n  There are those who are working in ways that are adverse to insisting \non America being number one. Those are people who want to tell the \nAmerican public that we can continue to have the best military in the \nworld and not pay for it or the best education system and not pay for \nit. Or you look at our national laboratories, and I have visited Oak \nRidge, I have visited Los Alamos and Sandia and Fermi and Argonne. You \nlook at these laboratories. These were major investments. Now, some \nmight call it spending, but it helped America win wars, but also win \nthe economic fight against our competitors by making these investments.\n  I just think that it is not a matter of what we can cut. It is where \ndoes our country want to end up. Do we want to be something less than \nnumber one in the world? Is that the legacy we want to leave our \nchildren and grandchildren? Or are we going to make the decisions that \nothers before us have made, which is that we have to make tough \ndecisions, and we are going to have to carry our own pail of water up \nthe hill, and we are going to have to pay for all that we get. It was \nAbraham Lincoln who said you may not get all that you pay for, but you \nwill pay for all that you get.\n  So this notion that somehow America can be number one on the cheap, I \nam not buying it. The world's not going to buy it. We are competing \nwith countries that have a billion-plus population. They are making \ninvestments, and they want to eat our lunch, economically. There may be \nchallenges in other ways for our country down the road, and we have to \nbe prepared as leaders to make some tough decisions and to tell the \nAmerican public that, in order to retain our position, we might have to \nactually stand up to the bar and pay our fair share.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Chairman, I admire the earnestness of my colleagues \nwho, in good faith, are pressing forward in terms of trying to protect \na whole host of programs that I think we all recognize are of great \nimportance to the American people.\n  Churchill once observed that the beauty of the American political \nsystem was that it always did the right thing--after it had exhausted \nevery other possible remedy. My fear in this is, if we wait late in the \ngame, and this is exactly what the Budget Director was talking about \nthis morning, if we wait, the consequences to waiting, in numerical \nterms, become horrific. We are dealing with a math trap that compounds \nwith time. Einstein, in fact, was once asked what is the most powerful \nforce in the universe, and his reply was compound interest. The numbers \nbecome, I think, absolutely compelling.\n  So I would agree with my colleagues that across-the-board cuts are \nabsolutely not the best way to go. When I was involved in State \npolitics, I worked earnestly against across-the-board cuts. It is only \nout of desperation that I offer a proposal that entails across-the-\nboard cuts because, again, if we wait, what the Budget Director this \nmorning says was that there will be real consequences.\n  I would make four additional points:\n  One, if we are serious about addressing the entitlement problem, then \nwe shouldn't be borrowing from entitlement spending to fund mandatory \nspending, and that is exactly what this particular appropriation bill \ndoes to the tune of about $10 billion. So I think\n\n[[Page H3801]]\n\nthat if we are really going to get earnest about entitlement spending, \nthis would be a place to start, which is part of the reason as to why \nwe focused on this particular appropriation bill.\n  Two, my colleague from California mentioned national debt is at an \nall-time low. That is incorrect. In fact, we are at an all-time high if \nyou look at the numbers. Roughly, it took us 200 years to get to $5 \ntrillion in debt. Over the Bush administration, we went from 5 to 10. \nIt doubled. And now, during the Obama administration, it is going to \ndouble again from roughly 10 to 20. It is at an all-time high.\n  I think the key to a mortgage is your ability to pay it off. It is \nnot, again, is there a mortgage or isn't there. It is can you pay it \noff. If you look at the numbers--and increasingly rating agencies \naround the world have suggested that when you get up around that 90 \npercent number, there is less and less probability that you will be \nable to perpetuate that spending, which goes to the heart of can we \nperpetuate our ability to fund these worthwhile programs, which is what \nthis amendment is about.\n  Lastly, I would say Admiral Mullen, when he spoke against the \nsequester, he did so, in large measure, because what he recognized was \nthe way in which sequester disproportionately impacted the military.\n  For a host of reasons, again, I would ask support for this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Sanford).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from South \nCarolina will be postponed.\n\n\n              Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. King of Iowa\n\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. ___.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used with respect to the case State of Texas, et al. v. \n     United States of America, et al. (No. B-14-254 in the United \n     States District Court for the Southern District of Texas and \n     No. 15-40238 in the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     Fifth Circuit).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Iowa and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Iowa.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is an amendment, in \nshort form, that says that none of the funds made available by this act \nmay be used with respect to the case State of Texas, et al. v. United \nStates of America.\n  I point out to the body, Mr. Chairman, that that is the case that was \nfiled by then-Attorney General of Texas Greg Abbott, now Governor of \nTexas, to protect the interest of Texans. It has been signed on to now \nby 25 States, I believe. And this is in reference to the President's \nNovember 20 DAPA policy, his executive amnesty policy.\n  We have watched as this Congress has three times voted to reject the \nPresident's initiative, and the debate has been centered on \nconstitutional grounds. The position of this Congress has three times \nbeen that the President of the United States is the leader of the \nexecutive branch of this government, and the legislative powers are all \nvested here in the United States Congress, in a House and in a Senate. \nThat is article 1 of the Constitution.\n  That is what the President taught through his 10 years as an adjunct \nprofessor of constitutional law at the University of Chicago, and that \nis what he also uttered at least 22 times as President of the United \nStates--that he didn't have the authority to establish in advance an \nexecutive amnesty that would waive the application of the law for some \n5 million people.\n  Not only does this Congress agree with the President's 22 statements \nthat he has since changed his position on--by the way, the President \nhas a 33-page Office of Legal Counsel opinion that is written, I think, \nvery loosely--and I read every word of that--but the President's \nconvictions, I believe, were reflected prior to this political \ndecision.\n  And so my amendment prohibits any of the funds from being used to \nfurther defend this unconstitutional executive amnesty position.\n  Mr. Chairman, I would point out that not only has Congress voted \nthree times but also the President's 22 statements, as I said, and then \nit is backed up by Federal Judge Hanen, who ruled on the side of the \nConstitution and the rule of law and the separation of powers. And on \nthe administration's appeal, a three-judge panel in the Fifth Circuit \nalso ruled and indicated that the State of Texas and the other \ncoplaintiffs were likely to prevail, and granted standing to the State \nof Texas.\n  And now we have an administration that appears to be willing to \ncontinue this debate further and go with an appeal to the Circuit Court \nagain. They actually have the opportunity to go directly to the Supreme \nCourt.\n  So, Mr. Chairman, I go through this long list of things that have \nhappened because a lot of money has been spent and wasted in an attempt \nto, let's say--the gracious way to say it would be to stretch the \nConstitution beyond any bounds that it had been stretched before.\n  This amendment simply directs that none of the funds made available \nshall be used to continue that endeavor.\n  With that, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. FATTAH. So when the gentleman references the Congress acting \nthree times, when you say ``the Congress,'' do you mean both Houses of \nthe Congress? Or, are you referring to one House?\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. I would have to go back and look at the record in \nthe Senate to give you an accurate count. I can tell you that it is an \naccurate count for the House. It may not be a full three times in the \nSenate.\n  Mr. FATTAH. I thank the gentleman, and if he would continue to yield, \nwe can continue for one second. Because I know that you appreciate the \nconstruction of our government and the way the Constitution framed it. \nIt is not the law of the land that one House acts on something. We need \nthe House to act, the Senate to act, and then we need a Presidential \nsignature or an override by a Presidential veto.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Reclaiming my time, and thanking the gentleman from \nPennsylvania for his insight, Mr. Chairman, I would state that the \nConstitution is very clear. It was very clear to the President of the \nUnited States for 10 years while he taught it, and it was very clear \nwhen he made his statements 22 times.\n  So this is the Congress reasserting itself. Our Founding Fathers \nexpected we would do that.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. I rise in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FATTAH. I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time in that \ncolloquy. I look forward to being able to do the same in return, but I \ndo appreciate the opportunity to communicate with my colleague, because \nI don't want anyone to misinterpret the facts here.\n  Every single President has acted in this area. And these actions by \nthis President are no different than the actions by previous Presidents \nin this trade space around providing amnesty.\n  And what the gentleman strenuously and sincerely objects to is that \nthis has benefited a large number of people whom the President has a \ndifferent view of, in terms of their circumstances, because they were \nbrought here as young children. And the President says, well, they are \nhere, they went to school here, and this is the only country they know, \nand they have abided by our laws, and he is granting them this ability \nto stay. And the gentleman objects.\n  But I don't want anyone to think that the Congress has taken some \ndifferent view, because the Congress is\n\n[[Page H3802]]\n\ntwo Houses--the House and the Senate--and even if both Houses were to \nact, the way our laws are structured, you need a Presidential \nsignature.\n  So, in fact, one House may have a difference of opinion. When Ronald \nReagan was President, the Democrats had a difference of opinion. It \ndidn't change the law so that we voted in some particular way.\n  I don't want anyone to misinterpret the comments of my colleague as \nhe has articulated his sincere objections to these issues.\n  And then to get to the point of his amendment, what he is saying is \nthat it is wonderful that the judiciary is responding, they are \ninterpreting the law the way he thinks it should be interpreted, but \nhere what he wants to do is to deny the executive branch appropriate \nresources to pursue its policy objectives by saying that none of the \nfunds here can be used by DOJ in furtherance of their position.\n  So I think it is fair for the House to have a view. The House is even \nsuing the President about his point of view on some things. But it is \nunfair for us to deny the executive branch an opportunity to put forth \nits arguments in court on any of these matters so that we can get a \nproper ruling from the third branch of our government.\n  And even though there have been rulings in the gentleman's favor, he \nand I both know that we are not at the final rendezvous here, and that \nthe wheels of justice grind slowly, but there will be a final decision \nprobably by the highest court in the land. But we should not deny the \nDOJ an opportunity to go into court and argue the administration's \nposition. I think that would be unfair.\n  Therefore, I oppose this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I move to strike the last word.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I wish to speak in support of the \namendment. I strongly support Mr. King's amendment because what the \nPresident has done is clearly illegal.\n  The President does not have the ability to change the law by himself. \nAs my good friend from Philadelphia points out, one House of Congress \ncannot change the law all by itself. And similarly, the Chief Executive \ncannot change the law enacted by Congress and signed by the President \nall by himself.\n  The law is very clear that people who are in the country illegally, \nwho have violated the immigration laws of the United States, need to be \ndeported. And the President by this illegal executive action has \nattempted to override the Federal law enacted by Congress and signed by \nprevious Presidents.\n  The District Court agreed that President Obama's action is illegal \nand that an injunction lies against it. The District Court suspended \nthe President's executive order because it was illegal. The Federal \nCourt of Appeals in New Orleans suspended the President's executive \norder because it was illegal. We expect the full Fifth Circuit Court of \nAppeals to suspend the President's executive order because it is \nillegal. We expect the Supreme Court to suspend the President's order \nbecause it is illegal, because the Constitution clearly says that as \nchief executive you have an obligation to faithfully execute the laws \nof the United States.\n\n  You cannot make a law all by yourself with the stroke of a pen. And \nthat is exactly what President Obama has done. In addition, it has \nplaced an incredibly unaffordable financial burden on the people of \nTexas, the people of Tennessee, and the people of all the States of the \nUnion that would have to deal with these folks that are here illegally.\n  All that we ask is that the law be enforced. All that we ask is that \nthe law be respected, because, as our Founding Fathers understood, the \nlaw is the foundation of all of our liberty. Without law enforcement, \nthere can be no liberty. Because there is just simply anarchy. If you \nlook at northern Mexico today, it is in a complete state of anarchy. \nMexico is essentially a failed state because they have no law \nenforcement.\n  In the United States of America we cannot expect to preserve this \ngreat Republic handed down to us by our Founders without enforcing the \nlaw. The fundamental question that this lawsuit, Texas v. United \nStates, is pursuing--and winning--is respect for the rule of law as the \nfoundation for all our liberties.\n  So I strongly support Mr. King's amendment as an important tool in \nthe ongoing effort to overturn the President's illegal executive \namnesty. We expect the Supreme Court will stand behind the State of \nTexas and agree that the President's order must be suspended because it \nis illegal, because without law enforcement, without respect for the \nlaw, there can be no liberty. That is the issue here.\n  I strongly support the gentleman's amendment, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I would just reiterate that the \nPresident of the United States has signed a document. It is a November \n20 document that says that he is going to impose executive amnesty. \nThis House disagrees. Many in the Senate also disagree.\n  They have been chasing down an expensive rabbit trail to advance an \noperation of imposing amnesty in the United States of America, in \ncontravention of our laws.\n  This Congress is reserved the right by the Constitution to write \nimmigration law, and our Founding Fathers imagined we would jealously \nguard that power. That is what this amendment is about.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I think that we are at a point where it is \ndifficult to reconcile what we are trying to do here--that is, in an \nappropriations bill--with these policy riders.\n  Now, I have heard my chairman claim that the President of the United \nStates has done things that are illegal three or four times. I think \nthat that kind of language is not useful in the debate, nor is it \nfactual, because I think that the President has been acting well in \nconcert with the precedents of former Presidents who have provided \nclemency and amnesty.\n  And I have heard Members like Mr. King criticize those other \nPresidents who have provided amnesty, like Ronald Reagan and others, \nand I have never heard anyone claim that President Reagan acted \nillegally in those matters. So I find it unusual that we would be in \nthis type of circumstance.\n  I heard the chairman run through a litany in which he also has the \nSupreme Court finally make some decision, which they have obviously not \ndone yet.\n  So I would like to try to get back on the tracks of moving an \nappropriations bill. And the point that we have to understand here is \nthat, if we are a coequal branch of the government--that is, the \nPresident is coequal to us, but we are one-half of the Congress--then \nthe idea that what the House says goes is nonsensical.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. FATTAH. I yield to the gentleman.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  I would just make the point that this Congress passed an amnesty act \nin 1986, and Ronald Reagan signed that. It was an act of Congress that \nbrought amnesty in 1986. I think it was a mistake, but I believe it was \nconstitutional.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Reclaiming my time, I appreciate the gentleman's point.\n  Like I was saying, it is nonsensical to assume that whatever the \nunfettered action of the House is, that it, number one, represents the \naction of the Congress, because it doesn't. We have two Houses. We have \na Senate and a House. And then we are coequal to the President, but the \nPresident has certain rights provided to him under the Constitution.\n  If you find no exception in the actions of other Presidents, it is \nunusual that we would have such enthusiastic language in condemnation \nof this President's very similar actions.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Iowa (Mr. King).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Iowa will be \npostponed.\n\n[[Page H3803]]\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n\n                 Amendment Offered by Mr. King of Iowa\n\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. _.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to negotiate or finalize a trade agreement that \n     includes provisions relating to visas issued under section \n     101(a)(15) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1101(a)(15)). The limitation described in this section shall \n     not apply in the case of the administration of a tax or \n     tariff.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Iowa and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Iowa.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, this amendment addresses the \ncircumstances around the trade promotion authority and later on, \nperhaps, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but it also addresses any of \nour trade negotiations that might take place that would be funded under \nthis bill.\n  The rationale is that there has been much concern about the \nnegotiations with regard to trade promotion authority in particular, \nenabling the discussion about immigration visas as being part of the \ntrade negotiations.\n  It is a longstanding pattern and practice of this Congress to assert \nour constitutional authority over immigration visas. When our U.S. \nTrade Representative or other negotiators bring in negotiations that \nhave to do with visas, it complicates our trade negotiations and puts \nus in a place where, when we see a trade agreement come before us, \nperhaps it is under a trade promotion authority that would be \nnegotiated and this House votes on it, then it may well have within it \nvisa agreements that have been negotiated with the multiple countries \nand taking out of the hands of Congress the ability to directly \nestablish, although there is an indirect inference, but directly \nestablish our immigration policy.\n  A lot of the opposition to the trade negotiations that have been \ntaking place in the Trans-Pacific Partnership have been about concerns \nof news reports that have come from places likes Australia that have \npointed out that there are negotiations going on that have to do with \nvisas.\n  There was a circumstance several years ago, under a previous \nadministration, where they had negotiated immigration provisions in a \ntrade agreement, and even though it was a nonamendable trade agreement, \nwe went before the Judiciary Committee and had a full hearing. I \noffered two amendments that passed, and ultimately, there were changes \nmade in that agreement. There is a long history on this with me.\n  It has been an important issue to maintain the separation of \nimmigration policy and the Congress from the executive branch \nnegotiations in trade. That is what this amendment does. It says no \nimmigrant visas will be negotiated in trade agreements. That means all \nof them.\n  Again, the Constitution enumerates this power to the Congress, not \nthe executive branch. I urge its adoption.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FATTAH. I think that the hopes of having some bipartisan support \nfor this bill is waning. I think it is very unfortunate that we are now \nat a point where we are trying to intrude in an entirely different area \nof the President's prerogatives. He can negotiate all he wants.\n  Now, I may not support what he negotiates, but to say you can't even \ndiscuss something in a negotiation, I think, is unfortunate.\n  I am in opposition, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time I \nhave remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Iowa has 2\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I would reiterate this point, that \nthis Congress and a lot of the American people lack confidence in the \nnegotiations of our President. A lot of this angst has flowed forth \nfrom the Iranian negotiations and their march towards a nuclear \ncapability that has undermined his credibility and made it \nsignificantly more difficult for a Congress that is in favor of trade, \nespecially on my side of the aisle.\n  I am a natural-born free trader. I have always believed that I can \ncompete with anybody in the world, and I think America and American \ncompanies can compete with anyone in the world. I think that we need to \nhave a level playing field.\n  What is happening is that lack of confidence in the President's \nnegotiations and the willingness to, I believe, give away some of the \npositions that would better enhance our national security with regard \nto Iran, in particular, has made it far more difficult for those like \nme, who are pro-free trade, pro-smart trade, and because of that and \nthe discussions about immigration visas being part of the negotiations \nand the indications from other countries that that is taking place, the \nsecrecy around these negotiations is another component of it.\n  When we have to go into a secure room and give up our iPhone and \nleave our notes there in order to be able to see what the \nadministration will present us as far as these negotiations are \nconcerned, it is hard to have confidence that we are getting all of the \nstraight story.\n  This is a way to put some containment around the negotiations. If the \nadministration says there are no visas being negotiated, there should \nbe no reason to oppose this amendment. That is really the bottom line.\n  If the administration opposes my amendment, that is a strong \nindication that they are not giving us the full story, but we are \ngetting more of the full story from places like Australia.\n  I urge the adoption of my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to the time \nremaining, please?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Iowa has 45 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time \nhere and reiterate that this amendment addresses a lack of trust that \nthese trade negotiations are focused on the things that trades are \nsupposed to be discussed about.\n  I have a strong suspicion that they have included immigration visas \nin their trade agreements. This amendment is drafted consistent with \nthe position of this Congress that immigration should not be part of \ntrade negotiations.\n  If the administration says that it is not part of trade negotiations, \nthey should say, Fine, I am happy to support the King amendment; and \nthey will be happy to prove it in that fashion.\n  Meanwhile, a lot of us are not going to a secure room to see if there \nis anything in there, and we won't know what is presented to the this \nCongress until it is too late to resist.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, let me assure the House I have no intention \nof taking 4\\1/2\\ minutes to make the comments that I intend to make.\n  I was at SelectUSA, which is a gathering of people that the \nadministration has brought together from around the world who were \nbusinesspeople and about investments in America. I was there with a \nnumber of Members of the U.S. Senate, Senator Nelson and others.\n  I got a chance at the lunch to sit next to a gentleman who has \nbusinesses in the United States--manufacturing businesses--and in South \nAfrica and his home country in Asia and a number of other places.\n  He was saying that, when he travels to America, even though he has \ngot 3,000 employees here, it is almost impossible for him to get the \nkind of visas and to get back and forth post-9/11 that can make it an \nefficient business trip for him. It requires such advance planning and \nso on.\n  I could imagine, in a negotiation, that there could be some \nconsideration when there is a person who has got a multinational \nbusiness and is employing Americans in Iowa or some other\n\n[[Page H3804]]\n\nState about their entry and exit from our country. In fact, he \nindicated that, in these other countries, he has such arrangements, \njust not in our own. I think that America has got to think about where \nit is on these issues.\n  This is not the appropriate bill for this. This is a bill to \ndetermine the appropriation levels that we are going to fund in certain \naccounts. We are well off the tracks, and I hope that we vote this \namendment down. I am opposed to it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Iowa (Mr. King).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Iowa will be \npostponed.\n\n\n                 Amendment Offered by Mr. King of Iowa\n\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. ___. None of the funds made available by this Act \n     under the heading ``Department of Justice--Office of Justice \n     Programs--State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance'' may be \n     used in contravention of section 642(a) of the Illegal \n     Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 \n     (8 U.S.C. 1373(a)).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Iowa and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Iowa.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, my amendment eliminates the funding \nthat might be used in contravention of section 642(a) that is \ndesignated in the amendment.\n  642(a) is the section in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act of 1996, as I know it, that prohibits the political \nsubdivisions in America from establishing sanctuary policies we often \nrefer to as sanctuary cities. These are the political subdivisions that \nestablish a policy that prohibit their law enforcement officers and \ntheir other agents from cooperating with Federal immigration officials.\n  It seems illogical to me to think that any local government would \nwant to prohibit their law enforcement officers from assisting in, \ncooperating with, and transferring information to the Federal law \nenforcement officers who are enforcing immigration law.\n  That section, it reads, in part, but with the thought being contained \nhere: ``Notwithstanding,'' the language says, ``the political \nsubdivisions may not prohibit, or in any way restrict any government \nentity or official from sending to or receiving from the INS''--at the \ntime, that is ICE today--``information regarding the citizenship or \nimmigration status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual.''\n  Mr. Chairman, I grew up in a law enforcement family. I looked at the \nmen around me as a little boy, and I just thought that all adult men \nput on a uniform of some kind or another. I was steeped in respect for \nthe supreme law of the land--the Constitution--and the rule of law.\n  When there was an issue that came forward, whether it was a bank \nrobbery or some tragedy that took place, all levels of law enforcement \ncooperated with all other levels of law enforcement. No one that was a \nmember of the city police said: I am not going to be serving papers \nhere because that is the county's job.\n  No county deputy decided that he wouldn't pull somebody over for \nspeeding because that was the city speed limit on a city street. No \nhighway patrol officer decided that he wouldn't enforce local law.\n  No one that came in from the Division of Criminal Investigation or \nthe FBI decided that it was their bailiwick, that it was exclusively \ntheir law to enforce and that no one should help them with that.\n  Law enforcement, to be effective, has to be a cooperation from all \nlevels; and, of course, the public has to respect the rule of law; and \nthey have to respect those who are there to protect and serve and to \nalso enforce that law.\n  For me, I cannot understand how or why a city would establish these \npolicies, but they are doing so. In the process of that, they are \nundermining the rule of law and eroding the respect for the rule of law \nand leaving their citizens vulnerable, when we could be helping them \nwith Federal officers who need to get this information.\n  This is an amendment that has been offered in multiple years. It has \npassed this House multiple times. The number that I saw last year with \nthe identical language passed the House by a vote of 214-94.\n  We have been consistent in defending the rule of law. This amendment \nsays that no funds shall go to these political subdivisions from this \nbill, if they establish sanctuary city policies, to put it in short \nsummation.\n  I urge its adoption, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chairman, the description of the amendment, as we \nunderstand it, prohibits the use of these funds that contravene section \n642 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act \nof 1996.\n  The facts are that the States and localities around the country that \nhave adopted laws and policies to limit immigration enforcement by law \nenforcement are focused on protecting public safety. We have this in \nCalifornia. We have it in many border States. There is a level of \ncooperation that does take place between local law enforcement agencies \nas well as our Federal enforcement officers.\n  Surely, we don't believe it is good public policy to force an \nunwanted role upon police through the threat of sanctions, which is \nwhat this amendment does, or withholding police funding. Frankly, if \nyou believe in Federalism and if you believe in that relationship \nbetween local, State, and Federal Government, this is really top-down \nand I think runs contrary to the notion that law enforcement agencies \nat all levels collaborate and cooperate.\n  Holding this sort of a sword of Damocles, so to speak, over the head \nof local law enforcement agencies simply, I think, is not good public \npolicy.\n  In an op-ed piece that was published in Roll Call last year, the \npolice chief of Dayton, Ohio, explained why his department instructs \nits officers not to check the immigration status of witnesses and \nvictims or to question their status in minor traffic stops.\n  He says:\n\n       These policies allow us to focus our limited resources on \n     our primary mission, which is crime solving and community \n     safety.\n\n  We know that local law enforcement agencies are clearly stretched \nvery thin across the country. They also said victims of crimes should \nnever be afraid to reach out for help due to the fear of immigration \nconsequences because, notwithstanding the fact of their status, crimes \nare perpetrated upon these people as well.\n  Since Dayton adopted these policies and innovative ways of addressing \ncrime problems, their crime rates have significantly declined; and, in \nthe past 3 years, serious crime has declined nearly 22 percent, while \nserious property crime has gone down 15 percent. It is simply, we \nbelieve, perverse to punish communities that want to prioritize because \nthey know best what their challenges are within their communities to \nprotect the public against crime and to enact community-based policing \nactivities. To deny them this funding through this threat of the SCAAP \nfunds simply is, we believe, inappropriate.\n  Finally, I think that this amendment focuses on a problem that \ndoesn't exist.\n  With those statements, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word to speak \nin support of the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, the objection of the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Costa) to this amendment is that he does not believe \ncurrent Federal law is good public policy. As a Member of Congress, he \nhas the privilege of filing amendments and filing\n\n[[Page H3805]]\n\nlegislation to change current Federal legislation, but we cannot, as \nlawmakers, encourage law breaking.\n  All the amendment of the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King) says is that \nif a local or State government expects to receive Federal money, they \nshould comply with Federal law. It is really that simple.\n  Mr. King's amendment simply says that, if you expect to receive \nfunding from the Department of Justice, if you expect to receive \nfunding under the SCAAP program--the State Criminal Alien Assistance \nProgram--to compensate local jurisdictions for housing illegal aliens \nwho have broken State law and are housed in a State or local jail at \nlocal taxpayer expense, if you want to be compensated for that and if \nyou want to apply for grant funding from the Department of Justice, all \nMr. King's amendment says is follow Federal law. If you want Federal \nmoney, follow Federal law.\n  The Federal law is very clear. The law Mr. King is referencing here \nis very simple. It simply says that a State or local government may not \nprohibit or in any way restrict a government entity or official from \nsending or receiving any information regarding the citizenship or \nimmigration status of any individual to the Immigration Services. That \nis all this law says.\n  It is a very important piece of law because, as the gentleman from \nIowa (Mr. King) quite correctly points out, we expect all our local and \nState and Federal law enforcement officials to work together \nseamlessly.\n  Because we are a Nation of laws, we understand that all our liberty \ndepends on the enforcement of the law, with equal protection and due \nprocess for everyone. All our liberties depend on local, State, and \nFederal law enforcement officers using their good hearts, their good \nsense, and their ability, as law enforcement officers, to recognize \nwhen and where they need to cooperate and communicate with the State \nlaw enforcement officials, with Federal law enforcement officials to \nprotect the life and liberty of the people of the United States. That \nis what is really at stake here.\n  That is the objection that we have had to the President's unlawful \nactions. That is the concern and the objection we have in the State of \nTexas to the uncontrolled flow of people and drugs and guns and illegal \nmaterial across the border. Our concern is not with the lawful free \nflow of people back and forth over the Rio Grande River. Our concern is \nwith the illegal, criminal conduct.\n  We recognize in Texas the importance of free trade with Mexico and \nwith Canada, but you cannot have free trade and a strong economy \nwithout safe streets, and you cannot have safe streets until the law is \nenforced. We in Texas, first and foremost, recognize that, in order to \nhave that good relationship with Mexico, the law has got to be \nenforced.\n  We need workers from Mexico to come here lawfully. We need our laws \nto be respected so that we can ensure the economy stays strong, so that \nour liberty is protected. Our liberty can only be safe when the law is \nenforced.\n  All Mr. King's amendment says is, if you expect to receive Federal \nmoney, follow Federal law. It is not complicated. That is very, very \nsimple. Under the law that has been on the books since 1996, a State or \nlocal unit of government cannot restrict in any way the ability of a \ngovernment official to either send information to Immigration Services \nor receive information from Federal immigration regarding the \ncitizenship or unlawful status of any individual.\n  If my colleague from California (Mr. Costa) objects to that law, it \nis his privilege, as a Member of Congress, to file an amendment or file \nlegislation to amend it or change it. In the meantime, our \nresponsibility as lawmakers and my responsibility as chairman of the \nCommerce, Justice, Science Subcommittee is to ensure that the law is \nenforced.\n\n  If agencies of the Federal Government or State or local governments \nexpect to receive Federal money, if they expect to have the privilege \nof spending our constituents' hard-earned tax dollars, they should \nexpect to follow the law.\n  If you want Federal money, follow Federal law. It is that simple. \nThat is all Mr. King's amendment does, and I urge Members to support \nit.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I want to reiterate the positions \nthat were taken by the gentleman from Texas. We have political \nsubdivisions, primarily, as sanctuary cities that are violating Federal \nlaw, and all we are saying is follow the law.\n  The point hasn't been made here that the Department of Justice could \nenforce this law, but they choose not to, and that empowers the \npolitical subdivisions, particularly the cities that continue to \nadvance these sanctuary policies.\n  Can you imagine being a police officer and being told that, if you \npick up people who are unlawfully present in America, that you can't \ntell the INS--even if you are having coffee with them--that you have \ngot a jail full of people who are unlawfully present in America that \nare required by law to be placed into removal proceedings? That is just \nillogical.\n  I would point out that, if you disagree with this section of the \ncode, you are here in this Congress, bring a bill to try to change it.\n  In the meanwhile, I am for full funding of the SCAAP funding. I think \nthat, when we have people in the country and we are not enforcing \nimmigration law, we should make sure that local jails are funded when \nthey are picking up people that are unlawfully present in America.\n  I support the Byrne JAG grants. I want to give that to them, but we \ncannot do that under provisions if the local subdivisions are violating \nlaw.\n  Then with regard to the statement that this is a problem that doesn't \nexist--no, it is a problem that exists all over this country. It is \ngrowing. It is replete in city after city. We need to restore respect \nfor the rule of law. That is what this amendment does. I urge its \nadoption.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Iowa (Mr. King).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Iowa will be \npostponed.\n\n\n                  Amendment Offered by Mr. Luetkemeyer\n\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available in this Act may \n     be used to carry out the program known as ``Operation Choke \n     Point''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Missouri and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Missouri.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Chairman, question: How does the Federal \nGovernment get rid of an industry it doesn't like?\n  Answer: Simple, it cuts off that industry from the financial services \nsector.\n  Sounds impossible, doesn't it? However, that is exactly what the \nDepartment of Justice is doing in conjunction with the FDIC right now. \nTheir name for this action is called Operation Choke Point. It is \ndesigned to force legally operating entities out of business by choking \nthem off from the financial services they need to operate their \nbusinesses.\n  What started with nondepository lenders has spread to other \nindustries, including pawn shops, tobacco retailers, and the firearms \nand ammunition industries, to name just a few, as well as the \nbusinesses that provide services and products to these industries.\n  This amendment would ensure that Operation Choke Point is ended and \nthat the DOJ returns to their proper job, targeting companies based on \nfraudulent actions, not entire industries based on political motive. An \nidentical amendment was offered by a bipartisan group of lawmakers \nduring fiscal year 2015 debate, and it was passed by voice vote.\n  This isn't a partisan issue. This is an issue of DOJ abusing its \nauthorities. I urge support for this amendment.\n\n[[Page H3806]]\n\n  I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Williams).\n  Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Chair, soon, we will vote to end funding for a \ngovernment program that is, at best, unethical and, at worst, illegal. \nThe program known as Operation Choke Point forces banks to discriminate \nagainst legitimate, legal businesses.\n  Today, we know that banks are closing their customers' accounts under \na directive by the U.S. Department of Justice. There is no appeals \nprocess.\n  That is right; the enforcer of the law of the land is backing this \npotentially unlawful program. Hard-working American businessowners are \nhaving their livelihoods ripped out from under them by a law \nestablished by this administration, not by Congress.\n  Operation Choke Point is another example of how the Obama \nadministration has gone around Congress to create laws, rather than do \ntheir job to enforce the laws we already have on the books.\n  As a businessowner myself, Operation Choke Point worries me greatly. \nOperation Choke Point is un-American. It is deceiving and simply wrong. \nIt is time this Congress uses its power of the purse to rein in \ngovernment overreach and restore government accountability.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to defund Operation \nChoke Point.\n  In God we trust.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, now I think that there may be some \nmutuality of interest if what the gentleman says is true about what is \nat stake here. However, this is not a process in which we can discern \nall of that at this moment. This is an appropriations bill. I think \nthat this is probably an area where the Congress should hold some \nhearings and look into it, take some testimony and figure out exactly \nwhat is going on before we would shut down what might be a very \nimportant program.\n  It may be, as the gentleman describes, that is something where DOJ is \njust moving in ways that make little or no sense. But I think that to \ncome at the final point in the bill and seek to restrict DOJ in this \nway, I would be reluctant to support it, and therefore, I stand in \nopposition to it.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom South Carolina (Mr. Mulvaney).\n  Mr. MULVANEY. I thank my friend, Mr. Luetkemeyer, and I thank the \nchairman. What we are up here talking about is a program where the \ngovernment is trying to put legal businesses out of business--that is \nwhat Operation Choke Point is--legal businesses that some people don't \nlike especially within the administration, pawnshops, payday lenders, \nammunition manufacturers, gun shops, but legal businesses.\n  With all due respect to my friend from Pennsylvania, we have had \nhearings on this. In fact, the Department of Justice has claimed they \nhave stopped this program. They have agreed with us that they shouldn't \nbe doing this. Now, we don't believe they are actually doing that. We \nhave indications from what is happening back in our districts that even \nthough the Department of Justice says they have stopped Operation Choke \nPoint, that it is still going on.\n  So here is my question, Mr. Chairman: Who supports this program? The \nDepartment of Justice says it is wrong. The Department of Justice says \nit is not even doing it. So who would get up here on this floor and \nsay: ``I think Operation Choke Point is a great idea. I think we should \ngo ahead and continue to use means within the Department of Justice to \ndrive legal businesses out of business''? I'm not really sure how you \ndefend that position.\n  This is real for me in my district, Mr. Chairman. I have a woman-\nowned business in my home county who cannot get money to expand her \npawnshop. I have businesses elsewhere in South Carolina that have a \nlittle tiny piece of their large financial services business in payday \nlending. They have been cut off from their financial relationships of \n25 years. They can't get banking services. That is why the DOJ said \nthey were going to stop. We just don't happen to believe them.\n  Mr. Chairman, we should support this amendment because it is the \nappropriate thing to do, to my good friend from Pennsylvania, because \nthat is how we work. We defund programs that we don't like. And if the \nDOJ says they are not doing it anyway, what is the harm in voting for \nthe amendment?\n  So I would ask again, who could possibly be against the amendment? \nWho could possibly be for Operation Choke Point?\n  I hope we have overwhelming and broad support for Mr. Luetkemeyer's \namendment later on this evening.\n  Mr. FATTAH. I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from \nMissouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer) for purposes of a colloquy.\n  Since the Republicans are in the majority, you have held hearings on \nthis. Is there legislation that is coming forward to end these \npractices?\n  I yield to the gentleman.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Yes. There have been hearings in the Financial \nServices Committee. There also have been hearings in the Oversight and \nGovernment Reform Committee. In fact, the Oversight and Government \nReform Committee has an extensive report on both the DOJ and FDIC \nactivities that include emails and internal memos from those agencies \nindicating these activities. They can't be denied. They admit this in \ndiscussions with the FDIC. In a follow-up hearing to the report, they \nadmit doing this. They have put in place a number of provisions of a \nbill that I am offering.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Let me restate my question.\n  Is there legislation coming forward that would end the practice?\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. That is what I was getting to.\n  As a result of these reports, we have come up with a bill. I have a \nbill filed. It will be coming up later on this month for a hearing in \ncommittee.\n  The FDIC has put in place many of the same provisions of the bill \nalready as protocols for their operations on how they handle situations \nlike this. I think we are making progress.\n  The problem is that DOJ has flipped the model of using FIRREA, which \nis a bank law that banks use to protect themselves against fraud, to \nnow use that law against them. As a result, we need to stop that. That \nis part of the bill as well.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Reclaiming my time, I appreciate your answering my \nquestion.\n  So what I hear is that you held some hearings, that you have \nlegislation, that you are making progress, and that the administration \nhas already curtailed some of these practices that you are concerned \nabout. However, you would still like to proceed with this prohibition \nof funds which might be entirely appropriate.\n  I don't have enough information, standing here today, to agree with \nyou that that is the right thing to do, so I stand in opposition to the \namendment even though I may not be, in spirit, in opposition to what it \nis that you are attempting to do. I just don't have enough information \nto join you in this effort as robustly as you are engaged in it.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. How much time do I have remaining, Mr. Chairman?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Missouri has 30 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Chairman, I just want to reiterate that I think \nmy two other spokespeople here, with regards to this, have expressed \nconcern.\n  There are businesses across this country that are being choked off \nfrom financial services, and as a result, they are doing legal business \nbut yet not being able to do that business because of the actions of \nthe FDIC and the DOJ, which the OGR report indicates that they are \ndoing. They admit this wrongdoing in different committee hearings as \nwell as meetings on campus here. What we are trying to do is protect \nlegal businesses to be able to continue to do a legal business\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H3807]]\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Denham\n\n  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration to implement in the California Central Valley \n     Recovery Domain any existing recovery plan for salmon and \n     steelhead populations listed under the Endangered Species Act \n     of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) as threatened species or \n     endangered species if that recovery plan does not address \n     predation by non-native species.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Chairman, this amendment will help protect native \nsalmon and steelhead species in California. My amendment would increase \nthe effectiveness of recovery plans for species of salmon and steelhead \nlisted under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 by ensuring an \nappropriate focus on predation control efforts.\n  Predation has long been recognized as a source of significant \nmortality for endangered and threatened species. In fact, according to \nNOAA, nonnative species are cited as a cause of endangerment for 48 \npercent of the species listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. \nThis is especially true for marine species, and along the Pacific coast \nsalmon and steelhead juveniles.\n  Recently, the National Marine Fisheries Service found protection of \nsalmon and steelhead required ``significantly reducing the nonnative \npredatory fishes,'' and that reducing the number of nonnative predatory \nfishes was necessary to ``prevent extinction or to prevent the species \nfrom declining irreversibly.''\n  In my own State, as far back as 1995, the State Water Resources \nControl Board recommended in its water quality control plan for the Bay \nDelta that the State and Federal fish agencies pursue programs to \ndetermine the impacts of predation by nonnative fish on salmon and \nsteelhead. Unfortunately, despite such recognition, nothing has been \ndone, and there are currently no programs in California to remove these \nnonnative predator fish.\n  Today in California, species such as the nonnative striped bass, \nintroduced into California from New Jersey, consume up to 95 percent of \nthe salmon and steelhead juveniles along the Sacramento and San Joaquin \nRiver System. These bass are not suppressed but, rather, managed by \nlocal State officials for abundance and sport fishing.\n  Mr. Chairman, predator control efforts can and do work. Currently, \ncontrol of predator fish is being successfully used in a number of \nlocations in North America. In the Great Lakes, control efforts of sea \nlamprey have reduced predation on lake trout, whitefish, salmon, \nrainbow trout, and others. In the Wood River System of Alaska, control \nof the arctic char reduced predation on sockeye salmon. In the Columbia \nand Snake Rivers, control of pike minnow reduced predation on salmon. \nIn Cultus Lake, British Columbia, sockeye salmon increased after an \neradication program focusing on pike minnow.\n  Recovering threatened and endangered salmon and steelhead populations \nhas been a critical priority for Congress for years. This amendment \nsimply ensures that controlling nonnative predators is a top priority \nfor NOAA and all other stakeholders interested in maintaining healthy \nand sustainable salmon and steelhead populations.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment even though my opposition is not as apparent as it might \notherwise be.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Costa), my great colleague here.\n  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the gentlemen from \nCalifornia and from Pennsylvania for allowing me this time, and the \ngentleman from California for offering this important amendment.\n  Let me give a little perspective here. Clearly, everyone is aware of \nthe disastrous drought that is having catastrophic impacts in \nCalifornia, not only in the San Joaquin Valley but throughout the \nState. There are a number of factors that have caused the challenges \nthat we face with a lack of water in California. Obviously, it hasn't \nrained very much or snowed very much in the mountains for 4 years.\n  In addition to that, we have a broken water system in the sense that, \ndesigned in the fifties and the sixties, both the Federal and State \nwater projects, for a State of 20 million people, today we have 38 \nmillion people, and we have a lot of demands not only for the use of \nagriculture, but for people in our cities and for the environment.\n  Mr. Chairman, this amendment relates to our requirements under the \nlaw to protect the environment, those endangered species, salmonoid and \nsteelhead that are native to California.\n  What happened is some 100 years ago, before we had a better \nunderstanding and before California was a much bigger State, there was \nthe introduction of striped bass from the East Coast, bound from the \nGulf of Saint Lawrence Seaway all the way down to Alabama. These are \nnative fish on the East Coast, but they were not native to California. \nThey were introduced in a small number but became very successful in \npropagation, so much so that in the early 1900s, after 10 years of \nintroduction, over 1 million pounds a year was being harvested of these \nnonnative striped bass fish in the San Francisco Bay-San Joaquin-\nSacramento-Delta River systems.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman an additional 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. COSTA. As I was saying, Mr. Chairman, the fact is that the State \nhas changed a great deal to present day. The current water system is \nunable to meet the demands under the current restrictions that are \nrequired under the Endangered Species Act to maintain and to try to \nincrease the population of salmonoid and steelhead.\n  We have determined, as my colleague and friend from California \nstated, that these fish, these predator fish, are responsible for a \nlarge amount of the takings of both the native California salmon and \nsteelhead, and yet we have no program to balance this.\n  What this amendment would do is it simply requires that for a \nrecovery plan to be effective, it must incorporate and address all \nfactors involved in species recovery, those of particularly high \nconcern.\n  Some of the studies have indicated on the Sacramento River over 95 \npercent of the juvenile salmon and steelhead are eaten by these \npredator striped bass, these nonnative fish and other invasive species. \nThis amendment ensures that the recovery plan for endangered salmon and \nsteelhead takes these factors into account, including the predation by \nthe nonnative species such as striped bass.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment of the \ngentleman from California.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Chairman, I would just like to point out one thing. \nTurlock Irrigation District, which is in my district, was forced to do \na federally ordered study which actually showed, on the lower Tuolumne, \n42,000 snook were killed by nonnative fish. This nearly eliminated the \nentire population. This is a federally ordered study.\n  With that, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from \nCalifornia.\n  Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from California for \noffering this very important amendment.\n  When you look at what is going on in Central Valley, my hometown, and \nyou hear stories--and I see for myself because I was there this past \nweek--cities, houses, running out of water, wells\n\n[[Page H3808]]\n\ngoing dry. There was a news article a couple of days ago about a city \nin my district named Lemoore where wells are going dry that supply \nhomes there the south side of town. That is a frustrating situation.\n  We fought for the last couple of years to bring legislation to the \nfloor. We delivered it to the Senate a few times to help resolve this.\n  What makes this more frustrating than anything is we have got a \nsituation here where we could actually make a difference. There are \nstudies here that prove that 95 percent of the fish that we are trying \nto protect are being eaten by species that we are doing nothing about. \nThe tools are there.\n  This is a simple amendment that actually helps deliver and force \nthese agencies which should be looking out for the best interests of \nthe people of the United States, it forces them to actually use every \nsingle tool in their toolbox to actually address the situation instead \nof wasting water.\n  When I saw the story not too long ago about water being diverted or \nreleased in these pulse flows to trick some of our species to try to \nprotect instead of actually doing something to make a difference, it is \na waste of water that could have made a real difference for the people \nin my district, people who are unemployed. We are starting to see \nunemployment numbers again upwards of 50 percent in some of these \ncommunities, houses where they are actually delivering water by truck \nso they can bathe. This is a real dire situation.\n  This amendment is a step in the right direction that actually allows \nthese government agencies which, again, are supposed to take the \ninterests of the American people at heart first to use all the tools in \ntheir toolbox.\n  This is a good idea, this is a good amendment, and this really truly \nmakes a difference.\n  Again, thank you for this amendment, and I urge support.\n  Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Denham).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n Vacating Demand for Recorded Vote on Amendment Offered by Mr. King of \n                                  Iowa\n\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chair, an amendment was passed, King No. 077, and \npassed by a voice vote. I requested a recorded vote. I ask unanimous \nconsent that my request for a recorded vote on the amendment that it be \nwithdrawn and allow the voice vote on which it passed to be the fact.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will redesignate the amendment.\n  The Clerk redesignated the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the request for a recorded vote \nis withdrawn. Accordingly, the ayes have it and the amendment is agreed \nto.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FATTAH. We have arrived at our final moment in this bill where my \ncolleague from New York, who is an extraordinary Member, has a very \nimportant amendment to offer.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Jeffries\n\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used for the monitoring or review of electronic \n     communications between an inmate and attorney or attorney's \n     agents who are traditionally covered by attorney client \n     privilege except as provided in 28 CFR 501.3(d).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom New York and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Chairman, I thank the distinguished gentleman, the \nranking member from Pennsylvania, for his leadership.\n  This amendment would prohibit the use of funds in connection with the \nmonitoring or review of electronic communications between an inmate \ndetainee and his or her attorney or attorney's agents who are \ntraditionally covered by the attorney-client privilege, except in \ncircumstances where reasonable suspicion exists that a particular \ninmate's communications with attorneys or their agents may be designed \nto further or facilitate acts of terrorism.\n  This amendment is designed to protect the legally sacrosanct \nattorney-client privilege. It would protect the Sixth Amendment right \nto counsel of individuals who are using electronic communications to \nshare privileged information with their designated court advocate.\n  The attorney-client privilege is one of the oldest recognized \nprivileges in American jurisprudence. It is intended to encourage the \nfull and frank communication between attorneys and their clients and \nthereby promote the broader public interests in the observance of the \nlaw and the administration of justice. It, of course, is anchored in \nthe Sixth Amendment.\n  Currently, in-person attorney visitations in facilities that are run \nby the Bureau of Prisons can take place in attorney-client rooms which \nprovide the privacy to share information necessary for a lawyer to \nadequately defend his or her client in court.\n  However, this is not the case for correspondence collected through \nelectronic means. Waiver notices in Federal prisons vary from facility \nto facility, with some having clearly posted notices which state that \nby using the Trust Fund Limited Inmate Computer System, otherwise known \nas TRULINCS, inmates are waiving their privilege rights. Other \nfacilities, however, provide no indication on the level of privacy that \na detained individual can expect when using electronic prison \nresources.\n  The TRULINCS system also does not provide an option for a detained \nindividual who hasn't been convicted to contact his or her attorney \nwithout subjecting electronic communications to external review.\n  The reading and collecting of privileged information in instances \nwhere clients are having electronic exchanges with their attorneys is a \nclear invasion of the traditional attorney-client privilege.\n  In this great country, there is a presumption of innocence, as one of \nour Founding Fathers, John Adams, has eloquently set forth. It is a \nfoundational principle of our democracy.\n  It seems unreasonable to require in the 21st century that protection \nof the attorney-client privilege at a detention center only occurs \nthrough in-person visitation. These correctional facilities are often \nlocated in distant locations that cannot be easily accessed. We live in \nan era of modern technology and communication. The technology is \navailable in these facilities, and our laws should reflect and adapt to \nthe modern age.\n  This amendment would prohibit the prison system from compromising the \nattorney-client privilege, as anchored in the Sixth Amendment \nconstitutional right to assistance of counsel.\n  For that reason, I urge my colleagues to support it, and I reserve \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although \nI am not in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from New York is prepared \nto withdraw the amendment. We will work together to resolve this \nproblem, so I do claim the time in opposition.\n  I think the gentleman from New York has raised a very valid concern. \nCertainly we do not want to see any exception to the attorney-client \nprivilege. It can't be limited to just those circumstances where an \nattorney is actually present with the individual\n\n[[Page H3809]]\n\ninterviewing him at the facility. I think the gentleman has identified \na legitimate problem that we need to address.\n  As I discussed with Mr. Jeffries earlier, we got the language very \nlate, and I want to be certain that we are not creating any \nunanticipated problems. Mr. Jeffries wants to be sure to exclude the \nvery reasonable exception in current law that if a court order, on a \nfinding of a judge, sees that there is potential or reasonable cause \nfor concern that there may be furtherance of a terrorist plot in the \ncourse of those communications between an attorney and a client, the \nDepartment of Justice would have the right under that court order to \nlisten to that conversation.\n  We want to make sure that we protect that exception but make sure we \ntake care of the one he has identified, so if I could, with my \ncolleague from Philadelphia Mr. Jeffries' help, we appreciate, as we \njust discussed earlier, if he would withdraw this amendment. I will \nwork with my colleague Ranking Member Fattah from Philadelphia to help \naddress the concern you have got when we move to conference. I think it \nis a valid concern and one that we will work closely with you, sir, to \nresolve.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I would be happy to concur with the chair's \nevery utterance on this amendment that we will work together and help \nfacilitate what I think is a very righteous effort on behalf of \nCongressman Jeffries to protect the rights of all Americans to have \nprivileged conversations and interactions with their attorneys so that \ntheir rights can be fully protected.\n  I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time to hear \nfrom my colleague from New York for the purpose of completing the \ndiscussion.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Chairman, I thank the distinguished gentleman from \nTexas and the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania for their \nwillingness to work together on this very important issue in terms of \nthe preservation of the attorney-client privilege in the detainee \ncontext and look forward to working with the two of them and Members of \nthis august body to resolve this issue.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment at \nthis time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  June 3, 2015, on page H3809, the following appeared: There was \nno objection.

The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Commerce, Justice, Science, \n     and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016''.\n\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise \nand report the bill back to the House with sundry amendments, with the \nrecommendation that the amendments be agreed to and that the bill, as \namended, do pass.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nReed) having assumed the chair, Mr. Westmoreland, Acting Chair of the \nCommittee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that \nthat Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2578) \nmaking appropriations for the Departments of Commerce and Justice, \nScience, and Related Agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n2016, and for other purposes, directed him to report the bill back to \nthe House with sundry amendments adopted in the Committee of the Whole, \nwith the recommendation that the amendments be agreed to and that the \nbill, as amended, do pass.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is \nordered.\n\n[[Page H3815]]\n\n  Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment reported from the \nCommittee of the Whole? If not, the Chair will put them en gros.\n  The amendments were agreed to.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit \nat the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill?\n  Ms. BROWNLEY of California. I am in its current form.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Ms. Brownley of California moves to recommit the bill H.R. \n     2578 to the Committee on Appropriations with instructions to \n     report the same back to the House forthwith with the \n     following amendment:\n       Page 23, line 14, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $6,000,000)''.\n       In the ``Violence Against Women Prevention and Prosecution \n     Programs'' account, on page 38, line 9, after the dollar \n     amount, insert ``(increased by $3,000,000)''.\n       In the ``Violence Against Women Prevention and Prosecution \n     Programs'' account, on page 39, line 22, after the dollar \n     amount relating to sexual assault victims assistance, insert \n     ``(increased by $3,000,000)''.\n       In the ``Juvenile Justice Programs'' account, on page 47, \n     line 10, after the dollar amount relating to missing and \n     exploited children programs, insert ``(increased by \n     $3,000,000)''.\n\n  Ms. BROWNLEY of California (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask \nunanimous consent to dispense with the reading.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment \nto H.R. 2578, which will not kill the bill or send it back to \ncommittee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final \npassage, as amended.\n  My amendment would provide an additional $3 million for Violence \nAgainst Women prevention and prosecution programs, increasing resources \nfor sexual assault victims' assistance. My amendment would also provide \nan additional $3 million for Juvenile Justice programs, directed to the \nInternet Crimes Against Children Task Force program.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is more than ample room within the budget cap for \nthis bill to do more to help sexual assault victims and prevent the \nexploitation of children. I hope we can all agree that these critical \nprograms are worthy of added resources.\n  The Sexual Assault Services Program was authorized through the \nViolence Against Women Act and was the first Federal program dedicated \nto the provision of direct services to victims of sexual violence.\n  Across the country, the Sexual Assault Services Program supports \ncritical, lifesaving, safety net services. Support services are offered \nto both adult and minor survivors of sexual assault and to family \nmembers who are helping them cope with the mental health issues and \nphysical trauma of sexual assault.\n  The program also funds intervention and advocacy services, providing \nsurvivors with the help that they need to navigate through the medical \nand criminal justice systems.\n  For many survivors of sexual assault, this program is a critical and \nnecessary source of support at the most vulnerable time in their lives. \nWe must support these lifesaving programs and stand up for survivors of \nsexual assault.\n  Additionally, we must do more to protect vulnerable children from \npredators who despicably exploit children on the Internet. That is why \nmy amendment will provide a much-needed increase for the Internet \nCrimes Against Children Task Force program, which funds State and local \nlaw enforcement who investigate online child exploitation.\n  The program also provides forensic, prevention, and investigative \nassistance to law enforcement, educators, prosecutors, and families. \nThe program also ensures law enforcement officers are trained to deal \nwith online child pornography and child enticement so that these cases \nwill be fully investigated and prosecuted.\n  In 2014 alone, 7,800 individuals were arrested, and the task forces \naround the country conducted over 60,000 forensic investigations. \nClearly there is an urgent and compelling moral need to address these \nheinous crimes.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the motion to \nrecommit, to vote ``yes'' to protect women and girls from sexual \nassault and violence, to vote ``yes'' to protect children from online \npredators.\n  Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida \n(Ms. Wasserman Schultz), my friend who is a champion in protecting \nchildren.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the \ngentlewoman's motion to recommit because there are children out there \nwho need to be saved. They are waiting to be saved.\n  This motion provides additional funding for the Internet Crimes \nAgainst Children program, a national network of 61 coordinated law \nenforcement task forces investigating and prosecuting those who \nsexually exploit our most vulnerable constituents, our children.\n  With the proliferation of the Internet and wireless technology, \nonline child pornography has become an epidemic. And let's not forget \nthat these are not just heinous images. They are crime scene photos. \nThe ICAC needs resources to go after these criminals now.\n  According to estimates, half of these arrests lead us to the door of \na hands-on offender, and that is a child waiting to be rescued. Yet in \none recent year, the ICAC only had the resources to investigate a mere \n2 percent of all leads.\n  Previous increases in Federal funding have directly resulted in \nthousands more arrests, contributing to many more thousands of children \nwho are outright rescued or who will be spared contact with an abuser.\n  Let's take this opportunity to help the ICAC rescue more children. \nPlease, think about these precious babies being victimized. Let's \nrescue as many of them as possible. If you are a parent, God forbid it \nwas your own child.\n  I urge Members' support for the motion to recommit, and I thank the \ngentlewoman for her commitment to making sure that we can rescue \nAmerica's victimized children.\n  Ms. BROWNLEY of California. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Speaker, before I begin--and I will be very \nbrief--I want to make sure to thank the majority staff who have worked \nso hard on this bill. I want to thank our chief clerk, John Martens; \nLeslie Albright; Jeff Ashford; Taylor Kelly; Colin Samples; and Aschley \nSchiller for their tireless work drafting this bill, along with Bob \nBonner and Matt Smith on the minority's staff and Corey Inglee and \nMegan Olmstead in my personal office. And a personal thank you to my \ngood friend, the Congressman from Philadelphia, who has done such a \ngreat job. We have worked together arm in arm on this bill.\n  Starting at about 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon, we have worked \nthrough over 80 amendments. All the gentlewoman from California (Ms. \nBrownley) would have had to do was to show up here. During the course \nof that debate, any Member could have offered an amendment, and that is \none of the great things about this process.\n  I want to thank our majority leader and our Speaker, Mr. Boehner, for \nopening up the legislative process. Unlike in the past, any Member of \nthis Congress could stand up and represent their 700,000 constituents. \nYou could take a Big Chief notepad and a pencil and just write out an \namendment and walk right down there and give it to the Clerk.\n  All the gentlewoman from California had to do was just write the \namendment up and present it to the Clerk. Why, we would have even \naccepted it. But instead, she offers it up here today as a procedural \ntrick to confuse and confound.\n  We produced a great bill. The ranking member and I have worked \ntogether arm in arm to produce a good\n\n[[Page H3816]]\n\nbill that protects this Nation's investment in space exploration and \nscientific research but, above all, invests in the good people of the \nlaw enforcement community.\n  Mr. HOYER. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. CULBERSON. I yield to the minority leader.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman. I am the whip. I wanted to make \nthat perfectly clear.\n  The fact of the matter is, did the gentleman just say if this \namendment had been offered previously that you would have accepted it?\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Absolutely, because it would have been done properly.\n  Mr. HOYER. But you are now urging----\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will suspend.\n  Mr. HOYER. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has the time.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. The gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) is exactly \nright. We would have accepted this amendment earlier in the process \nbecause it is an open process. Anyone has a chance to come down here \nand offer an amendment in an open and free House of Representatives. \nThat is why this amendment should be defeated.\n  We have got a good bill. I urge Members to vote ``no'' against this \nmotion to recommit.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n  Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas \nand nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, this 5-\nminute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by a 5-minute \nvote on the passage of the bill.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 184, \nnays 240, not voting 8, as follows:\n\n                             [Roll No. 296]\n\n                               YEAS--184\n\n     Aguilar\n     Ashford\n     Bass\n     Beatty\n     Becerra\n     Bera\n     Beyer\n     Bishop (GA)\n     Blumenauer\n     Bonamici\n     Boyle, Brendan F.\n     Brady (PA)\n     Brown (FL)\n     Brownley (CA)\n     Bustos\n     Butterfield\n     Capps\n     Capuano\n     Cardenas\n     Carney\n     Carson (IN)\n     Cartwright\n     Castor (FL)\n     Castro (TX)\n     Chu, Judy\n     Cicilline\n     Clark (MA)\n     Clarke (NY)\n     Clay\n     Cleaver\n     Clyburn\n     Cohen\n     Connolly\n     Conyers\n     Cooper\n     Costa\n     Courtney\n     Crowley\n     Cuellar\n     Cummings\n     Davis (CA)\n     Davis, Danny\n     DeFazio\n     DeGette\n     Delaney\n     DeLauro\n     DelBene\n     DeSaulnier\n     Deutch\n     Dingell\n     Doggett\n     Doyle, Michael F.\n     Duckworth\n     Edwards\n     Ellison\n     Engel\n     Eshoo\n     Esty\n     Farr\n     Fattah\n     Foster\n     Frankel (FL)\n     Fudge\n     Gabbard\n     Gallego\n     Garamendi\n     Graham\n     Grayson\n     Green, Al\n     Green, Gene\n     Grijalva\n     Gutierrez\n     Hahn\n     Hastings\n     Heck (WA)\n     Higgins\n     Himes\n     Hinojosa\n     Honda\n     Hoyer\n     Huffman\n     Israel\n     Jeffries\n     Johnson (GA)\n     Johnson, E.

Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the \nfirst time.\n  The gentleman from Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart) and the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Price) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to present to the House today for \nconsideration H.R. 2577, the Transportation, Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for fiscal year \n2016.\n  The committee has put forth a bill that conforms to our 302(b) \nallocation of $55.3 billion in budget authority and is in line with the \nbudget cap of 1.016, ``ten sixteen.''\n  Under such an allocation, we prioritized programs and spending to \nachieve, really, three very important basic goals: first, we continue \nthe ob lim funding levels of MAP-21 contingent upon reauthorization; we \nkeep the commercial airspace running smoothly; and also we preserve the \nhousing option for all current HUD-assisted families.\n  Mr. Chairman, I think this is a balanced bill with the allocation \nthat has been given to us by the chairman. The Department of \nTransportation is funded at $17.2 billion in budget authority and $70.6 \nbillion in total budgetary resources to ensure, Mr. Chairman, the safe \nand effective transportation of goods and people in America.\n  The Department of Housing and Urban Development is funded at $42 \nbillion to provide housing opportunities and assistance to the most \nvulnerable in both cities and rural areas across our great Nation.\n  Mr. Chairman, as you know, we are a diverse body and this is a very \ndiverse bill, and I know some Members will speak for increased funding. \nI would like to remind my colleagues that if you are going to be voting \nagainst this bill, you are voting against the commercial airspace \nsystem and our air traffic controllers and control system; against \nhousing programs for the most vulnerable, including the elderly and \nfamilies; and frankly, you would also be voting against community \ndevelopment block grants that are vital to the cities and counties that \nwe all represent.\n  Some, however, Mr. Chairman, will speak for lower spending. Here it \nis also important to remember that the House passed a budget \nresolution, which this bill adheres to, Mr. Chairman, and the Congress \nand the President are currently bound by the Budget Control Act, which \ndoes include sequester. So this bill takes the responsible steps of \nsetting funding priorities for the next fiscal year, many of which are \nshared, frankly, between both parties, and again, very important, \nwithout doing it with across-the-board cuts or across-the-board \nsequester.\n  The whole House of Representatives now has the opportunity for full \nconsideration of this legislation. It is imperative that we move this \nbill to final passage reflecting the amendments obviously adopted by \nthe House, and we move this bill to conference in time for the new \nfiscal year.\n  I really need to first thank my friend, the gentleman from North \nCarolina and the ranking member of this\n\n[[Page H3818]]\n\nsubcommittee, Mr. Price, for his ideas and his support in drafting this \npiece of legislation. The gentleman, as anyone who has dealt with him \nknows, gives a lot of thought and careful consideration to the many \nprograms under our jurisdiction, and I appreciate his willingness to \ncollaborate on this bill that is now before us.\n  I would also like to thank, in particular, Chairman Rogers and also \nRanking Member Lowey plus the members of the committee, and yes, I must \nsay, especially the members of the subcommittee for the hours and hours \nspent in hearings, markups, and meetings, working together in a \ncooperative effort to bring this bill to the floor and eventually \nsigned into law. Finally, as we can never do enough, I want to thank \nthe staff on both sides of the aisle for their incredible hard work.\n  I urge the expeditious adoption of this bill, Mr. Chairman, and at \nthis time, I reserve the balance of my time.\nTH03JN15.001\n\n\n[[Page H3819]]\n\nTH03JN15.002\n\n\n\n[[Page H3820]]\n\nTH03JN15.003\n\n\n\n[[Page H3821]]\n\nTH03JN15.004\n\n\n\n[[Page H3822]]\n\nTH03JN15.005\n\n\n\n[[Page H3823]]\n\nTH03JN15.006\n\n\n\n[[Page H3824]]\n\nTH03JN15.007\n\n\n\n[[Page H3825]]\n\nTH03JN15.008\n\n\n\n[[Page H3826]]\n\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time \nas I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, as we begin consideration of H.R. 2577, the fiscal year \n2016 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related \nAgencies Appropriations bill, I want to start by thanking our chairman, \nChairman Diaz-Balart, for the hard work he has put in on this bill. He \nhas been open and accessible throughout this year's process, and he has \nbeen receptive to my concerns and the concerns that other subcommittee \nmembers and other colleagues have raised. It has been a pleasure \nworking with him, and I look forward to continuing to do that \nthroughout this process.\n  I also want to echo the thanks he just expressed to our hardworking \nstaff, to Dena Baron and her colleagues in the majority, to Kate \nHallahan and Joe Carlile on our side of the aisle, as well as Laura \nThrift and Kate Roetzer from my personal staff.\n  Now, unfortunately, I have to add that there is going to be a lot of \nfurther work to do. It is necessary, and it is going to be difficult. \nThat is not the chairman's fault. He was dealt an impossible hand in \nthe Republican budget and an allocation that is simply unworkable.\n  At first glance, it might appear that this bill is a relative winner \nwhen compared to other appropriations bills, as Chairman Rogers did \nincrease the subcommittee's allocation by $1.5 million. However, the \nreality is that once you factor in declining Federal Housing \nAdministration receipts, increased Section 8 renewal costs, and other \ninflationary adjustments, this bill is actually $1.5 billion below last \nyear's funding level, resulting in fewer services and less capital \ninvestment than last year.\n  Mr. Chairman, the programs under the jurisdiction of this \nsubcommittee are critical to our Nation's economic and social well-\nbeing: providing necessary funding to improve housing and \ntransportation options, creating infrastructure jobs for hardworking \nAmerican families, and ensuring safe and adequate transportation \nnetworks for goods, commuters, and travelers. But our Nation's \ntransportation and housing systems face daunting challenges, and on \nalmost every count, this bill falls short.\n\n                              {time}  1915\n\n  The President requested a robust increase for this bill for fiscal \n2016, calling on Congress to provide the critical investments necessary \nto accelerate and sustain economic growth. Unfortunately, the bill \nbefore us would not even begin to address our infrastructure needs.\n  In transportation, the bill levies deep cuts to capital programs. As \nwe learned from the Amtrak derailment last month in Philadelphia, these \ncuts can have clear, direct consequences for the safety of our \ntransportation system. The bill before us cuts Amtrak by 18 percent--18 \npercent--below last year. There is no funding for the expansion of \nsafety mechanisms, including Positive Train Control, which regulates \nthe excessive speeds that caused the Philadelphia derailment.\n  Now, no one can say whether Positive Train Control would have \nprevented the tragedy in Philadelphia, but cutting funding certainly \nisn't making our transportation system any safer. How many train \nderailments, how many bridge collapses is it going to take before the \nmajority agrees that we must invest in our crumbling transportation \ninfrastructure?\n  The bill before us would also reduce funding for the New Starts \nprogram in the Federal Transit Administration by 8 percent below this \nyear, 40 percent below the President's request. It would cut DOT's \nenormously popular TIGER program by 80 percent. It cuts the Federal \nAviation Administration's capital program by $355 million below the \nPresident's request, $100 million below last year. That will hamper \nFAA's ability to maintain and improve aging facilities and will slow \ndown progress on the critical NextGen program.\n  The bill doesn't just provide insufficient funding for critical \ninvestments; it also contains toxic provisions completely unrelated to \nthe appropriations process. For instance, riders on truck length and \nweight have no place in this bill. They should be left to the \nauthorizing committees. The bill also continues to delay full \nimplementation of the Department of Transportation's hours-of-service \nrule for driver safety by including additional, unmanageable study \nrequirements. These riders, I regret to say, value the bottom line of \nthe trucking industry over driver safety. They will actually make our \nroads more dangerous.\n  The bill also attempts to undermine President Obama's new policy \nrelated to the United States' relationship with Cuba. Some of the \nriders aim to prevent scheduled air services and cruise ship travel to \nCuban ports of entry.\n  On the housing side, the bill fails to adequately address the capital \nneeds of public housing. For example, the bill provides only the token \namount of $20 million for the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment's Choice Neighborhoods Initiative. At such a low funding \nlevel, the program won't be able to fulfill its mission--transforming \nclusters of poverty into functioning, sustainable mixed-income \nneighborhoods and allowing the children who live there to have the \nopportunities that all Americans deserve.\n  The bill contains $1.68 billion for the Public Housing Capital Fund, \nwhich is a $194 million cut from last year. If enacted, this level \nwould be about the same as the funding level in 1989. That is 26 years \nago! Given that new maintenance needs accrue at $3.4 billion per year, \nthis level of funding would cover less than half the need while doing \nnothing to address a backlog that now amounts to $25 billion.\n  The majority's bill transforms--or, more accurately, devolves--the \nHousing for the Elderly and Housing for the Disabled programs into \npurely rental renewal programs. Without capital funding, the supply of \nsafe, decent, and affordable housing for the elderly and for the \ndisabled will not keep up with the demand.\n  Mr. Chairman, for centuries, our country's economic competitiveness \nhas been built upon a world-class infrastructure that enabled \ninnovation and ingenuity to flourish. This bill and the budgetary \nlevels it reflects undermine the continued viability of our Nation's \ninfrastructure and our economic vitality. We simply cannot write a \ncredible bill until we have a new budget agreement.\n  This bill clearly illustrates the folly of dogmatically insisting on \ndomestic appropriations cuts as the sole focus of deficit reduction--\nthat is the majority's strategy--while leaving the main drivers of the \ndeficit unaddressed. Under sequestration funding levels, any \nadvancement of appropriations bills is simply delaying the day of \nreckoning. So let's stop this charade now. Let's not wait for \nPresidential vetoes or for governmental shutdowns. Let's confront it \nnow! Let's begin serious, broad budget negotiations.\n  I know we can responsibly chart a course to fiscal balance; we have \ndone it before, as recently as the 1990s. We achieved budget surpluses \nas the result of a concerted, bipartisan effort to balance the budget \nthrough a comprehensive approach. And I mean comprehensive. Revenues, \nentitlements, military and domestic appropriations, everything was on \nthe table. We balanced the budget 4 years in a row. We paid off more \nthan $400 billion of this Nation's debt. Why is that lesson so hard to \nrecollect?\n  By contrast, the current Republican budget gives us the worst of both \nworlds. It fails as fiscal policy, and it decimates the investments a \ngreat country must make.\n  In its current form, Mr. Chairman, I cannot support the fiscal 2016 \nT-HUD Appropriations bill. I do remain hopeful, however, that this bill \ncould be improved as it goes through the appropriations process. I will \ncontinue working with the chairman as we move forward. I am confident \nthat a new agreement on funding levels can give this bill and America's \ntransportation and housing infrastructure the resources that our \nnational interest requires.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, at this time, I yield as much time as \nhe may use to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Rogers), a friend, a \nleader, a teacher, and the chairman of the full Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. I thank the chairman for yielding me this \ntime.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this bill, obviously, the fiscal \n2016 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill.\n\n[[Page H3827]]\n\n  Mr. Chairman, I am proud that we have this piece of legislation. It \nis our fifth appropriations bill of this year on the floor today. It is \nthe next step in our ongoing effort to fully fund the government before \nthe end of the fiscal year, as is our congressional duty.\n  This bill, as the chairman has said, funds a wide range of Federal \nprograms that affect every citizen of every district of every State. \nFrom the transportation infrastructure that moves goods, people, and \nbusinesses around the country to the housing options that help most \nthose in need, the benefits of the programs in this bill are felt far \nand wide.\n  In total, the bill provides $55.3 billion in discretionary spending \ndue to reduced offsets, including lower FHA receipts. The bill \nrepresents a $25 million increase above the current year.\n  This is a tight budget, Mr. Chairman. Yet the bill targets funds to \nprovide adequate investments in critical infrastructure and much-\nrelied-upon housing programs.\n  Of the total, $17.2 billion goes toward discretionary funding for \nDOT, prioritizing projects that have great benefits to our Nation as a \nwhole and that will help make this Nation's transportation systems \nsafer and more efficient.\n  This includes $15.9 billion for the Federal Aviation Administration. \nA portion of that money will go to what is called the NextGen program \nto improve efficiency in our airways and reduce congestion and delays.\n  The Federal highway program gets $40.2 billion from the highway trust \nfund, an amount equal to last year, but that is subject to continued \nauthorization. This funding will ensure our roadways, bridges, and \ntunnels can safely and smoothly facilitate the flow of American \ncommerce.\n  The Federal Railroad Administration is funded at $1.4 billion. That \nincludes $289 million for Amtrak operations, the same as last year, and \n$850 million for capital grants, as well as $187 million for critical \nsafety and research programs. Total FRA funding is reduced by $262 \nmillion, but rail safety, which is so important, is held harmless from \nany reductions.\n  In fact, safety was a priority throughout the bill, and that is \nevident in the funding levels. For instance, the National Highway \nTraffic Safety Administration received $6.5 million more than last \nyear, and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration \nreceives a $6.9 million bump up to help address safety concerns \nregarding the transport of energy products.\n  Beyond these important infrastructure investments, the bill also \nincludes a total of $42 billion for the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment. This level will guarantee that all individuals and \nfamilies currently receiving housing assistance will continue to be \nserved by this program, and it ensures that the 77,000 VASH vouchers \nwhich support our veterans remain in circulation.\n  Important housing programs for some of our most vulnerable citizens, \nthe elderly and persons with disabilities, also receive targeted \nincreases. To help bolster economic growth in local communities, the \nbill provides $6.4 billion in grant funding for economic development. \nInvesting in our communities through programs like Community \nDevelopment Block Grants will allow funds to be targeted to local areas \nto meet their unique needs.\n  Now, as with all appropriations bills, particularly in these tight \nbudget times, we had to take a close look at what was mission critical \nand what was lower on the priority list. Some tough choices had to be \nmade and some programs had to be reduced. Overall, I believe this bill \nputs everything in its proper place and does the very best within its \nallotted resources.\n  I want to thank the chairman of the subcommittee, Congressman Diaz-\nBalart. This is his maiden voyage as a cardinal, a chairman of a \nsubcommittee, his first voyage at sea. We hope it is a safe and smooth \none. And I am proud to say to him, ``Job well done so far.'' So we wish \nfor you the very best.\n  Thanks to David Price and the members of the committee, subcommittee, \nall the staff; my counterpart Mrs. Lowey. I thank all of you for \nworking hard on this bill.\n  I am proud to support this bill, and I ask my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey), our distinguished ranking \nmember of the full committee.\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I, too, would like to congratulate Chairman \nDiaz-Balart and Ranking Member Price in their new roles on the \nsubcommittee. You have worked so hard, you have worked together, and I \nreally do want to express my appreciation. And to Chairman Rogers, \nthank you for your work. I would particularly like to thank the \nchairman for his support of my grade crossing safety requests.\n  However, the Republican bill to fund transportation and housing \npriorities drastically shortchanges job-creating investments critical \nto hard-working American families, like roads, bridges, rail systems, \nand access to safe and affordable housing. At the same time, it \nincludes special interest giveaways for the trucking industry and other \npolicy riders that make our roads less safe and our rail system less \ncompetitive and meddles foolishly in foreign policy.\n  Despite the fact that our infrastructure needs are increasing, the \nbill before us takes a giant step backward. We cannot meet tomorrow's \nchallenges by slashing investments in TIGER, transit, and air traffic \nmodernization.\n  Even though the bill was considered in full committee the morning \nafter last month's tragic Amtrak crash in Philadelphia, the majority \nvoted down amendments to increase funds for Amtrak capital investments \nand positive train control, which the NTSB has said would have \nprevented the derailment. Yet it does not receive any funding in the \nbill.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  While we do not yet have all of the answers to the horrific accident \nin Philadelphia, we do know that starving Amtrak of funding will \ninhibit safety upgrades, track, and capital improvements. Our continued \nfailure to invest in road and rail infrastructure is not just unwise; \nit is plainly a public safety hazard.\n  Before I turn to housing, it is important to mention the plentiful \nlegislative riders. Christmas came early for the trucking industry: \nlonger, heavier trucks; the stalled enforcement of hours-of-service \nrules; and inadequate insurance requirements.\n  Controversial riders have no place in an already difficult \nappropriations process. At a time when roads and bridges are crumbling \nand when there is a national crisis of affordable housing, it makes no \nsense to use this critical bill to meddle in foreign policy by \nincluding riders on Cuba.\n  With regard to housing, adequate funding to renew existing vouchers \nis provided, but it isn't sufficient to meet our country's actual \nhousing needs.\n  Significantly cutting Lead Hazard Control will slow the progress on \neliminating household toxins despite the fact that the successful \nprogram has resulted in lower lead poisoning and in better educational \nand behavioral outcomes.\n  Slashing Choice Neighborhoods by $230 million, or 92 percent below \nthe President's request, guts resources to transform clusters of \npoverty into functioning, sustainable mixed-income neighborhoods; and \nit prevents the children who live there from having the opportunities \nthat all Americans deserve.\n  Employing gimmicks to fund HOME through the housing trust fund \nperpetuates another gap in the spectrum of affordable housing.\n  Democrats are more than willing to support bills that make \ninvestments to grow our economy and create opportunity for hard-working \nAmericans. Unfortunately, this bill falls far short of that goal.\n  Again, in conclusion, I want to thank the chairman, the ranking \nmember, and all of the hard-working staff. Although I urge my \ncolleagues to vote ``no,'' I do hope we can move forward and get to \nreal bills so we can work together and complete this process on \nespecially this very important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Kansas (Mr. Yoder), an indispensable member of the subcommittee.\n  Mr. YODER. I appreciate the chairman for yielding time in this \ndebate.\n  I want to thank Chairman Diaz-Balart, Chairman Rogers, Ranking\n\n[[Page H3828]]\n\nMember Price, and Ranking Member Lowey for their work in putting \ntogether what is, I think, one of the best bills to come through \nCongress as we debate how to balance our challenges with our budget and \nhow to make sure we enhance safety and improve our economy all at the \nsame time.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is one of the earliest opportunities we have had \nto debate this piece of legislation in the appropriations process since \n1974, which is a commendable achievement. I want to thank Chairman \nDiaz-Balart for his leadership, and I ask for the body to support this \ngood piece of legislation.\n  There are really three great reasons to support this bill.\n  First of all, it is great for the economy as we invest in our \nNation's critical transportation projects and programs and invest in \nhousing projects to help America's poverty families all across our \ndistricts.\n  It helps to promote safety enhancement on our infrastructure by \nensuring that our roads, rails, and airways are safe for all Americans. \nIt increases funding for the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration; it increases funding for the Federal Motor Carrier \nSafety Administration, and it increases funding for the Pipeline and \nHazardous Materials Safety Administration--all to help protect the \nsafety of Americans.\n  It works to enhance the responsible efforts to spend money in this \ncapital. Most Americans know Washington is spending too much money, and \nour budget is not in balance. It is a tough job, and I commend the \ncommittee for doing the hard work to ensure that we are good stewards \nof taxpayer dollars, so as to keep to the balanced budget agreement \nthat the House and Senate passed for the first time since 2001.\n  The bill also works towards needed policy achievements that would \nhelp farmers in my State of Kansas or that would help keep the cost of \ngoods down for hard-working Americans because the prices at the grocery \nstores are too high.\n  In Kansas, for example, the bill helps to ensure that Kansas laws are \nin parity with States like Nebraska and Oklahoma when it comes to the \nlength of a trailer that custom harvesters can use. This is a provision \nthat is supported by the Kansas Highway Patrol, the Kansas Department \nof Transportation, the Kansas Department of Agriculture.\n  I would ask my colleagues from across the aisle to listen to the \nleaders in Kansas. The leaders of public safety in Kansas and those \nwithin the highway patrol support this provision. Let's not subject the \nwill of Washington over the will of people in Kansas when it comes to \nhelping farmers with truck length for custom harvesters.\n  It works to eliminate the number of trucks that are on the road. This \nbill's actually extending the trailer length will eliminate 6.6 million \ntruck trips; it will save 1.3 billion miles driven; it will reduce \ncarbon emissions by 4.4 billion pounds annually, and it will eliminate \nthe need for every ninth truck in our economy. Truck tonnage is \nprojected to grow by 23 percent over the next 12 years, so it makes \nsense to move freight in fewer trucks.\n  The bill also works to enhance a program we started last year for \nshort line rail safety, which would help short line rail companies \nacross this country have the ability to have a stronger and sustainable \nsafety culture as they move more and more of our goods.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is a good bill. It promotes safety; it promotes \nour economy, and it creates jobs.\n  I urge the bipartisan support of this legislation to help the \nAmerican economy.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I am happy to yield 2 \nminutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), our colleague who \nis the ranking member of the Transportation and Infrastructure \nCommittee.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Chairman, we have all heard about America and American \nexceptionalism, and tonight, we see here a great new example for the \n21st century the Republican majority version of American \nexceptionalism. A country that used to be the envy of the world with \nits infrastructure has now become a laughingstock of the industrial \nworld because it is falling apart.\n  There are 150,000 bridges on the National Highway System that need \nrepair or replacement, and with this bill, next year, it will be \n160,000 that will need repair or replacement. There is 40 percent of \nthe road surface on the National Highway System that needs not just \nresurfacing; it is so bad that it has to be dug up. Next year, there \nwill be more miles that are deficient.\n  And our transit? There is an $80 billion backlog just to bring our \nexisting transit systems up to a state of good repair. It is so bad \nthat we are killing people unnecessarily here in the Nation's Capital \non the mass transit system; and what does the Republican budget do? It \ncuts the allocation to the Metro system here in D.C. In the greatest \ncountry on Earth, it will be dangerous to ride on the Metro system \nbecause we can't afford to fix it.\n  They failed to distinguish between investment--investment in moving \nour people and our goods more efficiently--and spending. They rail \nabout spending, but they cut indiscriminately, and they add money in \nplaces we don't need it.\n  Let's go down the list.\n  In aviation, we want to build a 21st century air traffic control \nsystem, but they cut that budget $100 million.\n  The Coast Guard is spread so thin it can't meet its own criteria for \nsearch and rescue, but they are $17 million below what the President \nproposed, and there is no money in here for a new Coast Guard \nicebreaker. We are a great maritime nation. We are down to one 50-year-\nold, decrepit icebreaker. That is not going to serve our country too \nwell.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman an \nadditional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Then Amtrak, they cut Amtrak by $251 million in its \ncapital accounts. On the day that we had the Amtrak crash, they cut the \ncapital acquisition account for Amtrak by $251 million, despite the \nfact that Amtrak has a $20 billion backlog.\n  There are 140-year-old tunnels that are near collapse, which will \nparalyze the East Coast. There are bridges that are 100, 110, 120 years \nold--and, yes, we do not yet have the positive train control system on \nall of Amtrak's routes.\n  That has been something that has only been recommended for 25 years \nby the National Transportation Safety Board. This is pretty pathetic.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom North Carolina (Mr. Rouzer).\n  Mr. ROUZER. I thank the chairman.\n  I am proud to lend my full support to the chairman's bill to fund our \ntransportation systems that are so vital to moving this country \nforward.\n  Mr. Chairman, important needs of our industries and countless \nbusinesses in North Carolina are addressed by this legislation.\n  First, a marginal increase in the length of twin trailers carrying \nfreight over North Carolina's roads will allow more freight to be \ncarried per trip, thus decreasing the number of trucks on the road. \nThis modest change to 33 feet in length has a large impact on \nproductivity. Slightly longer trailers improve stability because you \nhave a longer wheelbase.\n  More productivity means a slower growth rate of truck trips on our \nroads. With this change, there would be 6.6 million fewer truck trips \nper year; and, according to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety \nAdministration's data, it would prevent at least 912 highway accidents \nevery year.\n  Mr. Chairman, I think it is important to note that the North Carolina \nTroopers Association is focused on supporting policies that promote \nsafety and improve law enforcement in the State of North Carolina and \nacross this country. They support modernizing freight transportation \nregulations to allow for 33 feet in length.\n  Mr. Chairman, I submit for the Record their letter in support of this \nchange.\n\n                                                      May 6, 2015.\n     Secretary Anthony Foxx,\n     Department of Transportation,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Foxx: The North Carolina Troopers \n     Association, founded in 1977, is focused on supporting \n     policies that promote safety and improve law enforcement in \n     the state of North Carolina and the United States of America. \n     We are grateful for your leadership on policies at the \n     intersection of\n\n[[Page H3829]]\n\n     safety, law enforcement and transportation. From the \n     Charlotte City Council and Mayor's Office to the Department \n     of Transportation and the President's Cabinet, the central \n     questions remain the same. Which policy choices will do the \n     most to keep people safe?\n       We often work alongside the North Carolina Trucking \n     Association on matters concerning the transportation of \n     freight on the national highway system as well as the \n     extensive network of North Carolina highways and roads. From \n     Murphy to Manteo, we partner with professional drivers to \n     keep everyone safe on the roads.\n       We support truck safety advances such as lane departure \n     technologies and adaptive speed controls and encourage the \n     continued adoption of modern technology and training \n     techniques.\n       The less than truckload (LTL) market has a significant \n     footprint in North Carolina not least in the areas around \n     Greensboro and Charlotte. We understand the American Trucking \n     Associations along with other leading LTL companies, the \n     United States Chamber of Commerce, and the National \n     Association of Manufacturers, back a proposal to increase the \n     length of twin trailers in the LTL freight market by five \n     feet with no change to federal weight limits. We support the \n     proposal for several reasons.\n       First, a marginal increase to the length of twin trailers \n     carrying freight on North Carolina's roads will result in an \n     increase in cubic capacity allowing more freight to be \n     carried per trip, thus decreasing the number of trucks on the \n     road. A modest change in length has a large impact on \n     productivity. More productivity makes it easier to slow the \n     growth rate of truck trips on our road system.\n       Modernizing freight transportation regulations to allow for \n     33-ft. doubles means 6.6 million fewer truck trips per year \n     and according to Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration \n     data it would prevent at least 912 highway accidents every \n     year.\n       Second, studies from the experts at the University of \n     Michigan and the federal Department of Transportation show \n     that an increase to the length of the wheel base without an \n     increase to weight limitations creates a more stable truck \n     for both straight line driving and cornering. Indeed, the \n     proposal for five more feet on twin trailers came from a 2002 \n     analysis from the Transportation Research Board (Special \n     Report 267, 2002).\n       In addition, fewer trucks on the road will inevitably lead \n     to much needed relief for North Carolina's infrastructure. In \n     2013, some 9.7 billion tons of freight was carried by truck. \n     The proposal for twin 33s would shift a portion of that \n     freight--the LTL market--into trailers with a slightly longer \n     wheelbase providing benefit for North Carolina bridges.\n       We are encouraged by your advocacy for better, smarter, \n     safer transportation policies. When the proposal for a five \n     foot extension--with no change in weight limits for twin \n     trailers--comes before Congress we ask you to provide the \n     full support of your office.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Daniel S. Jenkins, Jr.,\n                   President, North Carolina Troopers Association.\n\n  Mr. ROUZER. I am also pleased to support the committee's language \nthat would continue to prohibit the use of funds to enforce the restart \nprovisions of hours-of-service rules for our truck drivers. The \ntrucking industry does not need more regulations imposed upon them in \nthe name of safety.\n  Safety is an absolute priority for their industry. Trucking companies \nknow that, without good safety records, they will not be the carriers \nof choice for businesses that need to move freight.\n  Mr. Chairman, each of these provisions will help spur economic growth \nthroughout our Nation and enable us to better compete and thrive \nglobally. My constituents in the manufacturing and agricultural \nindustries are interested in making Federal transportation policies \nmore conducive to the productive and efficient movement of the goods, \nand these provisions will help facilitate that.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how \nmuch time both sides have remaining?\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from North Carolina has 14 minutes \nremaining, and the gentleman from Florida has 15 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time \nas I may consume.\n  As for the ideas that are being thrown back and forth here tonight \nabout highway safety and driver safety, the advocates for highway and \nauto safety who are looking at this bill and evaluating this bill \ninclude the Teamsters and the Short Line Railroad Association.\n  My own highway patrol in North Carolina came to see me; they came on \ntheir own volition, and they had pictures, Mr. Chairman, of carnage on \nour highways. It left no doubt that they were not interested in seeing \nheavier and longer trucks and relaxed rules on our highways.\n  I suggest that Members might want to check in with safety advocates \nand with law enforcement in their own States and see what kind of \nassessments they get of this highly irregular effort that is going on \nhere tonight of writing into appropriations bills provisions that \nhaven't had hearings, that haven't had thorough evaluations.\n  In some cases, they overturn evaluations that are already in the \nprocess--evaluations that this body has ordered up--prejudging the \nconsequences and the conclusions of those studies and are moving ahead \nwith ill-advised relaxations in truck and auto safety.\n  I suggest that Members will want to take a critical look at that.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee), one of those additional \nspeakers, a member of the Committee on Appropriations.\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding but \nalso for his very thoughtful leadership on the subcommittee as our \nranking member.\n  I rise to express my grave concerns regarding the funding levels for \nour transportation and housing programs provided in this bill. Once \nagain, the majority has brought a bill to the floor that includes \ndrastic and misguided sequester cuts to programs that are critical to \nthe American economy and to the lives of the most vulnerable and to \ncreating jobs.\n  Under the transportation title, the bill funds TIGER grants $1.15 \nbillion below the President's request. Similarly, Small Starts and New \nStarts are underfunded from the President's request by over $1 billion. \nThese are programs that create jobs and create economic growth. It is \ncompletely nonsensical to starve our communities of the proven Federal \ninvestments in transportation that we so desperately need.\n  The bill before us drastically underfunds our critical housing \nprograms, including $25 million less than the President's request for \nelderly and disabled housing. Yes, that is elderly and disabled \nhousing. It zeroes out the housing trust fund, which helps the lowest \nincome Americans, and it is $320 million less than the request for \nChoice Neighborhoods. These cuts keep people living on the margins and \npush more people into poverty and homelessness.\n  Before I conclude, let me just say how inappropriate it is in this \nbill, like all these bills that we are seeing, they contain language \nthat would turn, now, this bill, the Treasury-HUD bill, into an \nideological and wrongheaded foreign policy document by restricting \ntravel to Cuba. I introduced an amendment to strike this language and \nwill be introducing a bipartisan amendment with my friend \nRepresentative Mark Sanford to do the same on this bill. We need a 21st \ncentury approach to our relations with the nation that is 90 miles from \nour shores, not to cling to cold war era policies.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. I yield an additional 1 minute to my \ncolleague.\n  Ms. LEE. Americans deserve the right to travel to wherever they would \nso desire. They travel to China and Vietnam; Americans have that right. \nWhy shouldn't they have the right to travel to a country 90 miles off \nof our shores? Cold war era policies are just that, 50-year-old \npolicies that have failed. They are wrong, first of all. They are very \nridiculous at this point, and they don't make any sense. So to keep \ntrying to put these amendments into nongermane bills where it makes no \nsense is mind-boggling to me. I hope that we can get that amendment \nout.\n  I just want to thank the ranking member for his efforts, given the \ntremendous constraints allotted by Republican austerity budgeting.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar), a\n\n[[Page H3830]]\n\ndistinguished member of our Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and \nUrban Development, and Related Agencies.\n  Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Chairman, first of all, I want to thank the ranking \nmember, Mr. Price, for the leadership that he has provided in this \ncommittee, and also, thank you to his staff.\n  I also want to thank my friend Chairman Mario Diaz-Balart for his \nleadership in working on this bill in a bipartisan way. There are a \ncouple things I just want to point out that are important to the State \nof Texas. First of all, one of the issues that we worked on together \nwas to make sure that we direct the Federal highway authority to \ncontinue to develop a freight network that connects to our high-volume \nland ports of entry.\n  Some of the maps that I have seen show that they don't connect to the \nland ports; but just to give you an idea, in my hometown of Laredo, the \nlargest inland port, if you look at the trucks that come in, those are \n12,000 trailers every single day. This is why this particular language \ngot added: to make sure that the freight is connected to land ports of \nentry and will make sure that American communities are able to get \nproducts that are coming into the United States.\n  The other thing I do want to emphasize that was put in in this \nparticular bill has to do with encouraging the standardization of \npassenger rail standards between the U.S. and Mexico, which means \nbasically from the San Antonio area to the Laredo area to the Monterrey \narea, and this is something that will be one of the first. I want to \nthank the chairman and the ranking member for putting in that language.\n  Finally, the last thing I want to bring up is the language that helps \nHUD pay a little bit more attention to colonias. As you know, colonias \nare third-world communities that have no water and no sewage. Putting \nin this type of language will help thousands of people that live in \nthird-world conditions. After speaking to Secretary Castro and speaking \nto the chairman and the ranking member, Mr. Price, this will put a \nfocus on that.\n  I want to thank the ranking member for his good work. I also thank my \nfriend, the chairman, so much for working with me on this language.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I have no further \nspeakers, so I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I also yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this bill for many \nreasons, but one short-sited cut stands out. This bill cuts HUD's \nOffice of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes by $35 million. Let me \nexplain in the simplest terms I can what a $35 million cut would mean: \nthousands of children in the United States will be poisoned.\n  Thousands of housing units identified as containing lead paint \nhazards will not be made safe for the children who live there. \nThousands of children will be needlessly subjected to decreased IQ and \ncognitive function across their entire lifespan, developmental delays, \nbehavior problems, learning disabilities, seizures, coma, and even \ndeath. Lead poisoning impacts the decision making center of the brain. \nChildren with lead poisoning are 7 times more likely to drop out of \nschool, more likely to engage in risk-taking behaviors, and more likely \nto engage in criminal activity.\n  Lead poisoning is entirely preventable--but to save a few dollars, \nthis Majority will let them suffer. And it doesn't even save a few \ndollars. The total annual costs of lead poisoning to society are over \n$50 billion. Every dollar spent on lead hazard control activities has a \nbenefit of $17 to $220 in medical, educational, and criminal justice \ncosts. A $35 million cut will create a minimum of $600 million, and \npossibly nearly $8 billion in additional costs to society.\n  In my district in Rochester, NY, 200 children were confirmed with \nlead poisoning in 2014. Two hundred children. That's ten kindergarten \nclassrooms full of kids. That is simply not acceptable. This $35 \nmillion cut would let another 119 children be poisoned in my district \nalone. When lead poisoning is entirely preventable, I do not know how \nwe can stand to have the lifelong negative impacts on those children's \nlives on our conscience.\n  The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment \nunder the 5-minute rule.\n  During consideration of the bill for amendment each amendment shall \nbe debatable for 10 minutes equally divided and controlled by the \nproponent and an opponent and shall not be subject to amendment. No pro \nforma amendment shall be in order except that the chair and ranking \nminority member of the Committee on Appropriations or their respective \ndesignees may offer up to 10 pro forma amendments each at any point for \nthe purpose of debate. The chair of the Committee of the Whole may \naccord priority in recognition on the basis of whether the Member \noffering an amendment has caused it to be printed in the portion of the \nCongressional Record designated for that purpose. Amendments so printed \nshall be considered read.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 2577\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the \n     following sums are appropriated, out of any money in the \n     Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the Departments of \n     Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development, and \n     related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     2016, and for other purposes, namely:\n\n                                TITLE I\n\n                      DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION\n\n                        Office of the Secretary\n\n                         salaries and expenses\n\n       For necessary expenses of the Office of the Secretary, \n     $105,000,000, of which not to exceed $2,734,000 shall be \n     available for the immediate Office of the Secretary; not to \n     exceed $1,025,000 shall be available for the immediate Office \n     of the Deputy Secretary; not to exceed $20,066,000 shall be \n     available for the Office of the General Counsel; not to \n     exceed $9,310,000 shall be available for the Office of the \n     Under Secretary of Transportation for Policy; not to exceed \n     $12,808,000 shall be available for the Office of the \n     Assistant Secretary for Budget and Programs; not to exceed \n     $2,500,000 shall be available for the Office of the Assistant \n     Secretary for Governmental Affairs; not to exceed $26,029,000 \n     shall be available for the Office of the Assistant Secretary \n     for Administration; not to exceed $2,029,000 shall be \n     available for the Office of Public Affairs; not to exceed \n     $1,769,000 shall be available for the Office of the Executive \n     Secretariat; not to exceed $10,793,000 shall be available for \n     the Office of Intelligence, Security, and Emergency Response; \n     and not to exceed $15,937,000 shall be available for the \n     Office of the Chief Information Officer: Provided, That the \n     Secretary of Transportation is authorized to transfer funds \n     appropriated for any office of the Office of the Secretary to \n     any other office of the Office of the Secretary: Provided \n     further, That no appropriation for any office shall be \n     increased or decreased by more than 5 percent by all such \n     transfers: Provided further, That notice of any change in \n     funding greater than 5 percent shall be submitted for \n     approval to the House and Senate Committees on \n     Appropriations: Provided further, That not to exceed $60,000 \n     shall be for allocation within the Department for official \n     reception and representation expenses as the Secretary may \n     determine: Provided further, That notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, excluding fees authorized in Public Law \n     107-71, there may be credited to this appropriation up to \n     $2,500,000 in funds received in user fees: Provided further, \n     That none of the funds provided in this Act shall be \n     available for the position of Assistant Secretary for Public \n     Affairs.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Dent\n\n  Mr. DENT. I have an amendment at the desk I would like to offer.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 2, line 13, after the first dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $3,000,000)''.\n       Page 2, line 16, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $2,000,000)''.\n       Page 2, line 18, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $1,000,000)''.\n       Page 47, line 11, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $9,000,000)''.\n       Page 50, line 25, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $3,000,000)''.\n       Page 56, line 14, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $3,000,000)''.\n\n  Mr. DENT (during the reading). Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent \nto dispense with the reading of the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from \nPennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman from \nPennsylvania and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer this amendment to increase \nAmtrak's capital account by $9 million, which is the amount that we are \ntold it will cost to equip all of Amtrak trains with inward-facing \ncameras in their engine cars.\n\n[[Page H3831]]\n\n  It has been over 3 weeks since Amtrak Northeast Regional number 188 \nderailed just north of Philadelphia, killing at least eight people and \ninjuring over 200. We still do not know exactly what caused this tragic \naccident, but had the train been equipped with an inward-facing camera, \nwe very well might.\n  This is a simple and relatively inexpensive reform that the National \nTransportation Safety Board has been advocating for years, and it is \npast time that we act. Like the infamous black boxes on airplanes, \ninward-facing cameras on trains would provide inspectors with critical \ninformation after an accident.\n  Northeast Regional 188 was traveling over twice the posted speed \nlimit on the stretch of track where it derailed. I should also let you \nknow, I rode on that same regional train that morning, from Wilmington, \nDelaware, down to Washington, so I know this particular line, the \nNortheast corridor. I travel it regularly, so I am very much personally \ninterested, as are so many of my constituents and friends in the \nnortheastern part of the United States.\n  Had an inward-facing camera been installed on that train, we might \nnow know whether that was due to some mechanical failure, negligence on \nthe engineer's part, or perhaps some medical incident beyond his \ncontrol. With that information in hand, we would be that much closer to \ntaking the appropriate steps to ensure that this never happens again.\n  Our thoughts and prayers remain with the victims of this tragedy and \ntheir loved ones, and we owe it to them to do everything we can to \nprevent future incidents like the one we saw in Philadelphia. The \ninstallation of inward-facing cameras in all Amtrak trains is an \nimportant step in that direction.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Diaz-Balart and his staff for their \nsupport and for working with me to identify an acceptable offset, \nespecially given the extremely tight constraints under which this bill \nwas drafted. I urge a ``yes'' vote on this amendment.\n  I also would like to say, I know that the offsets are of some concern \nto some of the Members. We are going to do our best to try to work with \nthem on that matter.\n  At this time, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in \nopposition so as to raise objections about the offsets proposed in this \namendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, my friend Mr. Dent has \nproposed an increase in an appropriation for a worthy purpose, to \ninstall inward-facing cameras on Amtrak locomotives, but his amendment \noffers another example of why the overall allocation in this T-HUD bill \nis completely inadequate.\n  The offsets may represent relatively small reductions in DOT's \nadministrative accounts, each of these accounts: the DOT Secretary's \nsalaries and expenses, the Federal Transit Administration's \nadministrative expenses account, the Saint Lawrence Seaway. All of \nthese would be cut below last year's level.\n  At this point, I yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from \nOhio (Ms. Kaptur), my colleague from the full committee.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment, respectfully, \nand I implore the majority to take a close look at where they have \nobtained the money for this important Amtrak investment. Amtrak is \nimportant to Ohio, to the Pennsylvania-Ohio corridor, and there would \nbe nothing I would do to hurt Amtrak. I have been one of Amtrak's \ngreatest advocates.\n  Of the $9 million to fix this problem for Amtrak, you don't take the \nmajority of it, $3 million, from the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development \nAdministration, the Great Lakes-Saint Lawrence Seaway Development \nCorporation. In effect, what they have done is they have taken $3 \nmillion of the $9 million they need for Amtrak out of the Saint \nLawrence Seaway Development Corporation, which is, in effect, a 10 \npercent cut to the smallest entity inside of the Department of \nTransportation.\n  Why is the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation important? \nFirst of all, the current funding level is the smallest budget within \nthe Department of Transportation. Our amendment inside the full \nCommittee on Appropriations allowed that budget not to be cut any \nfurther.\n  The seaway is the only binational instrumentality between Canada and \nthe United States. It connects an entire region of the country from \nDuluth to Massena, New York, to global markets. They have threatened \nproblems within the seaway, such as locks collapsing and inadequate \nareas for our ships to pass through. Sailing on the Great Lakes can be \nvery, very dangerous, as many of our sailors know.\n  That corridor is the shortest distance between Europe and the United \nStates, and last year, the seaway had an 8 percent increase in its \nshipping growth. It serves a part of America that has been battered \neconomically. Manufacturing has been fighting its way back. This really \nisn't the time to tamper with the seaway's budget.\n  I understand the problems of Amtrak, and I know that it needs \nfunding, but I am just asking the majority to please look at the budget \nyou have offered. Your offsets in the case of the Saint Lawrence Seaway \nDevelopment Corporation are truly unacceptable, and in doing so, the \nseaway will be harmed. It will harm ports like Erie, Pennsylvania; \nMassena, New York; Duluth, Minnesota; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Gary, \nIndiana; Toledo, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan. The list is a very, very long \nlist.\n  We have an aging infrastructure in the Great Lakes as well. We don't \nhave the power of the Intracoastal. We wish we did. But I have to raise \nmy voice in strong objection to the offset related to the Saint \nLawrence Seaway Development Corporation.\n  I respect very much the gentleman from Pennsylvania. I know what you \nare trying to do for Amtrak. I want to help you in that effort, but not \nat the expense of the seaway.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  I am hoping that the respective staffs can work together as this bill \nmoves forward to find a more reasonable offset. I have many more ideas \nabout that, but the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation \nshould be allowed to remain functional and not be harmed by a 10 \npercent cut.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I certainly appreciate the comments of the \ngentlewoman from Ohio, and I understand the difficult choices here. I \ndo intend to work with her and any other concerned Members about these \noffsets and maybe find a way to alter them at some point, but I just \ndidn't have time to do it tonight.\n  Again, I believe this is a reasonable amendment and it will do what \nwe need to at least help with respect to the inward-facing cameras on \nAmtrak trains.\n  At this time I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. \nLance), my friend, who is a frequent Amtrak rider himself.\n  Mr. LANCE. Mr. Chairman, 3 weeks ago, the tragic Amtrak accident in \nnorth Philadelphia led to deaths, injuries, and destruction. Those who \nwere injured included two of my constituents with whom I had been \nmeeting with earlier in the day here in Washington.\n  While the circumstances surrounding the incident remain under \ninvestigation, we do know that certain measures can be taken to ensure \nsafety and preparedness, and changes can be implemented moving forward \nfor public safety.\n  Inward-facing cameras are an appropriate step in modernizing train \ntransportation safety. The National Transportation Safety Board has \nbeen advocating for this simple and relatively inexpensive reform for \nyears.\n  I urge support of Mr. Dent's amendment to bring this reform to \nfruition.\n  Mr. DENT. Again, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment that \nwould provide $9 million for inward-facing cameras on Amtrak trains. \nThis is absolutely essential, I believe, to helping us hopefully \nprevent and--certainly, after the fact--determine the causes of these \ntypes of tragedies when they occur.\n  I wish we weren't at this point, but we need to do this. It is \nimportant.\n\n[[Page H3832]]\n\nAmtrak wants to move in this direction. The National Transportation \nSafety Board has urged this for some time. And it is now time that \nCongress act.\n  So, again, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the amendment, and I yield back \nthe balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen). The question is on the amendment \noffered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Dent).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mrs. Bustos\n\n  Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 2, line 13, after the first dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $500,000)''.\n       Page 2, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $500,000)''.\n       Page 60, line 16, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $500,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentlewoman \nfrom Illinois and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Illinois.\n  Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Chairman, I would like to thank Chairman Diaz-\nBalart and Ranking Member Price for their hard work on this \nlegislation.\n  I rise today to urge my colleagues to join with me in improving rail \nand pipeline safety by supporting my amendment to increase funding by \n$500,000 to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. \nThis important agency's mission is to protect our communities from the \nrisks of hazardous materials transportation, including moving crude oil \nby rail and pipeline.\n  Until just a few years ago, our Nation's railroads transported very \nlittle crude oil. Now, in part due to the boom in oil production from \nthe Bakken formation in North Dakota and in other areas, approximately \n1.1 billion barrels are transported by rail in the United States every \nsingle day.\n  The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration conducted \ntests on Bakken crude and found it to have a higher degree of \nvolatility than most other U.S. crudes.\n  Last year, railroads carried almost 650,000 carloads of oil, compared \nto only 9,500 carloads in 2008. This impact is especially felt in \nIllinois, my home State, where we have the second-most number of miles \nof rail track in the entire country. In fact, about 25 percent of all \nU.S. rail traffic passes through Chicago, Illinois.\n  Improving rail safety is extremely important to our region, our \nState, and to our entire country. This issue is especially personal to \nme and the people I serve in my congressional district. That is because \nin March, earlier this year, a train carrying crude oil derailed near \nGalena, Illinois. It is in the northwest corner of my State and is one \nof the most beautiful regions of not only my congressional district but \nthe entire State of Illinois--and I think in the entire country.\n  While we were lucky that no one was harmed, several tanker cars \nexploded and the Bakken crude spilled just a few feet from a slough \nthat flows straight into the Mississippi River, which is the drinking \nwater supply for millions of people.\n  Because of the bravery and the dedication of first responders and \nlocal, State, and Federal cleanup crews, no water was contaminated. We \nwere also lucky that the derailment took place in a largely rural and \nuninhabited area. Imagine what would have happened if a derailment like \nthis were to occur in Chicago, Los Angeles, or New York, or any more \npopulated area.\n  In light of several other high-profile train derailments, including \nthose in West Virginia and North Dakota, involving cars carrying crude \noil, communities across the country are becoming increasingly concerned \nabout the safe movement of crude oil--and with very good reason.\n  While I am encouraged that Federal agencies and industry leaders are \nworking together to make transportation of hazardous material safer, \nCongress must also do its job and step up and provide adequate \nresources to keep our energy transport system safe and secure.\n  That is why I ask today for your support for my effort to ensure this \nappropriations bill includes additional funding for the agency that \nhelps ensure the safe transportation of energy products, including the \nshipment of crude oil by pipeline and rail.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Madam Chairman, I want to thank my good friend and \ncolleague from Florida for his indulgence and working with me on this \namendment.\n  We have benefited here across the United States in recent times with \na boom in energy and moving towards energy self-sufficiency. Much of \nthis has been due to the ability to take advantage of our natural \nresources, including crude oil, which is increasingly being developed \nfrom the Western parts of our country. In fact, more than 33 million \nbarrels of crude oil are shipped by rail each month in the United \nStates, and that is a fifty-fold increase from more than 5 years ago.\n  Shipments from the Bakken region have brightened the future of oil \nworkers and refineries in my own Seventh District of Pennsylvania, and \nindeed the entire Philadelphia area, and in fact they have created \nenergy opportunities throughout our Nation.\n  But now, despite the fact that nearly all of the shipments reach \ntheir destinations safely, accidents, sadly, are on the rise. Recent \nincidents in Ontario, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania call to mind the \nneed for improved safety measures.\n  Madam Chairman, my amendment seeks to transfer funding from the \nOffice of the Secretary salaries and expense account and puts $3.5 \nmillion into the Federal Railroad Administration to fund additional \ncars to inspect the more than 14,000 miles of crude oil rail routes \nnationwide.\n  This funding would also expedite the use of remote automated track \ninspection capability, which will increase inspection mileage while \nreducing costs.\n  For more than 30 years, the FRA's automated track inspection program, \ncalled ATIP, has provided accurate track geometry and performance data \nto assess compliance with the Federal Track Safety Standards.\n  Collected data is used by the FRA, railroad inspectors, and railroads \nto ensure that track safety is being maintained. Immediately following \nATIP track surveys, the railroads use the data to help locate and \ncorrect problems. Often railroads use the ATIP data as a quality \nassurance check on their own track inspection and maintenance programs.\n  Madam Chairman, America's energy boom has brightened communities \nacross the country, and as crude oil by rail grows, I want to help \nprotect those communities. My amendment would enable the FRA to \nincrease its ATIP capability to meet this challenge.\n  Madam Chairman, I thank the chairman and Ranking Member Price for \ntheir willingness to work with me on this issue. I urge the amendment's \nadoption, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meehan).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Burgess\n\n  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 2, line 13, after the first dollar amount, insert \n     ``($4,000,000)''.\n       Page 2, line 18, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $500,000)''.\n       Page 2, line 20, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $1,000,000)''.\n\n[[Page H3833]]\n\n       Page 2, line 22, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $250,000)''.\n       Page 2, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $2,000,000)''.\n       Page 3, line 2, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $250,000)''.\n       Page 40, line 12, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $4,000,000)''.\n\n  Mr. BURGESS (during the reading). Madam Chair, I ask unanimous \nconsent the amendment be considered read.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Chairman, this is an amendment to add an \nadditional $4 million to the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration's operations and research.\n  Madam Chair, at the beginning of this Congress, I took the gavel of \nthe Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing, and \nTrade. This was the gavel previously held by our good friend, Chairman \nLee Terry.\n  There was some unfinished business as this Congress started, and one \nof the biggest issues left over from the previous Congress was the \nissue of airbag energetic deployments and ruptures, and the subsequent \nrecall of those airbags.\n  There was a hearing done in December right at the end of the last \nCongress, and it seemed like there was no activity from the National \nHighway Traffic Safety Administration. But just 2 weeks ago, they \nannounced a recall of 34 million vehicles. The recall massively \nexpanded. And the manufacturer of the airbags, Takata, finally admitted \nthat six of their manufacturing designs were indeed defective. Takata \nhas identified 11 auto manufacturers that use the defective air bag \ninflators.\n  Again, 34 million vehicles have been subject to this recall. And this \nmay not be the end.\n  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and Takata have \nnot identified what is the cause of these energetic disruptions of the \nair bag inflators.\n  Yesterday, the Commerce, Manufacturing, and Trade Subcommittee held a \nhearing to receive an update on the situation. Among the witnesses was \nthe Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration, Dr. Mark Rosekind. Dr. Rosekind took over the \nAdministration just weeks after the subcommittee's Takata hearing in \nDecember.\n  During yesterday's hearing, one of the themes we heard repeatedly \nfrom Administrator Rosekind was that NHTSA would have been better able \nto identify and mandate recalls had they had more resources. It is a \nrefrain we are used to hearing here in Congress. His argument was that \nwith more money, the agency could save more lives. I will take him at \nhis word on that.\n  For fiscal year 2016, Congress is proposing funding the National \nHighway Traffic Safety Administration operations and research, the \naccount responsible for the policing of the safety of auto \nmanufacturers' products, at $150 million. This indeed is an increase of \n$20 million from fiscal year 2015, and for that I am extremely \ngrateful.\n  In the interest of good faith, however, from the new chairman of the \nsubcommittee to the new Administrator of NHTSA, I want to take one more \nstep and offer an additional $4 million to this account to provide \nNHTSA with the resources it needs to ensure that more lives are not \ndisrupted by these defects.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  It is my hope that NHTSA can use this additional funding to find a \npermanent solution to the problem.\n  The Commerce, Manufacturing, and Trade Subcommittee is closely \nwatching and awaiting the release of a report by NHTSA's inspector \ngeneral on their Office of Defects Investigation. We hope it will be \nreleased soon.\n  The offset comes from the Department of Transportation Office of the \nSecretary for salaries and expenses. This seems like an extremely \nworthwhile investment, and I urge the subcommittee's adoption of my \namendment.\n  Again, I want to thank the subcommittee for hearing my amendment. I \ncertainly want to congratulate the chairman and ranking member of the \nsubcommittee. I think they have done good work on this. I urge adoption \nof the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Madam Chair, I have an amendment at \nthe desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 4, line 18, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $1,150,000,000)''.\n\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Chair, I reserve a point of order on the \ngentlewoman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n\n[[Page H3834]]\n\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentlewoman from California and \na Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Madam Chair, I rise to offer an \namendment to invest in transportation infrastructure for the 21st \ncentury.\n  The transportation funding in this bill is woefully insufficient to \nmeet our country's infrastructure needs. The cuts to the TIGER program \nare particularly egregious.\n  TIGER, formally known as Transportation Investment Generating \nEconomic Recovery, is a competitive grant program that creates jobs by \nfunding investments in transportation infrastructure. This bill cuts \nTIGER from the 2015 level of $500 million down to a mere $100 million \nin 2016.\n  America needs new infrastructure for the 21st century. The American \nSociety of Civil Engineers gave the public infrastructure of the United \nStates a grade of D-plus in 2013 and estimated that we will need to \ninvest $3.6 trillion by 2020 in order to improve the conditions of our \ninfrastructure.\n  Indeed, TIGER needs to be expanded, not cut. The President requested \n$1.25 billion for TIGER in the coming fiscal year, as part of an \nexpanded TIGER program that will create jobs, encourage innovation, and \nmodernize transportation infrastructure for the 21st century.\n  Earlier this year, I sent a letter to the Appropriations Committee \nurging support for the President's request, and 144 Members of Congress \nsigned my letter.\n  Our economy is still struggling to recover from the recession. \nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, our Nation's unemployment \nrate stands at 5.4 percent. Furthermore, unemployment among Hispanics \nis 6.9 percent. Among African Americans, it is 9.6 percent, and among \nteenagers, it is 17.1 percent.\n  An expanded TIGER program will create meaningful employment building \nsafe roads, bridges, and public transit systems in communities \nthroughout the United States.\n  My amendment increases TIGER funding to $1.25 billion in order to \nfully fund the President's request for this critical program.\n  Madam Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman \nfrom North Carolina (Mr. Price).\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Chairman, I want to commend my \ncolleague, who does such distinguished work in housing and financial \nservices on her committee, for coming in to this debate today and \ncalling attention to the importance of the TIGER program, and I would \njust like to ask her to respond.\n  I am looking at the figures for this year. There is a $500 million \nappropriation for that program in the current year. Is the gentlewoman \naware that the Department of Transportation has already received 950 \npreapplications, totaling $14.5 billion? That is 29 times the amount \navailable.\n  What does that suggest about the need for this program?\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Well, you have accurately and \nappropriately identified the need for the program, based on those \napplications. Not only is it a very popular program, it is a program \nthat creates jobs, and our local communities need this very much, and \nthey are strong advocates for it.\n  I would hope that my colleagues here in the Congress, on both sides \nof the aisle, who have benefitted from the TIGER program, would see the \nneed and remove all obstacles, support this program, and let us move \nforward with getting the infrastructure repairs and the building that \nwe need to do.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. I thank my colleague for offering this \namendment. It calls attention to the gross underfunding in this bill, \nnot just of TIGER, but of virtually every HUD and transportation \nprogram so that it is very hard, of course, to find offsets. There is \nvery little money in this bill.\n  We should be breaking out of that mold. We should be going after a \nbudget agreement that will let us write a decent bill and meet this \ncountry's needs. Her amendment, better than anything we have heard thus \nfar tonight, underscores that need.\n  I thank the gentlewoman.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I thank the gentleman from North \nCarolina, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Chair, the amendment proposes a net increase \nin budget authority in the bill.\n  The amendment is not in order under section 3(d)3 of House Resolution \n5 of the 114th Congress, which states the following:\n  ``It shall not be in order to consider an amendment to a general \nappropriations bill proposing a net increase in budget authority in the \nbill unless considered en bloc with another amendment or amendments \nproposing an equal or greater decrease in such budget authority \npursuant to clause 2(f) of rule XXI.''\n  The amendment does propose a net increase in budget authority in the \nbill in violation of such section.\n  I ask for a ruling from the Chair.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point \nof order? If not, the Chair is prepared to rule.\n  The gentleman from Florida makes a point of order that the amendment \noffered by the gentlewoman from California violates section 3(d)3 of \nHouse Resolution 5.\n  Section 3(d)3 establishes a point of order against an amendment \nproposing a net increase in budget authority in the pending bill.\n  As persuasively asserted by the gentleman from Florida, the amendment \nproposes a net increase in budget authority in the bill. Therefore, the \npoint of order is sustained. The amendment is not in order.\n\n\n          Amendment Offered by Ms. Maxine Waters of California\n\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at \nthe desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Madam Chair, I reserve a point of order on the \ngentlewoman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentlewoman from California and \na Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Madam Chair, I rise to offer an \namendment to restore some of the transportation funding that was cut \ndrastically in this bill.\n  This is my second of two amendments to increase funds for the \ninnovative TIGER transportation grant program. This amendment increases \nfiscal year 2016 TIGER funding to $500 million, thereby restoring TIGER \nto the 2015 level.\n  States, local governments, and transit agencies depend upon the TIGER \nprogram to finance projects to repair aging infrastructure and develop \nnew highway and transit systems. A safe, efficient, modern, and \naccessible transportation system is vital for a growing economy.\n  Madam Chair, we cannot afford to cut TIGER below the current funding \nlevel, and I am here this evening to urge my colleagues to vote for my \namendment and invest in infrastructure for the 21st century.\n  I recognize that a point of order has been raised on this issue, but \nI also recognize that what I am advocating is vital for this economy \nand for this country. I would hope that somehow we would be wise \nenough, creative enough, and caring enough to dispense with the rule, \nas it has been identified on my first amendment, and move forward in a \nvery creative way to do what is necessary to help our failing \ninfrastructure in this country.\n  The stories about the failing bridges, the stories about the unsafe \nhighways, the stories about the need for transit system improvements \nare stories that we hear, day in and day out.\n  Given the information that has been made available to us about the \nneeds for infrastructure repairs, I would hope that we would not simply \ntreat this in such an ordinary fashion and apply the rule that \nbasically says: Well, if I did not find the money to fund it, then \nsomehow it cannot be in order.\n  Certainly, this amount of money is not easy to locate; certainly, I \ndo not\n\n[[Page H3835]]\n\nhave an answer to where this money would necessarily come from, but I \nwould hope that my colleagues would take into consideration again the \ndesperate need of our economy and our communities and not rule this out \nof order.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Chair, this amendment proposes a net increase \nin budget authority in the bill.\n  The amendment is not in order under section 3(d)3 of House Resolution \n5 of the 114th Congress which states the following:\n  ``It shall not be in order to consider an amendment to a general \nappropriations bill proposing a net increase in budget authority in the \nbill unless considered en bloc with another amendment or amendments \nproposing an equal or greater decrease in such budget authority \npursuant to clause 2(f) of rule XXI.''\n  The amendment proposes a net increase in budget authority in the bill \nin violation of such section.\n  I ask for a ruling from the Chair.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point \nof order? If not, the Chair is prepared to rule.\n  The gentleman from Florida makes a point of order that the amendment \noffered by the gentlewoman from California violates section 3(d)3 of \nHouse Resolution 5.\n  For the reasons stated in the previous ruling, and as persuasively \nasserted by the gentleman from Florida, the amendment proposes a net \nincrease in budget authority in the bill. Therefore, the point of order \nis sustained. The amendment is not in order.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Dold\n\n  Mr. DOLD. Madam Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 6, line 9, strike ``and the Secretary'' and all that \n     follows through ``percent'' on line 10.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Illinois and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois.\n  Mr. DOLD. Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of this amendment \nto change a provision in the bill relating to TIGER grants.\n  Put simply, this amendment would put all transportation projects on \nan even playing field and allow all qualified projects to fairly \ncompete for these grants, regardless of whether they take place in an \nurban area or a rural area.\n\n                              {time}  2030\n\n  Madam Chair, my district is heavily reliant on all forms of \ntransportation. The Chicagoland area is the hub for the Nation's \ntransportation network. Over 925 million tons of freight move in and \nout of Chicago each and every year, and each workday, tens of thousands \nof citizens of the 10th Congressional District use commuter rail.\n  The Chicago Regional Transportation Authority estimates that it needs \nto find $13.4 billion over the next decade just to maintain the system \nin its current condition. That is why it is more important than ever to \nfind the funds to pay to maintain and rebuild our Nation's \ntransportation system.\n  In the Transportation Appropriations funding bill, there is a \nprovision which discriminates against urban districts, like Illinois' \n10th Congressional District. TIGER grants, which are competitive grants \nto fund capital investments in surface transportation projects, can be \nawarded to projects across the entire Nation.\n  However, the bill also provides that projects in urban areas receive \na Federal match of 50 percent of the project funding, while projects in \nrural areas can receive up to 80 percent of the project's funding.\n  Madam Chair, this is unfair and unjust. The TIGER grants are \ncompetitive, discretionary grants that should be awarded to the most \ndeserving projects. The bill's language allows rural areas to leverage \nlocal dollars at a 4 to 1 ratio, allowing them to put up just $2 out of \nevery $10 needed for a project. Urban areas may only leverage at a 1 to \n1 ratio.\n  This language harms urban areas and makes it more difficult to secure \nthe funding needed to complete these projects. My amendment is a \ncommonsense and just solution to this problem and would place all \nprojects, no matter where they occur, on an even playing field.\n  Madam Chair, it is time to bring equity back to transportation \nfunding, and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and put all \nqualified projects on an even playing field.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Chair, I respectfully oppose the gentleman's \nwell-intentioned amendment.\n  TIGER is a national program, and we support cities of all sizes \nhaving a chance to get a grant, and we work to ensure there is a \nbalance between urban and rural areas. I am afraid that the well-\nintentioned amendment from the gentleman seeks to undo that delicate \nbalance at this time.\n  Madam Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman \nfrom North Carolina (Mr. Price).\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  I, too, want to reluctantly express my opposition to this amendment.\n  Madam Chair, I take second place to no one in this body as the \nchampion of the TIGER program, as I hope was evident in my support for \nthe gentlewoman from California's (Ms. Maxine Waters) amendments just \nnow; but we are underscoring in this amendment, while it is worthy in \nits intent--and I would love to be able to add a lot more money than \nthis to the TIGER program--its offset is very worrisome and one that I \nthink should lead us to oppose this amendment.\n  It comes out of the Federal Aviation Administration's operations \naccount, $100 million out of that account.\n  Now, the bill provides a slight increase for FAA operations, but it \nis still $67 million below the President's request. This is the account \nthat provides the funds needed to ensure aviation safety and security, \nso cutting this account is ill advised.\n  Mr. DOLD. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. I yield to the gentleman from Illinois.\n  Mr. DOLD. I think the gentleman is talking about a different \namendment. My amendment doesn't take anything out of any account. This \nis talking about simply changing the percentages between urban and \nrural to allow competitive grants so that it competes at a level \nplaying field.\n  I just respectfully think you have got a different amendment, which I \nappreciate, but it is not the one that I think that we are talking \nabout right now.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. The gentleman does have an amendment \nthat fits my description; is that true?\n  Mr. DOLD. Yes, but we have withdrawn that one, but I do appreciate \nthe gentleman talking about that one.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. I thank the gentleman for that \nclarification. My remarks will await the proper amendment.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DOLD. Madam Chair, as we talk about transportation and \ninfrastructure, it is so critically important, critically important for \nour economy, critically important certainly for our urban areas, and if \nyou look at a map of the city of Chicago in the center of our country, \nwe have got six of seven major rail lines that go through there.\n  It used to be that a third of all the freight in the country would go \nthrough Chicago. Now, it is about a quarter, but it is still a \ntremendous amount, and it really impacts the Nation's economy.\n  We can get a railcar from Los Angeles to Chicago in 2 days. It takes \nnearly 2 days to go from one side of Chicago to the other side of \nChicago. This does have an impact.\n  The same rail that we are talking about here also has commuter rails \non it, and we are dealing with infrastructure that goes back to the \nRoosevelt administration. I don't mean FDR; I mean Teddy Roosevelt. We \nneed to make sure that there is some additional funding going here.\n  This amendment that we are talking about is not talking about moving \ndollars around. It is talking about trying to provide equity so that \nurban\n\n[[Page H3836]]\n\nprojects, which I would argue we desperately need, are on the same \nlevel as the rural projects.\n  If we were to lose mass transit or some of these other projects in \nthe city of Chicago, we are talking about a 50 percent increase in \ncongestion on our roadways.\n  This is an amendment that I hope that my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle would embrace--at least let's talk about a level playing \nfield, where we are not giving preference to the rural areas versus the \nurban areas, urban areas which I would argue use the rail a pretty \nsignificant amount in terms of how we are moving people around, not to \nmention our goods and services.\n  This is an amendment that I think is a commonsense amendment, and I \nwould hope that I would get some support from my good friend from \nFlorida and maybe we could get him to even reconsider, but I hope I am \nnot tilting at windmills on that one, Madam Chair.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 9, line 19, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     to $0)''.\n       Page 156, line 15, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $155,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Madam Chair, this amendment eliminates the $155 \nmillion of discretionary spending that is wasted on one of the least \nessential programs in the entire United States Government, the so-\ncalled Essential Air Service. That is the program that subsidizes empty \nand near-empty planes to fly from small airports to regional hubs just \na few hours or less away by car.\n  This was supposed to be a temporary program to allow local \ncommunities and airports to readjust to airline deregulation in 1978. \nNot only is it still going on today, but it has doubled in cost in the \nlast 4 years, from $130 million in 2011 to roughly $260 million in \n2015, and $155 million of that is in our control. This amendment zeros \nit out and puts it toward deficit reduction.\n  Now, we are often told: Well, don't worry. We have enacted all of \nthese reforms. We have caps on subsidies.\n  All those caps, $200 per ticket, are only for flights under 210 \nmiles. It continues unlimited subsidies over that distance. Actual \nsubsidies per passenger can be as high as $980 per ticket, paid by \nhard-working taxpayers. Year after year, we are promised reform; and \nyear after year, the cost goes up and up.\n  By the way, Essential Air Service flights are flown out of Merced and \nVisalia airports, serving my district in the Sierra. Trust me, a tiny \nnumber of people actually use it. The alternative is hardly \ncatastrophic; it is typically an extra hour's drive to a regional \nairport. I guarantee you that everybody who hears about this waste of \ntheir money is outraged by it.\n  It is true there are a few tiny communities in Alaska, like Kake's \n700 citizens, that have no highway connections to hub airports, but \nthey have plenty of alternatives. In the case of Kake, they enjoy year-\nround ferry service to Juneau. In addition, Alaska is well served by a \nthriving general aviation market and the ubiquitous bush pilot.\n  Rural life has great advantages. It also has some disadvantages, but \nit is not the job of hard-working taxpayers who choose to live \nelsewhere to level out the differences.\n  Now, apologists for this wasteful spending tell us it is an important \neconomic driver for these small airports and airlines, and I am sure \nthat is so. Whenever you give away money, the folks you are giving it \nto are always better off, but the folks you are taking it from are \nalways worse off to exactly the same extent. Indeed, it's economic \ndrivers like this that have driven Europe's economy right off a cliff.\n  Two years ago, one Member rushed to the microphone to suggest that \nthis was essential for emergency medical evacuations. It has nothing to \ndo with that. This program subsidizes regularly scheduled commercial \nservice that practically nobody uses. If it actually had a passenger \nbase, it wouldn't need, in effect, to hand out $100 bills to the few \npassengers who use it.\n  An airline so reckless with its funds would quickly bankrupt itself. \nWell,\n\n[[Page H3837]]\n\nthe same principle holds true of governments.\n  The Washington Post is not known as a bastion of fiscal conservatism, \nbut I cannot improve upon an editorial a few years ago when it said, \n``Ideally, EAS would be zeroed out, and the $200 million we waste on it \ndevoted to a truly national purpose: perhaps deficit reduction, \nmilitary readiness, or the social safety net.''\n  The Washington Post goes on to write, ``Alas, if Congress and the \nWhite House were capable of making such choices, we probably never \nwould have had sequestration in the first place.''\n  Madam Chair, there are many tough calls in setting fiscal priorities, \nbut this isn't one of them. If the House of Representatives--where all \nappropriations begin, where the Republican majority pledged to stop \nwasting money--can't even agree to cut this useless program off from \nthe trough, how does it expect to be taken seriously on the much \ntougher choices that lie ahead?\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Chair, I claim the time in \nopposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Chair, this amendment that the \ngentleman from California has offered is about as indiscriminate as it \ngets. He apparently has ideas, and those ideas ought to be heard to \nreform this program, to make it more efficient and more effective and \nmore targeted. The place to do that is in the authorizing committee. We \nhave forums where we can discuss those ideas and act on them.\n  To come in tonight and offer this indiscriminate amendment which, by \nthe way, not only cuts this overall program by more than half, but also \ncuts the allocation for this bill, which is already so inadequate, it \nis not an approach that this body should endorse.\n\n                              {time}  2045\n\n  The program we are talking about, Essential Air Services, was created \nafter deregulation. It has remained essential to keep service going to \nmany, many small communities in this country, including Crescent City, \nEl Centro, Merced, and Visalia in California. It is funded through \nannual appropriations, and also funded through overflight fees that are \ncollected when foreign air carriers traverse through U.S. airspace. If \nthis amendment were adopted, many small communities would lose air \nservice.\n  Madam Chair, this isn't the way to reform the program, so I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Madam Chair, this is the kindest cut of all. It is a \ntemporary program that was established 37 years ago and has become a \nposter child for wasteful Federal spending, and I believe the \nauthorization ran out years ago. Our national debt has doubled in 8 \nyears. American taxpayers pay $230 billion a year just in interest \ncosts on that debt. That means if you are an average family paying \naverage taxes, $2,000 of those taxes did nothing more than rent the \nmoney that we have already spent.\n  Continuing to pay for this obsolete and wasteful program with money \nwe don't have is obscene and makes a mockery of any claim that we have \ncut spending to the bone, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of \nmy time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. McClintock).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California \nwill be postponed.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                       administrative provisions\n\n       Sec. 101.  None of the funds made available in this Act to \n     the Department of Transportation may be obligated for the \n     Office of the Secretary of Transportation to approve \n     assessments or reimbursable agreements pertaining to funds \n     appropriated to the modal administrations in this Act, except \n     for activities underway on the date of enactment of this Act, \n     unless such assessments or agreements have completed the \n     normal reprogramming process for Congressional notification.\n       Sec. 102.  The Secretary or his designee may engage in \n     activities with States and State legislators to consider \n     proposals related to the reduction of motorcycle fatalities.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Walberg\n\n  Mr. WALBERG. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 11, strike lines 1 through 3.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Michigan and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.\n  Mr. WALBERG. I want to begin by thanking Chairman Diaz-Balart and his \nstaff for their hard work on this legislation before us.\n  Madam Chair, I rise today to offer a commonsense amendment with Mr. \nSensenbrenner and Mr. Ribble of Wisconsin which makes it clear that \nFederal Government agencies should not be in the business--again, I say \nshould not be--in the business of lobbying State and local legislators \nwith Federal taxpayers' money. Federal law already prohibits Federal \nagencies from lobbying Congress in support of or against legislation.\n  Thanks in part to the leadership of Mr. Sensenbrenner in 1998, \nCongress passed similar antilobbying language to prohibit the \nDepartment of Transportation from lobbying State and local elected \nofficials.\n  At that time, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration was \nsending staff to State capitols at taxpayers' expense to lobby in favor \nof motorcycle helmet laws. At the cost of tens of thousands of taxpayer \ndollars, these officials traveled across the country to testify before \nState legislative committees, participate in conferences, and produce \nvideotapes and other printed materials with the goal of advancing \nmandatory motorcycle helmet laws.\n  As the co-chairman of the Congressional Motorcycle Caucus and a rider \nmyself who wears a helmet, I believe the most effective way to reduce \nmotorcycle injuries and fatalities is to prevent these crashes from \noccurring in the first place. Madam Chair, that means putting between \nthe ears as opposed to simply putting on the head.\n  I believe the NHTSA has an appropriate role in promoting vehicle and \nhighway safety, whether that is focusing on efforts on crash prevention \nor rider education. Unfortunately, language pushed by the \nadministration has made it into the recent omnibus legislation to \nreverse the lobby ban, and that provision is carried over into this \nbill.\n  Whether you ride or not, I would hope all my colleagues agree that \nthis is an inappropriate use of taxpayer dollars. It violates the \nrights of States and local communities we represent to make their own \ndecisions on helmet laws.\n  Madam Chair, I ask my colleagues to support this amendment, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Chair, we have an amendment before \nus that would strike a provision that has been carried in every \ntransportation appropriations bill since 2009. The section simply \ngrants the Secretary or his representatives the authority to engage in \nactivities with States and State legislators to consider proposals \nrelated to the reduction of motorcycle fatalities. This consultation is \nentirely voluntary.\n  Madam Chair, in 2013, we had 5,000 motorcycle fatalities in this \ncountry. That is the last year for which we have data.\n  The research and expertise of the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration can be extremely helpful--helpful to State highway \ntraffic safety agencies as they consider measures they might want to \nundertake to improve motorcycle safety. Why wouldn't we want to be in \npartnership with the States as they address this important safety \nissue?\n  Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I \nyield back the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H3838]]\n\n  Mr. WALBERG.

Madam Chair, I would like to start by thanking Chairman \nDiaz-Balart for cooperating with this amendment.\n  Madam Chair, the Federal Aviation Administration is dealing with an \nincreasing threat of cyberattacks against the National Airspace System. \nThis critical threat was recently detailed in a GAO report as well as \nidentified in news reports of a reported attempt to hack into the \nflight control system of a U.S. airliner through the plane's in-flight \nentertainment system.\n  The FAA must protect the safety of our citizens and prevent negative \nimpact to the U.S. economy by developing a comprehensive and \nmultilayered approach to mitigating new and emerging cybersecurity \nthreats.\n  My amendment will transfer $3 million within the FAA to develop an \nintegrated cybersecurity testbed to evaluate and certify all NextGen \nand National Airspace systems. The FAA currently possesses the \ncapability to establish such a testbed at its existing integrated \ntesting environment at the FAA Tech Center in southern New Jersey. The \nTech Center presents a natural host for FAA partnership with industry \nand academia to leverage the best ideas and technology to continually \nmitigate evolving cybersecurity threats.\n  Madam Chair, increasing FAA capability for creating, identifying, \ndefending, and solving cybersecurity-related problems for existing \nNational Airspace System and future NextGen systems is vital to the \nfuture safety and proposals of our American airspace.\n  Once again, Madam Chair, I thank Chairman Mario Diaz-Balart.

Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentlewoman \nfrom Connecticut and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n\n[[Page H3839]]\n\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Connecticut.\n  Ms. ESTY. Madam Chair, I come to the floor once again to urge this \nHouse to invest in rail safety. My amendment adds $3 million to the \nFederal Railroad Administration for safety and operations to fund vital \nrail safety education programs, like Operation Lifesaver.\n  Railroads move the goods that fuel our economy, and thousands of \ncommuters in my district rely on passenger rail lines every day. In \nfact, over 11\\1/2\\ million Americans took the trains along the \nNortheast corridor last year, a record high ridership.\n  Freight rail traffic is also increasing, reflecting a growing economy \nand a booming energy sector. However, as we have seen in the news \nalmost monthly, there have been a disturbing number of rail accidents \nin the last few years, many of them preventable train derailments and \ncollisions. We in this House stood in silence a few weeks ago to mourn \nthe loss of the eight passengers killed in last month's Amtrak \nderailment near Philadelphia. Those deaths were tragic and completely \navoidable. We must do more to promote safe and reliable rail travel.\n  I have worked hard on the Transportation Committee and advocated in \nthis House to implement positive train control and other innovative \ntechnologies that can protect passengers against the most dangerous \nrail accidents. But technologies like positive train control cannot \nprevent all train-related accidents.\n  On February 3, 2015, six people died when a northbound Metro-North \nRailroad commuter train collided with an SUV that was stopped at a \nhighway rail crossing. Aditya Tomar, a resident of Danbury, \nConnecticut, and one of my constituents, was one of those passengers \nkilled.\n\n                              {time}  2100\n\n  According to the Federal Railroad Administration, these sorts of \nhighway-rail grade crossing accidents lead to 270 deaths every year.\n  Just this morning, media outlets were featuring a viral video from an \nAmtrak Silver Star train colliding with a car and slicing it in half \nafter the driver drove around the lowered gate at a rail crossing in \nJacksonville, Florida. Miraculously, every passenger survived with only \nminor injuries.\n  This video demonstrates that even when crossings are equipped with \ngates and warning lights, human error and miscalculation can have \ndevastating consequences.\n  That is why we need to educate drivers, passengers, and pedestrians \non how to avoid accidents along railroad tracks and at highway-rail \ngrade crossings.\n  Technological safety advances are essential, make no mistake, but \nthey are not enough. We must educate people about the dangers of \nwalking along railroads or ignoring rail crossing warning signals.\n  The Operation Lifesaver program is an effective public safety \ncampaign that encourages drivers and pedestrians to ``stop, look, and \nlisten'' at highway-rail grade crossings and increases awareness in all \n50 States.\n  Congress authorized Operation Lifesaver in 2008, but has failed to \nprovide adequate funding.\n  My amendment to increase funding for the Operation Lifesaver rail \nsafety program is also fiscally responsible and does not increase \nspending. Instead, this investment is offset by a very small reduction \nin Federal Government staff offices for the Federal Aviation \nAdministration, an account that will still receive $75 million above \nthe administration's request.\n  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Chair, just moments ago we increased the FRA \nsafety and operations by $3.5 million.\n  This amendment, however, would result in, really, an unsustainable \ncut to FAA's operations account. Air traffic control facilities would \nhave to close and communities would lose service. Frankly, critical \noperational support staff would have to be furloughed or even laid off. \nSafety could be compromised for flights, and flights could be \npotentially canceled.\n  Therefore, I cannot support this well-intentioned offset and, \ntherefore, I cannot support this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. ESTY. Madam Chair, I urge passage of this commonsense amendment, \nand I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. Esty).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. ESTY. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from \nConnecticut will be postponed.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Dold\n\n  Mr. DOLD. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n       Page 12, line 25, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $290,000,000)''.\n       Page 13, line 10, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $81,203,000)''.\n       Page 13, line 7, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $208,797,000)''.\n       Page 47, line 11, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $290,000,000)''.\n\n  Mr. DOLD (during the reading). Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the amendment be considered as read.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Illinois?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Illinois and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois.\n  Mr. DOLD. Madam Chair, I rise today in support of an amendment to \nincrease funding for Amtrak's capital account. The bill as is cuts $290 \nmillion from Amtrak's capital account, which is used to upgrade or \nreplace the infrastructure that Amtrak owns, along with the acquisition \nand maintenance of Amtrak's fleet of locomotives, passenger cars, and \nother equipment.\n  Madam Chair, the Chicago area, which I represent, is the hub of our \nNation's transportation network. Over 30 million people ride Amtrak \nevery year nationwide, and many of those passengers ride through the \ncity of Chicago. However, in the Chicago area, Amtrak trains are \nrunning on infrastructure that has not been updated in decades, \nincluding switches that date back to the administration of Teddy \nRoosevelt.\n  As we have seen in recent months, safety concerns on Amtrak are at a \npremium. Now is not the time to reduce the amount of money that we have \nmade available for Amtrak and for our needed infrastructure upgrades. \nWe need to make investments in our tracks, our trains, our stations, \nand the rest of our transportation system.\n  My amendment would take a step towards addressing that problem. All \nit does is restore capital investment grants to the level at which they \nwere appropriated last year. This is a small step but one that will \nhelp rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and will help improve the \nmass transit systems that so many of our citizens use each and every \nday.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Chair, this amendment would result in a deep \nand, frankly, unsustainable reduction to FAA's operations account. FAA \nwould have to suspend contracts that run the information technology \nsystems that keep our air traffic control flowing.\n  Air traffic control facilities would have to be closed and \ncommunities, frankly, would lose service. Critical operational support \nstaff would be furloughed or, again, laid off. Safety could be \ncompromised. Flights, again, would be canceled.\n  Therefore, I cannot support this offset and, respectfully, cannot \nsupport the gentleman's amendment.\n\n[[Page H3840]]\n\n  At this time, I would like to yield to the gentleman from North \nCarolina.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for \nyielding.\n  I, too, reluctantly oppose this amendment. The discussion we had \nearlier about this offset certainly pertains here. We really cannot \nafford to make this kind of cut--safety-related cut, I might say--to \nthe Federal Aviation Administration's funding.\n  The amendment is worthy in purpose. Again, funding for Amtrak's \ncapital accounts is woefully inadequate in this bill. But this is \nsimply not the way to make it up. In fact, there is no way to make it \nup within the confines of this bill. We are robbing Peter to pay Paul. \nThis is what is wrong with this bill--an inadequate allocation. That \nmeans there is no way to get adequate funding for things we care about \nwithout doing equivalent damage somewhere else. It is an impossible \ndilemma.\n  What we need to do is do the responsible thing: get a budget \nagreement, get numbers we can work with, and write a decent bill. In \nthe meantime, this amendment, while well-intentioned, really is not \nacceptable, and I urge rejection.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DOLD. Madam Chair, as we look at our transportation and \ninfrastructure system, we know that investment is needed.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Illinois (Mr. Dold).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Lynch\n\n  Mr. LYNCH. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 12, line 25, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $25,000,000)''.\n       Page 13, line 10, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $25,000,000)''.\n       Page 44, line 13, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $25,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Massachusetts and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. LYNCH. Madam Chair, what I am trying to do in this amendment is \nto really address a wider problem in my congressional district. My \ndistrict surrounds the Logan International Airport in Boston.\n  What this amendment would do is remove $25 million from the FAA \nbudget and transfer it to rail. The reason for that is because the FAA \nhas steadfastly refused to do part of their job in my district. I have \ntried to get them to come to the town of Milton, Massachusetts, to \naddress the overflights in that area. The new NextGen RNAV system \nconcentrates flight after flight, thousands of flights a month, over \nthe town of Milton, Massachusetts.\n  I requested the FAA to come out and meet with my neighbors--the \npeople that I represent--just like everybody else represents people in \ntheir districts, and the FAA has flatly refused. So since they have \nrefused to do part of the job that we fund them for, I figured I would \ntake $25 million out of their budget because they are not doing their \njob.\n  All I am looking for is a meeting with the FAA in my district, and \nI've got to resort to this. It is shameful. I would say that their \nattitude towards my constituents--the people I work for--has been utter \ncontempt and disrespectful. So here I am trying to cut their budget to \nget their attention. It is a sad statement of the way the FAA operates.\n  But my real issue is getting the FAA to respond to my constituents, \nnot about cutting their budgets. I know the chair and the ranking \nmember have worked wonderfully, and I give you great credit for the \nwork you have done.\n  What I am wondering is, would the chair and the ranking member help \nme just get the FAA to respond by having a meeting in my district in \nthe town of Milton? I would withdraw my amendment and leave the money \nthat you have wisely appropriated where it is. I am just looking to get \nthis agency, this bureaucracy, to respond to the people I represent. It \nis as simple as that, Mr. Chairman.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  I will tell the gentleman that one of the responsibilities that we \nhave is to make sure that we hold government accountable. I don't think \nit is acceptable to not get answers. So I look forward to working with \nthe gentleman to make sure that we move to address those concerns of \nyour community. I don't want to speak for the ranking member, but I \nknow that I look forward to working with you to make sure that we get \nanswers that you need to get.\n  Mr. LYNCH. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. LYNCH. I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Chair, I appreciate the chairman's \nresponse.\n  I, too, will work with you. This isn't acceptable. We will do our \nbest to help you get the kind of response you need.\n  Mr. LYNCH. Madam Chair, I want to thank the chairman, and I want to \nthank the ranking member for the courtesy, not only to me, but to my \nconstituents as well.\n  I yield back the balance of my time, and I ask unanimous consent to \nwithdraw my amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Massachusetts?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  June 3, 2015, on page H3840, the following appeared: There was \nno objection.

DOLD\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Dold\n\n  Mr. DOLD. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 12, line 25, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $200,000,000)''.\n       Page 13, line 7, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $200,000,000)''.\n       Page 52, line 16, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $200,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Illinois and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois.\n  Mr. DOLD. Madam Chair, I rise today in support of an amendment to \nincrease funding for capital investment grants to help our Nation's \nmass transit rail systems. The bill as is cuts $200 million from the \naccount, and my amendment would restore that funding.\n  While I recognize, and as we have heard from the chairman and the \nranking member, there is not really a good spot to be able to take some \nof these additional funds from, I do think it is important though, \nMadam Chair, that we talk about our infrastructure system, especially \nour rail system. And as we look specifically in the greater Chicago \narea, the Chicago Transit Authority's rail system, the El, serves \naround 725,000 riders each and every day, and the Metra, which serves \nthe suburban areas like the 10th District in Illinois, serves over \n300,000 riders each and every day. Over a million people are using \nthese rail systems.\n\n                              {time}  2115\n\n  Again, as we talked about before, Metra estimates that it needs to \nfind roughly $13.4 billion over the next decade just to maintain the \nsystem in its current condition. That is why it is more important than \never before to find the funds to pay to maintain and rebuild our \nNation's transportation infrastructure system.\n  Madam Chair, we hear all the time from our constituents that we need \ngood, high-paying jobs. Frankly, a transportation infrastructure system \nfor manufacturers--how do we get raw material and a finished product \nout? How do we get people around?--is absolutely critical to our \neconomy.\n  I saw an estimate from UPS that read that every additional 5 minutes \nof idling time costs them $100 million. We have switches in the Chicago \narea that delay rail up to 15 minutes one way. That is 30 minutes a \nday; and, if you are a regular commuter, that is 10\\1/2\\ hours in a \ngiven month, 10\\1/2\\ hours that you could be more productive or could \nbe spending time with your family or spending time doing homework with \nyour children.\n\n[[Page H3841]]\n\n  If we as a country want to be more productive, if we want to \nencourage more good, high-paying jobs, we have to find a way to make \nsure that we invest in our transportation infrastructure system.\n  When we use this transportation infrastructure system and if it goes \naway, we are talking about an increase in congestion--at least I can \ntell you in the Chicago area--of an additional 50 percent. In talking \nto the rail, we would need an additional 29 lanes of traffic.\n  What is the cost of that? We just don't have it. If we don't have \nthis type of funding, the car in front of you could have been somebody \nwho was sitting on the rail, who could have been using mass transit.\n  Madam Chair, this bill is a step backward for our Nation's mass \ntransit systems, not a step forward. Instead of providing funds to \nmaintain and improve world-class mass transit systems, we are, instead, \ntaking money away and making it harder and harder for the public to \nfind the funds needed to keep their systems operational, much less to \nimprove them. A reliable and consistent stream of capital funding is \nessential for these systems, but this bill does not meet that need.\n  My amendment would take a step toward addressing that problem. I \nrecognize it is just a step, but I am anxious to work with the chairman \nand the ranking member, and I am anxious to work with those on the \nTransportation and Infrastructure Committee to make sure that we are \ncoming up with outside-the-box thinking in how we can improve our mass \ntransit systems.\n  It is vitally important for our urban areas, and it is certainly \nimportant for the Nation's transportation hub, which, I would argue, is \nin the heartland, in the Chicago area.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Chair, one has to frankly respect and admire \nMr. Dold's knowledge and passion in these amendments that he is doing. \nI am sensitive to that, and I look forward to working with him. I know \nthat he will make sure that we work with him on these issues that he \nbrings up and that he is very passionate about, which I think are very \nimportant.\n  Respectfully, I have to oppose this amendment. This amendment would \nresult in deep reductions to the FAA's operations account and would \nresult in breaches of contract for air traffic control information \ntechnology systems. In addition, it would result in staff layoffs, \nwhich would again compromise safety.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with the gentleman. He brings \nup, obviously, some very important points; but again, respectfully, I \nmust object to this amendment at this time.\n  Madam Chair, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. \nPrice), the ranking member of the subcommittee.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Chair, I appreciate the chairman's \nyielding.\n  I want to echo his opposition to this amendment, and I want to echo \nhis praise for the reality check that the gentleman from Illinois has \nprovided us tonight. At various times in the course of the evening, we \nhave talked about TIGER grants; we have talked about Amtrak; we have \ntalked about transit investments--all of which are underfunded in this \nbill.\n  I am also pleased that the chairman has expressed the willingness to \ncooperate in going forward. I want to echo that on my part, too, \nbecause we do believe a better day will come and, hopefully, not only \nat the end of the fiscal year but soon, where we get a budget \nagreement, where we get better numbers, and where we are able to \naddress each of these accounts that the gentleman has highlighted.\n  He is exactly right about the need in all of these areas. The offset \nis not acceptable. It is even dangerous.\n  For that reason, I oppose the amendment, but the larger message is we \nhave got to get a better budget number, and we have got to revisit many \nof the accounts in this bill.\n  Mr. DOLD. Madam Chair, may I inquire as to how much time I have \nremaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Illinois has 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. DOLD. I certainly want to thank the chairman and the ranking \nmember for their thoughts.\n  Madam Chair, there is no question as we look at the debt that we \nhave--we have an $18 trillion debt in our country--that it is \njeopardizing our children's opportunity for the American Dream. One of \nthe things that I talk about in terms of how we get out of it is by \ntalking about: How do we grow, Madam Chair?\n  We grow, I think, by creating this opportunity and environment so \npeople want to come and put their businesses here, becoming globally \ncompetitive. When entrepreneurs look at where to go to place their \nbusinesses, one of the things they are going to look at is our \ntransportation infrastructure system. We need to know how we are going \nto get our raw materials in and our finished product out if we want to \nbe globally competitive and if we want to manufacture. I would argue \nthat we do.\n  I recognize where the committee is. I also appreciate the chairman's \nand the ranking member's willingness to work with us in going forward, \nbut we have to, each and every one of us, come together and put our \ndifferences aside and invest in our infrastructure system so that we \ncan grow our economy and have greater dollars coming into the Federal \nTreasury so that we can have these resources.\n  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Illinois (Mr. Dold).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n\n\n                  Amendment Offered by Mr. Bridenstine\n\n  Mr. BRIDENSTINE. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 13, line 5, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $250,000)''.\n       Page 13, line 7, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(decreased by $250,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Oklahoma and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. BRIDENSTINE. Madam Chair, the Bridenstine-Rohrabacher-Posey \namendment, which is supported by the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, \ntransfers $250,000 from the FAA's finance and management activities to \nthe Office of Commercial Space Transportation. This is a small amount, \nbut it is extremely important if we are to support the booming \ncommercial spaceflight industry.\n  The FAA Office of Commercial Space Transportation's mission is as \nfollows: ``to ensure protection of the public, property, and the \nnational security and foreign policy interests of the United States \nduring commercial launch or reentry activities and to encourage, \nfacilitate, and promote commercial space transportation.''\n  To carry out this mission, AST, as the office is known, is tasked \nwith overseeing commercially licensed launches, test launches under \nexperimental permits, licenses and permits for new vehicle designs, \nsupporting NASA and the Commercial Crew contractors, taking the lead \nrole in coordinating space traffic at the White House's request, and \nmany other duties.\n  Over the past few years, the number of activities AST oversees has \ngrown significantly; yet funding and staffing levels have remained \nabsolutely flat.\n  Just last month, the House of Representatives passed the SPACE Act on \nan overwhelmingly bipartisan basis. That bill establishes a statutory \nand regulatory regime that provides stability and encourages private \nsector investment in order to facilitate the growth of commercial space \nactivities. If we are passing legislation to encourage growth, we need \nto provide this office with increased resources to keep up.\n  We rely on the commercial space sector for many things: reliable, \nfrequent, and inexpensive launches; communications, navigation, and \nimaging satellites; and services such as the Internet, telephone, \ntelevision, and radio, which are staples of modern life.\n\n[[Page H3842]]\n\n  Going forward, there are companies whose goal is to provide space \ntourism services. There are also ventures planning missions to harvest \nprecious resources from celestial bodies. This is just the tip of the \niceberg for this growth industry.\n  This is an industry that is constantly innovating. It is also an \nindustry we have come to increasingly rely on. If AST does not get the \nadditional resources, it could lead to slips of planned launch dates \nfor some companies as the office is unable to process inspections, \npermits, and licenses in a timely manner. On top of being a hindrance \nto this growth industry, it could also reduce the functionality and \ncapabilities we take for granted in our everyday lives.\n  This funding will give AST additional resources to accomplish its \nmission. As its workload continues to grow, I encourage the Office of \nCommercial Space Transportation to continue to work alongside industry \nin developing and supporting consensus safety standards that can \nstreamline the inspection process.\n  I appreciate Chairman Diaz-Balart's leadership and his recognition of \nthe importance of this office. I thank him for working with me on this \namendment, particularly given the constraints he is under while \ncrafting this appropriations bill.\n  I understand we are in tough fiscal times; however, we need to ensure \nwe do not strangle the unlimited potential of the commercial \nspaceflight industry. An important piece of this is ensuring that the \nOffice of Commercial Space Transportation can keep up with the growth \nof this burgeoning industry.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and the underlying \nlegislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Bridenstine).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Madam Chair, I rise to offer an amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Strike section 134.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Chair, tonight I urge the adoption of my \namendment, which would allow the Federal Motor Carrier Safety \nAdministration to continue its congressionally mandated ongoing work to \nimprove\n\n[[Page H3845]]\n\nsafety and accountability in the trucking and bus industry. I do so out \nof a concern that we need to exhibit common sense in what we do. We \nneed to be fiscally prudent, we need to promote safe highways in our \nNation, and we need to recognize the importance of promoting personal \nresponsibility and accountability.\n  My amendment would strike a section of this bill that would halt the \nFMCSA's work toward issuing a rule that would make our highways safer \nfor everyone by creating an incentive for motor carriers to make safety \na greater priority. We have to allow the FMCSA to proceed with the \ndevelopment of a rule to increase insurance minimums for motor \ncarriers, which have not been updated in, fully, 35 years in this \nNation and, thus, have become outdated to the point of uselessness.\n  The first point I make is that it is simply common sense that we \nadjust for inflation. Not adjusting for inflation for 35 years is not \nprudent, and it makes no sense. It allows carriers to travel on our \nNation's highways in a financially irresponsible manner, in a manner \nthat would allow them not to be accountable for whatever harm they \nmight cause.\n  Adjusting for inflation is common sense. It is also fiscally prudent, \nbecause what happens? Right now in this Nation, tractor-trailers are \nallowed to travel around with $750,000 of liability insurance. The \nFMCSA is studying that number to see what it should be updated to after \n35 years. $750,000 is not enough money.\n  Just this morning in my district in northeastern Pennsylvania, there \nwas a horrendous truck and bus accident in which three people were \nkilled and a dozen others were seriously injured. When three people are \nkilled, asking their families to share $750,000 is not fiscally \nresponsible. Look who pays the difference.\n  If somebody is killed or if somebody is rendered, for example, a \nparaplegic, they are going to incur incredible amounts of medical \nbills; they are not going to be able to work. Who picks up the \ndifference when that happens? It is the Social Security system, it is \nthe Medicare system, it is John Q. Taxpayer that ends up paying the \nbill when the trucking company doesn't have enough insurance to pay the \ndamages.\n  That is why it is fiscally prudent that we allow the FMCSA to \ncontinue its important work, and it is important work that was mandated \nby the MAP-21 bill that required the FMCSA to do this work.\n  It also promotes safe highways, because if we raise insurance \nminimums up to modern and responsible levels, that means insurance \ncompanies will have to engage in actual real underwriting. They will \nhave to go out from the home office and visit the headquarters of \ntrucking companies to make sure they are acting properly and safely and \nresponsibly. If they do that, if you want to buy insurance at \nreasonable levels, you have to act safely.\n  Finally, Madam Chair, this is about personal responsibility. If you \ndon't have enough insurance, you get away without being personally \nresponsible when these horrendous crashes happen.\n  Madam Chair, I yield to Mr. Price for a colloquy.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I \nwant to commend him for offering this amendment.\n  Madam Chair, as he has stressed very effectively, this is simply \nirrational to freeze these claims where they were in the early 1980s, \nand it also defies our own body's directions to the DOT to look at this \nand to think about what kind of future changes might be in order. This \nsimply preempts that whole process; is that right?\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. That is correct. For that very reason, I urge \neveryone to support my amendment to allow the FMCSA to finish its \nimportant work of examining and developing a rule that is critical to \npreventing devastating trucking accidents and keeping our highways safe \nand secure for everyone.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Madam Chair, I claim time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Madam Chair, I oppose this amendment. As is frequently the case in \nWashington, D.C., the proposed rules requiring truckers to increase \ntheir liability insurance is a solution in search of a problem. The \nprovision currently included in the bill must remain. It must remain \nbecause it protects job creators so they can stay in business. When you \nconsider that 99.9 percent of crashes are already covered by existing \ninsurance requirements, you can see that increasing insurance and, \nthus, costs at the expense of jobs is just not a credible solution.\n  Safety is important. We all know that. We all want to make sure that \nour roadways are safe. But the Department of Transportation readily \nadmits that raising the cost does not necessarily improve safety. The \nDOT's own study expresses a crippling revelation to proponents of a \ncost increase on our job creators. There may be more effective ways \nthat reduce crashes at a lower cost.\n  Bottom line, we need to strike a balance. If the proposed regulations \nwent into effect, our smaller trucking companies in Iowa and other \nrural areas in States around the country would be unable to absorb the \nincreased costs, and it could threaten their ability to stay in \nbusiness. Too frequently in this town we are working to fix the \nmistakes that were made by so-called Washington solutions. I strongly \nencourage the rejection of this amendment tonight.\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Chair, on the one point about 99.9 percent of \ncrashes settling within existing insurance minimums, there we have the \nopponents of my amendment speaking really out of both sides of their \nmouth, because if they say it is so rare that a crash will cost more \nthan the minimum insurance, then what that means is that the expense of \ninsuring against that minimal risk has to be minimal itself, but these \nare the same people saying that it will be a crippling additional \ninsurance premium. It doesn't make sense.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Reclaiming my time, I yield the balance of my time \nto the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).\n  Mr. PERRY. Madam Chair, I, too, oppose this amendment. Increasing \ninsurance requirements will not improve highway safety. I mean, what \nincentive does it create? How does increasing the insurance requirement \nimprove safety? It is not backed by any sound data.\n  The agency's own data shows that current requirements cover damages \nin more--more--than 99 percent of all crashes. Think about that, more \nthan 99 percent of all crashes. But to the gentleman's point, my friend \nfrom Pennsylvania, the agency is planning on tying these requirements \nto medical inflation, and that results in increases of 500 percent or \nmore. Think about that, medical inflation, this administration. I mean, \nisn't that the height of irony? I thought they were driving the cost of \nmedical inflation down. That is another whole story.\n  The fact is the industry has a remarkable safety record compared to \nall commercial motor vehicles. As a matter of fact, motor coaches \naverage only 20 fatalities per year and schoolbuses only 5. Now, that \nis not meant to minimize those losses because every life is precious, \nbut in a highway environment that produces 35,000 fatalities per year, \nthe DOT study did not even consider accident data, claims data, or talk \nto insurance carriers about the impacts of increasing insurance or \nwhether there is even a need for it.\n  Indeed, this is a solution that is looking for a problem, a problem \nthat does not exist. I urge the Members to vote ``no'' on this \namendment.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania \nwill be postponed.\n\n[[Page H3846]]\n\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Sec. 135.

Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment which \nseeks to bolster funds for the inspector general of the National \nRailroad Passenger Corporation, or Amtrak.\n  I am a strong proponent of government oversight, and I believe the \nrevelatory work of the inspector general should be staunchly supported \nwithin each agency of the Federal Government.\n  Today, given the dismal financial record of Amtrak through its \nhistory, compounded with recent safety failures, it is clear that the \nscrupulous, objective oversight of the inspector general is needed for \nthis agency now more than ever.\n  This amendment redirects $500,000 to the Amtrak Office of the \nInspector General salaries and expenses account to bring it up to the \nbudget request level.\n  Since the Inspector General Act was passed into law, the IG community \nhas saved taxpayers billions of dollars and has uncovered countless \nexamples of wrongdoing in the Federal Government. The inspector general \ncommunity does good work. Let's give them the resources they need.\n  The committee has noted the good work of the Amtrak OIG in the \ncommittee report, stating: ``The OIG's efforts have resulted in \nvaluable studies and recommendations for this committee and for the \nCorporation that have yielded cost savings and management improvements. \nThese studies have been in a number of areas, including food and \nbeverage service, capital planning, overtime, and fraud.''\n  I commend the committee for the work they have done to support \nefficient and effective government.\n  This amendment is directly in line with the high value the committee \nplaces on the thorough work of the OIG and will ensure additional \ntransparency and accountability within Amtrak.\n  There is a wide agreement about the need to reform, streamline, and \nimprove Amtrak. A valuable first step in that reform is supporting the \nobjective, rigorous auditing information which the OIG is uniquely \nqualified to produce.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in support of government \naccountability by giving the Amtrak OIG the resources they need to \nidentify the waste, fraud, and abuse within a government agency that is \nin desperate need of reform.\n  I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their leadership on \nthis bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 44, line 13, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $16,930,000)''.\n       Page 52, line 16, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $83,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom New Jersey and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment that \nwill bolster our Nation's rail safety and operations.\n  First, I would like to thank the gentleman from Florida for his \ndedication and important work on this bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, the number of train derailments and accidents in our \nlocal communities is a growing concern among my constituents and \nAmericans all across the country.\n  In the first 2 months of 2015, there were 18 Amtrak accidents, as \nwell as recent oil train derailments in West Virginia and in North \nDakota. Most recently, Mr. Chairman, an Amtrak train crash in \nPhiladelphia killed eight people and injured dozens more.\n  In New Jersey alone, there are 2,400 miles of freight lines and over \n1,000 passenger rail miles, and we must ensure, Mr. Chairman, that \nthese existing lines are operating safely.\n  So what do we have here? My amendment fully funds the Federal \nRailroad Administration's safety and operations account without \nincreasing spending in the underlying bill. The FRA's safety and \noperations account provides funding for the FRA's safety program \nactivities related to passenger and freight railroads.\n  So how do we do this? By reallocating a mere 4 percent of funding \nfrom capital investment grants, we can fund the safe operation of our \nNation's trains at the President's requested levels.\n  Mr. Chairman, we do not build a new section onto our house if our \nroof is caving in. So we should not be adding on to these systems if \nthey are caving in or failing.\n  So why are we funding new projects before we ensure that our current \nrail lines have enough dollars, enough funding for their safety?\n  My amendment would simply prioritize safety and maintenance of our \nexisting infrastructure over the ribbon-cutting ceremonies associated \nwith system expansion.\n  In light of the recent upsurge in deadly rail accidents, now is the \ntime to adequately fund the safety and operations of our trains. \nAdditionally, with our rising national debt, it is very important that \nwe remain fiscally responsible and prioritize how we spend our \nconstituents' hard-earned tax dollars.\n  That is why, in conclusion, my amendment does not increase spending, \nbut only prioritizes a commonsense directive. And so I urge my \ncolleagues to support my amendment to fund train safety, and I reserve \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, while I know and I am absolutely \ncertain that the gentleman from New Jersey's heart is in the right \nplace, unfortunately, I cannot support the offset.\n  The committee carefully calculated the New Start numbers to be able \nto accommodate the signed FFGAs and Small Starts Grant Agreements at \nthe beginning of the fiscal year, and I am a firm believer that once \nyou sign a grant, once you make that commitment, we should honor it. \nThis reduction would impact those signed agreements, so I reluctantly \noppose this amendment.\n  With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina \n(Mr. Price), the ranking member.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for \nyielding, and I want to echo his opposition to this amendment, although \nI do commend Mr. Garrett for his focus on safety and operations. I, \ntoo, would like to raise that appropriation to the request level. That \nis a good objective.\n  There are a couple of problems here, though. One, is that because of \ndifferences in outlay rates, to pick up $17 million on the safety and \noperations side you have to cut $83 million from the transit New \nStarts. That has to do with differences in outlay rates. But the fact \nis, it is a substantial cut. And these New Starts in the bill, I remind \ncolleagues, are already $1.3 billion below the President's request. \nThey are $198 million below what we have this year.\n  These are badly underfunded items. So we simply, again, are robbing \nPeter to pay Paul. But because of the disproportionate impact here, and \nthe fact that New Starts are already so underresourced, I reluctantly \noppose this amendment.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Chairman, two points. The first is, I understand the \ngentleman's opposition on procedural grounds as far as the differences \nin outlays and what have you. But when you go back home and talk to \nyour district and say you are trying to do something for safety, as we \nare in this case, and you say: Well, the reason we can't do this is the \nprocedural aspect of outlays versus the actual amount of money going in \nand the amount of money being cut, and so on and so forth, and you go \nthrough all the rubric and the matrix that we use around here and all \nthe buzz words on the floor to try to explain things, the eyes of the \npeople back home glaze over, rightfully so, because they say: Those are \nyour rules, not ours. Why don't you just get something done.\n  What they are asking to get done is rail safety. And that is what \nthis amendment does.\n  I just want to end with one quote. Back in 2010, the head of the \nFTA--at that time, the administrator was Peter Rogoff--chastised local \ntransit agencies for promoting rail construction for so many new rail \nlines. He said on one hand, agencies were unable to maintain the rail \nlines they already had. The FTA had recently at that point estimated \nthat rail transit systems suffered from close to a $60 billion \nmaintenance backlog--and the backlog was growing even then.\n  And he said this: ``If you can't afford to operate the systems you \nhave,'' he asked the agencies, ``why does it make sense for us to \npartner with you in new expansions?''\n  That is a great question. If they can't fix up what is already out \nthere and all the problems on the rail lines out there on important \nthings like safety, then why on Earth are we spending all these tens of \nmillions of dollars on brand new programs that we know that they are \nnot going to be able to maintain as well? Let's do first things first.\n  As I said in my little example before, if your roof is collapsing on \nyour house, you don't add a new deck, you don't put in a new pool, you \ndon't put in a paved new driveway, you don't do anything else. You \nrepair the roof, first and foremost, and then everything else comes \nafter that.\n  And that is really all I am asking. Let's maintain the safety, first \nand foremost, so that everyone riding on the rails can feel confident \nthat they are operating right. Then, after that, let's come back here \nto the floor and fix up the other funding mechanism for new programs \nand what have you, and go forward.\n  Right now, let's make sure that our constituents back home can feel \nconfident every time they ride on a transit system, be it a bus or \ntrain or something else, that they know that it is adequately funded \nand taken care of and maintained.\n  With that, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Jersey \nwill be postponed.\n\n[[Page H3848]]\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 45, line 15, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $1,000,000) (increased by $1,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentlewoman \nfrom Nevada and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Nevada.\n\n                              {time}  2200\n\n  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Chairman, I rise today with this very simple \namendment. It is one that is meant to shed light on inadequate \ninvestments that are being made in our Nation's passenger rail service.\n  The bill before us appropriates nearly $16 billion for aviation, over \n$40 billion for our roads, over $10 billion for public transit, but \njust $1.1 billion for our Nation's passenger rail service.\n  I represent Las Vegas, where we import everything from tourists to \nlobsters, so we certainly understand the importance of transportation \nmobility.\n  It is interesting, many international and domestic travelers alike \nare shocked to learn, when they are coming to Las Vegas, that a major \nmetropolitan city, home to more than 2 million residents and playground \nand boardroom to over 42 million visitors a year, we just don't have \naccess to passenger rail service.\n  Visitors from Europe or Asia are accustomed to taking trains from one \ncity to another, and they face a sad reality when traveling to Las \nVegas from other Southwestern tourist destinations.\n  From Los Angeles, for example, you would have to take a 7-hour train \nride that drops you off in Kingman, Arizona, at 1:30 in the morning. \nThere, you would have to find the bus station, which is 4 miles away, \nget on a bus at 4 in the morning to travel another 3 hours to downtown \nLas Vegas. That is just crazy.\n  The last Amtrak train on the Desert Wind line departed the back of \nthe Plaza Hotel in May of 1997, bound for Los Angeles.\n  Well, a lot has changed since the late 1990s. Over the last 17 years, \nsouthern Nevada's population has grown by a million new residents, and \n10 million more visitors travel to southern Nevada annually, putting \nenormous strain on our area's highways and the airport, which is among \nthe top 10 busiest airports in the country.\n  More than 42,000 vehicles also cross the I-15 border between \nCalifornia and Nevada daily. If you have traveled along that busy \nstretch of road, you know the kind of traffic nightmares that you might \nencounter.\n  In fact, I recently spoke with an airline pilot who frequently makes \nthe short flight between Los Angeles and Las Vegas, and he remarked \nthat you can't get lost. All you have to do is follow the red brake \nlights on I-15 all the way to McCarran.\n  We can and we must do better; but this isn't just about Las Vegas. \nCities like Phoenix, Arizona; Nashville, Tennessee; Columbus, Ohio; \nLouisville, Kentucky; and Boise, Idaho, don't have passenger rail \nservice either.\n  In addition, there is no direct rail service between major \nmetropolitan areas like Houston and Dallas, Atlanta and Orlando, and \nKansas City and Oklahoma City. I believe that expanding rail service to \nunserved communities like those in southern Nevada should be a \npriority, but, unfortunately, this legislation before us does not \nreally get us there.\n  At the end of April, I organized a roundtable back in my district to \ndiscuss the need to restore passenger service to Las Vegas, and I was \nreally surprised by the high level of interest from local stakeholders.\n  We had participants from our State and local transportation \nauthorities, the gaming and hotel industries, the chamber of commerce, \nlabor unions and economic development organizations, all in agreement \nthat southern Nevada should have passenger rail service as part of our \nlong-term economic viability plans. This type of development is a \nregional and should be a national priority.\n  Now, a lot of attention has been paid to the Northeast corridor, \nwhere travelers frequent Amtrak service along the East Coast, but we \nshould not forget that it was the railroad that built the West and \nstill, today, remains a critical piece of our transportation network.\n  China is investing $128 million in rail in 2015 alone and India, $137 \nbillion over the next 5 years; yet we are investing only $1.1 billion.\n  Mr. Chairman, since this amendment really has no monetary impact, I \nwould respectfully ask that you accept it. It is my hope that we \nrecognize this mode of transportation that is so tied to our Nation's \nhistory and that we can continue to work together to see that it gets \nthe attention and support that it deserves.\n  Thank you very much for your time and your consideration. I hope \nthat, together, we can work to be sure that passenger rail service is \nexpanded throughout the country and especially in the Southwest.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Titus).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n               Amendment Offered by Mr. Brooks of Alabama\n\n  Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 45, strike line 6 and all that follows through page \n     47, line 3.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Alabama and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n\n[[Page H3849]]\n\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alabama.\n  Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, America recently suffered four \nstraight trillion dollar deficits. In the past few months, America's \ndebt blew through the $18 trillion mark.\n  America pays over $200 billion per year in debt service, which is \nmore than four times what the Federal Government spends on highways, \nbridges, and interstates each year. America's Comptroller General warns \nthat America's deficits and debt paths are unsustainable.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office warns that our debt \nservice cost is on a path to increase by another $600 billion within a \ndecade, to more than $800 billion per year. That is more than America \nspends each year on national defense. The CBO also warns that, within a \ndecade, if current trends continue, America will face yearly trillion \ndollar deficits in perpetuity.\n  Per then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen's \ntestimony before the House Armed Services Committee, debt is America's \n``greatest threat to our national security.''\n  As a result of America's debt, in a few short years, America's \nuniformed military personnel numbers will be our smallest since before \nWorld War II, America's Navy will have the smallest number of \noperational naval vessels since World War I, and America's Air Force \nwill have its smallest number of operational aircraft in its history. \nDebt, not our enemies, is slowly but surely stripping America of its \nability to defend itself.\n  In sum, Washington's financial irresponsibility, this House of \nRepresentatives' financial irresponsibility, is pushing America into a \ndebilitating insolvency and bankruptcy that will destroy the American \nDream for our children and grandchildren.\n  It is in this setting that I beseech this House of Representatives to \nbe financially responsible by supporting my amendment that eliminates \nFederal Government operating subsidies of Amtrak, thus forcing Amtrak \nto operate in the black.\n  How bad is the Amtrak subsidy problem? The Congressional Research \nService reports that, from 1971 to 2015, Federal Amtrak subsidies \ntotaled $78 billion in constant 2015 dollars. In fiscal year 2014, \nAmtrak had a net loss of $1.1 billion. Who paid for that loss? \nAmerica's children and grandchildren, that is who.\n  How so? It is because America does not have the money and had to \nborrow every penny of that $1.1 billion, thus burdening Americans for \ngenerations to come.\n  Mr. Chairman, a business that relies on subsidies and tax dollars to \ncover losses has little incentive to operate efficiently or effectively \nor, for that matter, as safely as it should.\n  It is appalling that the Federal Government undermines and threatens \nthe future of America's children and grandchildren in order to \nsubsidize Amtrak passenger service that would be self-sufficient if \nAmtrak riders stopped mooching off of hard-working American taxpayers \nand, instead, simply paid for the actual cost of their rides.\n  Amtrak supporters often claim that Amtrak will go out of business if \nit is not subsidized by American taxpayers. That is bunk unsupported by \nfacts.\n  This same ``woe is me'' argument was made about freight train \nsubsidies; yet, when freight rail subsidies ended and freight rail was \nsold to private investors in the 1980s, freight rail did not go out of \nbusiness and still operates today.\n  Similarly, the Federal Government does not operate or subsidize \nnational airlines or national bus services; yet airlines and buses \noperate profitably in the private sector, despite Federal Government \nsubsidies for Amtrak, their competitor.\n  Just as airlines, bus services, and freight rail operate without \ngovernment subsidies, Amtrak will do the same if this House of \nRepresentatives has the courage to wean Amtrak from the taxpayer \nnipple.\n  Mr. Chairman, after more than 40 years, it is time to stop the \nrunaway Amtrak train. It is time to force Amtrak riders to pay their \nown way by ending their subsidized rides on the backs of American \ntaxpayers.\n  I urge adoption of my amendment to do just that.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I seek time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong \nopposition to this amendment which, purely and simply, would end \nintercity passenger rail for our Nation.\n  I remind colleagues, there is not a single mode of transportation in \nthis country that is not subsidized, contrary to what we have just \nheard.\n  To make the case further, I yield such time as she may consume to the \ngentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Brown), a distinguished member of the \nauthorizing committee.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Chairman, when I was coming up, I used to like this television \nshow, ``Robin Hood.'' My colleagues practice what I call reverse Robin \nHood, robbing from the working people and the poor people and the \ntransit people to give tax breaks to the rich.\n  Just a few weeks ago, the House Republicans passed a bill cutting \ntaxes by $269 billion--I guess that didn't affect the deficit--for \ntheir wealthiest friends, but can't find the $2 billion that we need \nfor Amtrak--shameful.\n  The funding cuts proposed in this amendment would simply force Amtrak \nto shut down, strand millions of rail passengers, disrupt commuter \noperations, add to our already congested roads and airports, eliminate \nover 20,000 jobs nationwide, and jeopardize local economies and \nbusinesses that depend on Amtrak's service.\n  Amtrak provides the majority of all intercity passenger rail service \nin the United States, with more States and localities across America \nturning to passenger rail to meet the transportation needs of our \ncitizens.\n  Amtrak has done an excellent job, based on the fact that 9/11, when \nwe were attacked, Amtrak was the only means that you could move away.\n  When we had Hurricane Katrina, Amtrak is the only way that we could \nmove people out of harm's way by evacuating and delivering food and \nwater and supplies.\n  Amtrak has made significant improvement in its system over the last \nseveral years, has steady increase in ridership numbers, played a vital \nrole in disaster recovery, and has an ambitious agenda for future \ngrowth.\n  I encourage all Members to vote against this ill-willed and ill-\nthought-out amendment.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, I would respond that there is no \nfactual basis for the gentlewoman's comments that have just been made.\n  Socialism does not work. We need to get Amtrak passengers off the \nbacks of all taxpayers, including those that are poor, that can't \nafford the taxes that they are already having to pay to benefit those \nAmtrak riders. Let's set them free.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last \nword.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I yield to my colleague \nfrom Pennsylvania (Mr. Fattah).\n  Mr. FATTAH. Let me thank the ranking member.\n  The fact of the matter is, notwithstanding what was offered to the \nHouse as the picture of America, we actually live in the greatest \ncountry in the world. We have the strongest economy. We are the \nwealthiest country. There is no country, based on the IMF, that would \nwant to trade our position vis-a-vis debt-to-wealth ratio.\n  I hear the gentleman saying, Woe is America, and we can't afford to \nsubsidize rail. I think the ranking member makes it clear that there is \nno form of transportation that is not subsidized.\n  I heard this utterance that we don't subsidize airplane travel. This \nis nonsensical. Just the facts of this bill itself outline some of our \ncountry's subsidies for our airline industry.\n\n                              {time}  2215\n\n  But I want to talk about Amtrak.\n  When it is said that there is a $1 billion subsidy and that somehow \nwe can't afford that from last year, I want\n\n[[Page H3850]]\n\nto remind this House that for each and every month we have been in \nAfghanistan, we have been spending $2 billion a week for well over a \ndecade, as a Nation. The idea that we can't afford to have a first-rate \npassenger rail system defies logic. It is just a matter of political \nwill.\n  We need to make a decision about America's place in the world, and \nour economy is dependent on our ability to transport not just freight \nbut human beings, and Amtrak is critical to that.\n  I thank the gentleman from North Carolina for yielding me time.\n  I hope this House will reconsider this thrust of the majority to move \naway from passenger rail. I heard some talk from the gentleman that we \nhave got to stop this runaway train, but we tried to stop a train in \nPhiladelphia, and if we had made the investments, there would be people \nwho would be alive today.\n  We need to make these investments, and we need to move our country \nforward. It is not about political philosophy. It is about \npracticality.\n  Our economic competitors are subsidizing rail. And if we want to make \nour economy work, we are going to have to make Amtrak work. And we can \ndo that through some of the efforts on this bill today.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. I thank the gentleman for his wise words \nand join him in wholeheartedly opposing this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Alabama (Mr. Brooks).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Alabama will \nbe postponed.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n  capital and debt service grants to the national railroad passenger \n                              corporation\n\n       To enable the Secretary of Transportation to make grants to \n     the National Railroad Passenger Corporation for capital \n     investments as authorized by sections 101(c), 102, and 219(b) \n     of the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 \n     (division B of Public Law 110-432), $850,000,000, to remain \n     available until expended, of which not to exceed $160,200,000 \n     shall be for debt service obligations as authorized by \n     section 102 of such Act: Provided, That of the amounts made \n     available under this heading, not less than $50,000,000 shall \n     be made available to bring Amtrak-served facilities and \n     stations into compliance with the Americans with Disabilities \n     Act: Provided further, That after an initial distribution of \n     up to $200,000,000, which shall be used by the Corporation as \n     a working capital account, all remaining funds shall be \n     provided to the Corporation only on a reimbursable basis: \n     Provided further, That of the amounts made available under \n     this heading, up to $20,000,000 may be used by the Secretary \n     to subsidize operating losses of the Corporation should the \n     funds provided under the heading ``Operating Grants to the \n     National Railroad Passenger Corporation'' be insufficient to \n     meet operational costs for fiscal year 2016: Provided \n     further, That the Secretary may retain up to one-half of 1 \n     percent of the funds provided under this heading to fund the \n     costs of project management and oversight of activities \n     authorized by subsections 101(a) and 101(c) of division B of \n     Public Law 110-432: Provided further, That the Secretary \n     shall approve funding for capital expenditures, including \n     advance purchase orders of materials, for the Corporation \n     only after receiving and reviewing a grant request for each \n     specific capital project justifying the Federal support to \n     the Secretary's satisfaction: Provided further, That except \n     as otherwise provided herein, none of the funds under this \n     heading may be used to subsidize operating losses of the \n     Corporation: Provided further, That none of the funds under \n     this heading may be used for capital projects not approved by \n     the Secretary of Transportation or on the Corporation's \n     fiscal year 2016 business plan: Provided further, That in \n     addition to the project management oversight funds authorized \n     under section 101(d) of division B of Public Law 110-432, the \n     Secretary may retain up to an additional $3,000,000 of the \n     funds provided under this heading to fund expenses associated \n     with implementing section 212 of division B of Public Law \n     110-432, including the amendments made by section 212 to \n     section 24905 of title 49, United States Code: Provided \n     further, That Amtrak shall conduct a business case analysis \n     on capital investments that exceed $10,000,000 in life-cycle \n     costs: Provided further, That each contract for a capital \n     acquisition that exceeds $10,000,000 in life cycle costs \n     shall state that funding is subject to the availability of \n     appropriated funds provided by an appropriations Act.\n\n\n               amendment offered by ms. brown of florida\n\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 47, line 11, after the dollar amount insert \n     ``(increased by $861,500,000)''.\n\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the \ngentlewoman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentlewoman from Florida and a \nMember opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Chairman, my amendment increases capital \ngrants to Amtrak by $861 million. This will bring the total funding for \nAmtrak in the bill to $2 billion, equal to Amtrak's fiscal year 2016 \nbudget request to Congress.\n  This bill, as if it wasn't bad enough, cut $290 million from Amtrak's \ncapital program, which is used to repair and replace aging \ninfrastructure on the Northeast corridor, including 140-year-old \nbridges and tunnels, and implement positive train control, a system \nthat, according to the National Transportation Safety Board, would have \nprevented the recent Amtrak derailment in Philadelphia.\n  According to the April 2015 report to Congress, ``At the current rate \nof available funding, it would take over 300 years to replace all of \nthe bridges on the Northeast corridor, well beyond the timeframe in \nwhich assets would simply be shut down.''\n  The list of critical needs extends far beyond just bridges and \ntunnels. Major portions of Amtrak's electrical power supply system date \nback to 1930.\n  According to the commission, in total, $21.1 billion is needed to \nachieve a state of good repair on the corridor, $8.7 billion of which \nis needed to address critical infrastructure needs over the next 5 \nyears.\n  We cannot point to the recent Amtrak derailment and say that it was \ndirectly caused by a lack of investment. That is true. But we do know \nfrom the NTSB that it was preventable had positive train control been \ninstalled on that section of track.\n  Amtrak included $36.4 million in their $2 billion fiscal year 2016 \nbudget request to Congress. Amtrak testified at a hearing in the \nTransportation and Infrastructure Committee yesterday that had they \nbeen provided adequate funding from the get-go, they would have been \nable to implement positive train control sooner.\n  The impact of this tragic accident could also have been lessened had \nthe Republican-controlled Congress not denied Amtrak's request for \nfunding to replace passenger cars that date back to 1975 with newer \ncars.\n  At this time, I yield to the gentleman from Philadelphia, \nPennsylvania (Mr. Fattah).\n  Mr. FATTAH. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment.\n  I think it is critically important that we understand that the \nPresident requested an increase in capital allotments for Amtrak. Not \nonly was that not honored, but we actually went with the wisdom of the \nmajority: we actually cut last year's number by over $250-plus million.\n  This is a move in the wrong direction for our country, and I hope \nthat through the gentlewoman's amendment, we can reverse that. So I \nstand in support of it, and I hope that the majority would allow us to \nproceed to a vote.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n\n                             point of order\n\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, the amendment proposes a net increase \nin budget authority in the bill.\n  The amendment is not in order under section 3(d)(3) of House \nResolution 5 of the 114th Congress, which states the following:\n  ``It shall not be in order to consider an amendment to a general \nappropriations bill proposing a net increase in budget authority in the \nbill unless considered en bloc with another amendment or amendments \nproposing an equal or greater decrease in such budget authority \npursuant to clause 2(f) of rule XXI.''\n\n[[Page H3851]]\n\n  The amendment proposes a net increase in budget authority in the bill \nin violation of such section.\n  I ask for a ruling from the Chair.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point \nof order?\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I wish to be heard on the point \nof order.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Florida is recognized.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Chairman, just a few short weeks ago, House \nRepublicans passed a bill cutting taxes by $269 billion for their \nwealthiest friends, yet we can't find $2 billion for Amtrak to make it \nsafe?\n  My friend from Florida, this is unacceptable; shame.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman needs to confine her remarks to the \npoint of order.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. I thought I was speaking to the point of order, \nsir.\n  That is my point. We cut $269 billion, and we can't find $2 billion \nto make Amtrak safe? That is the point.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair is prepared to rule.\n  The gentleman from Florida makes a point of order that the amendment \noffered by the gentlewoman from Florida violates section 3(d)(3) of \nHouse Resolution 5.\n  Section 3(d)(3) establishes a point of order against an amendment \nproposing a net increase in budgetary authority in the pending bill.\n  As persuasively asserted by the gentleman from Florida, the amendment \nproposes a net increase in budget authority in the bill. Therefore, the \npoint of order is sustained. The amendment is not in order.\n\n\n               amendment offered by mr. brooks of alabama\n\n  Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 47, strike line 4 and all that follows through page \n     49, line 8.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Alabama and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alabama.\n  Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, my first amendment, Brooks No. \n19, strikes $288.5 million in operating subsidies for Amtrak. This \nsecond amendment, which is Brooks No. 21, strikes capital and debt \nservice subsidies that total $850 million per year to get to the point \nwhere we can strike all taxpayer subsidies for Amtrak.\n  I would rely on the arguments previously made with respect to my \nfirst amendment to support this second amendment.\n  I would add, however, that I have heard some comments about the \nsafety associated with Amtrak. I would emphasize at this point that if \nyou want safety with rail service, probably the best thing to do is to \nput it in the private sector and eliminate Amtrak altogether.\n  Look at airlines, air carriers; they are private sector and are much \nsafer than Amtrak. Look at buses; they are private sector and are safer \nthan Amtrak. And I would submit that if lives are what concern the \nopponents to these amendments that they would propose putting Amtrak \ninto private hands in order to have the same kind of safety record that \nwe have with buses, air carriers, and other modes of private \ntransportation.\n  Mr. Chairman, at this point, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to \nthe amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I very strongly oppose \nthis amendment which, like the gentleman's previous amendment, would \nessentially end passenger rail service in this country. It is just that \ndrastic. It is also targeting passenger rail in a way that obscures the \nfact that every mode of transportation in this country is subsidized. \nIt is in the public interest to maintain diverse modes of \ntransportation that serve our various transportation needs and our \nvarious population centers.\n  Amtrak provides an invaluable service to this country: 500 \ndestinations in 46 States, connecting small communities that don't have \naccess to air service.\n  Amtrak is popular with the American people. It is increasingly being \ntaken advantage of. In the last 11 years, 10 consecutive years of \nrecord ridership, serving nearly 32 million passengers last year.\n  Without Amtrak's service in the Northeast corridor, where would we \nbe? There would be virtual gridlock in New York's airports, but it is \nnot just the Northeast corridor. I come from a State that had the \ninsight years ago to invest in State Amtrak service, and now Amtrak is \nthe preferred mode of transportation for thousands of people between \nRaleigh and Charlotte, with three full routes a day in each direction.\n  This is an irresponsible amendment. It will eliminate thousands of \njobs. It will harm local economies. And it will violate labor \nagreements. There is so much wrong with this.\n  I urge its rejection and yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, I would submit that the argument \nthat this would end rail service is absolutely false and is not \nsupported by history. Nothing in history supports the gentleman's \nargument. However well-intentioned, the evidence is clear.\n  Freight rail, the same kind of argument was made. Subsidies were \nended. It went into the private sector. It survives and thrives today.\n  There is an argument that buses and air carriers are somehow or \nanother subsidized. I would submit that what we are talking about, \nthere are user fees and there are gasoline taxes and diesel taxes that \npay for those roads that buses use, and there are air passenger charges \nthat pay for the cost of those airports that air carriers use.\n  So with that as a backdrop, I would submit that it is time for Amtrak \npassengers to pay their own way. It is time for Amtrak passengers to \nquit riding on the backs of other taxpayers. They have the ability to \npay their own way. The rest of the country is expected to pay their own \nway when they travel. As such, I would ask this body to adopt my \namendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Alabama (Mr. Brooks).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Alabama will \nbe postponed.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       administrative provisions--federal railroad administration\n\n       Sec. 150.  The Secretary of Transportation may receive and \n     expend cash, or receive and utilize spare parts and similar \n     items, from non-United States Government sources to repair \n     damages to or replace United States Government owned \n     automated track inspection cars and equipment as a result of \n     third-party liability for such damages, and any amounts \n     collected under this section shall be credited directly to \n     the Safety and Operations account of the Federal Railroad \n     Administration, and shall remain available until expended for \n     the repair, operation and maintenance of automated track \n     inspection cars and equipment in connection with the \n     automated track inspection program.\n       Sec. 151.  None of the funds provided to the National \n     Railroad Passenger Corporation may be used to fund any \n     overtime costs in excess of $35,000 for any individual \n     employee: Provided, That the President of Amtrak may waive \n     the cap set in the previous proviso for specific employees \n     when the President of Amtrak determines such a cap poses a \n     risk to the safety and operational efficiency of the system: \n     Provided further, That Amtrak shall report to the House and \n     Senate Committees on Appropriations each quarter of the \n     calendar year on waivers granted to employees and amounts \n     paid above the cap for each month within such quarter and \n     delineate the reasons each waiver was granted: Provided \n     further, That the President of Amtrak shall report to the \n     House and Senate Committees on Appropriations by March 1, \n     2016, a summary of all overtime payments incurred by the \n     Corporation for 2015 and the three prior calendar years: \n     Provided further, That such summary shall include the total \n     number of employees that received waivers and the total \n     overtime payments the Corporation paid to those employees \n     receiving waivers for each month for 2015 and for the three \n     prior calendar years.\n\n[[Page H3852]]\n\n                     Federal Transit Administration\n\n                        administrative expenses\n\n       For necessary administrative expenses of the Federal \n     Transit Administration's programs authorized by chapter 53 of \n     title 49, United States Code, $102,933,000, of which not more \n     than $4,000,000 shall be available to carry out the \n     provisions of 49 U.S.C. 5329 and not less than $750,000 shall \n     be available to carry out the provisions of 49 U.S.C. 5326: \n     Provided, That none of the funds provided or limited in this \n     Act may be used to create a permanent office of transit \n     security under this heading: Provided further, That upon \n     submission to the Congress of the fiscal year 2017 \n     President's budget, the Secretary of Transportation shall \n     transmit to Congress the annual report on New Starts, \n     including proposed allocations for fiscal year 2017.\n\n                              {time}  2230\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Langevin\n\n  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 50, line 25, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(decreased by $2,000,000)''.\n       Page 52, line 13, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $2,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Rhode Island and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, the amendment I am offering today with my good friends \nCongressmen Quigley and Butterfield will return funding for FTA \nTechnical Assistance and Training back to its 2014 level. Older adults \nand individuals with disabilities disproportionately rely on public \ntransit to live, learn, get to work and access recreation in their \ncommunities. The Technical Assistance and Training dollars made \navailable by this amendment will help increase mobility for people with \ndisabilities and older adults. By providing this assistance to our \ntransit systems and services, we can ensure that they become more \naccessible for those who rely on them the most.\n  Mr. Chairman, FTA has a long history of working with Easter Seals, \nthe National Association of Area Agencies on Aging, and others to \nprovide training, technical assistance, and other problem-solving \nsupport to the transit industry, people with disabilities, and older \nadults; and it is imperative that this work continue as more people age \nand more people with disabilities seek to live as independently as \npossible.\n  Now, in order to realize this goal, FTA needs adequate resources to \nsupport these technical assistance activities. To that end, my \namendment will increase funding by $2 million for FTA Technical \nAssistance and Training and reduce, by an equivalent amount, funding \nfor FTA administrative expenses.\n  Mr. Chairman, the House adopted this exact amendment last year to \nrestore FTA Technical Assistance and Training to $5 million. \nUnfortunately, it was cut to $3 million in this bill. My amendment will \nsimply restore the funds back to the fiscal year '15 House-adopted \nlevel of $5 million.\n  With that, Mr. Chairman, I ask that my colleagues support this \namendment, which will provide a world of benefit to all those that it \nserves.\n  I thank my colleagues today for their consideration.\n  Again, I urge passage of the amendment, and with that, Mr. Chairman, \nI yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Wisconsin and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Chairman, as you know, we are very in debt in this \ncountry. This budget is on path to balance the budget eventually years \ndown the road, but, really, we should be looking to cut spending right \nnow.\n  You look at things the Federal Government is paying for that should \nbe done locally, and one of those things is these new capital \nimprovements on mass transit projects. I think normally these things do \nnot get the ridership that justifies these projects, and we would not \nbe doing these projects, local governments would not be applying for \nthese projects or building these projects if they had to pay their \nmoney themselves. The only reason these things go ahead is the Federal \nGovernment is paying for them, and the Federal Government has no money.\n  Mr. Chairman, this proposal will bring back down the funding on this \nline to what the Appropriations Committee wanted only 2 years ago, and \nfor whatever reason, apparently in negotiations, this amount went up \nlast year. But I don't think it is too much to ask that this House not \nzero out this line--and we could argue that we shouldn't be doing this \nat all--but at least go back to the levels of 2013, especially given \nthe huge amount of debt that is being piled up at this time.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, the committee carefully calculated the \nNew Start number to be able to accommodate the signed FFGAs and Small \nStarts Grant Agreements at the beginning of the fiscal year.\n  Again, as I submitted before, I am a firm believer that once you sign \na grant agreement, then we should, frankly, honor that. This reduction \nwould impact those signed agreements, and I reluctantly oppose the \ngentleman's amendment. I know the passion that he has for this, but I \nagain have to reluctantly oppose the gentleman's amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman \nfrom North Carolina (Mr. Price), the ranking member.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the \nchairman's yielding. I would like to echo his opposition to this \namendment.\n  I have just retrieved here a list of New Start projects that, under \nthe present funding levels of the bill, probably aren't going to be \nable to be addressed. We are talking about the Westside project in Los \nAngeles. We are talking about San Diego, Denver, Baltimore, the \nWashington, D.C. area, the Maryland National Capital Purple Line, \nMinneapolis, Fort Worth. These are ready to go. These are ready to go \nwith strong support in their communities, a strong impact on moving \npeople and providing jobs. It is just unthinkable that we would cut \nthis further.\n  Transit is an extremely important mode of transportation in many of \nour cities and suburban areas too, and the bill is inadequate. We need \nto find ways to make it more adequate going forward.\n\n[[Page H3853]]\n\n  Mr. Chairman, this amendment would move exactly in the wrong \ndirection, so I urge its defeat.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, it is all fine and good to move forward, but we are \ngoing to borrow about 14 percent of this budget, and we have got to \nstop saying whenever we see a spending item it is time to move forward. \nI think what we have to do here is--I can certainly understand if we \nmade commitments today, I can understand how people of goodwill would \nnot want this amendment. But if this amendment doesn't pass, then I \nthink we have to make doubly certain that a year from now we have a \ndramatic reduction here.\n  If there are any of these projects that are that important, the local \nunit of government can fund it. There is no surer way to overspend than \nhave the Federal Government give grants to local units of government \nthat they would never dream of spending themselves.\n  That is what is going on here, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n      grants to the washington metropolitan area transit authority\n\n       For grants to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit \n     Authority as authorized under section 601 of division B of \n     Public Law 110-432, $100,000,000, to remain available until \n     expended: Provided, That the Secretary shall approve grants \n     for capital and preventive maintenance expenditures for the \n     Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority only after \n     receiving and reviewing a request for each specific project: \n     Provided further, That prior to approving such grants, the \n     Secretary shall certify that the Washington Metropolitan Area \n     Transit Authority is making significant progress in \n     eliminating the material weaknesses, significant \n     deficiencies, and minor control deficiencies identified in \n     the most recent Financial Management Oversight Review: \n     Provided further, That the Secretary shall determine that the \n     Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority has placed the \n     highest priority on those investments that will improve the \n     safety of the system before approving such grants:  Provided \n     further, That the Secretary, in order to ensure safety \n     throughout the rail system, may waive the requirements of \n     section 601(e)(1) of title VI of Public Law 110-432 (112 \n     Stat. 4968).\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. Mica\n\n  Mr. MICA. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 53, line 11, strike the colon and all that follows \n     through line 15 and insert a period.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Florida (Mr. Mica) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. MICA. My colleagues, at this late hour, this is a simple \namendment. It strikes a waiver that was granted to the Washington \nMetropolitan Area Transit Authority, and it is a waiver that has been \nin place for several years. It waives the requirements for them to \ncomplete installation of cellular service in the tunnels of the Metro \nsystem in Washington, D.C. That waiver allows them to continue to \nreceive Federal funds but not have made the installation.\n  It is funny because congressional staffers said: Well, Mr. Mica, why \nare you doing this? I am doing this because, as the chairman of a \nsubcommittee on transportation oversight, I had to conduct a hearing \nafter the January 12 deadly incident in the Washington area Metro. You \nmay recall at L'Enfant Plaza, on the Yellow Line, there was an incident \nin which smoke filled the tunnel. A passenger train was left outside of \nthe station.\n  I might say that, back in 2008, we set up a requirement that we have \nat the stations, within 1 year, Metro cellular service, and then by 4 \nyears later, the entire system. So they were given from 2008 to 2012 to \ncomplete the system. They never completed the system. One individual \ndied, others were injured, and we disrupted service. It was a day from \nhell in Washington, D.C.\n  Mr. Chairman, they never completed the job. They said they were going \nto complete the job right after 2012. They did not complete the job. \nThey said it would be done in 2015. The last time I checked, it is \n2015. It won't be done in 2015. They will not even sit down with the \ncarriers who will install this equipment, and it is really at no cost \nto Metro.\n  I have talked to Mr. Connolly, the gentleman from Virginia; I have \ntalked to Mrs. Comstock, the gentlewoman from Virginia; I have talked \nto Mr. Hoyer, the gentleman from Maryland; and others. We have all had \nit with Metro not complying with us.\n  This waiver was put in to give them the opportunity to comply, and \nthey haven't complied. Now it is in here again, and I am offering, in \nthis amendment, to take it out.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Florida \n(Mr. Diaz-Balart), the chairman, for comment.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. I want to thank the gentleman for yielding to me.\n  Mr. Chairman, when the gentleman from Florida is talking about this \nissue, I think all of us should be very, very concerned. I will tell \nyou I think that the gentleman from Florida has been beyond reasonable, \nhas tried to get folks to do what they were, again, supposed to do, and \nthey have not done it.\n  So I just want to let the gentleman from Florida know that I am \nlooking forward, and I am committed to making sure that this issue is \nsolved one way or another. I am hoping that it is solved in a nice, \npositive way. But otherwise, I want to let the gentleman from Florida \nknow that I will be working with him to make sure that we hold folks \naccountable.\n  Mr. MICA. Again, Mr. Chairman, I am willing to work with everyone. \nAgain, I have had to conduct oversight over a tragedy that could have \nand should have been prevented.\n  Here is the latest headline: ``Can You Hear Me Now? In Metro Tunnels, \nAnswer Is `Not Yet.'''\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman \nfrom Virginia (Mr. Connolly).\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend.\n  Mr. Chairman, I sympathize deeply with the concerns expressed by my \nfriend and colleague from Florida (Mr. Mica), and I know Metro is \ncommitted to working with the wireless carriers to ensure seamless \ncoverage throughout the rail system. I appreciate his willingness \nultimately to withdraw the amendment so as not to jeopardize other \nvital safety improvements underway at Metro by conditioning the Federal \ncommitment, which has already been reduced and which is matched by our \nState and local partners, on completion of this wireless upgrade.\n  Without question, the January arcing incident at L'Enfant Plaza \nunderscored the urgent need for having working communications in \nMetro's underground stations and tunnels. While faulty electrical \nwiring was to blame for the fire and hazardous smoke, a breakdown in \ncommunications, as Mr. Mica has indicated, led to passengers being \nstranded in dangerous conditions aboard that Yellow Line train for an \nextended period of time. It wasn't just public safety personnel who \nexperienced problems communicating. Stranded riders also reported \nhaving spotty or no cellular service in the tunnel.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to \nthe amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he \nmay consume to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly), our \ncolleague, so he can complete his statement.\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend from North Carolina, \nthe distinguished ranking member.\n  Tragically, one rider--Carol Glover of Virginia, my home State--died \nas a result of smoke inhalation, and dozens of others required medical \ntreatment and/or hospitalization.\n\n                              {time}  2245\n\n  This was, and remains, an unacceptable situation, and I and all of \nthe members of the national capital region delegation are committed to \nworking with the NSTB, FTA, Metro, and our\n\n[[Page H3854]]\n\nregional partners to ensure corrective actions are taken to restore \npublic confidence.\n  I would note for my colleagues, the current Federal law already \nincludes language requiring Metro riders to have underground access to \nwireless telecommunications services if the service providers work with \nMetro to install such services. Unfortunately, they have lagged behind \nagain, as my friend from Florida has indicated.\n  Congress approved that requirement as part of the Passenger Rail \nInvestment and Improvement Act of 2008. One year later, as required by \nthe law, the wireless providers did successfully establish service in \nthe 20 busiest underground rail stations. However, Congress has granted \nan extension on the timeline to install wireless service to the tunnels \nand the rest of the system because Metro and the wireless providers \nhave run into delays with scheduling work while Metro trains are not \nrunning, performing higher priority safety improvements as directed by \nthe NTSB, and other factors. However, they continue to work toward \nmeeting this requirement, albeit at a very slow and glacial pace.\n  Metro is particularly motivated to complete this work as it also \ninvolves a parallel upgrade of its own underground radio communications \nservices. Metro is an essential component of this region's \ntransportation network, moving hundreds of thousands of commuters every \nday, including a significant portion of Federal employees. It also \nserves as America's subway, transporting 12 million visitors from \nacross the country to the Nation's Capital each year.\n  It is critical that we maintain this bipartisan commitment to match \nlocal and State funding so that Metro can continue working with the \nNTSB and FTA on its critical safety upgrades.\n  Mr. Mica is right, and all of us from the national capital region \nagree with him. I pledge upon withdrawal of this amendment we will work \nwith Mr. Mica to ensure that Metro meets deadlines at a much more \nexpeditious pace than has been the case in the past.\n  Again, I thank my friend from North Carolina for yielding, and I \nthank Mr. Mica for his leadership.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MICA. Will the gentleman from North Carolina yield?\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. I yield to the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. MICA. Mr. Chairman, I just want to conclude. I want to thank Mr. \nConnolly. I want to thank Mrs. Comstock, and the chairman particularly, \nfor working on this.\n  I think we have gotten the attention of the Washington Metropolitan \nArea Transit Authority. We have an agreement to bring the parties \ntogether as a result of this pending amendment. That is set. If it does \nnot go through, I can assure you we will find a way to put this waiver \nin.\n  At this time, though, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my \namendment. I will bring the parties together and hopefully common sense \nand good faith will prevail.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Connolly\n\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 52, line 21, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $50,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Virginia and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chair.\n  I rise to offer an amendment with my colleagues in the national \ncapital region that would restore full funding of the Federal \ncommitment for vital rider safety improvements to ``America's Subway,'' \nthe Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, or Metro.\n  Let me remind my colleagues, this is not like the traditional transit \nor capital funding under the Department of Transportation. The \nPassenger Rail Investment Improvement Act of 2008 specifically \nauthorized a $150 million annual Federal commitment for 10 years, and \nCongress has worked in bipartisan fashion the past 6 years to fulfill \nthat. It was a Republican initiative initiated and authored by my \npredecessor, Republican member Tom Davis of Virginia.\n  As required by law, the Federal funding is matched dollar for dollar, \nwith $150 million coming from Virginia, Maryland, and the District of \nColumbia.\n  I appreciate the efforts of my fellow Virginian, Mr. Rigell, and the \nsubcommittee chairman, my friend, Mr. Diaz-Balart, to try to work with \nus to restore some of the funding at full committee markup. But \nreducing any of this funding would renege on the Federal commitment and \njeopardize the successful local-State-Federal partnership we have \nworked so hard to create.\n  It would also open the door for our partners to pull back on their \ncommitments commensurately, which would only exacerbate Metro's \nchallenge in upgrading its aging infrastructure.\n  This partnership is funding critical safety improvements throughout \nthe system identified by Metro itself, the National Transportation \nSafety Board, and the Federal Transit Administration following the \ntragic 2009 Red Line accident and the recent tragedy on the Yellow Line \nthis past January. The most visible improvement is the purchase of \n7000-series new rail cars with advanced crash-resilient technology and \nextra capacity to replace the oldest and original cars in the fleet.\n  Congress and the Federal Government have a responsibility in the \noperation and safety of Metro. Half of all Metro stations are located \non Federal property, and approximately 40 percent of rush-hour riders \non Metro are, in fact, Federal employees, including many Members of \nCongress and their staffs.\n  It is critical we maintain this bipartisan commitment to match local \nand State funding so that Metro can continue making these safety \nupgrades.\n  I want to thank Mr. Hoyer, Ms. Norton, Mr. Van Hollen, Ms. Edwards, \nMr. Sarbanes, Mr. Delaney, Mr. Beyer, and my friend Mrs. Comstock for \nworking with us on this regional priority.\n  I now yield the balance of my time to the distinguished delegate from \nthe District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, I thank my good friend for yielding and as \na cosponsor of this amendment, which has profound safety implications \nfor America's subway. I think it is so urgent that a member of the \nAppropriations Committee has already restored $25 million.\n  This was a partnership, a partnership between the Federal Government \nand Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. It became real \nafter there was a crash that took the lives of nine District of \nColumbia residents in 2009.\n  This is a unique transit agency. This is where staff of this body, \nthis is where visitors from all over the world ride. If this funding is \ndelayed, it will delay the crashworthy 7000-series trains. It is in \ntrains that were not crashworthy that we lost lives. We beg that this \nfunding be restored.\n  The District, Maryland, and Virginia are each fulfilling their part \nof the partnership. It is up to the Federal Government to do our part \nand fulfill our part. Don't break the partnership open now.\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, and I \ncontinue to reserve my point of order.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentlewoman from \nVirginia (Mrs. Comstock), who, obviously, is very passionate about this \nissue.\n  Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and \nI rise as a cosponsor of the amendment in support of the amendment.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  June 3, 2015, on page H3854, the following appeared: Ms. \nCOMSTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I\n  \n  The online version should be corrected to read: Mrs. COMSTOCK. \nMr. Chairman, I\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  Mr. Chairman, as been pointed out by my colleagues, Congress did make \na 10-year statutory commitment as a Federal partner, a 50-50 partner, \nto provide capital grant money to the Washington Metropolitan Area \nTransit Authority. This funding has been used for vital\n\n[[Page H3855]]\n\ncapital and safety improvements on the Metro system that so many of our \nconstituents and our staff and tourists, people from all over the \nworld, travel on every day.\n  As part of that agreement, matching grant money from the Commonwealth \nof Virginia, the District of Columbia, and the State of Maryland have \nall supplemented this in a full 50-50 match. This is truly a good \npartnership that has worked well since the bill was passed in 2008, and \nwe should continue to fulfill that commitment.\n  This amendment would restore the already obligated funding to the \nbill and keep the promise that we have already made. Metro needs these \nimportant funds for capital improvements that will address important \nsafety concerns.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to join my colleagues in the national \ncapital area in support of this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I insist on my point of order.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman will state his point of order.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, the amendment proposes a net increase \nin budget authority in the bill.\n  The amendment is not in order under section 3(d)(3) of House \nResolution 5, 114th Congress, which states the following:\n  ``It shall not be in order to consider an amendment to a general \nappropriations bill proposing a net increase in budget authority in the \nbill unless considered en bloc with another amendment or amendments \nproposing an equal or greater decrease in such budget authority \npursuant to clause 2(f) of rule XXI.\n  Mr. Chairman, the amendment proposes a net increase in budget \nauthority in the bill in violation of such section.\n  I respectfully ask for a ruling from the Chair.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point \nof order?\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the invocation of \nthe point of order.\n  This is a provision that has been in law for the past 6 years, and I \nbelieve that it ought to be enshrined in law for a 7th. We represent \nthe entire National Capital Region. This is a unique region. This is \nthe Nation's Capital. And we ought not to be reneging on a deal that \nwas worked out with great effort 6 years ago based on a point of order.\n  With that, I oppose the point of order, Mr. Chairman.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair is prepared to rule.\n  The gentleman from Florida makes a point of order that the amendment \noffered by the gentleman from Virginia violates section 3(d)(3) of \nHouse Resolution 5.\n  Section 3(d)(3) establishes a point of order against an amendment \nproposing a net increase in budget authority in the pending bill.\n  As persuasively asserted by the gentleman from Florida, the amendment \nproposes a net increase in budget authority in the bill. Therefore, the \npoint of order is sustained. The amendment is not in order.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       administrative provisions--federal transit administration\n\n       Sec. 160.  The limitations on obligations for the programs \n     of the Federal Transit Administration shall not apply to any \n     authority under 49 U.S.C. 5338, previously made available for \n     obligation, or to any other authority previously made \n     available for obligation.\n       Sec. 161.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     funds appropriated or limited by this Act under the heading \n     Fixed Guideway Capital Investment of the Federal Transit \n     Administration for projects specified in this Act or \n     identified in reports accompanying this Act not obligated by \n     September 30, 2020, and other recoveries, shall be directed \n     to projects eligible to use the funds for the purposes for \n     which they were originally provided.\n       Sec. 162.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any \n     funds appropriated before October 1, 2015, under any section \n     of chapter 53 of title 49, United States Code, that remain \n     available for expenditure, may be transferred to and \n     administered under the most recent appropriation heading for \n     any such section.\n       Sec. 163.

Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentlewoman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California.\n  Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment that will take a \nmodest step forward to improve pipeline safety. This issue is of \nparticular importance to me and to my constituents.\n  Two weeks ago, more than 100,000 gallons of crude oil spilled from \nthe ruptured Plains All American Pipeline along the treasured Gaviota \nCoast, in my district, just north of Santa Barbara. The oil quickly \nflowed under the highway, onto the beach, and into the ocean where the \noil slick spread south for miles along the coastline, affecting \npristine environmental habitats, recreational interests, and commercial \nfishing operations.\n  While the exact causes of this spill are still being investigated, it \nis already clear that woefully inadequate Federal pipeline safety \nstandards played a significant role, but it didn't have to be this way.\n  In 2011, the House worked in a bipartisan way to pass the Pipeline \nSafety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act. This law, which \npassed the House unanimously, directed the Pipeline and Hazardous \nMaterials Safety Administration, or PHMSA, to update and strengthen key \npipeline safety standards.\n  The law called on PHMSA to issue a rule requiring automatic shutoff \nvalves on new pipelines and to strengthen requirements for the \ninclusion of leak detection technologies on pipelines.\n  The law required these rules to be finalized by January of last year; \nyet, here today, we are still waiting. PHMSA has not even issued a \nproposed rule on these commonsense regulations, which passed the House \nunanimously. PHMSA continues to drag its feet, and communities like \nmine continue to pay the price. It is time for PHMSA to follow the law \nand the bipartisan will of Congress.\n  My amendment is simple. It would set aside $1 million of PHMSA's own \nbudget for the finalization and implementation of these overdue \npipeline safety and spill mitigation rules.\n  My amendment would simply help ensure that section 4 and section 8 of \nthe bipartisan 2011 pipeline safety law are finally implemented so that \nour Federal regulations are in line with today's reality.\n  My amendment does not cost a dime, and it does not authorize any new \nprograms. Section 4 requires new pipelines to install automatic shutoff \nvalves, and section 8 requires pipeline operators to use the latest \nleak detection technologies. Both of these provisions were enacted \nunanimously by this House in 2011.\n  The pipeline that burst in my district did not have an automatic \nshutoff valve despite the fact that other comparable pipelines in the \narea do use this technology. An automatic shutoff valve would not have \nprevented the spill necessarily, but it certainly would have minimized \nit. It took over 2 hours for the pipeline operator to even identify \nwhere the pipeline had ruptured, let alone to actually stop the flow of \ncrude oil.\n  That is unacceptable. If the standards required under section 4 and \nsection 8 had been required of the Plains pipeline in my district, the \nspill likely would have been much less severe. My amendment would take \na small, yet important step forward to address these troubling issues \nby pushing PHMSA to get its act together and finalize these rules.\n  Mr. Chairman, oil and gas development, by its nature, is a dangerous \nand dirty business. The mere fact that the Plains and other companies \nhave oil spill contingency funds shows that there is no such thing as a \nsafe pipeline. Spills do happen, and they will continue to happen as \nlong as we depend on fossil fuels for our energy needs. We have a \nresponsibility, therefore, to do all we can to make these pipelines as \nsafe as possible.\n  Congress has repeatedly directed PHMSA to strengthen its standards; \nyet this agency has done little. My amendment would help hold their \nfeet to the fire and get commonsense safety standards finalized and \nimplemented. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from California (Mrs. Capps).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mrs. Capps\n\n  Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 61, line 14, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $27,604,000)''.\n\n[[Page H3857]]\n\n       Page 61, line 17, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $27,604,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentlewoman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California.\n  Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Chairman, it is no secret that Federal pipeline \nsafety standards are in serious need of improvement. Despite repeated \nbipartisan efforts to strengthen these standards, the Pipeline and \nHazardous Materials Safety Administration, PHMSA, has dragged its feet \non implementing the new rules.\n  Not only has this agency failed to keep up with new statutory \nrequirements, they struggle to even enforce the rules they already have \non the books. There are several reasons for this, including rapid \ngrowth in the miles of new pipelines to inspect and the need to compete \nwith the private sector for the best talent while using limited \nresources.\n  PHMSA's preliminary estimate of serious incidents on pipelines showed \nan increase in 2014; and, with the miles of pipelines only multiplying, \nthese numbers will surely grow. That is why my amendment would increase \nfunding for PHMSA's pipeline safety program by $27 million, to simply \nmatch the President's own fiscal year 2016 budget request. While this \nwould not solve the multitude of problems facing the agency, it would \ncertainly make a big difference in two key areas.\n  First, it would help PHMSA retain and recruit the best inspectors and \nstaff. Last year, Congress provided funding for 100 additional full-\ntime employees to help PHMSA adjust to the increasing demand; and, as \npart of its fiscal year 2016 request, PHMSA requested $15 million to \nfully fund and annualize these employees. The current bill only \nprovides enough funding for 1 year of salaries for these new employees.\n  How is the agency supposed to attract the best talent when they can't \ncount on paying their new employees for more than a year at a time?\n  Second, my amendment would also provide requested funding for the \nnational pipeline information exchange. This information exchange would \nbe a comprehensive database of integrated pipeline safety information \nfrom PHMSA, from State regulators, industry, and other Federal \nresources.\n  Of the 2.6 million miles of pipeline in the United States, PHMSA \ninspects only 20 percent, while States monitor the remaining 80 \npercent. However, the information the States gather through inspections \nis neither shared among the States, nor with PHMSA. That is kind of \nunbelievable. It makes no sense. We should be doing everything we can \nto analyze and understand this data.\n  My amendment would fund this exchange to help regulators be more \neffective and to better protect communities like mine from future \nspills. There are currently pilot information exchange programs in 7 \nStates, and the funding provided by my amendment would allow PHMSA to \nexpand these information exchanges to 25 States.\n  Mr. Chairman, my amendment costs absolutely nothing from the American \ntaxpayers, not one dime. The increased funding would come from a modest \nincrease in user fees paid into the pipeline safety fund. These user \nfees are paid for by the oil companies that profit enormously from the \noil and gas flowing through the pipelines that PHMSA oversees.\n  Oil companies are seeing record profits from a booming oil and gas \ndevelopment industry. This is leading to more miles of pipeline and \nmore risks for local communities like mine. The least they can do is \nensure that the Federal oversight of the industry is keeping pace with \nthe growth because, when pipelines fail, it is our local communities \nand our constituents, not the oil companies, who suffer the most.\n  My amendment takes a small step forward to help strengthen the \npipeline safety and oversight, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Will the gentlewoman yield?\n  Mrs. CAPPS. I yield to the gentleman.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. I commend my colleague for offering this \namendment, and I want to offer my strong support.\n  Mr. Chairman, we are talking here about annualizing the funding--in \nother words, bringing these people on board permanently--for pipeline \nsafety inspectors who were hired in fiscal year 2015. We are also \ntalking about the better coordination of enforcement activities between \nFederal, State, and local officials.\n  I would like to remind my colleagues we have 2.6 million miles of \npipeline across this country. I think the number is maybe 548 personnel \nin the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.\n  This is an enormous task. The gentlewoman's amendment would greatly \nimprove our capacity to address this challenge, and I urge its \nadoption.\n  Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. The authorization for this program expires this \nyear, Mr. Chairman. Frankly, there are many questions, and it is not \nreally clear whether or not the next authorization would accommodate \nthis funding fee level. I understand the gentlewoman's passion, but I \nmust respectfully urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Chairman, again, I urge the adoption of this \namendment. I have a classic example of why it is needed, and I ask for \nyour consideration.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from California (Mrs. Capps).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mrs. CAPPS.

The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 74, line 23, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $75,000,000)''.\n       Page 75, line 6, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $75,000,000)''.\n       Page 77, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $75,000,000)''.\n       Page 78, line 9, before the semicolon insert the following: \n     ``, except that of the amount made available by this proviso, \n     $75,000,000 shall be used only for the purpose under this \n     clause''.\n\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas (during the reading). Mr. Chair, I ask that the \namendment be considered as read.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman from Texas and a \nMember opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise tonight in support of the \npeople who make it possible for us to be here. Of course, I speak of \nthose persons who go to distant places, those persons who serve us in \nour military who don't always return the same way they left.\n  I rise tonight because we have had a successful program. The HUD VASH \nprogram has been successful, and it has contributed to the decline in \nhomelessness among those persons who make it possible for us to be \nhere, who make real the great and noble American ideals: liberty and \njustice for all; government of the people, by the people, for the \npeople.\n  Mr. Chairman, homelessness has declined 33 percent among our veteran \npopulation since 2010, and this is because the President made it a \npriority. President Obama indicated that he would reduce homelessness \namong veterans, and he had 2015 as a targeted date.\n  I am proud to say that in my city of Houston, Texas, our mayor, \nAnnise Parker, had an event just recently with three HUD Secretaries, \nand it was announced at that event that in Houston, Texas, the \nresources were available to accommodate a veteran in need of a place to \ncall home.\n  Tonight, Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment that would accord $75 \nmillion to the HUD VASH program. This $75 million would be used to make \nsure that what we have done we will not only continue to do, but we can \ndo even better.\n  I believe that the people who have served us and who find themselves \nnow living on the streets of life should have a better quality of life. \nFor this reason, I will promote this amendment tonight, understanding \nthat a point of order has been made, but also understanding that it is \nnecessary for us to continue to remind ourselves that we have people \nwho are willing to make the sacrifice and that we should make \nsacrifices for them.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. I yield to the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. I want to thank the gentleman, again, for his \npassion for this issue and for talking to me about this issue, and I \nlook forward to continuing to work with the gentleman.\n  Obviously, all of us know that there is never anything, there is \nnever enough that we could ever do for our veterans. So again, I thank \nthe gentleman, and I look forward to continuing to work with the \ngentleman.\n  I thank you for yielding your time.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman and I thank \nthe Congress of the United States of America because Congress has \nappropriated money for these VASH vouchers, this program. I have always \ntried to get more because I think our veterans deserve as much as we \ncan give them, but I am appreciative for what Congress has done, and I \nam appreciative for what the chairman has done.\n  So tonight I will withdraw my amendment, Mr. Chairman, but I do so \nwith the understanding that as we move forward, knowing that we have \ndone a great job, the President has done well, that the cities and \nmunicipalities have worked well with the President, this has been an \nintegrated system, holistic approach to ending homelessness among our \nveterans, but I still believe that we cannot allow ourselves to relax. \nWe must never assume that we have done enough for those who are willing \nto do all for us.\n  With that, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  June 3, 2015, on page H3860, the following appeared: There was \nno objection.

Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 74, line 23, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $512,000,000)''.\n       Page 75, line 6, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $512,000,000)''.\n\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the \ngentlewoman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentlewoman from the District \nof Columbia and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n\n[[Page H3861]]\n\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment to H.R. 2577, \nthe Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies \nAppropriation Act, that would fully fund the existing Housing Choice \nVouchers and replenish the 67,000 vouchers lost to the fiscal year 2013 \nsequestration.\n  It is difficult, Mr. Chair, to think of a more urgent issue \nconfronting the American people. Affordable housing has reached zero in \nmany communities of our country. It is estimated that 2.1 million low-\nincome families utilize the Housing Choice Voucher program. These are \nthe most vulnerable among us, including children, senior citizens, \nveterans, and persons with disabilities who rely on this important \nprogram to keep their families from becoming homeless.\n  Most families must make roughly $18.92 per hour to afford a two-\nbedroom apartment, which is more than 2\\1/2\\ times the Federal minimum \nwage. In the District of Columbia, where affordable housing has \nvirtually disappeared, families must make $28.25 per hour to afford a \ntwo-bedroom apartment, making the Nation's Capital one of the most \nexpensive housing markets in the Nation.\n  The District mirrors cities and suburbs throughout the country, \nhowever. For over a decade, District residents have faced increasing \nrents, stagnant incomes, and the disappearance of affordable rental \nunits. As a result, the city has had to close--actually close \naltogether--its housing waiting list, which includes vouchers, leaving \nmore than 72,000 people waiting to be placed and thousands more waiting \nfor a chance even to get on the list.\n  My amendment would fund President Obama's budget request to restore \n67,000 vouchers lost during the fiscal year 2013 sequestration, \nbringing urgently needed relief to struggling families across the \ncountry. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. What is \nCongress here for if not to bring some relief to millions of families \nacross the country, those who are most in need?\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n\n                             point of order\n\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I insist on my point of order.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida may state his point of \norder.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is not in order under \nsection 3(d)(3) of House Resolution 5 of the 114th Congress which \nstates the following:\n  ``It shall not be in order to consider an amendment to a general \nappropriations bill proposing a net increase in budget authority in the \nbill unless considered en bloc with another amendment or amendments \nproposing an equal or greater decrease in such budget authority \npursuant to clause 2(f) of rule XXI.''\n  The amendment proposes a net increase in budget authority in the bill \nin violation of such section.\n  I ask for a ruling from the Chair.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point \nof order?\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, I would like to be heard.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from the District of Columbia is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, but for sequestration probably most of \nthese housing vouchers would have gone through. They are already cut. \nThese are cuts that were never anticipated. These were sequestration \ncuts. The Congress cannot ignore forever the neediest people for \nhousing as homelessness increases and as there is no relief whatsoever.\n  I understand the point of order. I can't agree with it. I think at \nsome point this Congress must face what it must do for people who but \nfor sequestration, something none of us wanted, none of us anticipated, \nwould at least among them have some who would have these housing \nvouchers.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair is prepared to rule.\n  The gentleman from Florida makes a point of order that the amendment \noffered by the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia violates \nsection 3(d)(3) of House Resolution 5.\n  Section 3(d)(3) establishes a point of order against an amendment \nproposing a net increase in budget authority in the pending bill.\n  As persuasively asserted by the gentleman from Florida, the amendment \nproposes a net increase in budget authority in the bill. Therefore, the \npoint of order is sustained. The amendment is not in order.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Nadler\n\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 74, line 23, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $1,204,853,210)''.\n       Page 75, line 6, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $182,816,000)''.\n       Page 79, line 1, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $20,000,000)''.\n       Page 81, line 13, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $490,037,000)''.\n       Page 83, after line 10, insert the following:\n       (5) $277,000,000 shall be for incremental rental voucher \n     assistance under section 8(o) of the Act to be distributed \n     based on relative need, as determined by the Secretary: \n     Provided, That the Secretary shall make such funding \n     available, notwithstanding section 204 (competition \n     provision) of this title;\n       (6) $177,500,000 shall be used for incremental rental \n     voucher assistance for use by families, veterans, and tribal \n     families who are experiencing homelessness, as well as \n     victims of domestic and dating violence: Provided, That \n     eligibility for veterans is made without regard to discharge \n     status: Provided further, That the Secretary shall make such \n     funding available through a competitive process to public \n     housing agencies that partner with eligible Continuums of \n     Care, as identified by the Secretary and to recipients \n     eligible to receive block grants under the Native American \n     Housing Assistance and Determination Act of 1996 (NAHASDA) \n     (25 U.S.C. 4101 et seq.): Provided further, That assistance \n     provided to recipients eligible under NAHASDA shall be \n     subject to requirements of NAHASDA: Provided further, That \n     the Secretary may waive, or specify alternative requirements \n     for any provision or statute or regulation that the Secretary \n     administers in connection with the use of funds made \n     available under this paragraph upon a finding by the \n     Secretary that any such waivers or alternative requirements \n     are necessary for the effective delivery and administration \n     of such voucher assistance: Provided further, That the \n     Secretary shall issue guidance to implement the previous \n     proviso;\n       (7) $37,500,000 shall be made available to provide \n     incremental rental voucher assistance for victims of domestic \n     violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, as \n     defined by the Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization Act \n     of 2013 (Public Law 113-4), who require an emergency \n     transfer: Provided, That the Secretary shall issue guidance \n     to implement this paragraph;\n       (8) $20,000,000 shall be made available for new incremental \n     voucher assistance through the Family Unification Program: \n     Provided, That the assistance made available under this \n     paragraph shall continue to remain available for family \n     unification upon turnover: Provided further, That the amounts \n     made available under this paragraph shall be used only in \n     connection with tenant-based assistance on behalf of--\n       (A) any family--\n       (i) who is otherwise eligible for such assistance; and\n       (ii) who the public child welfare agency for the \n     jurisdiction has certified is a family for whom the lack of \n     adequate housing is a primary factor in the imminent \n     placement of the family's child or children in out-of-home \n     care; and\n       (B) for a period not to exceed 60 months, otherwise \n     eligible youths who have attained at least 18 years of age \n     and not more than 21 years of age and who have left foster \n     care at age 16 or older.\n       Page 83, line 11, strike ``(5)'' and insert ``(9)''\n\n  Mr. NADLER (during the reading). Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent \nto waive the reading of the bill.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman from New York and a \nMember opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, the funding levels provided in this bill are \nunrealistic and unsustainable and clearly demonstrate that our current \nbudget process has failed. This bill reveals where the majority's \npriorities lie, and they clearly do not lie in serving the most basic \nfunction of government: to provide for the safety and well-being of its \ncitizens.\n  This bill makes major cuts to critical HUD programs. The public \nhousing\n\n[[Page H3862]]\n\ncapital fund is slashed by $200 million, barely reaching its 1989 \nlevel, almost 30 years ago. This will cover less than half of the basic \nmaintenance needs and does nothing to address the $25 billion in \ndeferred projects.\n  For the first time since 2007, this body will provide no new funding \nto provide housing and support to homeless veterans. The Healthy Homes \nand Lead Hazard Control program is cut by 32 percent, even as The \nWashington Post reported 2 months ago that in low-income West Baltimore \nneighborhoods, more than 3 percent of children under the age of 6 had \ndangerously high levels of lead in their blood, which we know leads to \nlearning disabilities and can lead to lifelong dependency, not to \nmention lifelong dependency on the taxpayers.\n  But perhaps most startling is the bill's failure to provide low-\nincome seniors and hard-working families adequate access to affordable \nhousing through HUD's Section 8 program. Rental assistance helps 2.1 \nmillion very-low-income households to rent modest homes in the private \nmarket at affordable costs. Households that use vouchers have an \naverage income of $13,000 per year, well below the Federal poverty \nline, and nearly all include children, seniors, or people with \ndisabilities. Only about one in four eligible low-income families \nreceives Federal rental assistance. Long waiting lists remain in nearly \nevery community, and these long waits are exacerbated by a lack of \nadministrative funding for public housing agencies.\n  Sequestration has only made this situation worse. As of June of last \nyear, an estimated 100,000 fewer families were receiving assistance \nfrom Section 8 due to the sequestration cuts; 100,000 families cut off. \nThese cuts have had a severe impact on communities at a time when the \nnumber of very-low-income renters with worst case housing needs remains \n30 percent higher than it was before the Great Recession.\n  Through the fiscal year 2014 and fiscal year 2015 appropriations \nbills, Congress began the work of reversing the deep cuts in assistance \ncaused by sequestration, but nearly 67,000 vouchers have yet to be \nrestored. My amendment would finally restore those lost vouchers by \nproviding an additional $512 million to the voucher renewal account. \nThis amendment mirrors the President's request and targets 30,000 \nvouchers to those families and individuals most in need of housing \nassistance: homeless families; veterans, including those not covered by \nthe VASH program; victims of domestic violence; and Native Americans.\n\n                              {time}  2330\n\n  The bill does include important and helpful language directing HUD to \ntarget vouchers to the vulnerable populations as they become available \nbut provides no funds for HUD to do so.\n  My amendment sets aside specific funding for these targeted vouchers \nto make sure the most vulnerable populations have access to safe, \naffordable housing.\n  This additional funding will go a long way toward ensuring that every \nfamily that qualifies for rental assistance finds a home. However, at \nthe funding levels for administrative fees in this legislation, it \nwould be impossible for public housing agencies to hire and maintain \nenough staff to process and renew vouchers.\n  We cannot continue to undermine our hard-working public housing \nagencies by failing to provide them enough money to function. My \namendment would finally address the undercutting of public housing \nagencies by providing an additional $490 million to match the \nPresident's request.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is the minimum we can do to meet the vital needs \nof our lowest-income citizens and of our veterans. I urge adoption of \nthis amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n\n                             POINT OF ORDER\n\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I insist on the point of order.\n  The amendment is not in order under section 3(d)(3) of House \nResolution 5, 114th Congress, which states:\n  ``It shall not be in order to consider an amendment to a general \nappropriations bill proposing a net increase in budget authority in the \nbill unless considered en bloc with another amendment or amendments \nproposing an equal or greater decrease in such budget authority \npursuant to clause 2(f) of rule XXI.''\n  The amendment proposes a net increase in budget authority in the bill \nin violation of such section.\n  I ask for a ruling from the Chair.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point \nof order?\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, we can all agree that this amendment is \nnecessary. We are talking about denying tens of thousands of families \nand seniors access to an efficient, cost-effective program that keeps \nfamilies together and lowers the government's costs over the long term. \nWithout this amendment, we will see a spike in homelessness, a spike in \nmedical costs, and a spike in hungry children.\n  I understand the point of order. I understand that the rules demand \nan offset for any funding increase in the bill. I also appreciate the \nchairman's efforts to support Section 8 and public housing. However, \nwhen funding levels are as restrictive as this bill provides across the \nboard, it is impossible to offset such drastic underfunding without \nhurting other people in need.\n  When faced with a funding bill----\n  The Acting CHAIR. Does the gentleman from New York wish to speak to \nthe point of order?\n  The gentleman will confine his remarks to the point of order.\n  Mr. NADLER. When faced with a funding bill that fails to provide any \nnew funding to support homeless veterans and is leaving victims of \ndomestic violence and homeless families with no access to secure \nhousing, we need to take action to support the most vulnerable among \nus.\n  I hope that as we go forward, we can find a way to provide these \nfunds so that kids, working families, and seniors are not out on the \nstreet.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair is prepared to rule.\n  The gentleman from Florida makes a point of order that the amendment \noffered by the gentleman from New York violates section 3(d)(3) of \nHouse Resolution 5.\n  Section 3(d)(3) establishes a point of order against an amendment \nproposing a net increase in budget authority in the pending bill.\n  As persuasively asserted by the gentleman from Florida, the amendment \nproposes a net increase in budget authority in the bill. Therefore, the \npoint of order is sustained. The amendment is not in order.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last \nword.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I think it is very \nimportant that this moment not pass without us expressing appreciation \nto Mr. Nadler and to Ms. Norton for these amendments they have offered, \nbecause they are addressing a critical issue, a critical deficiency in \nthis bill. And believe me, Mr. Chairman, this is just the tip of the \niceberg.\n  The President proposed in his budget to provide additional rental \nvouchers to compensate for those lost earlier to sequestration. He also \nproposed funding for 30,000 new targeted vouchers, as Mr. Nadler was \nindicating: homeless families, veterans, Native Americans, victims of \ndomestic violence and stalking, reuniting families.\n  Because of this budget policy that has us so hamstrung, we are simply \nnot addressing in this bill any of these desperate needs. I invite \ncolleagues to talk to their local housing authorities, if they haven't \nalready. Ask how many are on the waiting list. Ask how many people are \ndesperate for decent housing. There is nothing more basic to our \ncommunities' well-being than decent housing.\n  I don't know of a single housing program that isn't underresourced, \nand all this because of a budget policy that really isn't working as \nfiscal policy. That is what it is supposed to be doing, but it is \ndecimating these investments that our country needs to be making.\n  I said the tip of the iceberg. Here is what I mean. The Choice \nNeighborhoods initiative is the successor to HOPE VI. That has been an \nenormously successful program in my area of Raleigh-Durham in North \nCarolina. That is $20 million. That is a token amount. I hope we will \nrevisit that amount later.\n\n[[Page H3863]]\n\n  Public housing capital fund, $1.68 billion. That is $194 million cut \nfrom last year. That goes back to where we were 26 years ago. And then \nwe have a $25 billion backlog--not even beginning to address that.\n  Mr. Chairman, my district displays rental housing for the elderly, \nhousing for the disabled. Local congregations have taken on these \nprojects. We have group homes for the disabled that have done a \nwonderful job. This budget simply turns them into rental renewal \nprograms. No capital funding, no increase in the supply. And so it \ngoes.\n  So Mr. Nadler and Ms. Norton have done us a great service tonight in \npressing the case for tenant-based rental assistance--for these \nvouchers--and for addressing some of these very needy categories of our \nfellow citizens. But it is the tip of the iceberg. It is only one of an \narray of programs that we very much need to address.\n  I am hopeful that the inadequacy of this bill tonight, and the kind \nof debate we are having tonight, the kind of sharp relief that these \nneeds are being put into, will motivate us very strongly sooner rather \nthan later.\n  Let's not wait for a Presidential veto. Let's not wait for some kind \nof governmental shutdown. Let's show that we can govern. Let's show \nthat we can take hold of our situation, invest the way a great country \nshould invest, and do a budget agreement that secures our fiscal future \nbut also makes room for the kind of investments that we should make.\n  So I thank my colleagues for bringing up these critical housing \nneeds. We simply must address them in the weeks ahead.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n\n                   amendment offered by mr. grothman\n\n  Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 74, line 23, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $614,000,000)''.\n       Page 75, line 6, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced \n     by $434,000,000)''.\n       Page 81, line 13, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $180,000,000)''.\n       Page 81, line 23, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $180,000,000)''.\n       Page 156, line 15, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $614,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Wisconsin and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Chairman, I am glad to be here. It shows different \npeople look at this budget and see different things.\n  I look at this budget and see a $614 million increase in Section 8 \nhousing, and I look at the huge debt we have, and I say: Why are we \nspending more? Other people apparently look at the $614 million \nincrease and say: Why, that is just a pittance.\n  Obviously, a 3 percent increase in any program at a time we are in \nthe huge debt we are should be viewed skeptically. I have an amendment \nhere to get rid of the $614 million increase.\n  Now, as I understand, the reason there is an increase is because we \nare getting in less receipts on the Section 8 housing and, therefore, \nwe feel that the citizens of this country have to make up the \ndifference.\n  My opinion is they have done nothing that we have to take more out of \ntheir pocket, either in taxes or by way of inflation, and we should not \nbe increasing this funding by $614 million.\n  In the debate over the last amendment it was said that there is a \nwaiting list on a lot of these programs. That doesn't mean we have to \nspend more money on the programs. If we are giving away something for \nfree, there is always going to be a waiting list. If you go out in \nsociety, if a store says, we are going to give away something for free, \nyou have a waiting list, right?\n  This is a flawed program for a couple of reasons. I don't object to \nusing it for disabled people. I don't object to using it for elderly \npeople. But like many welfare-related programs, two things help you in \neligibility for this program.\n  First of all, you are required not to work very hard. And the \ngentleman made a point that the income level of a lot of these people \nin the projects isn't that high. That is because if they made more \nmoney, they wouldn't be eligible for the generous subsidies. So, of \ncourse they are not making a lot of money. It is wrong to set up a \nprogram that discourages industry.\n  The second thing wrong with this program is it discourages marriage. \nA lot of these housing things are set up such that if somebody marries \nthe mother or father of their children who is working harder, you lose \nthe subsidy. I can't imagine anything more foolish than setting up a \nprogram that says we will give you an apartment if you raise a child \nout of wedlock, but if you get married, we will take away your \napartment.\n  The last time we really looked at this program was 1994. It is time \nwe look at it again. And the idea of pouring another $614 million into \nthis program is out of line.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in \nopposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in \nopposition with considerable enthusiasm.\n  It is as though what I said 5 minutes ago about the deficiencies of \nthis bill--this whole budget strategy that has left us so unable to \naddress our needs--it is as though the gentleman took that and went in \nexactly the opposite direction.\n  His amendment reduced an allocation that is already far too low, and \nit takes these rental assistance programs and reduces them further. Not \nonly does it not meet the need that we are seeing but actually reduces \nwhat we are already doing. This means evictions. I promise you, it \nmeans large-scale evictions. It means a cutting back in communities \nacross this country of the housing alternatives that people have.\n  I have always thought, Mr. Chairman, that rental assistance--Section \n8--should be a housing program that conservatives should love because \nit is market-based. It is not, contrary to what the gentleman says, a \ntotal free ride. As a matter of fact, people pay a third of their \nincome in rent. What Section 8 provides is a modest boost so that these \nhousing developments and these apartment buildings can work. People can \nlive there. They put their own money in, and they get a boost. They are \nable to move toward self-sufficiency.\n  So it is not public housing. It is housing for people who are able to \ndo more for themselves and who are receiving support as they do that. \nThis would be unconscionable to cut this program further.\n  With great conviction I believe this would be a mistaken amendment, a \nhard-hearted amendment, and one that this body should reject.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 94, line 1, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $3,000,000)''.\n       Page 116, line 12, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $3,000,000)''.\n\n  Mr. NADLER (during the reading). Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent \nto waive the reading of the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman from New York and a \nMember opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, since 1992, the Housing Opportunities for Persons with \nAIDS has provided a vital safety net. In the United States, 50,000 \npeople become infected with HIV every year, and 1.2 million people are \nliving with HIV/AIDS. More than 500,000 of these individuals will need \nsome form of housing assistance during the course of their illness, but \n145,000 individuals have unmet housing needs.\n  HOPWA combines housing support with additional services to help \npeople living with HIV/AIDS and their families stay in stable, safe \nhousing; manage their illness; and remain active in their communities. \nHousing interventions are critical in our continued fight against HIV/\nAIDS, and research clearly shows that stable housing leads to better \nhealth outcomes.\n  Providing stable housing to people living with HIV/AIDS reduces the \nrisk of transmission to a partner by 96 percent; it reduces emergency \nroom visits and expense to the public by 36 percent and \nhospitalizations by 57 percent. In other words, investing a modest \namount in HOPWA today saves us millions, if not billions of Federal \ntaxpayer dollars in the future.\n  HOPWA is the only Federal housing program to provide cities and \nStates with dedicated resources to address the housing crisis facing \npeople living with HIV/AIDS, and the program traditionally enjoys \nstrong bipartisan support.\n  Congressional support for HOPWA is clear in this legislation. While \nnearly every other program in the bill has been slashed by millions of \ndollars and often funded at levels below the point of actually \nfunctioning, HOPWA saw a slight increase in funding during the \ncommittee's consideration of the bill.\n  Some hail the bill's slim $332 million for HOPWA as a victory. I also \napplaud any additional funding for HOPWA, but I cannot call it a \nvictory to fund this program below its 2010 funding level when wait \nlists for HOPWA services continue to grow and thousands of Americans \ndie on the streets and in shelters because we refuse to provide a few \nextra million dollars to provide them with the care they need.\n  I will not claim that my amendment completely solves that problem. \nThe National AIDS Housing Coalition estimates that, in FY16, they will \nneed $364 million to provide HOPWA services to those who need them and \nto fund vital administrative support to improve the program.\n  To reach that goal, we would need to find $32 million somewhere in \nthis bill to transfer to HOPWA, but the funding levels we are \nconsidering today are so abysmally low, it is nearly impossible to move \nthat much money without gutting other important programs.\n  What we do, at the very least, is pass my amendment to restore HOPWA \nto its FY10 funding level of $335 million, a scant $3 million increase. \nThat funding level makes only a small dent in HOPWA's real need, but it \nwill give hundreds more people and families access to lifesaving \nservices. It is a very small step, but it is in the right direction, \nand I believe if we have the chance to save even one life, let alone \nhundreds, we have a duty to act.\n  To protect those living with HIV/AIDS and to stay within the House \nrules, my amendment offsets this additional funding to cuts to HUD's \ninformation technology fund.\n  I recognize the importance of providing HUD with phones and computers \nand understand the chairman and ranking member's concerns about \nadditional cuts to this account, but nothing is more important than, \nquite simply, saving lives.\n  We must pass this amendment and give those families battling HIV/AIDS \na fighting chance. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and \nI reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I withdraw my reservation of a point \nof order.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The reservation of the point of order is withdrawn.\n  Does any Member seek time in opposition?\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, let me inquire of the \nchairman, does he plan to claim the time in opposition?\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I will not be claiming the time in \nopposition.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, although, as a formality, \nI will then claim that time, although I am not opposed; I am \nenthusiastically in support of Mr. Nadler's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I do want to take a little \nextra time to mention some things connected to this that I think need \nto come to our colleagues' attention.\n  First of all, this is not an ideal offset that Mr. Nadler has chosen. \nThis is simply an example of the problem we have had all evening. Any \nfunding amendment will fill only one hole by digging another, and so \nthat is just the reality we are dealing with.\n  I do support this amendment. It runs the risk of further delaying \nHUD's acquisition of improved IT systems. We are going to need to \nattend to that. In this bill, HUD's IT account is already $150 million \nbelow the fiscal year '15 level and $234 million below the President's \nrequest. This is not an account that has a lot to spare, so I hope we \ncan revisit that.\n  It may be relatively easy to target this funding line. We have got to \nprovide HUD with the tools it needs to properly administer HOPWA and \nother programs.\n  We need, of course, eventually, a bipartisan budget agreement that \nwill allow for a more credible bill that will adequately fund HOPWA and \nHUD's IT account both, both of those.\n  Let me say, Mr. Chairman, I, in addition, hope that the chairman and \nother longtime supporters of HOPWA are\n\n[[Page H3866]]\n\ngoing to be able to work--we are all going to be able to work together \nmoving forward to get this HOPWA formula updated once and for all.\n  The formula hasn't been updated for the distribution of funds, the \nallocation of funds, that formula hasn't been updated since the \ninception of program in the early nineties. Without an update, many \nAmericans who are living with HIV in areas of the country with the \nfastest growing infection rates--namely, the South and rural America--\nare not getting the housing support they desperately need.\n  As a Member from a State with an AIDS death rate higher than the \nnational average, this issue, getting this formula right, is a matter \nof life and death for many of my constituents.\n  As we work on this bill in the months to come, try to get the funding \nlevels where they need to be, we also very much need to address that \nformula issue, and I pledge my readiness to work with colleagues to \nhave an equitable funding formula.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New York has 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. I \nwon't use it.\n  I simply want to express my appreciation first to the ranking member \nfor supporting the amendment, despite the very painful offset which he \nwill have to deal with, which I won't have to deal with, except as a \nsingle Member of the House.\n  I want to thank the chairman for not opposing this amendment.

Mr. Chair, I ask \nunanimous consent that the amendment be considered as read.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman from Texas and a \nMember opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, let me please start by \nacknowledging the Honorable Maxine Waters. What I present tonight is an \namendment that she actually authored, and I would like to present it. \nIn so doing, I want to remind us that this amendment deals with two \nprograms that are near and dear to my heart, the affordable housing \ntrust fund and the HOME program.\n  These programs are near and dear to my heart because the greatness of \na nation will not be measured by how we treat people who live in the \nsuites of life, how we treat the well off, the well heeled, and the \nwell to do.\n  The greatness of a nation is often measured by how we treat people \nwho live in the streets of life, those who are too often among the \nleast, the last, and the lost.\n  This amendment seeks to provide aid and comfort for those who, but \nfor the grace of God, could be you or me, but those who find themselves \nliving in the streets of life. This amendment, in dealing with the \naffordable housing trust fund, will restore it.\n  The current bill would actually eliminate the affordable housing \ntrust fund. This amendment provides some degree of aid and comfort for \nthose who are living at 30 percent of the area median income, wherever \nthey happen to live.\n  In Ms. Maxine Waters' district, this would mean an annual income of \n$20,200 for a family of four. I would dare say that there are few among \nus who\n\n[[Page H3867]]\n\nwould dare attempt to live off of $20,200 as an individual. This helps \na family of four with $20,200. This is what the affordable housing \ntrust fund does. It helps people who are extremely low of income.\n  My hope is that we will be able to prevent this elimination of the \naffordable housing trust fund, and this amendment does it.\n  This amendment also will help those who can benefit from the HOME \nprogram. The HOME program can serve a family of four that earns up to \n$53,900 per year. This program is a partnership, if you will, between \nState, municipal, and Federal Government.\n  It has been a program that has been of great benefit across the \nlength and breadth of this country. There is not a State in the \ncountry, I would dare say, that has not benefited from the HOME \nprogram.\n  It is my hope that we can meet the President's request for the HOME \nprogram. Right now, it is about $293 million short of the President's \nrequest. This amendment would add that $293 million that the President \nhas requested.\n  I started by indicating that these are two programs that are near and \ndear to me. Mr. Chairman, I believe that Ruth Meltzer was right when \nshe indicated that some measure their lives by days and years, others \nby heartthrobs, passions, and tears; but the surest measure under God's \nsun is what for others in your lifetime have you done.\n  These programs afford us an opportunity to do for others, to be a \nblessing to those that have not been as blessed as we. My hope is that \nwe will find a way to salvage both of these programs, restore the HOME \nprogram to what the President has requested, and prevent the affordable \nhousing trust fund from finding its way to the ash heap of history.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I insist on my point of order.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, the amendment proposes a net increase \nin budget authority in the bill.\n  The amendment is not in order under section 3(d)3 of House Resolution \n5, 114th Congress, which states the following:\n  ``It shall not be in order to consider an amendment to a general \nappropriations bill proposing a net increase in budget authority in the \nbill unless considered en bloc with another amendment or amendments \nproposing an equal or greater decrease in such budget authority \npursuant to clause 2(f) of rule XXI.''\n  The amendment proposes a net increase in budget authority in the bill \nin violation of such section.\n  I ask for a ruling from the Chair.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point \nof order?\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. If I may, Mr. Chairman.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized on the point of order.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, on the point of order, \nunderstanding the rules, I still would beseech us, Mr. Chairman, to \ngive some consideration to the salvation of these programs.\n  Perhaps I will be able to work with the chairman and in some way help \nthose who are not in a position to help themselves.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair is prepared to rule.\n  The gentleman from Florida makes a point of order that the amendment \noffered by the gentleman from Texas violates section 3(d)(3) of House \nResolution 5.\n  Section 3(d)(3) establishes a point of order against an amendment \nproposing a net increase in budget authority in the pending bill.\n  As persuasively asserted by the gentleman from Florida, the amendment \nproposes a net increase in budget authority in the bill. Therefore, the \npoint of order is sustained. The amendment is not in order.\n\n                              {time}  0000\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n        self-help and assisted homeownership opportunity program\n\n       For the Self-Help and Assisted Homeownership Opportunity \n     Program, as authorized under section 11 of the Housing \n     Opportunity Program Extension Act of 1996, as amended, \n     $50,000,000, to remain available until September 30, 2018: \n     Provided, That of the total amount provided under this \n     heading, $10,000,000 shall be made available to the Self-Help \n     and Assisted Homeownership Opportunity Program as authorized \n     under section 11 of the Housing Opportunity Program Extension \n     Act of 1996, as amended: Provided further, That of the total \n     amount provided under this heading, $35,000,000 shall be made \n     available for the second, third, and fourth capacity building \n     activities authorized under section 4(a) of the HUD \n     Demonstration Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 9816 note), of which not \n     less than $5,000,000 shall be made available for rural \n     capacity building activities: Provided further, That of the \n     total amount provided under this heading, $5,000,000 shall be \n     made available for capacity building by national rural \n     housing organizations with experience assessing national \n     rural conditions and providing financing, training, technical \n     assistance, information, and research to local nonprofits, \n     local governments and Indian Tribes serving high need rural \n     communities.\n\n                       homeless assistance grants\n\n                     (including transfer of funds)\n\n       For the emergency solutions grants program as authorized \n     under subtitle B of title IV of the McKinney-Vento Homeless \n     Assistance Act, as amended;

Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 114, line 10, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $28,375,000) (increased by $28,375,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Ohio and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Diaz-Balart as \nwell as Ranking Member Price for their hard work on this bill and for \npreparing a bill that is the best we can do.\n  I do rise in support of an amendment that seeks to curb lawsuit abuse \nand help fund our local governments. This creates congressional intent \nto redirect funds away from the private enforcement account to the \nadministrative enforcement account.\n  My amendment would decrease by $28.375 million the Private \nEnforcement Initiative and redirect those resources to the \nAdministrative Enforcement Initiative in the Fair Housing Initiatives \nProgram.\n  I believe that the most efficient and effective way to protect Fair \nHousing is through the Administrative Enforcement Initiative of the \nFair Housing Initiatives Program, which helps State and local \ngovernments who administer laws that include rights and remedies every \nday. They act to help Fair Housing. They know their communities, and \nthey can enforce in their communities best.\n  My amendment would help protect more consumers. In fact, I believe \nadministrative enforcement is less expensive to taxpayers. It is more \ncertain. It has faster resolution. It has less conflicts of interest \nthan some of these nonprofit proxy agencies that use the Private \nEnforcement Initiative.\n  In fact, there is a 1997 GAO study, Mr. Chairman, that revealed that \nmore than half of the Private Enforcement Initiative dollars were \nconcentrated in just 6 of the 27 awardees. I have asked the GAO to \nupdate that study and to look at private enforcement as far as its \neffectiveness because, as I said, it is slower and more expensive than \nadministrative enforcement.\n  Therefore, I would ask my colleagues to support my congressional \nintent amendment to redirect these resources to our State and local \ngovernments who can more effectively administer justice. I ask my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in \nopposition to this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to \nthis amendment. We have only recently received it, and I haven't fully \nanalyzed\n\n[[Page H3870]]\n\nit; but, on the face of it, it does appear to be shifting the support \namong private enforcement and public enforcement, the kind of private \nenforcement that involves community-based groups, that involves often \nmore flexible ways of resolving conflicts and issues.\n  I simply think it is ill advised here tonight to undertake that kind \nof internal shifting of funds and would suggest that we reject this, \nunderstanding that we can return to it and examine this more fully to \nsee exactly what is implied by this kind of internal shifting of funds \nwithin Fair Housing accounts.\n  I suggest that we reject this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Chairman, I would simply say to my colleague from \nNorth Carolina that administrative enforcement is more effective, it is \nmore efficient. That is why we should redirect these resources \ninternally inside Fair Housing. It doesn't change Fair Housing dollars \none penny.\n  It redirects the resources to more efficient and effective means of \nenforcement, from folks who enforce these laws every day and can do it \nfaster and more effectively, to make sure the people that might be \ndiscriminated against get their redress sooner.\n  I am excited about this amendment. I think it will lead to much more \neffective enforcement. It does so without the conflict of interest of \nthese private organizations that can have conflicts of interest, and \nthat has been another issue that I have asked the GAO to look at in my \nletter to them today.\n  I apologize that the minority is just seeing this for the first time. \nI did talk about it at the Rules Committee the other day. It is \nsomething I have been working on just for a couple of days since that \nRules Committee meeting when it came up. I apologized for not giving \nthe gentleman from North Carolina more notice.\n  I would urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I yield back \nthe balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Stivers).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Grayson\n\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 114, line 19, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $150,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Florida and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Chair, this amendment seeks to raise the cap on \nfunding for the Limited English Proficiency Initiative under the Fair \nHousing and Equal Opportunity section of the bill by 50 percent.\n  I want to highlight that we are not taking away anything from other \nprograms. We are simply lifting the cap on this particular initiative. \nThis amendment has passed by voice vote for the last 2 years, and it is \nmy hope that it will do so again.\n  There are more than 40 million Americans who do not speak English as \ntheir first language. This tiny, but vital program demonstrates to the \nAmerican people that we have equal protection under the law, regardless \nof what language we speak.\n  I hope to once again have the support of my friend from Florida and \nfrom the House as a whole.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Grayson).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

conditions:\n       (1) Number and bedroom size of units.--\n       (A) For occupied units in the transferring project: the \n     number of low-income and very low-income units and the \n     configuration (i.e., bedroom size) provided by the \n     transferring project shall be no less than when transferred \n     to the receiving project or projects and the net dollar \n     amount of Federal assistance provided to the transferring \n     project shall remain the same in the receiving project or \n     projects.\n       (B) For unoccupied units in the transferring project: the \n

    subsection (d)(2), the owner or mortgagor of the receiving \n     project or projects shall execute and record either a \n     continuation of the existing use agreement or a new use \n     agreement for the project where, in either case, any use \n     restrictions in such agreement are of no lesser duration than \n     the existing use restrictions.\n       (9) The transfer does not increase the cost (as defined in \n     section 502 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as \n     amended) of any FHA-insured mortgage, except to the extent \n     that appropriations are provided in advance for the amount of \n     any such increased cost.\n       (d) For purposes of this section--\n       (1) the terms ``low-income'' and ``very low-income'' shall \n     have the

The funds made available for Native Alaskans \n     under the heading ``Native American Housing Block Grants'' in \n     title II of this Act shall be allocated to the same Native \n     Alaskan housing block grant recipients that received funds in \n     fiscal year 2005.\n       Sec. 215.  Notwithstanding the limitation in the first \n     sentence of section 255(g) of the National Housing Act (12 \n     U.S.C. 1715z-20(g)), the Secretary of Housing and Urban \n     Development may, until September 30, 2016, insure and enter \n     into commitments to insure mortgages under such section 255.\n       Sec. 216.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in \n     fiscal year 2016, in managing and disposing of any \n     multifamily property that is owned or has a mortgage held by \n     the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and during \n     the process of foreclosure on any property with a contract \n     for rental assistance payments under section 8 of the United \n     States Housing Act of 1937 or other Federal programs, the \n     Secretary shall maintain any rental assistance payments under \n     section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 and other \n     programs that are attached to any dwelling units in the \n     property. To the extent the Secretary determines, in \n     consultation with the tenants and the local government, that \n     such a multifamily property owned or held by the Secretary is \n     not feasible for continued rental assistance payments under \n     such section 8 or other programs, based on consideration of \n     (1) the costs of rehabilitating and operating the property \n     and all available Federal, State, and local resources, \n     including rent adjustments under section 524 of the \n     Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of \n     1997 (``MAHRAA'') and (2) environmental conditions that \n     cannot be remedied in a cost-effective fashion, the Secretary \n     may, in consultation with the tenants of that property, \n     contract for project-based rental assistance payments with an \n     owner or owners of other existing housing properties, or \n     provide other rental assistance. The Secretary shall also \n     take appropriate steps to ensure that project-based contracts \n     remain in effect prior to foreclosure, subject to the \n     exercise of contractual abatement remedies to assist \n     relocation of tenants for imminent major threats to health \n     and safety after written notice to and informed consent of \n     the affected tenants and use of other available remedies, \n     such as partial abatements or receivership. After disposition \n     of any multifamily property described under this section, the \n     contract and allowable rent levels on such properties shall \n     be subject to the requirements under section 524 of MAHRAA.\n       Sec. 217.

With respect to the use of amounts provided in \n     this Act and in future Acts for the operation, capital \n     improvement and management of public housing as authorized by \n     sections 9(d) and 9(e) of the United States Housing Act of \n     1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437g(d) and (e)), the Secretary shall not \n     impose any requirement or guideline relating to asset \n     management that restricts or limits in any way the use of \n     capital funds for central office costs pursuant to section \n     9(g)(1) or 9(g)(2) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 \n     (42 U.S.C. 1437g(g)(1), (2)): Provided, That a public housing \n     agency may not use capital funds authorized under section \n     9(d) for activities that are eligible under section 9(e) for \n     assistance with amounts from the operating fund in excess of \n     the amounts permitted under section 9(g)(1) or 9(g)(2).\n       Sec. 220.  No official or employee of the Department of \n     Housing and Urban Development shall be designated as an \n     allotment holder unless the Office of the Chief Financial \n     Officer has determined that such allotment holder has \n     implemented an adequate system of funds control and has \n     received training in funds control procedures and directives. \n     The Chief Financial Officer shall ensure that there is a \n     trained allotment holder for each HUD sub-office under the \n     accounts ``Executive Offices'' and ``Administrative Support \n     Offices'', as well as each account receiving appropriations \n     for ``Program Office Salaries and Expenses'', ``Government \n     National Mortgage Association--Guarantees of Mortgage-Backed \n     Securities Loan Guarantee Program Account'', and ``Office of \n     Inspector General'' within the Department of Housing and \n     Urban Development.\n       Sec. 221.

Other than areas with high rates of defaults and \n     foreclosures, grants may also be provided to approved \n     counseling intermediaries based on a geographic analysis of \n     the Nation by NRC which determines where there is a \n     prevalence of mortgages that are risky and likely to fail, \n     including any trends for mortgages that are likely to default \n     and face foreclosure.

No funds made available under this \n     paragraph may be provided directly to lenders or homeowners \n     to discharge outstanding mortgage balances or for any other \n     direct debt reduction payments.\n       (3) The use of mortgage foreclosure mitigation assistance \n     by approved counseling intermediaries and State Housing \n     Finance Agencies shall involve a reasonable analysis of the \n     borrower's financial situation, an evaluation of the current \n     value of the property that is subject to the mortgage, \n     counseling regarding the assumption of the mortgage by \n     another non-Federal party, counseling regarding the possible \n     purchase of the mortgage by a non-Federal third party, \n     counseling and advice of all likely restructuring and \n     refinancing strategies or the approval of a work-out strategy \n     by all interested parties.\n       (4) NRC may provide up to 15 percent of the total funds \n     under this paragraph to its own charter members with \n     expertise in foreclosure prevention counseling, subject to a \n     certification by NRC that the procedures for selection do not \n     consist of any procedures or activities that could be \n     construed as a conflict of interest or have the appearance of \n     impropriety.\n       (5) HUD-approved counseling entities and State Housing \n     Finance Agencies receiving funds under this paragraph shall \n     have demonstrated experience in successfully working with \n     financial institutions as well as borrowers facing default, \n     delinquency and foreclosure as well as documented counseling \n     capacity, outreach capacity, past successful performance and \n     positive outcomes with documented counseling plans (including \n     post mortgage foreclosure mitigation counseling), loan \n     workout agreements and loan modification agreements. NRC may \n     use other criteria to demonstrate capacity in underserved \n     areas.\n       (6) Of the total amount made available under this \n     paragraph, up to $2,000,000 may be made available to build \n     the mortgage foreclosure and default mitigation counseling \n     capacity of counseling intermediaries through NRC training \n     courses with HUD-approved counseling intermediaries and their \n     partners, except that private financial institutions that \n     participate in NRC training shall pay market rates for such \n     training.\n       (7) Of the total amount made available under this \n     paragraph, up to 5 percent may be used for associated \n     administrative expenses for NRC to carry out activities \n     provided under this section.\n       (8) Mortgage foreclosure mitigation assistance grants may \n     include a budget for outreach and advertising, and training, \n     as determined by NRC.\n       (9) NRC shall continue to report bi-annually to the House \n     and Senate Committees on Appropriations as well as the Senate \n     Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee on \n     its efforts to mitigate mortgage default.\n\n           United States Interagency Council on Homelessness\n\n                           operating expenses\n\n       For necessary expenses (including payment of salaries, \n     authorized travel, hire of passenger motor vehicles, the \n     rental of conference rooms, and the employment of experts and \n     consultants under section 3109 of title 5, United States \n     Code) of the United States Interagency Council on \n     Homelessness in carrying out the functions pursuant to title \n     II of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, as amended, \n     $3,530,000.\n\n                                TITLE IV\n\n                      GENERAL PROVISIONS--THIS ACT\n\n       Sec. 401.

Are there any amendments to that portion of the \nbill?\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                       spending reduction account\n\n       Sec. 415.  The amount by which the applicable allocation of \n     new budget authority made by the Committee on Appropriations \n     of the House of Representatives under Section 302(b) of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974 exceeds the amount of \n     proposed new budget authority is $0.\n\n\n                    amendment offered by mr. stivers\n\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used for the Private Enforcement Initiative of the Fair \n     Housing Initiatives Program under section 561(b) of the \n     Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 (42 U.S.C. \n     3616a(b)) and section 125.401 of the regulations of the \n     Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (24 C.F.R. \n     125.401).\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Ohio and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Chairman, I will be fairly brief.\n  This is a followup amendment. We have already accepted the \ncongressional intent that we will have a preference toward \nadministrative enforcement. This is a followup limitation amendment \nthat basically says we will not, for this calendar year, use the \nPrivate Enforcement Initiative.\n  As the gentleman from North Carolina said, we can always come back; \nbut I think we need to have time for this GAO study that I have \nrequested to come back because I would assert that administrative \nenforcement is less expensive to taxpayers than private enforcement.\n  It creates more certainty. It happens faster. It has less conflict of \ninterest than the Private Enforcement Initiative. I would ask that my \ncolleagues support this limitation amendment on the Private Enforcement \nInitiative for this year period.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  0015\n\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to \nthe amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Again, Mr. Chairman, let me say how \nunfortunate I believe it is that we are dealing with this kind of \namendment in this setting here tonight without really having much \nnotice, much ability to understand the full implications.\n  I do think that we need to appreciate the role of what the gentleman \ncalls private organizations. We are really talking here about \nnonprofits, about mediators, about the kind of working out of \ncomplaints, working out of problems, informal work with landlords, the \nkind of thing that actually helps avoid legal action and avoid \nlitigation. There is a lot that can be mediated, a lot of things can be \nworked out in the fair housing arena. There are many nonprofit groups \nthat do a good job of doing that.\n  Mr. Chairman, the gentleman apparently has lots of complaints about \nthis, and there have been a couple of prominent cases. I am aware of \nthat. But the notion that we would come in here tonight and make a \nchange of this magnitude, of this importance, I simply don't think is \nresponsible.\n  So I will speak for myself. I am perfectly willing to look at this \nmatter down the road. I understand there may be some issues here, but \nthis is a pretty drastic amendment, and you are taking a whole area \nhere of mediation and informal conciliation, things that actually keep \nthings out of the courts, keep things out of the legal system and out \nof litigation. I don't know why we would want to do that. It seems \nreckless to me.\n  I recommend that we reject this amendment and, at the same time, \npledge to look at this carefully and work on it later.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Chair, does \nrecognize that there are problems in the private enforcement \ninitiative. He just admitted that. There is a lot of lawsuit abuse. In \nfact, many of these organizations sue first and ask questions later. \nThey don't do their due diligence. They send interns in to actually \nlook at these places and file lawsuits before they get the facts.\n  The gentleman asserted that we shouldn't make these kind of changes. \nThat is why the people sent us here, to make things better. We are \nsupposed to do it every day, and when we see problems, we need to fix \nthem. This is a temporary, 1-year halt of the private enforcement \ninitiative with the GAO study that is not directed in this bill, but I \nasked for by letter through the GAO, and they are always good about \ndoing those when you ask them to. They haven't looked at this program \nsince 1997.\n  Mr. Chairman, it is time to look at this program in detail. I would \nassert that our local and State governments can also do the mediation \nthat the gentleman from North Carolina talked about, Mr. Chairman, and \nthey can do it better, more efficiently, and without the conflicts of \ninterest that some of these private organizations have done.\n  So I think we ought to give it a try. That is the great thing about \nan annual appropriations bill. Guess what; we get to do it again next \nyear. I am certainly willing to admit if I am wrong and we find out \nthrough a GAO study that the private enforcement has worked well. But \nthere have been articles in the paper about some of the lawsuit abuse \nthat we have seen all across the country, and I think we should just \ntake a strategic pause here and give the money to our State and local \ngovernments who can better enforce our laws. They do it every day, and \nthey can do it through the mediation and things that the gentleman \nasserts that these private enforcement initiatives can do so well.\n  Mr. Chairman, I would urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I \nthink it will help make our fair housing laws better, and it will \nprotect more consumers.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Stivers).\n\n[[Page H3876]]\n\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Ohio will be \npostponed.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Grayson\n\n  Mr. GRAYSON. I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

None of the funds made available in this Act may \n     be used to enter into a contract with any offeror or any of \n     its principals if the offeror certifies, as required by the \n     Federal Acquisition Regulation, that the offeror or any of \n     its principals--\n       (1) within a three-year period preceding this offer has \n     been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against it \n     for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection \n     with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public \n     (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation \n     of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the \n     submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, \n     forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, \n     making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal \n     criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; or\n       (2) are presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or \n     civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of \n     any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (1); or\n       (3) within a three-year period preceding this offer, has \n     been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount \n     that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains \n     unsatisfied.\n\n  Mr. GRAYSON (during the reading). Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the reading be waived.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Florida and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Chair, this amendment is identical to other \namendments that have been inserted by voice vote into every \nappropriations bill considered under an open rule during the 113th and \n114th Congresses.\n  My amendment would expand the list of parties with whom the Federal \nGovernment is prohibited from contracting due to serious misconduct on \nthe part of that contractor. It is my hope that this amendment will be \nnoncontroversial, as it always has been, and again passed unanimously \nby the House.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Grayson).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                  Amendment Offered by Mr. Fitzpatrick\n\n  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used in contravention of section 121.584 of title 14, Code \n     of Federal Regulations.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Chairman, my amendment will ensure that the FAA \nis doing everything that it can to certify that our aircraft are \nprotected during a moment that pilots, flight attendants, and Federal \nlaw enforcement officers have all said that the aircraft is vulnerable \nto terror hijackings. Despite the effort to safeguard the cockpit after \nthe 9/11 terror attacks, today, operational experience has highlighted \nthat a critical vulnerability remains when a pilot must open the \nhardened, reinforced cockpit doors to eat, rest, or use the bathroom \nduring long flights. Even the FAA recognizes that, ``During this door \ntransition, the flight deck is vulnerable.''\n  Current FAA regulations require that the area outside the flight deck \nbe secure before the reinforced cockpit door is opened. Currently, some \nairlines are using human shields or, in some cases, drink carts to try \nto block entry to the cockpit and claim it ``secure.'' But only one \nmethod has been thoroughly studied and proven to beat the threat of a \ntrained hijacker exploiting this particular vulnerability, and that is \nan installed physical secondary barrier door. These barriers are light, \ninexpensive wire gates that are able to protect the flight deck long \nenough for the pilot to shut the reinforced door.\n  This double door security procedure is something that Israeli \nairlines have been using for over a decade. They understand the risk \nand how to mitigate it. A Cato study has shown these secondary barrier \ndoors to be the most cost-effective way to protect the cockpit door \nwhen the reinforced door is opened.\n  This is not some hypothetical threat. We know for a fact that \nterrorists maintain their desire to exploit vulnerabilities in our \naircraft safety protocols to bring down an airliner just like they did \non September 11, 2001. A recent USA Today headline read, ``ISIS' Next \nTest Could Be a 9/11-Style Attack.'' In 2013, outgoing FBI Director \nRobert Mueller said that the terror scenario he fears most remains an \nattack with the use of an aircraft.\n  Perhaps no one knows the consequences of terrorists hijacking our \naircraft more so than my constituent, Ellen Saracini. The terror \nhijackings of September 11 took the life of her husband, Victor \nSaracini, Captain of United Flight 175, which was hijacked and flown \ninto the South Tower of the World Trade Center by al Qaeda terrorists.\n  Inspired by Ellen and the pilots and flight attendants that stand \nwith her, I have been working with a bipartisan, bicameral group of \nlawmakers to have these commonsense, cost-effective security features \ninstalled on every single large passenger aircraft in the United States \nthrough my bill, H.R. 911, the Saracini Aviation Safety Act.\n  Some have pointed to the ``layered security'' approach to aircraft \nsecurity as proof that we don't need secondary barriers, but one only \nneed to read current headlines to see the huge gaps in our layered \nsecurity. As we recently learned, undercover agents, we saw, this week, \nwere able to get weapons past the TSA 95 percent of the time.\n  Mr. Chairman, a recent Advisory Circular issued by the FAA highlights \nthe risk to the cockpit during door transition and calls for the use of \neffective protection measures. Support for this amendment today would \nbuild on this positive step used by the FAA by showing that Congress is \nserious about this issue and that installed physical secondary barriers \nare the only way that we can guarantee, as FAA regulations do require, \nthat the flight deck be secure prior to that reinforced door being \nopened.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Grayson\n\n  Mr. GRAYSON.

None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to make incentive payments pursuant to 48 CFR 16.4 to \n     contractors for contracts that are behind schedule under the \n     terms of the contract as prescribed by 48 CFR 52.211 or over \n     the contract amount indicated in Standard Form 33, box 20.\n\n  Mr. GRAYSON (during the reading). Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the reading be waived.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Mr. Chairman, this is a good government amendment the \nHouse passed by voice vote last year. It simply states that bonus \npayments should not be paid to contractors whose projects are behind \nschedule or over budget.\n\n[[Page H3877]]\n\n  I urge support for this amendment that combats waste, fraud, and \nabuse of taxpayer dollars, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back the balance \nof my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR.
